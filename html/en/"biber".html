NAME
       &quot;biber&quot; - A bibtex replacement for users of biblatex

SYNOPSIS
       biber [options] file[.bcf]

         Creates &quot;file.bbl&quot; using control file &quot;file.bcf&quot; (&quot;.bcf&quot; extension is
         optional). Normaly use with biblatex requires no options as they are
         all set in biblatex and passed via the &quot;.bcf&quot; file

         Please run &quot;biber --help&quot; for option details

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;biber&quot; provides a replacement of the bibtex processor for users of
       biblatex.

OPTIONS
       --bblencoding|-E [encoding]
           Specify the encoding of the output &quot;.bbl&quot; file. Default is &quot;UTF-8&quot;.
           Normally it&apos;s not necessary to set this as it&apos;s passed via biblatex
           from the inputenc package setting.  See &quot;perldoc Encode::Supported&quot;
           for a list of supported encodings.

       --bblsafechars
           Try to convert UTF-8 chars into LaTeX macros when writing the .bbl
           This can prevent unknown char errors when using PDFLaTeX and inputenc
           as this doesn&apos;t understand all of UTF-8. Note, it is better to switch
           to XeTeX or LuaTeX to avoid this situation. By default uses the
           --bblsafecharsset &quot;base&quot; set of characters.

       --bblsafecharsset=base|full
           The set of characters included in the conversion routine for
           --bblsafechars. Set to &quot;full&quot; to try harder with a much larger set or
           &quot;base&quot; to use a basic set. Default is &quot;base&quot; which is fine for most
           use cases. You may need to load more macro packages to deal with the
           results of &quot;full&quot; (Dings, Greek characters, special symbols etc.).

       --bibencoding|-e [encoding]
           Specify the encoding of the data source file(s). Default is &quot;UTF-8&quot;
           Normally it&apos;s not necessary to set this as it&apos;s passed via the .bcf
           file from biblatex&apos;s setting of the same name.  See &quot;perldoc
           Encode::Supported&quot; for a list of supported encodings.

       --collate|-C
           Sort with &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; instead of the built-in sort function.
           This is the default.

       --collate_options|-c [options]
           Options to pass to the &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; object used for sorting
           (default is &apos;level =&gt; &quot;2&quot;, table =&gt; &quot;latinkeys.txt&quot;&apos;).  See &quot;perldoc
           Unicode::Collate&quot; for details.

       --configfile|-g [file]
           Use file as configuration file for &quot;biber&quot;.  The default is the first
           file found among biber.conf in the current directory,
           &quot;$HOME/.biber.conf&quot;, or else the output of &quot;kpsewhich biber.conf&quot;.

       --convert_control
           Converts the .bcf control file into html using an XSLT transform. Can
           be useful for debugging. File is named by appending &quot;.html&quot; to .bcf
           file.
&#12;       --decodecharsset=base|full
           The set of characters included in the conversion routine when
           decoding LaTeX macros into UTF-8 (which happens when --bblencoding|-E
           is set to UTF-8). Set to &quot;full&quot; to try harder with a much larger set
           or &quot;base&quot; to use a smaller basic set. Default is &quot;base&quot;. You may want
           to try &quot;full&quot; if you have less common UTF-8 characters in your data
           source.

       --debug|-D
           Turn on debugging for &quot;biber&quot;.

       --dot_include=section,field,xdata,crossref,xref,related
           Specifies the element to include in GraphViz DOT output format if the
           output format is &apos;dot&apos;.  You can also choose to display crossref,
           xref, xdata and/or related entry connections.  The default if not
           specified is &quot;--dot_include=section,xdata,crossref,xref&quot;.

       --fastsort|-f
           Use Perl&apos;s sort instead of &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; for sorting. Also uses
           OS locale definitions (which may be broken for some languages ...).

       --help|-h
           Show this help message.

       --logfile [file]
           Use file.blg as the name of the logfile.

       --mincrossrefs|-m [number]
           Set threshold for crossrefs.

       --noconf
           Don&apos;t look for a configfile.

       --nodieonerror
           Don&apos;t exit on errors, just log and continue as far as possible.  This
           can be useful if the error is something from, for example, the
           underlying BibTeX parsing C library which can complain about parsing
           errors which can be ignored.

       --nolog
           Do not write any logfile.

       --nostdmacros
           Don&apos;t automatically define any standard macros like month
           abbreviations.  If you also define these yourself, this option can be
           used to suppress macro redefinition warnings.

       --onlylog
           Do not write any message to screen.

       --outfile|-O [file]
           Output to file instead of basename.bbl file is relative to
           --output_directory, if set (absolute paths in this case are stripped
           to filename only). file can be absolute if --output_directory is not
           set.

       --outformat=bbl|dot|bltxml
           Biber output format. Default if not specified is of course, bbl. Use
           dot to output a GraphViz DOT file instead of .bbl. This is a directed
           graph of the bibliography data showing entries and, as requested,
           sections and fields.  You must process this file with &quot;dot&quot;, e.g.
           &quot;dot -Tsvg test.dot -o test.svg&quot; to render the graph. See the
           --dot_include option to select what is included in the DOT output.
           Use bltxml to output a BibLaTeXML file of the internal data model
           instead of a .bbl. This helps in moving to BibLaTeXML by translating
           other datasource formats.

       --output_directory [directory]
           Files (.bbl and .log) are output to directory directory instead of
           the current directory. Input files are also looked for in directory
           before current directory.

       --quiet|-q
           Log only errors. If this option is used more than once, don&apos;t even
           log errors.

       --sortcase=true|false
           Case-sensitive sorting (default is true).

       --sortfirstinits=true|false
           When sorting names, use only the first name initials, not full first
           name. Some people expect the biblatex firstinits option to do this
           but it needs to be a separate option in case users, for example, need
           to show only initials but sort with full first names (default is
           false).

       --sortlocale|-l [locale]
           Set the locale to be used for sorting.  With default sorting
           (--collate|-C), the locale is used to add CLDR tailoring to the sort
           (if available for the locale). With --fastsort|-f this sets the OS
           locale for sorting.

       --sortupper=true|false
           Whether to sort uppercase before lowercase when using default sorting
           (--collate|-C). When using --fastsort|-f, your OS collation locale
           determines this and this option is ignored (default is true).

       --ssl-noverify-host
           Turn off host verification when using HTTPS to fetch remote data
           sources.  You may need this if the SSL certificate is self-signed for
           example.

       -u  Alias for --bibencoding=UTF-8

       -U  Alias for --bblencoding=UTF-8

       --validate_config
           Schema validate the biber config file.

       --validate_control
           Schema validate the .bcf biblatex control file.

       --validate_structure|-V
           Validate the data against a data model.

       --version|-v
           Display version number.

       --wraplines|-w
           Wrap lines in the .bbl file.
