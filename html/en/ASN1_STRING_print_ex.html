ASN1_STRING_print_ex(3SSL)           OpenSSL          ASN1_STRING_print_ex(3SSL)



NAME
       ASN1_STRING_print_ex, ASN1_STRING_print_ex_fp - ASN1_STRING output
       routines.

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/asn1.h&gt;

        int ASN1_STRING_print_ex(BIO *out, ASN1_STRING *str, unsigned long flags);
        int ASN1_STRING_print_ex_fp(FILE *fp, ASN1_STRING *str, unsigned long flags);
        int ASN1_STRING_print(BIO *out, ASN1_STRING *str);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions output an ASN1_STRING structure. ASN1_STRING is used to
       represent all the ASN1 string types.

       ASN1_STRING_print_ex() outputs str to out, the format is determined by
       the options flags. ASN1_STRING_print_ex_fp() is identical except it
       outputs to fp instead.

       ASN1_STRING_print() prints str to out but using a different format to
       ASN1_STRING_print_ex(). It replaces unprintable characters (other than
       CR, LF) with &apos;.&apos;.

NOTES
       ASN1_STRING_print() is a legacy function which should be avoided in new
       applications.

       Although there are a large number of options frequently
       ASN1_STRFLGS_RFC2253 is suitable, or on UTF8 terminals
       ASN1_STRFLGS_RFC2253 &amp; ~ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_MSB.

       The complete set of supported options for flags is listed below.

       Various characters can be escaped. If ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_2253 is set the
       characters determined by RFC2253 are escaped. If ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_CTRL is
       set control characters are escaped. If ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_MSB is set
       characters with the MSB set are escaped: this option should not be used
       if the terminal correctly interprets UTF8 sequences.

       Escaping takes several forms.

       If the character being escaped is a 16 bit character then the form
       &quot;\UXXXX&quot; is used using exactly four characters for the hex
       representation. If it is 32 bits then &quot;\WXXXXXXXX&quot; is used using eight
       characters of its hex representation. These forms will only be used if
       UTF8 conversion is not set (see below).

       Printable characters are normally escaped using the backslash &apos;\&apos;
       character. If ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_QUOTE is set then the whole string is
       instead surrounded by double quote characters: this is arguably more
       readable than the backslash notation. Other characters use the &quot;\XX&quot;
       using exactly two characters of the hex representation.

       If ASN1_STRFLGS_UTF8_CONVERT is set then characters are converted to UTF8
       format first. If the terminal supports the display of UTF8 sequences then
       this option will correctly display multi byte characters.

       If ASN1_STRFLGS_IGNORE_TYPE is set then the string type is not
       interpreted at all: everything is assumed to be one byte per character.
       This is primarily for debugging purposes and can result in confusing
       output in multi character strings.
&#12;       If ASN1_STRFLGS_SHOW_TYPE is set then the string type itself is printed
       out before its value (for example &quot;BMPSTRING&quot;), this actually uses
       ASN1_tag2str().

       The content of a string instead of being interpreted can be &quot;dumped&quot;:
       this just outputs the value of the string using the form #XXXX using hex
       format for each octet.

       If ASN1_STRFLGS_DUMP_ALL is set then any type is dumped.

       Normally non character string types (such as OCTET STRING) are assumed to
       be one byte per character, if ASN1_STRFLGS_DUMP_UNKNOWN is set then they
       will be dumped instead.

       When a type is dumped normally just the content octets are printed, if
       ASN1_STRFLGS_DUMP_DER is set then the complete encoding is dumped instead
       (including tag and length octets).

       ASN1_STRFLGS_RFC2253 includes all the flags required by RFC2253. It is
       equivalent to:
        ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_2253 | ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_CTRL | ASN1_STRFLGS_ESC_MSB |
        ASN1_STRFLGS_UTF8_CONVERT | ASN1_STRFLGS_DUMP_UNKNOWN
       ASN1_STRFLGS_DUMP_DER
