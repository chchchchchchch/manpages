NAME
       Algorithm::Diff::XS - Algorithm::Diff with XS core loop

SYNOPSIS
           # Drop-in replacement to Algorithm::Diff, but &quot;compact_diff&quot;
           # and C&lt;LCSidx&gt; will run much faster for large data sets.
           use Algorithm::Diff::XS qw( compact_diff LCSidx );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a simple re-packaging of Joe Schaefer&apos;s excellent but not
       very well-known Algorithm::LCS with a drop-in interface that simply re-
       uses the installed version of the Algorithm::Diff module.

       Note that only the &quot;LCSidx&quot; function is optimized in XS at the moment,
       which means only &quot;compact_diff&quot; will get significantly faster for large
       data sets, while &quot;diff&quot; and &quot;sdiff&quot; will run in identical speed as
       &quot;Algorithm::Diff&quot;.

BENCHMARK
                             Rate     Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Diff::XS
       Algorithm::Diff     14.7/s                  --                -98%
       Algorithm::Diff::XS  806/s               5402%                  --

       The benchmarking script is as below:

           my @data = ([qw/a b d/ x 50], [qw/b a d c/ x 50]);
           cmpthese( 500, {
               &apos;Algorithm::Diff&apos; =&gt; sub {
                   Algorithm::Diff::compact_diff(@data)
               },
               &apos;Algorithm::Diff::XS&apos; =&gt; sub {
                   Algorithm::Diff::XS::compact_diff(@data)
               },
           });
