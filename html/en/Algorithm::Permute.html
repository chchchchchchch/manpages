NAME
       Algorithm::Permute - Handy and fast permutation with object oriented
       interface

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::Permute;

         # default is to create n of n objects permutation generator
         my $p = new Algorithm::Permute([&apos;a&apos;..&apos;d&apos;]);

         # but also you can create r of n objects permutation generator, where r &lt;= n
         my $p = new Algorithm::Permute([1..4], 3);

         while (@res = $p-&gt;next) {
           print join(&quot;, &quot;, @res), &quot;\n&quot;;
         }

         # and this one is the speed demon:
         my @array = (1..9);
         Algorithm::Permute::permute { print &quot;@array\n&quot; } @array;

DESCRIPTION
       This handy module makes performing permutation in Perl easy and fast,
       although perhaps its algorithm is not the fastest on the earth.  It
       supports permutation r of n objects where 0 &lt; r &lt;= n.

METHODS
       new [@list]
           Returns a permutor object for the given items.

       next
           Returns a list of the items in the next permutation.  The order of
           the resulting permutation is the same as of the previous version of
           &quot;Algorithm::Permute&quot;.

       peek
           Returns the list of items which will be returned by next(), but
           doesn&apos;t advance the sequence. Could be useful if you wished to skip
           over just a few unwanted permutations.

       reset
           Resets the iterator to the start. May be used at any time, whether
           the entire set has been produced or not. Has no useful return value.

CALLBACK STYLE INTERFACE
       Starting with version 0.03, there is a function - not exported by default
       - which supports a callback style interface:

       permute BLOCK ARRAY
           A block of code is passed, which will be executed for each
           permutation. The array will be changed in place, and then changed
           back again before &quot;permute&quot; returns. During the execution of the
           callback, the array is read-only and you&apos;ll get an error if you try
           to change its length. (You can change its elements, but the
           consequences are liable to confuse you and may change in future
           versions.)

           You have to pass an array, it can&apos;t just be a list. It does work with
           special arrays and tied arrays, though unless you&apos;re doing something
           particularly abstruse you&apos;d be better off copying the elements into a
           normal array first. Example:
&#12;            my @array = (1..9);
            permute { print &quot;@array\n&quot; } @array;

           The code is run inside a pseudo block, rather than as a normal
           subroutine. That means you can&apos;t use &quot;return&quot;, and you can&apos;t jump out
           of it using &quot;goto&quot; and so on. Also, &quot;caller&quot; won&apos;t tell you anything
           helpful from inside the callback. Such is the price of speed.

           The order in which the permutations are generated is not guaranteed,
           so don&apos;t rely on it.

           The low-level hack behind this function makes it currently the
           fastest way of doing permutation among others.

COMPARISON
       I&apos;ve collected some Perl routines and modules which implement
       permutation, and do some simple benchmark. The whole result is the
       following.

       Permutation of eight scalars:

         Abigail&apos;s                     :  9 wallclock secs ( 8.07 usr +  0.30 sys =  8.37 CPU)
         Algorithm::Permute            :  5 wallclock secs ( 5.72 usr +  0.00 sys =  5.72 CPU)
         Algorithm::Permute qw(permute):  2 wallclock secs ( 1.65 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.65 CPU)
         List::Permutor                : 27 wallclock secs (26.73 usr +  0.01 sys = 26.74 CPU)
         Memoization                   : 32 wallclock secs (32.55 usr +  0.02 sys = 32.57 CPU)
         perlfaq4                      : 36 wallclock secs (35.27 usr +  0.02 sys = 35.29 CPU)

       Permutation of nine scalars (the Abigail&apos;s routine is commented out,
       because it stores all of the result in memory, swallows all of my
       machine&apos;s memory):

         Algorithm::Permute            :  43 wallclock secs ( 42.93 usr +  0.04 sys = 42.97 CPU)
         Algorithm::Permute qw(permute):  15 wallclock secs ( 14.82 usr +  0.00 sys = 14.82 CPU)
         List::Permutor                : 227 wallclock secs (226.46 usr +  0.22 sys = 226.68 CPU)
         Memoization                   : 307 wallclock secs (306.69 usr +  0.43 sys = 307.12 CPU)
         perlfaq4                      : 272 wallclock secs (271.93 usr +  0.33 sys = 272.26 CPU)

       The benchmark script is included in the bench directory. I understand
       that speed is not everything. So here is the list of URLs of the
       alternatives, in case you hate this module.

       &#183;   Memoization is discussed in chapter 4 Perl Cookbook, so you can get
           it from O&apos;Reilly:

       &#183;   Abigail&apos;s: http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl

       &#183;   List::Permutor: http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/List

       &#183;   The classic way, usually used by Lisp hackers: perldoc perlfaq4

       The object oriented interface is taken from Tom Phoenix&apos;s
       &quot;List::Permutor&quot;.  Robin Houston &lt;robin@kitsite.com&gt; invented and
       contributed the callback style interface.
