NAME
       Alien::Package::Deb - an object that represents a deb package

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object class that represents a deb package. It is derived from
       Alien::Package.

FIELDS
       have_dpkg_deb
           Set to a true value if dpkg-deb is available.

       dirtrans
           After the build stage, set to a hash reference of the directories we
           moved files from and to, so these moves can be reverted in the
           cleantree stage.

       fixperms
           If this is set to true, the generated debian/rules will run
           dh_fixperms.

METHODS
       init
           Sets have_dpkg_deb if dpkg-deb is in the path. I prefer to use dpkg-
           deb, if it is available since it is a lot more future-proof.

       checkfile
           Detect deb files by their extention.

       install
           Install a deb with dpkg. Pass in the filename of the deb to install.

       test
           Test a deb with lintian. Pass in the filename of the deb to test.

       getcontrolfile
           Helper method. Pass it the name of a control file, and it will pull
           it out of the deb and return it.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a deb file.

       unpack
           Implement the unpack method to unpack a deb file.

       getpatch
           This method tries to find a patch file to use in the prep stage. If
           it finds one, it returns it. Pass in a list of directories to search
           for patches in.

       prep
           Adds a populated debian directory the unpacked package tree, making
           it ready for building. This can either be done automatically, or via
           a patch file.

       build
           Build a deb.

       cleantree
           Delete the entire debian/ directory.

       package
           Set/get package name.
&#12;           Always returns the packge name in lowercase with all invalid
           characters rmoved. The name is however, stored unchanged.

       version
           Set/get package version.

           When the version is set, it will be stripped of any epoch. If there
           is a release, the release will be stripped away and used to set the
           release field as a side effect. Otherwise, the release will be set to
           1.

           More sanitization of the version is done when the field is retrieved,
           to make sure it is a valid debian version field.

       release
           Set/get package release.

           Always returns a sanitized release version. The release is however,
           stored unchanged.

       description
           Set/get description

           Although the description is stored internally unchanged, this will
           always return a sanitized form of it that is compliant with Debian
           standards.

       date
           Returns the date, in rfc822 format.

       email
           Returns an email address for the current user.

       username
           Returns the user name of the real uid.

       savescript
           Saves script to debian directory.

       gen_postinst
           Modifies or creates a postinst. This may include generated shell code
           to set owners and groups from the owninfo field, and update modes
           from the modeinfo field.
