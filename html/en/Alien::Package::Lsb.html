NAME
       Alien::Package::Lsb - an object that represents a lsb package

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object class that represents a lsb package. It is derived from
       Alien::Package::Rpm.

METHODS
       checkfile
           Lsb files are rpm&apos;s with a lsb- prefix, that depend on a package
           called &apos;lsb&apos; and nothing else.

       scan
           Uses the parent scan method to read the file. lsb is added to the
           depends.

       prep
           The parent&apos;s prep method is used to generate the spec file. First
           though, the package&apos;s name is munged to make it lsb compliant (sorta)
           and lsb is added to its dependencies.

       revert
           Undo the changes made by prep.

       build
           Uses the parent&apos;s build method. If a lsb-rpmbuild is available, uses
           it to build the package.

       incrementrelease
           LSB package versions are not changed.
