NAME
       Alien::Package::Rpm - an object that represents a rpm package

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object class that represents a rpm package. It is derived from
       Alien::Package.

FIELDS
       prefixes
           Relocatable rpm packages have a prefixes field.

METHODS
       checkfile
           Detect rpm files by their extention.

       install
           Install a rpm. If RPMINSTALLOPT is set in the environement, the
           options in it are passed to rpm on its command line.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a rpm file.

       unpack
           Implement the unpack method to unpack a rpm file. This is a little
           nasty because it has to handle relocatable rpms and has to do a bit
           of permissions fixing as well.

       prep
           Prepare for package building by generating the spec file.

       cleantree
           Delete the spec file.

       build
           Build a rpm. If RPMBUILDOPT is set in the environement, the options
           in it are passed to rpm on its command line.

           An optional parameter, if passed, can be used to specify the program
           to use to build the rpm. It defaults to rpmbuild.

       version
           Set/get version.

           When retreiving the version, remove any dashes in it.

       postinst
       postrm
       preinst
       prerm
           Set/get script fields.

           When retrieving a value, we have to do some truely sick mangling.
           Since debian/slackware scripts can be anything -- perl programs or
           binary files -- and rpm is limited to only shell scripts, we need to
           encode the files and add a scrap of shell script to make it unextract
           and run on the fly.

           When setting a value, we do some mangling too. Rpm maintainer scripts
           are typically shell scripts, but often lack the leading shebang line.
           This can confuse dpkg, so add the shebang if it looks like there is
           no shebang magic already in place.
&#12;           Additionally, it&apos;s not uncommon for rpm maintainer scripts to contain
           bashisms, which can be triggered when they are ran on systems where
           /bin/sh is not bash. To work around this, the shebang line of the
           scripts is changed to use bash.

           Also, if the rpm is relocatable, the script could refer to
           RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX, which is set by rpm at run time. Deal with this
           by adding code to the script to set RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX.

       arch
           Set/get arch field. When the arch field is set, some sanitizing is
           done first to convert it to the debian format used internally. When
           it&apos;s retreived it&apos;s converted back to rpm form from the internal
           form.
