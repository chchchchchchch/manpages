NAME
       Alien::Package::Slp - an object that represents a slp package

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object class that represents a slp package. It is derived from
       Alien::Package.

CLASS DATA
       The following data is global to the class, and is used to describe the
       slp package format, which this class processes directly.

       footer_size
           Complete sizeof(slpformat) from slp.h in the stampede package manager
           source.

       footer_packstring
           This is the pack format string for the footer. (A=space terminated
           character, I=unsigned integer.)

       footer_version
           What package format are we up to now? (Lowest one this is still
           compatable with.)

       archtrans
           This is a translation table between architectures and the number that
           represents them in a slp package.

       fieldlist
           This is a list of all the fields in the order they appear in the
           footer.

FIELDS
       compresstype
           Holds the compression type used in the slp file.

       slpkgversion
           Holds the slp package format version of the slp file.

METHODS
       checkfile
           Detect slp files by their extention.

       install
           Install a slp. Pass in the filename of the slp to install.

       getfooter
           Pulls the footer out of the slp file and returns it.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a slp file.

       unpack
           Unpack a slp file. They can be compressed in various ways, depending
           on what is in the compresstype field.

       build
           Build a slp.

       conffiles
           Set/get conffiles.

           When the conffiles are set, the format used by slp (a colon-delimited
           list) is turned into the real list that is used internally. The list
           is changed back into slp&apos;s internal format when it is retreived.

       copyright
           Set/get copyright.

           When the copyright is set, the number used by slp is changed into a
           textual description. This is changed back into a number when the
           value is retreived.

       arch
           Set/get arch.

           When the arch is set, the number used by slp is changed into a
           textual description. This is changed back into a number when the
           value is retreived.

       release
           Set/get release version.

           When the release version is retreived, it is converted to an unsigned
           integer, as is required by the slp package format.
