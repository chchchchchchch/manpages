NAME
       Alien::Package::Tgz - an object that represents a tgz package

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object class that represents a tgz package, as used in
       Slackware.  It also allows conversion of raw tar files.  It is derived
       from Alien::Package.

CLASS DATA
       scripttrans
           Translation table between canoical script names and the names used in
           tgz&apos;s.

METHODS
       checkfile
           Detect tgz files by their extention.

       install
           Install a tgz with installpkg. Pass in the filename of the tgz to
           install.

           installpkg (a slackware program) is used because I&apos;m not sanguine
           about just untarring a tgz file. It might trash a system.

       scan
           Scan a tgz file for fields. Has to scan the filename for most of the
           information, since there is little useful metadata in the file
           itself.

       unpack
           Unpack tgz.

       prep
           Adds a populated install directory to the build tree.

       build
           Build a tgz.
