NAME
       Apache::RPC::Status - A status monitor similar to Apache::Status for RPC

SYNOPSIS
           # In httpd.conf:
           &lt;/Location /rpc-status&gt;
               SetHandler perl-script
               PerlHandler Apache::RPC::Status
           &lt;/Location&gt;

           # In the start-up Perl file:
           use Apache::RPC::Status;

DESCRIPTION
       The Apache::RPC::Status package is provided as a simple status monitor
       for XML-RPC servers running in a mod_perl environment, using the
       Apache::RPC::Server class (or derivative of). Patterned after the status
       system provided with mod_perl itself, information is broken down into a
       series of screens providing information ranging from the RPC servers
       currently configured down to the individual methods provided by the
       servers.

   Information Screens
       There are three basic screens provided by the stock Apache::RPC::Status
       package:

       Main: Listing of Servers
           This screen is the first screen that comes up when the location for
           which this class was assigned as a handler is invoked. It lists the
           server objects that this running Apache process knows of. Note that
           if the servers are defined in such a way as to mean on-demand
           creation, then a given child process may not have all the configured
           servers in memory. This is by design, it is not a bug. See &quot;Usage
           Within &lt;Perl&gt; Sections&quot; in Apache::RPC::Server for details on
           configuring the RPC servers such that they are pre-loaded into all
           child processes.

       Server: Details of a Server
           Each of the known servers in the main screen links to this screen,
           which provides details on the specific server. Information such as
           when the server was started (which usually matches the time that
           Apache was started), when the specific child was started (which may
           not be the same), number of requests servered, and so forth is
           provided. Additionally, each of the methods that the server provides
           is listed in alphanumeric order, with a link to the next screen.

       Method: Details of a Specific Method
           For each of the known methods published by a server, this screen
           summarizes all that is known about the method itself. The signatures,
           help text and hidden status (whether the method is visible to the
           introspection API that is shipped with RPC::XML::Server) are all
           shown. Some optional information is shown if available: if the method
           has a version number associated with it, that is displayed. If the
           method was loaded from an external XPL file, the file path and
           modification-time are also displayed.

       The primary purpose of this status system is to allow for checking the
       availability and sanity of the RPC servers themselves. For example, if a
       server is configured to auto-load methods, and automatically check for
       updates, the status system could confirm that a method is available or is
       at the correct version.
&#12;       (Note that auto-loading and auto-updating are done on demand, when a call
       is made to the method in question. Thus, the status might not reflect
       changes until at least one call has been made. Further, if there are very
       many child processes handling the RPC servers, several calls may be
       necessary to ensure that the child process answering the status request
       also has the most up-to-date impression of the server.)

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
       This package is implemented as a method handler for Apache/mod_perl. This
       means that is should be relatively easy to subclass this package to
       implement an extended version of status reporting, or to provide handlers
       for phases of the request lifecycle not otherwise addressed.

   Class Methods
       There are three class methods defined in this package. One is the
       constructor, the other two are handlers for specific phases in the Apache
       request lifecycle.

       new(CLASS, ARGS)
           This creates a new object of this class and returns a reference to
           it. The first argument is the class being created into, the remaining
           arguments are treated as key/value pairs (note: not a hash
           reference). At present, the only additional argument recognized is:

           serverclass
                   This is used when the status monitor is being used with a
                   server class other than Apache::RPC::Server directly. Because
                   several methods from that class are invoked, it is presumed
                   that the class named here is a subclass of
                   Apache::RPC::Server. If not, the status monitor may not work
                   correctly, or at all. In the absence of this value,
                   &quot;Apache::RPC::Server&quot; is assumed. This value may also be set
                   with the mod_perl PerlSetVar directive. See the documentation
                   for &quot;init_handler&quot;, below.

       handler(CLASS, REQUEST)
           This is the primary entry-point for the package. This is the handler
           defined for assignment to &quot;PerlHandler&quot; in a location configuration
           block. It is invoked by mod_perl as a method handler, thus the first
           argument is either the name of the class (in the case of class-
           method, or static, invocation) or the object configured as the
           handler. The second argument is the Apache request object itself.

           This method derives the query parameters for the request from the
           Apache object, and treats them according to the type of information
           screen requested:

           screen  This specifies which screen of the status monitor is to be
                   displayed. In absence, the value defaults to &quot;main&quot;, which is
                   the internal identifier for the primary screen of the status
                   monitor system. If the value of this parameter does not match
                   a known interface hook, then the handler will signify to
                   mod_perl that it cannot handler the request, by replying with
                   the &quot;DECLINED&quot; response code.

           server  When the screen parameter is set to &quot;server&quot;, the monitor
                   displays the server detail screen. In that case, this
                   parameter specifies which server should be displayed. Servers
                   are given unique identifiers when they are created, usually
                   derived from the URL path that they are attached to. If the
                   value here does not match any known servers, a warning is
                   sent to the browser.

           method  When the screen parameter is set to &quot;method&quot;, this calls for
                   the method detail screen. The provided interface hook to deal
                   with these requests looks for both the server parameter above
                   and this one, which specifies by name the method to be laid
                   out in detail. As with the server parameter, if the value in
                   this parameter does not match any known data, an error is
                   reported to the browser.

           Any additional parameters will be preserved by make_url call detailed
           below. These are merely the specific ones recognized by the status
           monitor as written.

       init_handler(CLASS, REQUEST)
           This is a very simple handler designed for the PerlChildInitHandler
           phase. At present, it only does one simple task (and thus makes no
           direct use of either parameter passed to it by mod_perl). However, it
           is included mainly as a placeholder for possible future expansion.
           The current behavior is to check for the existence of directory-
           configuration item called &quot;ServerClass&quot;, and record the value if it
           is set. This is used to specifiy the class from which the RPC server
           objects are created, if something other than Apache::RPC::Server. If
           this information is passed via the &quot;serverclass&quot; parameter to the new
           method above, that value overrides any value here. However, that
           requires actually creating an object to use as the handler, whereas
           this handler may be used directly, as a static handler. It would be
           configured outside of any &lt;Location&gt; blocks, a requirement for the
           PerlChildInitHandler phase. It is designed to stack cleanly with any
           other handlers for that phase, provided your mod_perl installation
           supports stacked handlers.

   Additional Methods
       In addition to the class methods above, the following are provided. In
       most cases, these do not rely on any data contained within the actual
       object itself. Many may also be called as static methods (these are so
       noted). They are provided as a utility, implemented as methods so as to
       avoid namespace issues:

       version
           (May be called as a static method.) Returns the current version of
           this module.

       apache_status_attach
           Attach the Apache::RPC::Status module to the main screen of the
           Apache::Status display.

       default_object
           (May be called as a static method.) Returns a default
           Apache::RPC::Status instance when called as a static method. Returns
           the calling reference itself, otherwise.

       header(REQUEST, TITLE)
           Produces the HTML header for a page. Uses the passed-in title
           parameter to give the page a title, and extracts any request-specific
           information from the Apache request object passed as the first
           parameter.

       footer(REQUEST)
           Produces the HTML footer.

       make_url(QUERY|REQUEST, FLAG)
           (May be called as a static method.) This creates a URL string for use
           as a hyperlink. It makes certain to preserve all parameters in a CGI-
           like fashion. Additionally, it can make the URL in such a fashion as
           to allow better integration with the Apache::Status package. If the
           &quot;FLAG&quot; parameter is passed and is any true value, then the resulting
           URL will be tailored for use with Apache::Status. The first argument
           must be either the original request object as passed by mod_perl, or
           a reference to a CGI object created from the request (see CGI for
           more on the CGI class).

       main_screen(REQUEST, QUERY, INTERNAL)
           Renders the HTML (minus the header and footer) for the main screen.
           The arguments are the Apache request object, a CGI query object
           created from the request, and a boolean flag indicating whether the
           call into this method was made from within this module or made from
           the Apache::Status page.

       server_summary(SERVER)
           Creates an HTML snippet to provide a summary for the server passed in
           as an argument. The passed-in value should be the server object, not
           the name.

       server_detail(REQUEST, QUERY, INTERNAL)
           Renders the HTML (minus header and footer) for a screen describing a
           server instance in detail. The server is specified by name in the
           query parameters.  The arguments are the same as for &quot;main_screen&quot;.

       method_summary(SERVER, METHOD, BASEURL)
           Creates and HTML snippet to provide a summary for the specified
           method of the specified server. The third argument is a base-URL to
           use for making links to the detailed method page.

       method_detail(REQUEST, QUERY, INTERNAL)
           Renders the HTML (minus header and footer) for a screen describing a
           method on a specific server instance, in detail. The method and
           server are specified by name in the query parameters. The arguments
           are the same as for &quot;main_screen&quot;.

   Use and Extension Within Perl Sections
       Some extension may be done without necessarily subclassing this package.
       The class object are implemented simply as hash references. When a
       request is received, the screen parameter (see above) is extracted, and
       used to look up in the hash table. If there is a value for that key, the
       value is assumed to be a hash reference with at least two keys (described
       below). If it does not exist, the handler routine declines to handle the
       request. Thus, some degree of extension may be done without the need for
       developing a new class, if the configuration and manipulation are done
       within &lt;Perl&gt; configuration blocks.

       Adding a new screen means writing a routine to handle the requests, and
       then adding a hook into that routine to the object that is the handler
       for the Apache location that serves RPC status requests. The routines
       that are written to handle a request should expect four arguments (in
       order):

       The object reference for the location handler
       The Apache request object reference
       A query object reference (see below)
       A flag that is only passed when called from Apache::Status

       The routines are given both the original request object and a query
       object reference for sake of ease. The query object is already available
       prior to the dispatch, so there is no reason to have each hook routine
       write the same few lines to derive a query object from an Apache request.
       At the same time, the hooks themselves may need the Apache object to call
       methods on. The query object is an instance of CGI. The flag parameter is
       passed by the linkage from this status package to Apache::Status. The
       primary use for it is to pass to routines such as make_url that are
       sensitive to the Apache::Status context.

       The return value from these routines must be a reference to a list of
       lines of text. It is passed to the print method of the Apache class. This
       is necessary for compatibility with the Apache::Status environment.

       To add a new hook, merely assign it to the object directly. The key is
       the value of the &quot;screen&quot; parameter defined above, and the value is a
       hash reference with two keys:

       title
           A string that is incorporated into the HTML title for the page.

       call
           A reference to a subroutine or closure that implements the hook, and
           conforms to the conventions described above.

       A sample addition:

           $stat_obj-&gt;{dbi} = {
                                  title =&gt; &apos;RPC-side DBI Pool&apos;,
                                  call  =&gt; \&amp;show_dbi_pool
                              };

INTEGRATION WITH Apache::Status
       This package is designed to integrate with the Apache::Status package
       that is a part of mod_perl. However, this is not currently functional.
       When this has been debugged, the details will be presented here.

CAVEATS
       This is the newest part of the RPC-XML package. While the package as a
       whole is now considered beta, this piece may yet undergo some alpha-like
       enhancements to the interface and such. However, the design and planning
       of this were carefully considered, so any such changes should be minimal.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Diagnostics are not handled well in this module.
