NAME
       AptPkg::Source - APT source package interface

SYNOPSIS
       use AptPkg::Source;

DESCRIPTION
       The AptPkg::Source module provides an interface to APT&apos;s source package
       lists.

   AptPkg::Source
       The AptPkg::Source package implements the APT pkgSrcRecords class as a
       hash reference (inherits from AptPkg::hash).  The hash is keyed on source
       or binary package name and the value is an array reference of the details
       of matching source packages.

       Note that there is no iterator class, so it is not possible to get a list
       of all keys (with keys or each).

       Constructor

       new([SOURCELIST])
           Instantiation of the object uses configuration from the
           $AptPkg::Config::_config object (automatically initialised if not
           done explicitly).

           If no SOURCELIST is specified, then the value of Dir::Etc::sourcelist
           from the configuration object is used (generally
           /etc/apt/sources.list).

       Methods

       find(PACK, [SRCONLY])
           In a list context, return a list of source package details for the
           given PACK, which may either be a source package name, or the name of
           one of the binaries provided (unless SRCONLY is provided and true).

           In a scalar context, the source package name of the first entry is
           returned.

       get, exists
           These methods are used to implement the hashref abstraction:
           $obj-&gt;get($pack) and $obj-&gt;{$pack} are equivalent.

           The get method has the same semantics as find, but returns an array
           reference in a scalar context.

       The list returned by the find (and get) methods consists of hashes which
       describe each available source package (in order of discovery from the
       deb-src files described in sources.list).

       Each hash contains the following entries:

       Package
       Version
       Maintainer
       Section
           Strings giving the source package name, version, maintainer and
           section.

       Binaries
           A list of binary package names from the package.
&#12;       BuildDepends
           A hash describing the build dependencies of the package.  Possible
           keys are:

               &quot;Build-Depends&quot;, &quot;Build-Depends-Indep&quot;, &quot;Build-Conflicts&quot;,
               &quot;Build-Conflicts-Indep&quot;.

           The values are a list of dependencies/conflicts with each item being
           a list containing the package name followed optionally by an operator
           and version number.

           Operator values evaluate to a comparison string* (&gt;, &gt;=, etc) or one
           of the AptPkg::Dep:: constants in a numeric context (see
           &quot;pkgCache::Dep::DepCompareOp&quot; in AptPkg(3pm)).

           *Note that this is a normalised, rather than Debian-style (&gt;&gt; vs &gt;)
           string.

       Files
           A list of files making up the source package, each described by a
           hash containing the keys:

               &quot;MD5Hash&quot;, &quot;Size&quot;, &quot;ArchiveURI&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;.
