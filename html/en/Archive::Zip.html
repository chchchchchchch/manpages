NAME
       Archive::Zip - Provide an interface to ZIP archive files.

SYNOPSIS
          # Create a Zip file
          use Archive::Zip qw( :ERROR_CODES :CONSTANTS );
          my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();

          # Add a directory
          my $dir_member = $zip-&gt;addDirectory( &apos;dirname/&apos; );

          # Add a file from a string with compression
          my $string_member = $zip-&gt;addString( &apos;This is a test&apos;, &apos;stringMember.txt&apos; );
          $string_member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );

          # Add a file from disk
          my $file_member = $zip-&gt;addFile( &apos;xyz.pl&apos;, &apos;AnotherName.pl&apos; );

          # Save the Zip file
          unless ( $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed(&apos;someZip.zip&apos;) == AZ_OK ) {
              die &apos;write error&apos;;
          }

          # Read a Zip file
          my $somezip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
          unless ( $somezip-&gt;read( &apos;someZip.zip&apos; ) == AZ_OK ) {
              die &apos;read error&apos;;
          }

          # Change the compression type for a file in the Zip
          my $member = $somezip-&gt;memberNamed( &apos;stringMember.txt&apos; );
          $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
          unless ( $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed( &apos;someOtherZip.zip&apos; ) == AZ_OK ) {
              die &apos;write error&apos;;
          }

DESCRIPTION
       The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
       read, and write Zip archive files.

       Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.

       Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members
       can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated.
       They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other
       attributes queried or modified. Their data can be compressed or
       uncompressed as needed.

       Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from
       existing directories, files, or strings.

       This module uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib library to read and write the
       compressed streams inside the files.

       One can use Archive::Zip::MemberRead to read the zip file archive members
       as if they were files.

   File Naming
       Regardless of what your local file system uses for file naming, names in
       a Zip file are in Unix format (forward slashes (/) separating directory
       names, etc.).
&#12;       &quot;Archive::Zip&quot; tries to be consistent with file naming conventions, and
       will translate back and forth between native and Zip file names.

       However, it can&apos;t guess which format names are in. So two rules control
       what kind of file name you must pass various routines:

       Names of files are in local format.
           &quot;File::Spec&quot; and &quot;File::Basename&quot; are used for various file
           operations. When you&apos;re referring to a file on your system, use its
           file naming conventions.

       Names of archive members are in Unix format.
           This applies to every method that refers to an archive member, or
           provides a name for new archive members. The &quot;extract()&quot; methods that
           can take one or two names will convert from local to zip names if you
           call them with a single name.

   Archive::Zip Object Model
   Overview
       Archive::Zip::Archive objects are what you ordinarily deal with.  These
       maintain the structure of a zip file, without necessarily holding data.
       When a zip is read from a disk file, the (possibly compressed) data still
       lives in the file, not in memory. Archive members hold information about
       the individual members, but not (usually) the actual member data. When
       the zip is written to a (different) file, the member data is compressed
       or copied as needed.  It is possible to make archive members whose data
       is held in a string in memory, but this is not done when a zip file is
       read. Directory members don&apos;t have any data.

           COMPRESSION_PKWARE_DATA_COMPRESSION_LIBRARY_IMPLODED
&#12;       :ERROR_CODES
           Explained below. Returned from most methods.

           AZ_OK AZ_STREAM_END AZ_ERROR AZ_FORMAT_ERROR AZ_IO_ERROR

ERROR CODES
       Many of the methods in Archive::Zip return error codes. These are
       implemented as inline subroutines, using the &quot;use constant&quot; pragma. They
       can be imported into your namespace using the &quot;:ERROR_CODES&quot; tag:

         use Archive::Zip qw( :ERROR_CODES );

         ...

         unless ( $zip-&gt;read( &apos;myfile.zip&apos; ) == AZ_OK ) {
             die &quot;whoops!&quot;;
         }

       AZ_OK (0)
           Everything is fine.

       AZ_STREAM_END (1)
           The read stream (or central directory) ended normally.

       AZ_ERROR (2)
           There was some generic kind of error.

       AZ_FORMAT_ERROR (3)
           There is a format error in a ZIP file being read.

       AZ_IO_ERROR (4)
           There was an IO error.

   Compression
       Archive::Zip allows each member of a ZIP file to be compressed (using the
       Deflate algorithm) or uncompressed.

       Other compression algorithms that some versions of ZIP have been able to
       produce are not supported. Each member has two compression methods: the
       one it&apos;s stored as (this is always COMPRESSION_STORED for string and
       external file members), and the one you desire for the member in the zip
       file.

       These can be different, of course, so you can make a zip member that is
       not compressed out of one that is, and vice versa.

       You can inquire about the current compression and set the desired
       compression method:

         my $member = $zip-&gt;memberNamed( &apos;xyz.txt&apos; );
         $member-&gt;compressionMethod();    # return current compression

         # set to read uncompressed
         $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );

         # set to read compressed
         $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );

       There are two different compression methods:

       COMPRESSION_STORED
           File is stored (no compression)

       COMPRESSION_DEFLATED
           File is Deflated
&#12;   Compression Levels
       If a member&apos;s desiredCompressionMethod is COMPRESSION_DEFLATED, you can
       choose different compression levels. This choice may affect the speed of
       compression and decompression, as well as the size of the compressed
       member data.

         $member-&gt;desiredCompressionLevel( 9 );

       The levels given can be:

       0 or COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE
           This is the same as saying

             $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );

       1 .. 9
           1 gives the best speed and worst compression, and 9 gives the best
           compression and worst speed.

       COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST
           This is a synonym for level 1.

       COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION
           This is a synonym for level 9.

       COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT
           This gives a good compromise between speed and compression, and is
           currently equivalent to 6 (this is in the zlib code).  This is the
           level that will be used if not specified.

Archive::Zip Methods
       The Archive::Zip class (and its invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive)
       implement generic zip file functionality. Creating a new Archive::Zip
       object actually makes an Archive::Zip::Archive object, but you don&apos;t have
       to worry about this unless you&apos;re subclassing.

   Constructor
       new( [$fileName] )
           Make a new, empty zip archive.

               my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();

           If an additional argument is passed, new() will call read() to read
           the contents of an archive:

               my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new( &apos;xyz.zip&apos; );

           If a filename argument is passed and the read fails for any reason,
           new will return undef. For this reason, it may be better to call read
           separately.

   Zip Archive Utility Methods
       These Archive::Zip methods may be called as functions or as object
       methods. Do not call them as class methods:

           $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
           $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( &apos;ghijkl&apos; );    # OK
           $crc = $zip-&gt;computeCRC32( &apos;ghijkl&apos; );            # also OK
           $crc = Archive::Zip-&gt;computeCRC32( &apos;ghijkl&apos; );    # NOT OK

       Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string [, $crc] )
           This is a utility function that uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib CRC
           routine to compute a CRC-32. You can get the CRC of a string:

               $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string );
&#12;           Or you can compute the running CRC:

               $crc = 0;
               $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( &apos;abcdef&apos;, $crc );
               $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( &apos;ghijkl&apos;, $crc );

       Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( $number )
           Report or change chunk size used for reading and writing.  This can
           make big differences in dealing with large files.  Currently, this
           defaults to 32K. This also changes the chunk size used for
           Compress::Raw::Zlib. You must call setChunkSize() before reading or
           writing. This is not exportable, so you must call it like:

               Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( 4096 );

           or as a method on a zip (though this is a global setting).  Returns
           old chunk size.

       Archive::Zip::chunkSize()
           Returns the current chunk size:

               my $chunkSize = Archive::Zip::chunkSize();

       Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \&amp;subroutine )
           Change the subroutine called with error strings. This defaults to
           \&amp;Carp::carp, but you may want to change it to get the error strings.
           This is not exportable, so you must call it like:

               Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \&amp;myErrorHandler );

           If myErrorHandler is undef, resets handler to default.  Returns old
           error handler. Note that if you call Carp::carp or a similar routine
           or if you&apos;re chaining to the default error handler from your error
           handler, you may want to increment the number of caller levels that
           are skipped (do not just set it to a number):

               $Carp::CarpLevel++;

       Archive::Zip::tempFile( [$tmpdir] )
           Create a uniquely named temp file. It will be returned open for
           read/write. If $tmpdir is given, it is used as the name of a
           directory to create the file in. If not given, creates the file using
           &quot;File::Spec::tmpdir()&quot;. Generally, you can override this choice using
           the

               $ENV{TMPDIR}

           environment variable. But see the File::Spec documentation for your
           system. Note that on many systems, if you&apos;re running in taint mode,
           then you must make sure that $ENV{TMPDIR} is untainted for it to be
           used.  Will NOT create $tmpdir if it doesn&apos;t exist (this is a change
           from prior versions!). Returns file handle and name:

               my ($fh, $name) = Archive::Zip::tempFile();
               my ($fh, $name) = Archive::Zip::tempFile(&apos;myTempDir&apos;);
               my $fh = Archive::Zip::tempFile();  # if you don&apos;t need the name

   Zip Archive Accessors
       members()
           Return a copy of the members array

               my @members = $zip-&gt;members();

       numberOfMembers()
           Return the number of members I have
&#12;       memberNames()
           Return a list of the (internal) file names of the zip members

       memberNamed( $string )
           Return ref to member whose filename equals given filename or undef.
           $string must be in Zip (Unix) filename format.

       membersMatching( $regex )
           Return array of members whose filenames match given regular
           expression in list context. Returns number of matching members in
           scalar context.

               my @textFileMembers = $zip-&gt;membersMatching( &apos;.*\.txt&apos; );
               # or
               my $numberOfTextFiles = $zip-&gt;membersMatching( &apos;.*\.txt&apos; );

       diskNumber()
           Return the disk that I start on. Not used for writing zips, but might
           be interesting if you read a zip in. This should be 0, as
           Archive::Zip does not handle multi-volume archives.

       diskNumberWithStartOfCentralDirectory()
           Return the disk number that holds the beginning of the central
           directory. Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you
           read a zip in. This should be 0, as Archive::Zip does not handle
           multi-volume archives.

       numberOfCentralDirectoriesOnThisDisk()
           Return the number of CD structures in the zipfile last read in.  Not
           used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.

       numberOfCentralDirectories()
           Return the number of CD structures in the zipfile last read in.  Not
           used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.

       centralDirectorySize()
           Returns central directory size, as read from an external zip file.
           Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip
           in.

       centralDirectoryOffsetWRTStartingDiskNumber()
           Returns the offset into the zip file where the CD begins. Not used
           for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.

       zipfileComment( [$string] )
           Get or set the zipfile comment. Returns the old comment.

               print $zip-&gt;zipfileComment();
               $zip-&gt;zipfileComment( &apos;New Comment&apos; );

       eocdOffset()
           Returns the (unexpected) number of bytes between where the EOCD was
           found and where it expected to be. This is normally 0, but would be
           positive if something (a virus, perhaps) had added bytes somewhere
           before the EOCD. Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting
           if you read a zip in. Here is an example of how you can diagnose
           this:

             my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new(&apos;somefile.zip&apos;);
             if ($zip-&gt;eocdOffset())
             {
               warn &quot;A virus has added &quot;, $zip-&gt;eocdOffset, &quot; bytes of garbage\n&quot;;
             }

           The &quot;eocdOffset()&quot; is used to adjust the starting position of member
           headers, if necessary.

       fileName()
           Returns the name of the file last read from. If nothing has been read
           yet, returns an empty string; if read from a file handle, returns the
           handle in string form.

   Zip Archive Member Operations
       Various operations on a zip file modify members. When a member is passed
       as an argument, you can either use a reference to the member itself, or
       the name of a member. Of course, using the name requires that names be
       unique within a zip (this is not enforced).

       removeMember( $memberOrName )
           Remove and return the given member, or match its name and remove it.
           Returns undef if member or name doesn&apos;t exist in this Zip. No-op if
           member does not belong to this zip.

       replaceMember( $memberOrName, $newMember )
           Remove and return the given member, or match its name and remove it.
           Replace with new member. Returns undef if member or name doesn&apos;t
           exist in this Zip, or if $newMember is undefined.

           It is an (undiagnosed) error to provide a $newMember that is a member
           of the zip being modified.

               my $member1 = $zip-&gt;removeMember( &apos;xyz&apos; );
               my $member2 = $zip-&gt;replaceMember( &apos;abc&apos;, $member1 );
               # now, $member2 (named &apos;abc&apos;) is not in $zip,
               # and $member1 (named &apos;xyz&apos;) is, having taken $member2&apos;s place.

       extractMember( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )
           Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.  Returns
           undef if member doesn&apos;t exist in this Zip. If optional second arg is
           given, use it as the name of the extracted member. Otherwise, the
           internal filename of the member is used as the name of the extracted
           file or directory.  If you pass $extractedName, it should be in the
           local file system&apos;s format.  All necessary directories will be
           created. Returns &quot;AZ_OK&quot; on success.

       extractMemberWithoutPaths( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )
           Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.  Does not
           use path information (extracts into the current directory). Returns
           undef if member doesn&apos;t exist in this Zip.  If optional second arg is
           given, use it as the name of the extracted member (its paths will be
           deleted too). Otherwise, the internal filename of the member (minus
           paths) is used as the name of the extracted file or directory.
           Returns &quot;AZ_OK&quot; on success.

       addMember( $member )
           Append a member (possibly from another zip file) to the zip file.
           Returns the new member. Generally, you will use addFile(),
           addDirectory(), addFileOrDirectory(), addString(), or read() to add
           members.

               # Move member named &apos;abc&apos; to end of zip:
               my $member = $zip-&gt;removeMember( &apos;abc&apos; );
               $zip-&gt;addMember( $member );

       updateMember( $memberOrName, $fileName )
           Update a single member from the file or directory named $fileName.
           Returns the (possibly added or updated) member, if any; &quot;undef&quot; on
           errors.  The comparison is based on &quot;lastModTime()&quot; and (in the case
           of a non-directory) the size of the file.

       addFile( $fileName [, $newName ] )
           Append a member whose data comes from an external file, returning the
           member or undef. The member will have its file name set to the name
           of the external file, and its desiredCompressionMethod set to
           COMPRESSION_DEFLATED. The file attributes and last modification time
           will be set from the file.  If the name given does not represent a
           readable plain file or symbolic link, undef will be returned.
           $fileName must be in the format required for the local file system.
           The optional $newName argument sets the internal file name to
           something different than the given $fileName. $newName, if given,
           must be in Zip name format (i.e. Unix).  The text mode bit will be
           set if the contents appears to be text (as returned by the &quot;-T&quot; perl
           operator).

           NOTE that you shouldn&apos;t (generally) use absolute path names in zip
           member names, as this will cause problems with some zip tools as well
           as introduce a security hole and make the zip harder to use.

       addDirectory( $directoryName [, $fileName ] )
           Append a member created from the given directory name. The directory
           name does not have to name an existing directory.  If the named
           directory exists, the file modification time and permissions are set
           from the existing directory, otherwise they are set to now and
           permissive default permissions.  $directoryName must be in local file
           system format.  The optional second argument sets the name of the
           archive member (which defaults to $directoryName). If given, it must
           be in Zip (Unix) format.  Returns the new member.

       addFileOrDirectory( $name [, $newName ] )
           Append a member from the file or directory named $name. If $newName
           is given, use it for the name of the new member.  Will add or remove
           trailing slashes from $newName as needed.  $name must be in local
           file system format.  The optional second argument sets the name of
           the archive member (which defaults to $name). If given, it must be in
           Zip (Unix) format.

       addString( $stringOrStringRef, $name )
           Append a member created from the given string or string reference.
           The name is given by the second argument.  Returns the new member.
           The last modification time will be set to now, and the file
           attributes will be set to permissive defaults.

               my $member = $zip-&gt;addString( &apos;This is a test&apos;, &apos;test.txt&apos; );

       contents( $memberOrMemberName [, $newContents ] )
           Returns the uncompressed data for a particular member, or undef.

               print &quot;xyz.txt contains &quot; . $zip-&gt;contents( &apos;xyz.txt&apos; );

           Also can change the contents of a member:

               $zip-&gt;contents( &apos;xyz.txt&apos;, &apos;This is the new contents&apos; );

           If called expecting an array as the return value, it will include the
           status as the second value in the array.

               ($content, $status) = $zip-&gt;contents( &apos;xyz.txt&apos;);

   Zip Archive I/O operations
       A Zip archive can be written to a file or file handle, or read from one.

       writeToFileNamed( $fileName )
           Write a zip archive to named file. Returns &quot;AZ_OK&quot; on success.

               my $status = $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed( &apos;xx.zip&apos; );
               die &quot;error somewhere&quot; if $status != AZ_OK;

           Note that if you use the same name as an existing zip file that you
           read in, you will clobber ZipFileMembers. So instead, write to a
           different file name, then delete the original.  If you use the
           &quot;overwrite()&quot; or &quot;overwriteAs()&quot; methods, you can re-write the
           original zip in this way.  $fileName should be a valid file name on
           your system.

       writeToFileHandle( $fileHandle [, $seekable] )
           Write a zip archive to a file handle. Return AZ_OK on success. The
           optional second arg tells whether or not to try to seek backwards to
           re-write headers. If not provided, it is set if the Perl &quot;-f&quot; test
           returns true. This could fail on some operating systems, though.

               my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( &apos;someFile.zip&apos;, &apos;w&apos; );
               unless ( $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh ) == AZ_OK ) {
                   # error handling
               }

           If you pass a file handle that is not seekable (like if you&apos;re
           writing to a pipe or a socket), pass a false second argument:

               my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( &apos;| cat &gt; somefile.zip&apos;, &apos;w&apos; );
               $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh, 0 );   # fh is not seekable

           If this method fails during the write of a member, that member and
           all following it will return false from &quot;wasWritten()&quot;. See
           writeCentralDirectory() for a way to deal with this.  If you want,
           you can write data to the file handle before passing it to
           writeToFileHandle(); this could be used (for instance) for making
           self-extracting archives. However, this only works reliably when
           writing to a real file (as opposed to STDOUT or some other possible
           non-file).

           See examples/selfex.pl for how to write a self-extracting archive.

       writeCentralDirectory( $fileHandle [, $offset ] )
           Writes the central directory structure to the given file handle.

           Returns AZ_OK on success. If given an $offset, will seek to that
           point before writing. This can be used for recovery in cases where
           writeToFileHandle or writeToFileNamed returns an IO error because of
           running out of space on the destination file.

           You can truncate the zip by seeking backwards and then writing the
           directory:

               my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( &apos;someFile.zip&apos;, &apos;w&apos; );
                   my $retval = $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh );
               if ( $retval == AZ_IO_ERROR ) {
                   my @unwritten = grep { not $_-&gt;wasWritten() } $zip-&gt;members();
                   if (@unwritten) {
                       $zip-&gt;removeMember( $member ) foreach my $member ( @unwritten );
                       $zip-&gt;writeCentralDirectory( $fh,
                       $unwritten[0]-&gt;writeLocalHeaderRelativeOffset());
                   }
               }

       overwriteAs( $newName )
           Write the zip to the specified file, as safely as possible.  This is
           done by first writing to a temp file, then renaming the original if
           it exists, then renaming the temp file, then deleting the renamed
           original if it exists. Returns AZ_OK if successful.

       overwrite()
           Write back to the original zip file. See overwriteAs() above.  If the
           zip was not ever read from a file, this generates an error.

       read( $fileName )
           Read zipfile headers from a zip file, appending new members.  Returns
           &quot;AZ_OK&quot; or error code.

               my $zipFile = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
               my $status = $zipFile-&gt;read( &apos;/some/FileName.zip&apos; );

       readFromFileHandle( $fileHandle, $filename )
           Read zipfile headers from an already-opened file handle, appending
           new members. Does not close the file handle.  Returns &quot;AZ_OK&quot; or
           error code. Note that this requires a seekable file handle; reading
           from a stream is not yet supported.

               my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( &apos;/some/FileName.zip&apos;, &apos;r&apos; );
               my $zip1 = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
               my $status = $zip1-&gt;readFromFileHandle( $fh );
               my $zip2 = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
               $status = $zip2-&gt;readFromFileHandle( $fh );

   Zip Archive Tree operations
       These used to be in Archive::Zip::Tree but got moved into Archive::Zip.
       They enable operation on an entire tree of members or files.  A usage
       example:

         use Archive::Zip;
         my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();

         # add all readable files and directories below . as xyz/*
         $zip-&gt;addTree( &apos;.&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos; );

         # add all readable plain files below /abc as def/*
         $zip-&gt;addTree( &apos;/abc&apos;, &apos;def&apos;, sub { -f &amp;&amp; -r } );

         # add all .c files below /tmp as stuff/*
         $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( &apos;/tmp&apos;, &apos;stuff&apos;, &apos;\.c$&apos; );

         # add all .o files below /tmp as stuff/* if they aren&apos;t writable
         $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( &apos;/tmp&apos;, &apos;stuff&apos;, &apos;\.o$&apos;, sub { ! -w } );

         # add all .so files below /tmp that are smaller than 200 bytes as stuff/*
         $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( &apos;/tmp&apos;, &apos;stuff&apos;, &apos;\.o$&apos;, sub { -s &lt; 200 } );

         # and write them into a file
         $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed(&apos;xxx.zip&apos;);

         # now extract the same files into /tmpx
         $zip-&gt;extractTree( &apos;stuff&apos;, &apos;/tmpx&apos; );

       $zip-&gt;addTree( $root, $dest [,$pred] ) -- Add tree of files to a zip
           $root is the root of the tree of files and directories to be added.
           It is a valid directory name on your system. $dest is the name for
           the root in the zip file (undef or blank means to use relative
           pathnames). It is a valid ZIP directory name (that is, it uses
           forward slashes (/) for separating directory components). $pred is an
           optional subroutine reference to select files: it is passed the name
           of the prospective file or directory using $_, and if it returns
           true, the file or directory will be included. The default is to add
           all readable files and directories. For instance, using

             my $pred = sub { /\.txt/ };
             $zip-&gt;addTree( &apos;.&apos;, &apos;&apos;, $pred );

           will add all the .txt files in and below the current directory, using
           relative names, and making the names identical in the zipfile:

             original name           zip member name
             ./xyz                   xyz
             ./a/                    a/
             ./a/b                   a/b
&#12;           To translate absolute to relative pathnames, just pass them in:
           $zip-&gt;addTree( &apos;/c/d&apos;, &apos;a&apos; );

             original name           zip member name
             /c/d/xyz                a/xyz
             /c/d/a/                 a/a/
             /c/d/a/b                a/a/b

           Returns AZ_OK on success. Note that this will not follow symbolic
           links to directories. Note also that this does not check for the
           validity of filenames.

           Note that you generally don&apos;t want to make zip archive member names
           absolute.

       $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( $root, $dest, $pattern [,$pred] )
           $root is the root of the tree of files and directories to be added
           $dest is the name for the root in the zip file (undef means to use
           relative pathnames) $pattern is a (non-anchored) regular expression
           for filenames to match $pred is an optional subroutine reference to
           select files: it is passed the name of the prospective file or
           directory in $_, and if it returns true, the file or directory will
           be included.  The default is to add all readable files and
           directories. To add all files in and below the current dirctory whose
           names end in &quot;.pl&quot;, and make them extract into a subdirectory named
           &quot;xyz&quot;, do this:

             $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( &apos;.&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos;, &apos;\.pl$&apos; )

           To add all writable files in and below the dirctory named &quot;/abc&quot;
           whose names end in &quot;.pl&quot;, and make them extract into a subdirectory
           named &quot;xyz&quot;, do this:

             $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( &apos;/abc&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos;, &apos;\.pl$&apos;, sub { -w } )

           Returns AZ_OK on success. Note that this will not follow symbolic
           links to directories.

       $zip-&gt;updateTree( $root, [ $dest, [ $pred [, $mirror]]] );
           Update a zip file from a directory tree.

           &quot;updateTree()&quot; takes the same arguments as &quot;addTree()&quot;, but first
           checks to see whether the file or directory already exists in the zip
           file, and whether it has been changed.

           If the fourth argument $mirror is true, then delete all my members if
           corresponding files weren&apos;t found.

           Returns an error code or AZ_OK if all is well.

       $zip-&gt;extractTree()
       $zip-&gt;extractTree( $root )
       $zip-&gt;extractTree( $root, $dest )
       $zip-&gt;extractTree( $root, $dest, $volume )
           If you don&apos;t give any arguments at all, will extract all the files in
           the zip with their original names.

           If you supply one argument for $root, &quot;extractTree&quot; will extract all
           the members whose names start with $root into the current directory,
           stripping off $root first.  $root is in Zip (Unix) format.  For
           instance,

             $zip-&gt;extractTree( &apos;a&apos; );

           when applied to a zip containing the files: a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will
           extract:
&#12;           a/x as ./x

           a/b/c as ./b/c

           If you give two arguments, &quot;extractTree&quot; extracts all the members
           whose names start with $root. It will translate $root into $dest to
           construct the destination file name.  $root and $dest are in Zip
           (Unix) format.  For instance,

              $zip-&gt;extractTree( &apos;a&apos;, &apos;d/e&apos; );

           when applied to a zip containing the files: a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will
           extract:

           a/x to d/e/x

           a/b/c to d/e/b/c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e

           If you give three arguments, &quot;extractTree&quot; extracts all the members
           whose names start with $root. It will translate $root into $dest to
           construct the destination file name, and then it will convert to
           local file system format, using $volume as the name of the
           destination volume.

           $root and $dest are in Zip (Unix) format.

           $volume is in local file system format.

           For instance, under Windows,

              $zip-&gt;extractTree( &apos;a&apos;, &apos;d/e&apos;, &apos;f:&apos; );

           when applied to a zip containing the files: a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will
           extract:

           a/x to f:d/e/x

           a/b/c to f:d/e/b/c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e

           If you want absolute paths (the prior example used paths relative to
           the current directory on the destination volume, you can specify
           these in $dest:

              $zip-&gt;extractTree( &apos;a&apos;, &apos;/d/e&apos;, &apos;f:&apos; );

           when applied to a zip containing the files: a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will
           extract:

           a/x to f:\d\e\x

           a/b/c to f:\d\e\b\c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e

           Returns an error code or AZ_OK if everything worked OK.

MEMBER OPERATIONS
   Member Class Methods
       Several constructors allow you to construct members without adding them
       to a zip archive. These work the same as the addFile(), addDirectory(),
       and addString() zip instance methods described above, but they don&apos;t add
       the new members to a zip.

       Archive::Zip::Member-&gt;newFromString( $stringOrStringRef [, $fileName] )
           Construct a new member from the given string. Returns undef on error.

               my $member = Archive::Zip::Member-&gt;newFromString( &apos;This is a test&apos;,
                                                            &apos;xyz.txt&apos; );
&#12;       newFromFile( $fileName )
           Construct a new member from the given file. Returns undef on error.

               my $member = Archive::Zip::Member-&gt;newFromFile( &apos;xyz.txt&apos; );

       newDirectoryNamed( $directoryName [, $zipname ] )
           Construct a new member from the given directory.  $directoryName must
           be a valid name on your file system; it doesn&apos;t have to exist.

           If given, $zipname will be the name of the zip member; it must be a
           valid Zip (Unix) name. If not given, it will be converted from
           $directoryName.

           Returns undef on error.

               my $member = Archive::Zip::Member-&gt;newDirectoryNamed( &apos;CVS/&apos; );

   Member Simple accessors
       These methods get (and/or set) member attribute values.

       versionMadeBy()
           Gets the field from the member header.

       fileAttributeFormat( [$format] )
           Gets or sets the field from the member header. These are &quot;FA_*&quot;
           values.

       versionNeededToExtract()
           Gets the field from the member header.

       bitFlag()
           Gets the general purpose bit field from the member header.  This is
           where the &quot;GPBF_*&quot; bits live.

       compressionMethod()
           Returns the member compression method. This is the method that is
           currently being used to compress the member data.  This will be
           COMPRESSION_STORED for added string or file members, or any of the
           &quot;COMPRESSION_*&quot; values for members from a zip file. However, this
           module can only handle members whose data is in COMPRESSION_STORED or
           COMPRESSION_DEFLATED format.

       desiredCompressionMethod( [$method] )
           Get or set the member&apos;s &quot;desiredCompressionMethod&quot;. This is the
           compression method that will be used when the member is written.
           Returns prior desiredCompressionMethod. Only COMPRESSION_DEFLATED or
           COMPRESSION_STORED are valid arguments. Changing to
           COMPRESSION_STORED will change the member desiredCompressionLevel to
           0; changing to COMPRESSION_DEFLATED will change the member
           desiredCompressionLevel to COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT.

       desiredCompressionLevel( [$method] )
           Get or set the member&apos;s desiredCompressionLevel This is the method
           that will be used to write. Returns prior desiredCompressionLevel.
           Valid arguments are 0 through 9, COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE,
           COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT, COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION, and
           COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST. 0 or COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE will change
           the desiredCompressionMethod to COMPRESSION_STORED.  All other
           arguments will change the desiredCompressionMethod to
           COMPRESSION_DEFLATED.

       externalFileName()
           Return the member&apos;s external file name, if any, or undef.

       fileName()
           Get or set the member&apos;s internal filename. Returns the (possibly new)
           filename. Names will have backslashes converted to forward slashes,
           and will have multiple consecutive slashes converted to single ones.

       lastModFileDateTime()
           Return the member&apos;s last modification date/time stamp in MS-DOS
           format.

       lastModTime()
           Return the member&apos;s last modification date/time stamp, converted to
           unix localtime format.

               print &quot;Mod Time: &quot; . scalar( localtime( $member-&gt;lastModTime() ) );

       setLastModFileDateTimeFromUnix()
           Set the member&apos;s lastModFileDateTime from the given unix time.

               $member-&gt;setLastModFileDateTimeFromUnix( time() );

       internalFileAttributes()
           Return the internal file attributes field from the zip header. This
           is only set for members read from a zip file.

       externalFileAttributes()
           Return member attributes as read from the ZIP file. Note that these
           are NOT UNIX!

       unixFileAttributes( [$newAttributes] )
           Get or set the member&apos;s file attributes using UNIX file attributes.
           Returns old attributes.

               my $oldAttribs = $member-&gt;unixFileAttributes( 0666 );

           Note that the return value has more than just the file permissions,
           so you will have to mask off the lowest bits for comparisions.

       localExtraField( [$newField] )
           Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the local header.
           This is not set for a member from a zip file until after the member
           has been written out. The extra field must be in the proper format.

       cdExtraField( [$newField] )
           Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the central directory
           header. The extra field must be in the proper format.

       extraFields()
           Return both local and CD extra fields, concatenated.

       fileComment( [$newComment] )
           Get or set the member&apos;s file comment.

       hasDataDescriptor()
           Get or set the data descriptor flag. If this is set, the local header
           will not necessarily have the correct data sizes. Instead, a small
           structure will be stored at the end of the member data with these
           values. This should be transparent in normal operation.

       crc32()
           Return the CRC-32 value for this member. This will not be set for
           members that were constructed from strings or external files until
           after the member has been written.

       crc32String()
           Return the CRC-32 value for this member as an 8 character printable
           hex string. This will not be set for members that were constructed
           from strings or external files until after the member has been
           written.

       compressedSize()
           Return the compressed size for this member. This will not be set for
           members that were constructed from strings or external files until
           after the member has been written.

       uncompressedSize()
           Return the uncompressed size for this member.

       isEncrypted()
           Return true if this member is encrypted. The Archive::Zip module does
           not currently create or extract encrypted members.

       isTextFile( [$flag] )
           Returns true if I am a text file. Also can set the status if given an
           argument (then returns old state). Note that this module does not
           currently do anything with this flag upon extraction or storage. That
           is, bytes are stored in native format whether or not they came from a
           text file.

       isBinaryFile()
           Returns true if I am a binary file. Also can set the status if given
           an argument (then returns old state). Note that this module does not
           currently do anything with this flag upon extraction or storage. That
           is, bytes are stored in native format whether or not they came from a
           text file.

       extractToFileNamed( $fileName )
           Extract me to a file with the given name. The file will be created
           with default modes. Directories will be created as needed.  The
           $fileName argument should be a valid file name on your file system.
           Returns AZ_OK on success.

       isDirectory()
           Returns true if I am a directory.

       writeLocalHeaderRelativeOffset()
           Returns the file offset in bytes the last time I was written.

       wasWritten()
           Returns true if I was successfully written. Reset at the beginning of
           a write attempt.

   Low-level member data reading
       It is possible to use lower-level routines to access member data streams,
       rather than the extract* methods and contents(). For instance, here is
       how to print the uncompressed contents of a member in chunks using these
       methods:

           my ( $member, $status, $bufferRef );
           $member = $zip-&gt;memberNamed( &apos;xyz.txt&apos; );
           $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
           $status = $member-&gt;rewindData();
           die &quot;error $status&quot; unless $status == AZ_OK;
           while ( ! $member-&gt;readIsDone() )
           {
           ( $bufferRef, $status ) = $member-&gt;readChunk();
           die &quot;error $status&quot;
                       if $status != AZ_OK &amp;&amp; $status != AZ_STREAM_END;
           # do something with $bufferRef:
           print $$bufferRef;
           }
           $member-&gt;endRead();

       readChunk( [$chunkSize] )
           This reads the next chunk of given size from the member&apos;s data stream
           and compresses or uncompresses it as necessary, returning a reference
           to the bytes read and a status. If size argument is not given,
           defaults to global set by Archive::Zip::setChunkSize. Status is AZ_OK
           on success until the last chunk, where it returns AZ_STREAM_END.
           Returns &quot;( \$bytes, $status)&quot;.

               my ( $outRef, $status ) = $self-&gt;readChunk();
               print $$outRef if $status != AZ_OK &amp;&amp; $status != AZ_STREAM_END;
&#12;       rewindData()
           Rewind data and set up for reading data streams or writing zip files.
           Can take options for &quot;inflateInit()&quot; or &quot;deflateInit()&quot;, but this
           isn&apos;t likely to be necessary.  Subclass overrides should call this
           method. Returns &quot;AZ_OK&quot; on success.

       endRead()
           Reset the read variables and free the inflater or deflater.  Must be
           called to close files, etc. Returns AZ_OK on success.

       readIsDone()
           Return true if the read has run out of data or errored out.

       contents()
           Return the entire uncompressed member data or undef in scalar
           context. When called in array context, returns &quot;( $string, $status
           )&quot;; status will be AZ_OK on success:

               my $string = $member-&gt;contents();
               # or
               my ( $string, $status ) = $member-&gt;contents();
               die &quot;error $status&quot; unless $status == AZ_OK;

           Can also be used to set the contents of a member (this may change the
           class of the member):

               $member-&gt;contents( &quot;this is my new contents&quot; );

       extractToFileHandle( $fh )
           Extract (and uncompress, if necessary) the member&apos;s contents to the
           given file handle. Return AZ_OK on success.

Archive::Zip::FileMember methods
       The Archive::Zip::FileMember class extends Archive::Zip::Member. It is
       the base class for both ZipFileMember and NewFileMember classes. This
       class adds an &quot;externalFileName&quot; and an &quot;fh&quot; member to keep track of the
       external file.

       externalFileName()
           Return the member&apos;s external filename.

       fh()
           Return the member&apos;s read file handle. Automatically opens file if
           necessary.

Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember methods
       The Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember class represents members that have been
       read from external zip files.

       diskNumberStart()
           Returns the disk number that the member&apos;s local header resides in.
           Should be 0.

       localHeaderRelativeOffset()
           Returns the offset into the zip file where the member&apos;s local header
           is.

       dataOffset()
           Returns the offset from the beginning of the zip file to the member&apos;s
           data.

REQUIRED MODULES
       Archive::Zip requires several other modules:

       Carp

       Compress::Raw::Zlib

       Cwd

       File::Basename

       File::Copy

       File::Find

       File::Path

       File::Spec

       IO::File

       IO::Seekable

       Time::Local

BUGS AND CAVEATS
   When not to use Archive::Zip
       If you are just going to be extracting zips (and/or other archives) you
       are recommended to look at using Archive::Extract instead, as it is much
       easier to use and factors out archive-specific functionality.

   Try to avoid IO::Scalar
       One of the most common ways to use Archive::Zip is to generate Zip files
       in-memory. Most people have use IO::Scalar for this purpose.

       Unfortunately, as of 1.11 this module no longer works with IO::Scalar as
       it incorrectly implements seeking.

       Anybody using IO::Scalar should consider porting to IO::String, which is
       smaller, lighter, and is implemented to be perfectly compatible with
       regular seekable filehandles.

       Support for IO::Scalar most likely will not be restored in the future, as
       IO::Scalar itself cannot change the way it is implemented due to back-
       compatibility issues.

TO DO
       * auto-choosing storing vs compression

       * extra field hooks (see notes.txt)

       * check for dups on addition/renaming?

       * Text file extraction (line end translation)

       * Reading zip files from non-seekable inputs
         (Perhaps by proxying through IO::String?)

       * separate unused constants into separate module

       * cookbook style docs

       * Handle tainted paths correctly

       * Work on better compatibility with other IO:: modules
