AuDataFormats(3)                                                AuDataFormats(3)



Name
       AuDataFormats - audio data formats.

Synopsis
       #include &lt;audio/audiolib.h&gt;

       Currently,  the following data formats are defined: AuFormatULAW8, AuFor&#8208;
       matLinearUnsigned8,   AuFormatLinearSigned8,   AuFormatLinearSigned16MSB,
       AuFormatLinearUnsigned16MSB,  AuFormatSignedLinear16LSB, and AuFormatLin&#8208;
       earUnsigned16LSB.

       AuFormatULAW8
                 Designates a data format in which samples are stored  as  8-bit
                 ulaw values.

       AuFormatLinearUnsigned8
                 Designates  a  data  format  in  which  samples  are  stored as
                 unsigned 8-bit values.

       AuFormatLinearSigned8
                 Designates a data format in which samples are stored as  signed
                 8-bit values.

       AuFormatLinearSigned16MSB
                 Designates  a data format in which samples are stored as signed
                 16-bit values, with the most significant byte first.

       AuFormatLinearUnsigned16MSB
                 Designates a  data  format  in  which  samples  are  stored  as
                 unsigned 16-bit values, with the most significant byte first.

       AuFormatSignedLinear16LSB
                 Designates  a  data  format  which samples are stored as signed
                 16-bit values, with the least significant byte first.

       AuFormatLinearUnsigned16LSB
                 Designates a data format which samples are stored  as  unsigned
                 16-bit values, with the least significant byte first.
