Members
       type      The  event type.  ElementNotify events are type AuEventTypeEle&#8208;
                 mentNotify.

       serial    The serial ID of the event expanded from the 16 bit value  sent
                 by the server.

       send_event
                 AuTrue if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.

       server    The  connection  to  the  audio  server that the event was read
                 from.

       time      The server time in milliseconds when the event was generated.

       flow      The ID of the flow that caused the event.

       element_num
                 The index of the element that caused the event or  AuElementAll
                 to indicate the flow.

       kind      The kind of notify event.  This will be one of these constants:
                 AuElementNotifyKindLowWater,  AuElementNotifyKindHighWater,  or
                 AuElementNotifyKindState.

       prev_state
                 The previous state of the element indexed by element_num.  This
                 will be one of these constants: AuStateStop,  AuStateStart,  or
                 AuStatePause.

       cur_state The  current state of the element indexed by element_num.  This
                 will be one of these constants: AuStateStop,  AuStateStart,  or
                 AuStatePause.

       reason    The  reason  for  the  notify event.  This will be one of these
                 constants:  AuReasonUser,  AuReasonUnderrun,   AuReasonOverrun,
                 AuReasonEOF, AuReasonWatermark, or AuReasonHardware.

       num_bytes The  number of bytes to send or receive.  Only valid if the the
                 element indexed by element_num is an  ImportClient  or  Export&#8208;
                 Client.

Description
       ElementNotify  events are sent to client applications to notify them of a
       watermark condition or state change.   If  kind  is  AuElementNotifyKind&#8208;
       LowWater,  the  ImportClient  element  indexed  by element_num in flow is
       ready to receive num_bytes of audio data from the client application.  If
       kind is AuElementNotifyKindHighWater, the ExportClient element indexed by
       element_num in flow is ready to send  num_bytes  of  audio  data  to  the
       client  application.   If  kind  is AuElementNotifyKindState, the element
       indexed by element_num (or flow if element_num is AuElementAll) has  made
       a  state  transition  from  prev_state to cur_state triggering the event.
       Reguardless of kind, prev_state and cur_state contain  the  old  and  new
       states and reason contains the reason for the event.
