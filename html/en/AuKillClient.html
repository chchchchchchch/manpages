Synopsis
       #include &lt;audio/audiolib.h&gt;

       void AuKillClient(server, resource, status)
           AuServer *server;

Arguments

       destroyed.  If resource  is  AuCloseDownDestroy,  the  resources  of  all
       clients that have terminated in AuCloseDownRetainTemporary are destroyed.
