Members
       type      The event type.  MonitorNotify events are type AuEventTypeMoni&#8208;

                 earUnsigned16MSB, AuFormatSignedLinear16LSB,  and  AuFormatLin&#8208;
                 earUnsigned16LSB.  Taken from the ExportMonitor element.

       num_tracks
                 The  number  of  tracks  in  the  monitor data.  Taken from the
                 ExportMonitor element.
&#12;       count     Always 0.
