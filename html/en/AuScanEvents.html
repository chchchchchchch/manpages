AuScanEvents(3)                                                  AuScanEvents(3)



Name
       AuScanEvents - return the first event that satisfies the predicate

Synopsis
       #include &lt;audio/audiolib.h&gt;

       AuBool AuScanEvents(server, mode, dequeue, predicate, arg, event)
           AuServer *server;
           int mode;
           AuBool dequeue;
           AuBool (*predicate)(AuServer *,AuEvent *, AuPointer);
           AuPointer arg;
           AuEvent *event; /* RETURN */

Arguments
       server    Specifies the connection to the audio server.

       mode      Specifies  how  far to look for a match.  This should be one of
                 these  constants:  AuEventsQueuedAlready,  AuEventsQueuedAfter&#8208;
                 Reading, or AuEventsQueuedAfterFlush.

       dequeue   Specifies  if  a  matching event is found, should it be removed
                 from the queue.

       predicate Specifies the procedure that is called to determine if an event
                 matches the criteria.

       arg       Specifies  any  additional arguments to be passed to the predi&#8208;
                 cate procedure.

       event     Returns the matching event if found.

Description
       AuScanEvents scans the event queue looking for the first event that  sat&#8208;
       isfies  the caller-supplied predicate.  If mode is AuEventsQueuedAlready,
       AuScanEvents only checks for events already in the  queue.   If  mode  is
       AuEventsQueuedAfterReading,  and  a matching event isn&apos;t found already in
       the queue, AuScanEvents attempts to read more events out of the  applica&#8208;
       tion&apos;s  connection.   If  mode is AuEventsQueuedAfterFlush and a matching
       event isn&apos;t already in the queue or isn&apos;t waiting  to  be  read,  AuScan&#8208;
       Events  flushes  the output queue and attempts to read more events out of
       the application&apos;s connection.  If dequeue is AuTrue, and a matching event
       is  found,  it  is  removed  from  the queue.  The predicate procedure is
       called with the arguments server, event, and arg and should return AuTrue
       to indicate a match.
