AuScanForTypedEvent(3)                                    AuScanForTypedEvent(3)



Name
       AuScanForTypedEvent - return the first event of a specific type

Synopsis
       #include &lt;audio/audiolib.h&gt;

       AuBool AuScanForTypedEvent(server, mode, dequeue, type, event)
           AuServer *server;
           int mode;
           AuBool dequeue;
           int type;
           AuEvent *event; /* RETURN */

Arguments
       server    Specifies the connection to the audio server.

       mode      Specifies  how  far to look for a match.  This should be one of
                 these  constants:  AuEventsQueuedAlready,  AuEventsQueuedAfter&#8208;
                 Reading, or AuEventsQueuedAfterFlush.

       dequeue   Specifies  if  a  matching event is found, should it be removed
                 from the queue.

       type      Specifies the type of event to match.  The type should  be  one
                 of  these constants: AuEventTypeElementNotify, AuEventTypeGrab&#8208;
                 Notify, or AuEventTypeMonitorNotify.

       event     Returns the matching event if found.

Description
       AuScanForTypedEvent scans the event queue looking  for  the  first  event
       that matches type.  If mode is AuEventsQueuedAlready, AuScanForTypedEvent
       only  checks  for  events   already   in   the   queue.    If   mode   is
       AuEventsQueuedAfterReading,  and  a matching event isn&apos;t found already in
       the queue, AuScanForTypedEvent attempts to read more events  out  of  the
       application&apos;s  connection.   If  mode  is  AuEventsQueuedAfterFlush and a
       matching event isn&apos;t already in the queue or isn&apos;t waiting  to  be  read,
       AuScanForTypedEvent  flushes  the  output queue and attempts to read more
       events out of the application&apos;s connection.  If dequeue is AuTrue, and  a
       matching event is found, it is removed from the queue.
