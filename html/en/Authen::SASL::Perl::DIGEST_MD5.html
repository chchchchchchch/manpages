NAME
       Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 - Digest MD5 Authentication class

SYNOPSIS
         use Authen::SASL qw(Perl);

         $sasl = Authen::SASL-&gt;new(
           mechanism =&gt; &apos;DIGEST-MD5&apos;,
           callback  =&gt; {
             user =&gt; $user,
             pass =&gt; $pass,
             serv =&gt; $serv
           },
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This method implements the client and server parts of the DIGEST-MD5 SASL
       algorithm, as described in RFC 2831.

   CALLBACK
       The callbacks used are:

       client

       authname
           The authorization id to use after successful authentication

       user
           The username to be used in the response

       pass
           The password to be used to compute the response.

       serv
           The service name when authenticating to a replicated service

       realm
           The authentication realm when overriding the server-provided default.
           If not given the server-provided value is used.

           The callback will be passed the list of realms that the server
           provided in the initial response.

       server

       realm
           The default realm to provide to the client

       getsecret(username, realm, authzid)
           returns the password associated with &quot;username&quot; and &quot;realm&quot;

   PROPERTIES
       The properties used are:

       maxbuf
           The maximum buffer size for receiving cipher text

       minssf
           The minimum SSF value that should be provided by the SASL security
           layer.  The default is 0

       maxssf
           The maximum SSF value that should be provided by the SASL security
           layer.  The default is 2**31

       externalssf
           The SSF value provided by an underlying external security layer.  The
           default is 0

       ssf The actual SSF value provided by the SASL security layer after the
           SASL authentication phase has been completed. This value is read-only
           and set by the implementation after the SASL authentication phase has
           been completed.

       maxout
           The maximum plaintext buffer size for sending data to the peer.  This
           value is set by the implementation after the SASL authentication
           phase has been completed and a SASL security layer is in effect.
