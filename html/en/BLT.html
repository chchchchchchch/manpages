NAME
       BLT - Introduction to the BLT library
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       BLT  is  a library of extensions to the Tk library.  It adds new commands
       and variables to the application&apos;s interpreter.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are added to the interpreter from the BLT library:

       table          A table geometry  manager  for  Tk.   You  specify  window
                      placements  as  table row,column positions and windows can
                      also span multiple rows or  columns.   It  also  has  many
                      options for setting and/or bounding window sizes.

       graph          A 2D plotting widget.  Plots two variable data in a window
                      with an optional legend and annotations.   It has of  sev&#8208;
                      eral  components;  coordinate  axes, crosshairs, a legend,
                      and a collection of elements and tags.

       barchart       A barchart widget.  Plots two-variable data as rectangular
                      bars  in  a window.  The x-coordinate values designate the
                      position of the bar along the x-axis, while the  y-coordi&#8208;
                      nate  values designate the magnitude.  The barchart widget
                      has of several components; coordinate axes, crosshairs,  a
                      legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

       vector         Creates  a  vector of floating point values.  The vector&apos;s
                      components can be manipulated in three ways: through a Tcl
                      array variable, a Tcl command, or the C API.

       spline         Computes  a  spline  fitting a set of data points (x and y
                      vectors) and produces a vector of the interpolated  images
                      (y-coordinates) at a given set of x-coordinates.

       bgexec         Like  Tcl&apos;s  exec  command, bgexec runs a pipeline of Unix
                      commands in the background.  Unlike exec,  the  output  of
                      the last process is collected and a global Tcl variable is
                      set upon its completion.  bgexec can be used  with  tkwait
                      to  wait  for Unix commands to finish while still handling
                      expose events.   Intermediate  output  is  also  available
                      while the pipeline is active.

       busy           Creates  a  &quot;busy  window&quot; which prevents user-interaction
                      when an application is busy.  The busy  window  also  pro&#8208;
                      vides  an easy way to have temporary busy cursors (such as
                      a watch or hourglass).

       bitmap         Reads and writes bitmaps from Tcl.  New X bitmaps  can  be
                      defined  on-the-fly  from  Tcl, obviating the need to copy
                      around bitmap files.  Other options query  loaded  X  bit&#8208;
                      map&apos;s dimensions and data.

       drag&amp;drop      Provides  a  drag-and-drop  facility  for Tk.  Information
                      (represented by a token window) can be dragged to and from
                      any  Tk window, including those of another Tk application.
                      drag&amp;drop acts as a coordinator, directing  Tk  send  com&#8208;
                      mands between (or within) TCL/Tk applications.
&#12;       htext          A  simple  hypertext widget.  Combines text and Tk widgets
                      into a single scroll-able window.   Tcl  commands  can  be
                      embedded  into  text,  which  are  invoked  as the text is
                      parsed.  In addition, Tk widgets can be  appended  to  the
                      window  at  the  current  point in the text.  Htext can be
                      also used to create scrolled windows of Tk widgets.

       winop          Raise, lower, map, or, unmap any window.   The  raise  and
                      lower  functions  are useful for stacking windows above or
                      below &quot;busy windows&quot;.

       watch          Arranges for Tcl procedures to  be  called  before  and/or
                      after the execution of every Tcl command. This command may
                      be used in the logging, profiling, or tracing of Tcl code.

       bltdebug       A simple Tcl command tracing facility useful for debugging
                      Tcl code.  Displays each Tcl command before and after sub&#8208;
                      stitution along its level in the interpreter  on  standard
                      error.

VARIABLES
       The  following  Tcl  variables  are  either set or used by BLT at various
       times in its execution:

       blt_library    This variable contains the name of a directory  containing
                      a  library  of Tcl scripts and other files related to BLT.
                      Currently, this directory contains the drag&amp;drop  protocol
                      scripts  and  the PostScript prolog used by graph and bar&#8208;
                      chart.  The value of  this  variable  is  taken  from  the
                      BLT_LIBRARY  environment  variable, if one exists, or else
                      from a default value compiled into the BLT library.

       blt_versions   This variable is set in the interpreter for each  applica&#8208;
                      tion.  It  is  an array of the current version numbers for
                      each of the BLT commands in the form  major.minor.   Major
                      and   minor   are  integers.   The  major  version  number
                      increases in any command that includes  changes  that  are
                      not  backward  compatible (i.e. whenever existing applica&#8208;
                      tions and scripts may have to change to work with the  new
                      release).   The  minor  version number increases with each
                      new release of a command, except that it  resets  to  zero
                      whenever  the  major version number changes.  The array is
                      indexed by the individual command name.

ADDING BLT TO YOUR APPLICATIONS
       It&apos;s easy to add BLT to an existing  Tk  application.   BLT  requires  no
       patches  or edits to the Tcl or Tk libraries.  To add BLT, simply add the
       following code snippet to your application&apos;s tkAppInit.c file.

              if (Blt_Init(interp) != TCL_OK) {
                  return TCL_ERROR;
              }

       Recompile and link with the BLT library (libBLT.a) and that&apos;s it.

       Alternately, you can dynamically load BLT, simply by invoking the command

              package require BLT

       from your Tcl script.
