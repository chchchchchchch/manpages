BIB2BIB(1)                                                            BIB2BIB(1)



NAME
       BibX2bib - Filter BibTeX data bases


SYNOPSIS
       bib2bib [options] &lt;filename&gt; ...


DESCRIPTION
       bib2bib  is  a  filter tool that reads one or several bibliography files,
       filters the entries with respect to a given criterion,  and  outputs  the
       list  of  selected  keys together with a new bibliography file containing
       only the selected entries. If no input file is given then input is  taken
       from the standard input.

       Additionally,  bib2bib  may  output  a  file  containing  all the keys of
       entries that satisfy the condition. This  second  file  is  suitable  for
       input as option -citefile to bibtex2html


OPTIONS
       -ob filename
              specify the filename where the selected entries are output. If not
              given, it defaults to standard output.

       -oc filename
              specify the filename where the list of selected keys is output. If
              not given, this file is not created.

       -c condition
              specify  a  condition  for  selecting the entries. The output will
              retain only the entries that satisfy this  condition.  If  several
              such  condition  are given, then only the entries that satisfy all
              the conditions are selected. The syntax of conditions is described
              in  the complete documentation, notice that it is better to escape
              shell expansions in that conditions, in other  words,  you  should
              write conditions between quotes.

       -expand
              expand  all abbreviations in the output file. Notice that there is
              no way to ask for expansion of cross-references, since the meaning
              of  such  an  expansion is unclear: it&apos;s better to let bibtex (via
              bibtex2html) handle the cross-references himself, depending on the
              style considered.

       -s field
              sorts  the  entries  of the bibliography with respect to the given
              field, which may be $key or $type to refer to the key  or  to  the
              entry  type,  as  for  filter conditions. This options may be used
              several times to specifiy a lexicographic order, such as by  year,
              then  by  keys.   When  the field is $date then entries are sorted
              chronologically.

              When sorting, the resulting bibliography will always  contain  the
              comments  first,  then  the preambles, then the abbreviations, and
              finally the regular entries. Be warned that such a  sort  may  put
              cross-references  before  entries  that  refer to them, so be cau&#8208;
              tious.

       -r     reverses the sort

       -q , --quiet
              be quiet.
&#12;       -w , --warn-error
              stop at the first warning.


USAGE WITH BIBTEX2HTML
       Notice that the two output files are suitable for use with bibtex2html. A
       typical use would be

           bib2bib -oc citefile -ob bibfile.bib -c condition file1.bib file2.bib
       ...
           bibtex2html -citefile citefile bibfile.bib

       which will produce exactly the HTML file  for  the  selected  references.
       Notice  finally  that  bibtex2html  will  expand the strings (by default,
       unless you specify the -noexpand option) but not the cross-references.
