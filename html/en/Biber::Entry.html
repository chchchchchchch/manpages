Biber::Entry(3pm)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     Biber::Entry(3pm)



NAME
       Biber::Entry - Biber::Entry objects

   new
           Initialize a Biber::Entry object

   TO_JSON
          Serialiser for JSON::XS::encode

   clone
           Clone a Biber::Entry object and return a copy
           Accepts optionally a key for the copy

   notnull
           Test for an empty object

   set_orig_field
           Set a field which came from the datasource which is then split/transformed
           into other fields. Here we save the original in case we need to look at it again
           but it is not treated as a real field any more. Such fields are of only historical
           interest in the processing in case we lose information during processing but need
           to refer back.

   get_orig_field
           Get an original field which has been subsequently split/transformed.

   set_field
         Set/append to a derived field for a Biber::Entry object, that is, a field
         which was not an actual bibliography field

   get_field
           Get a field for a Biber::Entry object

   set_datafield
           Set/append to a field which is in the bib data file
           Only set to null if the field is a nullable one
           otherwise if value is null, remove the field

   get_datafield
           Get a field that was in the original data file

   del_field
           Delete a field in a Biber::Entry object

   del_datafield
           Delete an original data source data field in a Biber::Entry object

   field_exists
           Check whether a field exists (even if null)

   datafields
           Returns a sorted array of the fields which came from the data source

   count_datafields
           Returns the number of datafields

   fields
           Returns a sorted array of all field names, including ones
           added during processing which are not necessarily fields
           which came from the data file

   count_fields
           Returns the number of fields
&#12;   has_keyword
           Check if a Biber::Entry object has a particular keyword in
           in the KEYWORDS field.

   add_warning
           Append a warning to a Biber::Entry object

   set_inherit_from
           Inherit fields from parent entry

           $entry-&gt;set_inherit_from($parententry);

           Takes a second Biber::Entry object as argument
           Tailored for set inheritance which is a straight 1:1 inheritance,
           excluding certain fields for backwards compatibility

   resolve_xdata
           Recursively resolve XDATA fields in an entry

           $entry-&gt;resolve_xdata($xdata_entry);

   inherit_from
           Inherit fields from parent entry (as indicated by the crossref field)

           $entry-&gt;inherit_from($parententry);

           Takes a second Biber::Entry object as argument
           Uses the crossref inheritance specifications from the .bcf

   dump
           Dump Biber::Entry object
