Biber::Input::file::bibUser3Contributed Perl DocuBiber::Input::file::bibtex(3pm)



   init_cache
           Invalidate the T::B object cache. Used only in tests when e.g. we change the encoding
           settings and therefore must force a re-read of the data

   TBSIG
            Signal handler to catch fatal Text::BibTex SEGFAULTS. It has bugs
            and we want to say at least something if it coredumps

   extract_entries
          Main data extraction routine.
          Accepts a data source identifier, preprocesses the file and then
          looks for the passed keys, creating entries when it finds them and
          passes out an array of keys it didn&apos;t find.

   create_entry
          Create a Biber::Entry object from a Text::BibTeX object

   cache_data
          Caches file data into T::B objects indexed by the original
          datasource key, decoded into UTF8

   preprocess_file
          Convert file to UTF-8 and potentially decode LaTeX macros to UTF-8

   parsename
           Given a name string, this function returns a Biber::Entry::Name object
           with all parts of the name resolved according to the BibTeX conventions.

           parsename(&apos;John Doe&apos;)
           returns an object which internally looks a bit like this:

           { firstname     =&gt; &apos;John&apos;,
             firstname_i   =&gt; [&apos;J&apos;],
             lastname      =&gt; &apos;Doe&apos;,
             lastname_i    =&gt; [&apos;D&apos;],
             prefix        =&gt; undef,
             prefix_i      =&gt; undef,
             suffix        =&gt; undef,
             suffix_i      =&gt; undef,
             namestring    =&gt; &apos;Doe, John&apos;,
             nameinitstring =&gt; &apos;Doe_J&apos;,
             strip          =&gt; {&apos;firstname&apos; =&gt; 0,
                                &apos;lastname&apos;  =&gt; 0,
                                &apos;prefix&apos;    =&gt; 0,
                                &apos;suffix&apos;    =&gt; 0}
             }
