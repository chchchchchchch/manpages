NAME
       Biber::Output::Base - base class for Biber output modules.

   new
           Initialize a Biber::Output::Base object

   set_output_target_file
           Set the output target file of a Biber::Output::Base object
           A convenience around set_output_target so we can keep track of the
           filename

   set_output_target
           Set the output target of a Biber::Output::Base object

   set_output_head
           Set the output head of a Biber::Output::Base object
           $data could be anything - the caller is expected to know.

   set_output_tail
           Set the output tail of a Biber::Output::Base object
           $data could be anything - the caller is expected to know.

   get_output_head
           Get the output head of a Biber::Output object
           $data could be anything - the caller is expected to know.
           Mainly used in debugging

   get_output_tail
           Get the output tail of a Biber::Output object
           $data could be anything - the caller is expected to know.
           Mainly used in debugging

   add_output_head
           Add to the head output data of a Biber::Output::Base object
           The base class method just does a string append

   add_output_tail
           Add to the tail output data of a Biber::Output::Base object
           The base class method just does a string append

   set_output_section
         Records the section object in the output object
         We need some information from this when writing the .bbl

   get_output_section
         Retrieve the output section object

   get_output_entries
           Get the sorted order output data for all entries in a list as array ref

   get_output_entry
           Get the output data for a specific entry.
           Used really only in tests as it instantiates list dynamic information so
           we can see it in tests

   set_los
           Set the output list of shorthands for a section

   get_los
           Get the output list of shorthands for a section as an array

   set_output_entry
           Add an entry output to a Biber::Output::Base object
           The base class method just does a dump
&#12;   create_output_misc
           Create the output for misc bits and pieces like preamble and closing
           macro call and add to output object.

   create_output_section
           Create the output from the sections data and push it into the
           output object.

   set_output_keyalias
         Set the output for a key which is an alias to another key

   set_output_undefkey
         Set the output for an undefined key

   output
           Generic base output method
