NAME
       Biber::Utils - Various utility subs used in Biber

EXPORT
       All functions are exported by default.

FUNCTIONS
   driver_config
         Returns an XML::LibXML::Simple object for an input driver config file

   locate_biber_file
         Searches for a file by

         For the exact path if the filename is absolute
         In the output_directory, if defined
         Relative to the current directory
         In the same directory as the control file
         Using kpsewhich, if available

   biber_warn
           Wrapper around various warnings bits and pieces
           Logs a warning, add warning to the list of .bbl warnings and optionally
           increments warning count in Biber object, if present

   biber_error
           Wrapper around error logging
           Forces an exit.

   makenamesid
       Given a Biber::Names object, return an underscore normalised
       concatenation of all of the full name strings.

   makenameid
       Given a Biber::Name object, return an underscore normalised concatenation
       of the full name strings.

   latex_recode_output
         Tries to convert UTF-8 to TeX macros in passed string

   strip_nosort
       Removes elements which are not to be used in sorting a name from a string

   normalise_string_sort
       Removes LaTeX macros, and all punctuation, symbols, separators and
       control characters, as well as leading and trailing whitespace for
       sorting strings.  It also decodes LaTeX character macros into Unicode as
       this is always safe when normalising strings for sorting since they don&apos;t
       appear in the output.

   normalise_string
       Removes LaTeX macros, and all punctuation, symbols, separators and
       control characters, as well as leading and trailing whitespace for
       sorting strings.  Only decodes LaTeX character macros into Unicode if
       output is UTF-8

   normalise_string_common
         Common bit for normalisation

   normalise_string_hash
         Normalise strings used for hashes. We collapse LaTeX macros into a vestige
         so that hashes are unique between things like:
&#12;         Smith
         {\v S}mith

         we replace macros like this to preserve their vestiges:

         \v S -&gt; v:
         \&quot; -&gt; 34:

   normalise_string_underscore
       Like normalise_string, but also substitutes ~ and whitespace with
       underscore.

   reduce_array
       reduce_array(\@a, \@b) returns all elements in @a that are not in @b

   remove_outer
           Remove surrounding curly brackets:
               &apos;{string}&apos; -&gt; &apos;string&apos;

   add_outer
           Add surrounding curly brackets:
               &apos;string&apos; -&gt; &apos;{string}&apos;

   ucinit
           upper case of initial letters in a string

   is_undef
           Checks for undefness of arbitrary things, including
           composite method chain calls which don&apos;t reliably work
           with defined() (see perldoc for defined())
           This works because we are just testing the value passed
           to this sub. So, for example, this is randomly unreliable
           even if the resulting value of the arg to defined() is &quot;undef&quot;:

           defined($thing-&gt;method($arg)-&gt;method)

           wheras:

           is_undef($thing-&gt;method($arg)-&gt;method)

           works since we only test the return value of all the methods
           with defined()

   is_def
           Checks for definedness in the same way as is_undef()

   is_undef_or_null
           Checks for undef or nullness (see is_undef() above)

   is_def_and_notnull
           Checks for def and unnullness (see is_undef() above)

   is_def_and_null
           Checks for def and nullness (see is_undef() above)

   is_null
           Checks for nullness

   is_notnull
           Checks for notnullness

   is_notnull_scalar
           Checks for notnullness of a scalar

   is_notnull_array
           Checks for notnullness of an array (passed by ref)
&#12;   is_notnull_hash
           Checks for notnullness of an hash (passed by ref)

   is_notnull_object
           Checks for notnullness of an object (passed by ref)

   stringify_hash
           Turns a hash into a string of keys and values

   normalise_utf8
         Normalise any UTF-8 encoding string immediately to exactly what we want
         We want the strict perl utf8 &quot;UTF-8&quot;

   inits
          We turn the initials into an array so we can be flexible with them later
          The tie here is used only so we know what to split on. We don&apos;t want to make
          any typesetting decisions in Biber, like what to use to join initials so on
          output to the .bbl, we only use BibLaTeX macros.

   join_name
         Replace all join typsetting elements in a name part (space, ties) with BibLaTeX macros
         so that typesetting decisions are made in BibLaTeX, not hard-coded in Biber

   filter_entry_options
           Process any per_entry option transformations which are necessary

   imatch
           Do an interpolating match using a match RE and a string passed in as variables

   ireplace
           Do an interpolating match/replace using a match RE, replacement RE
           and string passed in as variables

   validate_biber_xml
         Validate a biber/biblatex XML metadata file against an RNG schema
