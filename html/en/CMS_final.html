CMS_final(3SSL)                      OpenSSL                     CMS_final(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_final - finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        int CMS_final(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_final() finalises the structure cms. It&apos;s purpose is to perform any
       operations necessary on cms (digest computation for example) and set the
       appropriate fields. The parameter data contains the content to be
       processed. The dcont parameter contains a BIO to write content to after
       processing: this is only used with detached data and will usually be set
       to NULL.

NOTES
       This function will normally be called when the CMS_PARTIAL flag is used.
       It should only be used when streaming is not performed because the
       streaming I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_final() returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
