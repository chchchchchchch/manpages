CMS_get0_type(3SSL)                  OpenSSL                 CMS_get0_type(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_get0_type, CMS_set1_eContentType, CMS_get0_eContentType - get and set CMS content types

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        const ASN1_OBJECT *CMS_get0_type(CMS_ContentInfo *cms);
        int CMS_set1_eContentType(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, const ASN1_OBJECT *oid);
        const ASN1_OBJECT *CMS_get0_eContentType(CMS_ContentInfo *cms);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_get0_type() returns the content type of a CMS_ContentInfo structure
       as and ASN1_OBJECT pointer. An application can then decide how to process
       the CMS_ContentInfo structure based on this value.

       CMS_set1_eContentType() sets the embedded content type of a
       CMS_ContentInfo structure. It should be called with CMS functions with
       the CMS_PARTIAL flag and before the structure is finalised, otherwise the
       results are undefined.

       ASN1_OBJECT *CMS_get0_eContentType() returns a pointer to the embedded
       content type.

NOTES
       As the 0 implies CMS_get0_type() and CMS_get0_eContentType() return
       internal pointers which should not be freed up. CMS_set1_eContentType()
       copies the supplied OID and it should be freed up after use.

       The ASN1_OBJECT values returned can be converted to an integer NID value
       using OBJ_obj2nid(). For the currently supported content types the
       following values are returned:

        NID_pkcs7_data
        NID_pkcs7_signed
        NID_pkcs7_digest
        NID_id_smime_ct_compressedData:
        NID_pkcs7_encrypted
        NID_pkcs7_enveloped

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_get0_type() and CMS_get0_eContentType() return and ASN1_OBJECT
       structure.

       CMS_set1_eContentType() returns 1 for success or 0 if an error occurred.
       The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3).

HISTORY
       CMS_get0_type(), CMS_set1_eContentType() and CMS_get0_eContentType() were
       all first added to OpenSSL 0.9.8
