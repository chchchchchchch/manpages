CMS_sign(3SSL)                       OpenSSL                      CMS_sign(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_sign - create a CMS SignedData structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        CMS_ContentInfo *CMS_sign(X509 *signcert, EVP_PKEY *pkey, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, BIO *data, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_sign() creates and returns a CMS SignedData structure. signcert is
       the certificate to sign with, pkey is the corresponding private key.
       certs is an optional additional set of certificates to include in the CMS
       structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the chain). Any or all of
       these parameters can be NULL, see NOTES below.

       The data to be signed is read from BIO data.

       flags is an optional set of flags.

NOTES
       Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the flags
       parameter.

       Many S/MIME clients expect the signed content to include valid MIME
       headers. If the CMS_TEXT flag is set MIME headers for type text/plain are
       prepended to the data.

       If CMS_NOCERTS is set the signer&apos;s certificate will not be included in
       the CMS_ContentInfo structure, the signer&apos;s certificate must still be
       supplied in the signcert parameter though. This can reduce the size of
       the signature if the signers certificate can be obtained by other means:
       for example a previously signed message.

       The data being signed is included in the CMS_ContentInfo structure,
       unless CMS_DETACHED is set in which case it is omitted. This is used for
       CMS_ContentInfo detached signatures which are used in S/MIME plaintext
       signed messages for example.

       Normally the supplied content is translated into MIME canonical format
       (as required by the S/MIME specifications) if CMS_BINARY is set no
       translation occurs. This option should be used if the supplied data is in
       binary format otherwise the translation will corrupt it.

       The SignedData structure includes several CMS signedAttributes including
       the signing time, the CMS content type and the supported list of ciphers
       in an SMIMECapabilities attribute. If CMS_NOATTR is set then no
       signedAttributes will be used. If CMS_NOSMIMECAP is set then just the
       SMIMECapabilities are omitted.

       If present the SMIMECapabilities attribute indicates support for the
       following algorithms in preference order: 256 bit AES, Gost R3411-94,
       Gost 28147-89, 192 bit AES, 128 bit AES, triple DES, 128 bit RC2, 64 bit
       RC2, DES and 40 bit RC2.  If any of these algorithms is not available
       then it will not be included: for example the GOST algorithms will not be
       included if the GOST ENGINE is not loaded.

       OpenSSL will by default identify signing certificates using issuer name
       and serial number. If CMS_USE_KEYID is set it will use the subject key
       identifier value instead. An error occurs if the signing certificate does
       not have a subject key identifier extension.

       If the flags CMS_STREAM is set then the returned CMS_ContentInfo
       structure is just initialized ready to perform the signing operation. The
       signing is however not performed and the data to be signed is not read
       from the data parameter. Signing is deferred until after the data has
       been written. In this way data can be signed in a single pass.

       If the CMS_PARTIAL flag is set a partial CMS_ContentInfo structure is
       output to which additional signers and capabilities can be added before
       finalization.

       If the flag CMS_STREAM is set the returned CMS_ContentInfo structure is
       not complete and outputting its contents via a function that does not
       properly finalize the CMS_ContentInfo structure will give unpredictable
       results.

       Several functions including SMIME_write_CMS(), i2d_CMS_bio_stream(),
       PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream() finalize the structure. Alternatively
       finalization can be performed by obtaining the streaming ASN1 BIO
       directly using BIO_new_CMS().

       If a signer is specified it will use the default digest for the signing
       algorithm. This is SHA1 for both RSA and DSA keys.

       If signcert and pkey are NULL then a certificates only CMS structure is
       output.

       The function CMS_sign() is a basic CMS signing function whose output will
       be suitable for many purposes. For finer control of the output format the
       certs, signcert and pkey parameters can all be NULL and the CMS_PARTIAL
       flag set. Then one or more signers can be added using the function
       CMS_sign_add1_signer(), non default digests can be used and custom
       attributes added. CMS_final() must then be called to finalize the
       structure if streaming is not enabled.

BUGS
       Some attributes such as counter signatures are not supported.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_sign() returns either a valid CMS_ContentInfo structure or NULL if an
       error occurred. The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3).

HISTORY
       CMS_sign() was added to OpenSSL 0.9.8

       The CMS_STREAM flag is only supported for detached data in OpenSSL 0.9.8,
       it is supported for embedded data in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later.
