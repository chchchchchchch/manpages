CMS_sign_receipt(3SSL)               OpenSSL              CMS_sign_receipt(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_sign_receipt - create a CMS signed receipt

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        CMS_ContentInfo *CMS_sign_receipt(CMS_SignerInfo *si, X509 *signcert, EVP_PKEY *pkey, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_sign_receipt() creates and returns a CMS signed receipt structure. si
       is the CMS_SignerInfo structure containing the signed receipt request.
       signcert is the certificate to sign with, pkey is the corresponding
       private key.  certs is an optional additional set of certificates to
       include in the CMS structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the
       chain).

       flags is an optional set of flags.

NOTES
       This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_sign() except the flag
       values CMS_DETACHED, CMS_BINARY, CMS_NOATTR, CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are
       not supported since they do not make sense in the context of signed
       receipts.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_sign_receipt() returns either a valid CMS_ContentInfo structure or
       NULL if an error occurred.  The error can be obtained from
       ERR_get_error(3).
