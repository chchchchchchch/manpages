CMS_uncompress(3SSL)                 OpenSSL                CMS_uncompress(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_uncompress - uncompress a CMS CompressedData structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        int CMS_uncompress(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *dcont, BIO *out, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_uncompress() extracts and uncompresses the content from a CMS
       CompressedData structure cms. data is a BIO to write the content to and
       flags is an optional set of flags.

       The dcont parameter is used in the rare case where the compressed content
       is detached. It will normally be set to NULL.

NOTES
       The only currently supported compression algorithm is zlib: if the
       structure indicates the use of any other algorithm an error is returned.

       If zlib support is not compiled into OpenSSL then CMS_uncompress() will
       always return an error.

       The following flags can be passed in the flags parameter.

       If the CMS_TEXT flag is set MIME headers for type text/plain are deleted
       from the content. If the content is not of type text/plain then an error
       is returned.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_uncompress() returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure. The error
       can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)

BUGS
       The lack of single pass processing and the need to hold all data in
       memory as mentioned in CMS_verify() also applies to CMS_decompress().

HISTORY
       CMS_uncompress() was added to OpenSSL 0.9.8
