CMS_verify_receipt(3SSL)             OpenSSL            CMS_verify_receipt(3SSL)



NAME
        CMS_verify_receipt - verify a CMS signed receipt

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/cms.h&gt;

        int CMS_verify_receipt(CMS_ContentInfo *rcms, CMS_ContentInfo *ocms, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, X509_STORE *store, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_verify_receipt() verifies a CMS signed receipt. rcms is the signed
       receipt to verify. ocms is the original SignedData structure containing
       the receipt request. certs is a set of certificates in which to search
       for the signing certificate. store is a trusted certificate store (used
       for chain verification).

       flags is an optional set of flags, which can be used to modify the verify
       operation.

NOTES
       This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_verify() except the flag
       values CMS_DETACHED, CMS_BINARY, CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are not
       supported since they do not make sense in the context of signed receipts.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_verify_receipt() returns 1 for a successful verification and zero if
       an error occurred.

       The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)
