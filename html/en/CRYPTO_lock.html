DESCRIPTION
       OpenSSL can safely be used in multi-threaded applications provided that
       at least two callback functions are set, locking_function and
       threadid_func.

       locking_function(int mode, int n, const char *file, int line) is needed
       to perform locking on shared data structures.  (Note that OpenSSL uses a
       number of global data structures that will be implicitly shared whenever
       multiple threads use OpenSSL.)  Multi-threaded applications will crash at
       random if it is not set.

       locking_function() must be able to handle up to CRYPTO_num_locks()
       different mutex locks. It sets the n-th lock if mode &amp; CRYPTO_LOCK, and
       releases it otherwise.

       file and line are the file number of the function setting the lock. They
       can be useful for debugging.

       threadid_func(CRYPTO_THREADID *id) is needed to record the currently-
       executing thread&apos;s identifier into id. The implementation of this
       callback should not fill in id directly, but should use
       CRYPTO_THREADID_set_numeric() if thread IDs are numeric, or
       CRYPTO_THREADID_set_pointer() if they are pointer-based.  If the
       application does not register such a callback using
       CRYPTO_THREADID_set_callback(), then a default implementation is used -
       on Windows and BeOS this uses the system&apos;s default thread identifying
       APIs, and on all other platforms it uses the address of errno. The latter
       is satisfactory for thread-safety if and only if the platform has a
       thread-local error number facility.

       Once threadid_func() is registered, or if the built-in default
       implementation is to be used;

       &#183;   CRYPTO_THREADID_current() records the currently-executing thread ID
           into the given id object.

       &#183;   CRYPTO_THREADID_cmp() compares two thread IDs (returning zero for
           equality, ie.  the same semantics as memcmp()).

       &#183;   CRYPTO_THREADID_cpy() duplicates a thread ID value,

       &#183;   CRYPTO_THREADID_hash() returns a numeric value usable as a hash-table
           key. This is usually the exact numeric or pointer-based thread ID
           used internally, however this also handles the unusual case where
           pointers are larger than &apos;long&apos; variables and the platform&apos;s thread
           IDs are pointer-based - in this case, mixing is done to attempt to
           produce a unique numeric value even though it is not as wide as the
           platform&apos;s true thread IDs.

       Additionally, OpenSSL supports dynamic locks, and sometimes, some parts
       of OpenSSL need it for better performance.  To enable this, the following
       is required:

       &#183;   Three additional callback function, dyn_create_function,
           dyn_lock_function and dyn_destroy_function.

       &#183;   A structure defined with the data that each lock needs to handle.

       struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value has to be defined to contain whatever
       structure is needed to handle locks.

       dyn_create_function(const char *file, int line) is needed to create a
       lock.  Multi-threaded applications might crash at random if it is not
       set.

       dyn_lock_function(int mode, CRYPTO_dynlock *l, const char *file, int
       line) is needed to perform locking off dynamic lock numbered n. Multi-
       threaded applications might crash at random if it is not set.
&#12;       dyn_destroy_function(CRYPTO_dynlock *l, const char *file, int line) is
       needed to destroy the lock l. Multi-threaded applications might crash at
       random if it is not set.

       CRYPTO_get_new_dynlockid() is used to create locks.  It will call
       dyn_create_function for the actual creation.

       CRYPTO_destroy_dynlockid() is used to destroy locks.  It will call
       dyn_destroy_function for the actual destruction.

       CRYPTO_lock() is used to lock and unlock the locks.  mode is a bitfield
       describing what should be done with the lock.  n is the number of the
       lock as returned from CRYPTO_get_new_dynlockid().  mode can be combined
       from the following values.  These values are pairwise exclusive, with
       undefined behaviour if misused (for example, CRYPTO_READ and CRYPTO_WRITE
       should not be used together):

               CRYPTO_LOCK     0x01
               CRYPTO_UNLOCK   0x02
               CRYPTO_READ     0x04
               CRYPTO_WRITE    0x08

RETURN VALUES
       CRYPTO_num_locks() returns the required number of locks.

       CRYPTO_get_new_dynlockid() returns the index to the newly created lock.

       The other functions return no values.

NOTES
       You can find out if OpenSSL was configured with thread support:

        #define OPENSSL_THREAD_DEFINES
        #include &lt;openssl/opensslconf.h&gt;
        #if defined(OPENSSL_THREADS)
          // thread support enabled
        #else
          // no thread support
        #endif

       Also, dynamic locks are currently not used internally by OpenSSL, but may
       do so in the future.

EXAMPLES
       crypto/threads/mttest.c shows examples of the callback functions on
       Solaris, Irix and Win32.

HISTORY
       CRYPTO_set_locking_callback() is available in all versions of SSLeay and
       OpenSSL.  CRYPTO_num_locks() was added in OpenSSL 0.9.4.  All functions
       dealing with dynamic locks were added in OpenSSL 0.9.5b-dev.
       CRYPTO_THREADID and associated functions were introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.0
       to replace (actually, deprecate) the previous CRYPTO_set_id_callback(),
       CRYPTO_get_id_callback(), and CRYPTO_thread_id() functions which assumed
       thread IDs to always be represented by &apos;unsigned long&apos;.
