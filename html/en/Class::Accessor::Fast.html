Class::Accessor::Fast(3User Contributed Perl DocumentaClass::Accessor::Fast(3pm)



NAME
       Class::Accessor::Fast - Faster, but less expandable, accessors

SYNOPSIS
         package Foo;
         use base qw(Class::Accessor::Fast);

         # The rest is the same as Class::Accessor but without set() and get().

DESCRIPTION
       This is a faster but less expandable version of Class::Accessor.
       Class::Accessor&apos;s generated accessors require two method calls to
       accompish their task (one for the accessor, another for get() or set()).
       Class::Accessor::Fast eliminates calling set()/get() and does the access
       itself, resulting in a somewhat faster accessor.

       The downside is that you can&apos;t easily alter the behavior of your
       accessors, nor can your subclasses.  Of course, should you need this
       later, you can always swap out Class::Accessor::Fast for Class::Accessor.

       Read the documentation for Class::Accessor for more info.
