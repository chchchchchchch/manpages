NAME
       Class::Factory::Util - Provide utility methods for factory classes

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Class;

         use Class::Factory::Util;

         My::Class-&gt;subclasses;

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports a method that is useful for factory classes.

USAGE
       When this module is loaded, it creates a method in its caller named
       &quot;subclasses()&quot;.  This method returns a list of the available subclasses
       for the package.  It does this by looking in @INC as well as the
       directory containing the caller, and finding any modules in the immediate
       subdirectories of the calling module.

       So if you have the modules &quot;Foo::Base&quot;, &quot;Foo::Base::Bar&quot;, and
       &quot;Foo::Base::Baz&quot;, then the return value of &quot;Foo::Base-&gt;subclasses()&quot;
       would be &quot;Bar&quot; and &quot;Baz&quot;.
