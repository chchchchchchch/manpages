NAME
       Class::ISA - report the search path for a class&apos;s ISA tree

SYNOPSIS
         # Suppose you go: use Food::Fishstick, and that uses and
         # inherits from other things, which in turn use and inherit
         # from other things.  And suppose, for sake of brevity of
         # example, that their ISA tree is the same as:

         @Food::Fishstick::ISA = qw(Food::Fish  Life::Fungus  Chemicals);
         @Food::Fish::ISA = qw(Food);
         @Food::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Life::Fungus::ISA = qw(Life);
         @Chemicals::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Life::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Matter::ISA = qw();

         use Class::ISA;
         print &quot;Food::Fishstick path is:\n &quot;,
               join(&quot;, &quot;, Class::ISA::super_path(&apos;Food::Fishstick&apos;)),
               &quot;\n&quot;;

       That prints:

         Food::Fishstick path is:
          Food::Fish, Food, Matter, Life::Fungus, Life, Chemicals

DESCRIPTION
       Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived,
       via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is
       from Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those
       superclasses may themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or
       more superclasses (as above).

       When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick-&gt;calories), Perl
       first searches there for that method, but if it&apos;s not there, it goes
       searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
       &quot;height-first&quot; is the word) search.  In the above example, it&apos;d first
       look in Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life,
       then Chemicals.

       This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
       list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method,
       with no duplicates.

FUNCTIONS
       the function Class::ISA::super_path($CLASS)
           This returns the ordered list of names of classes that Perl would
           search thru in order to find a method, with no duplicates in the
           list.  $CLASS is not included in the list.  UNIVERSAL is not included
           -- if you need to consider it, add it to the end.

       the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_path($CLASS)
           Just like &quot;super_path&quot;, except that $CLASS is included as the first
           element.

       the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_versions($CLASS)
           This returns a hash whose keys are $CLASS and its
           (super-)superclasses, and whose values are the contents of each
           class&apos;s $VERSION (or undef, for classes with no $VERSION).

           The code for self_and_super_versions is meant to serve as an example
           for precisely the kind of tasks I anticipate that self_and_super_path
           and super_path will be used for.  You are strongly advised to read
           the source for self_and_super_versions, and the comments there.

CAUTIONARY NOTES
       * Class::ISA doesn&apos;t export anything.  You have to address the functions
       with a &quot;Class::ISA::&quot; on the front.

       * Contrary to its name, Class::ISA isn&apos;t a class; it&apos;s just a package.
       Strange, isn&apos;t it?

       * Say you have a loop in the ISA tree of the class you&apos;re calling one of
       the Class::ISA functions on: say that Food inherits from Matter, but
       Matter inherits from Food (for sake of argument).  If Perl, while
       searching for a method, actually discovers this cyclicity, it will throw
       a fatal error.  The functions in Class::ISA effectively ignore this
       cyclicity; the Class::ISA algorithm is &quot;never go down the same path
       twice&quot;, and cyclicities are just a special case of that.

       * The Class::ISA functions just look at @ISAs.  But theoretically, I
       suppose, AUTOLOADs could bypass Perl&apos;s ISA-based search mechanism and do
       whatever they please.  That would be bad behavior, tho; and I try not to
       think about that.

       * If Perl can&apos;t find a method anywhere in the ISA tree, it then looks in
       the magical class UNIVERSAL.  This is rarely relevant to the tasks that I
       expect Class::ISA functions to be put to, but if it matters to you, then
       instead of this:

         @supers = Class::Tree::super_path($class);

       do this:

         @supers = (Class::Tree::super_path($class), &apos;UNIVERSAL&apos;);

       And don&apos;t say no-one ever told ya!

       * When you call them, the Class::ISA functions look at @ISAs anew -- that
       is, there is no memoization, and so if ISAs change during runtime, you
       get the current ISA tree&apos;s path, not anything memoized.  However,
       changing ISAs at runtime is probably a sign that you&apos;re out of your mind!
