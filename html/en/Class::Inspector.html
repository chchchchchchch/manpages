NAME
       Class::Inspector - Get information about a class and its structure

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::Inspector;

         # Is a class installed and/or loaded
         Class::Inspector-&gt;installed( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;loaded( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );

         # Filename related information
         Class::Inspector-&gt;filename( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;resolved_filename( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );

         # Get subroutine related information
         Class::Inspector-&gt;functions( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;function_refs( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;function_exists( &apos;Foo::Class&apos;, &apos;bar&apos; );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;methods( &apos;Foo::Class&apos;, &apos;full&apos;, &apos;public&apos; );

         # Find all loaded subclasses or something
         Class::Inspector-&gt;subclasses( &apos;Foo::Class&apos; );

DESCRIPTION
       Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most
       or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they aren&apos;t
       always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl
       wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts
       to provide an easier, more friendly interface to this information.

METHODS
   installed $class
       The &quot;installed&quot; static method tries to determine if a class is installed
       on the machine, or at least available to Perl. It does this by wrapping
       around &quot;resolved_filename&quot;.

       Returns true if installed/available, false if the class is not installed,
       or &quot;undef&quot; if the class name is invalid.

   loaded $class
       The &quot;loaded&quot; static method tries to determine if a class is loaded by
       looking for symbol table entries.

       This method it uses to determine this will work even if the class does
       not have its own file, but is contained inside a single file with
       multiple classes in it. Even in the case of some sort of run-time loading
       class being used, these typically leave some trace in the symbol table,
       so an Autoload or Class::Autouse-based class should correctly appear
       loaded.

       Returns true if the class is loaded, false if not, or &quot;undef&quot; if the
       class name is invalid.

   filename $class
       For a given class, returns the base filename for the class. This will NOT
       be a fully resolved filename, just the part of the filename BELOW the
       @INC entry.

         print Class-&gt;filename( &apos;Foo::Bar&apos; );
         &gt; Foo/Bar.pm

       This filename will be returned with the right separator for the local
       platform, and should work on all platforms.

       Returns the filename on success or &quot;undef&quot; if the class name is invalid.

   resolved_filename $class, @try_first
       For a given class, the &quot;resolved_filename&quot; static method returns the
       fully resolved filename for a class. That is, the file that the class
       would be loaded from.

       This is not nescesarily the file that the class WAS loaded from, as the
       value returned is determined each time it runs, and the @INC include path
       may change.

       To get the actual file for a loaded class, see the &quot;loaded_filename&quot;
       method.

       Returns the filename for the class, or &quot;undef&quot; if the class name is
       invalid.

   loaded_filename $class
       For a given loaded class, the &quot;loaded_filename&quot; static method determines
       (via the %INC hash) the name of the file that it was originally loaded
       from.

       Returns a resolved file path, or false if the class did not have it&apos;s own
       file.

   functions $class
       For a loaded class, the &quot;functions&quot; static method returns a list of the
       names of all the functions in the classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of the function names on success, or
       &quot;undef&quot; if the class name is invalid or the class is not loaded.

   function_refs $class
       For a loaded class, the &quot;function_refs&quot; static method returns references
       to all the functions in the classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of &quot;CODE&quot; refs of the functions on
       success, or &quot;undef&quot; if the class is not loaded.

   function_exists $class, $function
       Given a class and function name the &quot;function_exists&quot; static method will
       check to see if the function exists in the class.

       Note that this is as a function, not as a method. To see if a method
       exists for a class, use the &quot;can&quot; method for any class or object.

       Returns true if the function exists, false if not, or &quot;undef&quot; if the
       class or function name are invalid, or the class is not loaded.

   methods $class, @options
       For a given class name, the &quot;methods&quot; static method will returns ALL the
       methods available to that class. This includes all methods available from
       every class up the class&apos; @ISA tree.

       Returns a reference to an array of the names of all the available methods
       on success, or &quot;undef&quot; if the class name is invalid or the class is not
       loaded.

       A number of options are available to the &quot;methods&quot; method that will alter
       the results returned. These should be listed after the class name, in any
       order.

         # Only get public methods
         my $method = Class::Inspector-&gt;methods( &apos;My::Class&apos;, &apos;public&apos; );

       public
           The &quot;public&quot; option will return only &apos;public&apos; methods, as defined by
           the Perl convention of prepending an underscore to any &apos;private&apos;
           methods. The &quot;public&quot; option will effectively remove any methods that
           start with an underscore.

       private
           The &quot;private&quot; options will return only &apos;private&apos; methods, as defined
           by the Perl convention of prepending an underscore to an private
           methods. The &quot;private&quot; option will effectively remove an method that
           do not start with an underscore.

           Note: The &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; options are mutually exclusive

       full
           &quot;methods&quot; normally returns just the method name. Supplying the &quot;full&quot;
           option will cause the methods to be returned as the full names. That
           is, instead of returning &quot;[ &apos;method1&apos;, &apos;method2&apos;, &apos;method3&apos; ]&quot;, you
           would instead get &quot;[ &apos;Class::method1&apos;, &apos;AnotherClass::method2&apos;,
           &apos;Class::method3&apos; ]&quot;.

       expanded
           The &quot;expanded&quot; option will cause a lot more information about method
           to be returned. Instead of just the method name, you will instead get
           an array reference containing the method name as a single combined
           name, ala &quot;full&quot;, the separate class and method, and a CODE ref to
           the actual function ( if available ). Please note that the function
           reference is not guarenteed to be available. &quot;Class::Inspector&quot; is
           intended at some later time, work with modules that have some some of
           common run-time loader in place ( e.g &quot;Autoloader&quot; or
           &quot;Class::Autouse&quot; for example.

           The response from &quot;methods( &apos;Class&apos;, &apos;expanded&apos; )&quot; would look
           something like the following.

             [
               [ &apos;Class::method1&apos;,   &apos;Class&apos;,   &apos;method1&apos;, \&amp;Class::method1   ],
               [ &apos;Another::method2&apos;, &apos;Another&apos;, &apos;method2&apos;, \&amp;Another::method2 ],
               [ &apos;Foo::bar&apos;,         &apos;Foo&apos;,     &apos;bar&apos;,     \&amp;Foo::bar         ],
             ]

   subclasses $class
       The &quot;subclasses&quot; static method will search then entire namespace (and
       thus all currently loaded classes) to find all classes that are
       subclasses of the class provided as a the parameter.

       The actual test will be done by calling &quot;isa&quot; on the class as a static
       method. (i.e. &quot;My::Class-&gt;isa($class)&quot;.

       Returns a reference to a list of the loaded classes that match the class
       provided, or false is none match, or &quot;undef&quot; if the class name provided
       is invalid.
