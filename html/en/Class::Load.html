Class::Load(3pm)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      Class::Load(3pm)



NAME
       Class::Load - a working (require &quot;Class::Name&quot;) and more

VERSION
       version 0.17

SYNOPSIS
           use Class::Load &apos;:all&apos;;

           try_load_class(&apos;Class::Name&apos;)
               or plan skip_all =&gt; &quot;Class::Name required to run these tests&quot;;

           load_class(&apos;Class::Name&apos;);

           is_class_loaded(&apos;Class::Name&apos;);

           my $baseclass = load_optional_class(&apos;Class::Name::MightExist&apos;)
               ? &apos;Class::Name::MightExist&apos;
               : &apos;Class::Name::Default&apos;;

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;require EXPR&quot; only accepts &quot;Class/Name.pm&quot; style module names, not
       &quot;Class::Name&quot;. How frustrating! For that, we provide &quot;load_class
       &apos;Class::Name&apos;&quot;.

       It&apos;s often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of
       throwing an error when it&apos;s not available. For that, we provide
       &quot;try_load_class &apos;Class::Name&apos;&quot;.

       Finally, sometimes we need to know whether a particular class has been
       loaded.  Asking %INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and
       any class for which the filename does not correspond to the package name.
       For that, we provide &quot;is_class_loaded &apos;Class::Name&apos;&quot;.

FUNCTIONS
   load_class Class::Name, \%options
       &quot;load_class&quot; will load &quot;Class::Name&quot; or throw an error, much like
       &quot;require&quot;.

       If &quot;Class::Name&quot; is already loaded (checked with &quot;is_class_loaded&quot;) then
       it will not try to load the class. This is useful when you have inner
       packages which &quot;require&quot; does not check.

       The %options hash currently accepts one key, &quot;-version&quot;. If you specify a
       version, then this subroutine will call &quot;Class::Name-&gt;VERSION(
       $options{-version} )&quot; internally, which will throw an error if the
       class&apos;s version is not equal to or greater than the version you
       requested.

   try_load_class Class::Name, \%options -&gt; (0|1, error message)
       Returns 1 if the class was loaded, 0 if it was not. If the class was not
       loaded, the error will be returned as a second return value in list
       context.

       Again, if &quot;Class::Name&quot; is already loaded (checked with
       &quot;is_class_loaded&quot;) then it will not try to load the class. This is useful
       when you have inner packages which &quot;require&quot; does not check.

       Like &quot;load_class&quot;, you can pass a &quot;-version&quot; in %options. If the version
       is not sufficient, then this subroutine will return false.

   is_class_loaded Class::Name, \%options -&gt; 0|1
       This uses a number of heuristics to determine if the class &quot;Class::Name&quot;
       is loaded. There heuristics were taken from Class::MOP&apos;s old pure-perl
       implementation.

       Like &quot;load_class&quot;, you can pass a &quot;-version&quot; in %options. If the version
       is not sufficient, then this subroutine will return false.

   load_first_existing_class Class::Name, \%options, ...
       This attempts to load the first loadable class in the list of classes
       given. Each class name can be followed by an options hash reference.

       If any one of the classes loads and passes the optional version check,
       that class name will be returned. If none of the classes can be loaded
       (or none pass their version check), then an error will be thrown.

       If, when attempting to load a class, it fails to load because of a syntax
       error, then an error will be thrown immediately.

   load_optional_class Class::Name, \%options -&gt; 0|1
       &quot;load_optional_class&quot; is a lot like &quot;try_load_class&quot;, but also a lot like
       &quot;load_class&quot;.

       If the class exists, and it works, then it will return 1. If you specify
       a version in %options, then the version check must succeed or it will
       return 0.

       If the class doesn&apos;t exist, and it appears to not exist on disk either,
       it will return 0.

       If the class exists on disk, but loading from disk results in an error (
       i.e.: a syntax error ), then it will &quot;croak&quot; with that error.

       This is useful for using if you want a fallback module system, i.e.:

           my $class = load_optional_class($foo) ? $foo : $default;

       That way, if $foo does exist, but can&apos;t be loaded due to error, you won&apos;t
       get the behaviour of it simply not existing.

           This module was designed to be used anywhere you have &quot;if (eval
           &quot;require $module&quot;; 1)&quot;, which occurs in many large projects.
