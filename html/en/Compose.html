Compose(5)                                                            Compose(5)



NAME
       Compose - X client mappings for multi-key input sequences

DESCRIPTION
       The  X  library,  libX11,  provides  a simple input method for characters
       beyond those represented on typical  keyboards  using  sequences  of  key
       strokes that are combined to enter a single character.

       The compose file is searched for in  the following order:

       -      If  the  environment  variable  $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its value is
              used as the name of the Compose file.

       -      If the user&apos;s home directory has a file  named  .XCompose,  it  is
              used as the Compose file.

       -      The  system provided compose file is used by mapping the locale to
              a compose file from the list in /usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir.

       Compose files can use an &quot;include&quot; instruction.  This allows local  modi&#8208;
       fications  to  be made to existing compose files without including all of
       the content directly.  For example, the system&apos;s iso8859-1  compose  file
       can be included with a line like this:
           include &quot;%S/iso8859-1/Compose&quot;

       There  are several substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
       include instruction:

       %H  expands to the user&apos;s home directory (the $HOME environment variable)

       %L  expands to the name  of  the  locale  specific  Compose  file  (i.e.,
           &quot;/usr/share/X11/locale/&lt;localename&gt;/Compose&quot;)

       %S  expands  to the name of the system directory for Compose files (i.e.,
           &quot;/usr/share/X11/locale&quot;)

       For example, you can include in your compose  file  the  default  Compose
       file by using:
              include &quot;%L&quot;
       and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
       rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

FILE FORMAT
       Compose files are plain text files, with a separate line for each compose
       sequence.    Comments  begin  with  # characters.   Each compose sequence
       specifies one or more events and a  resulting  input  sequence,  with  an
       optional comment at the end of the line:
              EVENT [EVENT...] : RESULT [# COMMENT]

       Each  event  consists  of a specified input keysym, and optional modifier
       states:
              [MODIFIER_LIST] &lt;keysym&gt;

       Each modifier consists of a specified modifier and a state:
              (! MODIFIER ) | None
       Modifiers may be preceded by a &quot;~&quot; character to indicate that  the  modi&#8208;
       fier must not be present.

       The  result  specifies  a  string,  keysym,  or  both,  that the X client
       receives as input when the sequence of events is input:
              &quot;STRING&quot; | keysym | &quot;STRING&quot; keysym
&#12;       Keysyms are specified without the XK_ prefix.

       Strings may be direct text encoded in the locale for  which  the  compose
       file  is  to  be used, or an escaped octal or hexadecimal character code.
       Octal codes are specified as &quot;\123&quot; and hexadecimal codes  as  &quot;\0x123a&quot;.
       It  is  not  necessary  to  specify  in the right part of a rule a locale
       encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is omitted,
       Xlib  figures  it  out  from  the keysym according to the current locale.
       I.e., if a rule looks like:
              &lt;dead_grave&gt; &lt;A&gt; : &quot;\300&quot; Agrave
       the result of the composition is always the letter with the &quot;\300&quot;  code.
       But if the rule is:
              &lt;dead_grave&gt; &lt;A&gt; : Agrave
       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.
