Config::File(3pm)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     Config::File(3pm)



NAME
       Config::File - Parse a simple configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       use Config::File;

       my $config_hash = Config::File::read_config_file($configuration_file);

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;read_config_file&quot; parses a simple configuration file and stores its
       values in an anonymous hash reference. The syntax of the configuration
       file is as follows:

           # This is a comment
           VALUE_ONE = foo
           VALUE_TWO = $VALUE_ONE/bar
           VALUE_THREE = The value contains a \# (hash). # This is a comment.

       Options can be clustered when creating groups:

           CLUSTER_ONE[data] = data cluster one
           CLUSTER_ONE[value] = value cluster one
           CLUSTER_TWO[data] = data cluster two
           CLUSTER_TWO[value] = value cluster two

       Then values can be fetched using this syntax:

           $hash_config-&gt;{CLUSTER_ONE}{data};

       There can be as many sub-options in a cluster as needed.

           BIG_CLUSTER[part1][part2][part3] = data

       is fetched by:
           $hash_config-&gt;{BIG_CLUSTER}{part1}{part2}{part3};

       There are a couple of restrictions as for the names of the keys. First of
       all, all the characters should be alphabetic, numeric, underscores or
       hyphens, with square brackets allowed for the clustering. That is, the
       keys should conform to /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$/

       This means also that no space is allowed in the key part of the line.

           CLUSTER_ONE[data] = data cluster one      # Right
           CLUSTER_ONE[ data ] = data cluster one    # Wrong

Function &quot;read_config_file&quot;
   Syntax
           Config::File::read_config_file($file);

   Arguments
       $file is the configuration file.

   Return value
       This function returns a hash reference. Each key of the hash is a value
       defined in the configuration file.

   Description
       &quot;read_config_file&quot; parses a configuration file a sets up some values in a
       hash reference.

NOTES
   Function not exported by default
       In versions up to 1.0, the function read_config_file was exported to the
       calling program&apos;s namespace - Starting in version 1.1, nothing is
       exported by default. You can either fully qualify read_config_file or
       explicitly import it into your namespace:

       Fully qualifying read_config_file
             use Config::File;

             my $config_hash = Config::File::read_config_file($configuration_file);

       Explicitly importing read_config_file
             use Config::File qw(read_config_file);

             my $config_hash = read_config_file($configuration_file);

   Migrated away from ConfigFile into Config::File
       As of version 1.4, in order to include this module in the CPAN, I decided
       to move away from the highly unstandard name of ConfigFile and rename the
       module to Config::File. A small redirecting module is put in place, so
       current code using this module does not break, but the ConfigFile
       namespace usage is deprecated (and will thus issue a warning). Please
       update your code!
