NAME
       Convert::BinHex - extract data from Macintosh BinHex files

       ALPHA WARNING: this code is currently in its Alpha release.  Things may
       change drastically until the interface is hammered out: if you have sug&#8208;
       gestions or objections, please speak up now!

SYNOPSIS
       Simple functions:

           use Convert::BinHex qw(binhex_crc macbinary_crc);

           # Compute HQX7-style CRC for data, pumping in old CRC if desired:
           $crc = binhex_crc($data, $crc);

           # Compute the MacBinary-II-style CRC for the data:
           $crc = macbinary_crc($data, $crc);

       Hex to bin, low-level interface.  Conversion is actually done via an
       object (&quot;Convert::BinHex::Hex2Bin&quot;) which keeps internal conversion
       state:

           # Create and use a &quot;translator&quot; object:
           my $H2B = Convert::BinHex-&gt;hex2bin;    # get a converter object
           while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
               print $STDOUT $H2B-&gt;next($_);        # convert some more input
           }
           print $STDOUT $H2B-&gt;done;              # no more input: finish up

       Hex to bin, OO interface.  The following operations must be done in the
       order shown!

           # Read data in piecemeal:
           $HQX = Convert::BinHex-&gt;open(FH=&gt;\*STDIN) || die &quot;open: $!&quot;;
           $HQX-&gt;read_header;                  # read header info
           @data = $HQX-&gt;read_data;            # read in all the data
           @rsrc = $HQX-&gt;read_resource;        # read in all the resource

       Bin to hex, low-level interface.  Conversion is actually done via an
       object (&quot;Convert::BinHex::Bin2Hex&quot;) which keeps internal conversion
       state:

           # Create and use a &quot;translator&quot; object:
           my $B2H = Convert::BinHex-&gt;bin2hex;    # get a converter object
           while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
               print $STDOUT $B2H-&gt;next($_);        # convert some more input
           }
           print $STDOUT $B2H-&gt;done;              # no more input: finish up

       Bin to hex, file interface.  Yes, you can convert to BinHex as well as
       from it!

           # Create new, empty object:
           my $HQX = Convert::BinHex-&gt;new;

           # Set header attributes:
           $HQX-&gt;filename(&quot;logo.gif&quot;);
           $HQX-&gt;type(&quot;GIFA&quot;);
           $HQX-&gt;creator(&quot;CNVS&quot;);

           # Give it the data and resource forks (either can be absent):
           $HQX-&gt;data(Path =&gt; &quot;/path/to/data&quot;);       # here, data is on disk
           $HQX-&gt;resource(Data =&gt; $resourcefork);     # here, resource is in core
&#12;           # Output as a BinHex stream, complete with leading comment:
           $HQX-&gt;encode(\*STDOUT);

       PLANNED!!!! Bin to hex, &quot;CAP&quot; interface.  Thanks to Ken Lunde for sug&#8208;
       gesting this.

           # Create new, empty object from CAP tree:
           my $HQX = Convert::BinHex-&gt;from_cap(&quot;/path/to/root/file&quot;);
           $HQX-&gt;encode(\*STDOUT);

DESCRIPTION
       BinHex is a format used by Macintosh for transporting Mac files safely
       through electronic mail, as short-lined, 7-bit, semi-compressed data
       streams.  Ths module provides a means of converting those data streams
       back into into binary data.

FORMAT
       (Some text taken from RFC-1741.)  Files on the Macintosh consist of two
       parts, called forks:

       Data fork
           The actual data included in the file.  The Data fork is typically the
           only meaningful part of a Macintosh file on a non-Macintosh computer
           system.  For example, if a Macintosh user wants to send a file of
           data to a user on an IBM-PC, she would only send the Data fork.

       Resource fork
           Contains a collection of arbitrary attribute/value pairs, including
           program segments, icon bitmaps, and parametric values.

       Additional information regarding Macintosh files is stored by the Finder
       in a hidden file, called the &quot;Desktop Database&quot;.

       Because of the complications in storing different parts of a Macintosh
       file in a non-Macintosh filesystem that only handles consecutive data in
       one part, it is common to convert the Macintosh file into some other for&#8208;
       mat before transferring it over the network.  The BinHex format squashes
       that data into transmittable ASCII as follows:

       1.  The file is output as a byte stream consisting of some basic header
           information (filename, type, creator), then the data fork, then the
           resource fork.

       2.  The byte stream is compressed by looking for series of duplicated
           bytes and representing them using a special binary escape sequence
           (of course, any occurences of the escape character must also be
           escaped).

       3.  The compressed stream is encoded via the &quot;6/8 hemiola&quot; common to
           base64 and uuencode: each group of three 8-bit bytes (24 bits) is
           chopped into four 6-bit numbers, which are used as indexes into an
           ASCII &quot;alphabet&quot;.  (I assume that leftover bytes are zero-padded;
           documentation is thin).

FUNCTIONS
       CRC computation

       macbinary_crc DATA, SEED
           Compute the MacBinary-II-style CRC for the given DATA, with the CRC
           seeded to SEED.  Normally, you start with a SEED of 0, and you pump
           in the previous CRC as the SEED if you&apos;re handling a lot of data one
           chunk at a time.  That is:

               $crc = 0;
               while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
                   $crc = macbinary_crc($_, $crc);
               }
&#12;           Note: Extracted from the mcvert utility (Doug Moore, April &apos;87),
           using a &quot;magic array&quot; algorithm by Jim Van Verth for efficiency.
           Converted to Perl5 by Eryq.  Untested.

       binhex_crc DATA, SEED
           Compute the HQX-style CRC for the given DATA, with the CRC seeded to
           SEED.  Normally, you start with a SEED of 0, and you pump in the pre&#8208;
           vious CRC as the SEED if you&apos;re handling a lot of data one chunk at a
           time.  That is:

               $crc = 0;
               while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
                   $crc = binhex_crc($_, $crc);
               }

OO INTERFACE
       Conversion

       bin2hex
           Class method, constructor.  Return a converter object.  Just creates
           a new instance of &quot;Convert::BinHex::Bin2Hex&quot;; see that class for
           details.

       hex2bin
           Class method, constructor.  Return a converter object.  Just creates
           a new instance of &quot;Convert::BinHex::Hex2Bin&quot;; see that class for
           details.

       Construction

       new PARAMHASH
           Class method, constructor.  Return a handle on a BinHex&apos;able entity.
           In general, the data and resource forks for such an entity are stored
           in native format (binary) format.

           Parameters in the PARAMHASH are the same as header-oriented method
           names, and may be used to set attributes:

               $HQX = new Convert::BinHex filename =&gt; &quot;icon.gif&quot;,
                                          type    =&gt; &quot;GIFB&quot;,
                                          creator =&gt; &quot;CNVS&quot;;

       open PARAMHASH
           Class method, constructor.  Return a handle on a new BinHex&apos;ed
           stream, for parsing.  Params are:

           Data
               Input a HEX stream from the given data.  This can be a scalar, or
               a reference to an array of scalars.

           Expr
               Input a HEX stream from any open()able expression.  It will be
               opened and binmode&apos;d, and the filehandle will be closed either on
               a &quot;close()&quot; or when the object is destructed.

           FH  Input a HEX stream from the given filehandle.

           NoComment
               If true, the parser should not attempt to skip a leading &quot;(This
               file...)&quot;  comment.  That means that the first nonwhite charac&#8208;
               ters encountered must be the binhex&apos;ed data.

       Get/set header information

       creator [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the creator of the file.  This is a four-
           character string (though I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s guaranteed to be print&#8208;
           able ASCII!)  that serves as part of the Macintosh&apos;s version of a
           MIME &quot;content-type&quot;.

           For example, a document created by &quot;Canvas&quot; might have creator
           &quot;CNVS&quot;.

       data [PARAMHASH]
           Instance method.  Get/set the data fork.  Any arguments are passed
           into the new() method of &quot;Convert::BinHex::Fork&quot;.

       filename [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the name of the file.

       flags [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Return the flags, as an integer.  Use bitmasking to
           get as the values you need.

       header_as_string
           Return a stringified version of the header that you might use for
           logging/debugging purposes.  It looks like this:

               X-HQX-Software: BinHex 4.0 (Convert::BinHex 1.102)
               X-HQX-Filename: Something_new.eps
               X-HQX-Version: 0
               X-HQX-Type: EPSF
               X-HQX-Creator: ART5
               X-HQX-Data-Length: 49731
               X-HQX-Rsrc-Length: 23096

           As some of you might have guessed, this is RFC-822-style, and may be
           easily plunked down into the middle of a mail header, or split into
           lines, etc.

       requires [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the software version required to convert
           this file, as extracted from the comment that preceded the actual
           binhex&apos;ed data; e.g.:

               (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)

           In this case, after parsing in the comment, the code:

               $HQX-&gt;requires;

           would get back &quot;4.0&quot;.

       resource [PARAMHASH]
           Instance method.  Get/set the resource fork.  Any arguments are
           passed into the new() method of &quot;Convert::BinHex::Fork&quot;.

       type [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the type of the file.  This is a four-char&#8208;
           acter string (though I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s guaranteed to be printable
           ASCII!)  that serves as part of the Macintosh&apos;s version of a MIME
           &quot;content-type&quot;.

           For example, a GIF89a file might have type &quot;GF89&quot;.

       version [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the version, as an integer.

       Decode, high-level

       read_comment
           Instance method.  Skip past the opening comment in the file, which is
           of the form:

              (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)

           As per RFC-1741, this comment must immediately precede the BinHex
           data, and any text before it will be ignored.

           You don&apos;t need to invoke this method yourself; &quot;read_header()&quot; will
           do it for you.  After the call, the version number in the comment is
           accessible via the &quot;requires()&quot; method.

       read_header
           Instance method.  Read in the BinHex file header.  You must do this
           first!

       read_data [NBYTES]
           Instance method.  Read information from the data fork.  Use it in an
           array context to slurp all the data into an array of scalars:

               @data = $HQX-&gt;read_data;

           Or use it in a scalar context to get the data piecemeal:

               while (defined($data = $HQX-&gt;read_data)) {
                  # do stuff with $data
               }

           The NBYTES to read defaults to 2048.

       read_resource [NBYTES]
           Instance method.  Read in all/some of the resource fork.  See
           &quot;read_data()&quot; for usage.

       Encode, high-level

       encode OUT
           Encode the object as a BinHex stream to the given output handle OUT.
           OUT can be a filehandle, or any blessed object that responds to a
           &quot;print()&quot; message.

           The leading comment is output, using the &quot;requires()&quot; attribute.

SUBMODULES
       Convert::BinHex::Bin2Hex

       A BINary-to-HEX converter.  This kind of conversion requires a certain
       amount of state information; it cannot be done by just calling a simple
       function repeatedly.  Use it like this:

           # Create and use a &quot;translator&quot; object:
           my $B2H = Convert::BinHex-&gt;bin2hex;    # get a converter object
           while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
               print STDOUT $B2H-&gt;next($_);          # convert some more input
           }
           print STDOUT $B2H-&gt;done;               # no more input: finish up

           # Re-use the object:
           $B2H-&gt;rewind;                 # ready for more action!
           while (&lt;MOREIN&gt;) { ...

       On each iteration, &quot;next()&quot; (and &quot;done()&quot;) may return either a decent-
       sized non-empty string (indicating that more converted data is ready for
       you) or an empty string (indicating that the converter is waiting to
       amass more input in its private buffers before handing you more stuff to
       output.

       Note that &quot;done()&quot; always converts and hands you whatever is left.

       This may have been a good approach.  It may not.  Someday, the converter
       may also allow you give it an object that responds to read(), or a File&#8208;
       Handle, and it will do all the nasty buffer-filling on its own, serving
       you stuff line by line:

           # Someday, maybe...
           my $B2H = Convert::BinHex-&gt;bin2hex(\*STDIN);
           while (defined($_ = $B2H-&gt;getline)) {
               print STDOUT $_;
           }
&#12;       Someday, maybe.  Feel free to voice your opinions.

       Convert::BinHex::Hex2Bin

       A HEX-to-BINary converter. This kind of conversion requires a certain
       amount of state information; it cannot be done by just calling a simple
       function repeatedly.  Use it like this:

           # Create and use a &quot;translator&quot; object:
           my $H2B = Convert::BinHex-&gt;hex2bin;    # get a converter object
           while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
               print STDOUT $H2B-&gt;next($_);          # convert some more input
           }
           print STDOUT $H2B-&gt;done;               # no more input: finish up

           # Re-use the object:
           $H2B-&gt;rewind;                 # ready for more action!
           while (&lt;MOREIN&gt;) { ...

       On each iteration, &quot;next()&quot; (and &quot;done()&quot;) may return either a decent-
       sized non-empty string (indicating that more converted data is ready for
       you) or an empty string (indicating that the converter is waiting to
       amass more input in its private buffers before handing you more stuff to
       output.

       Note that &quot;done()&quot; always converts and hands you whatever is left.

       Note that this converter does not find the initial &quot;BinHex version&quot; com&#8208;
       ment.  You have to skip that yourself.  It only handles data between the
       opening and closing &quot;:&quot;.

       Convert::BinHex::Fork

       A fork in a Macintosh file.

           # How to get them...
           $data_fork = $HQX-&gt;data;      # get the data fork
           $rsrc_fork = $HQX-&gt;resource;  # get the resource fork

           # Make a new fork:
           $FORK = Convert::BinHex::Fork-&gt;new(Path =&gt; &quot;/tmp/file.data&quot;);
           $FORK = Convert::BinHex::Fork-&gt;new(Data =&gt; $scalar);
           $FORK = Convert::BinHex::Fork-&gt;new(Data =&gt; \@array_of_scalars);

           # Get/set the length of the data fork:
           $len = $FORK-&gt;length;
           $FORK-&gt;length(170);        # this overrides the REAL value: be careful!

           # Get/set the path to the underlying data (if in a disk file):
           $path = $FORK-&gt;path;
           $FORK-&gt;path(&quot;/tmp/file.data&quot;);

           # Get/set the in-core data itself, which may be a scalar or an arrayref:
           $data = $FORK-&gt;data;
           $FORK-&gt;data($scalar);
           $FORK-&gt;data(\@array_of_scalars);

           # Get/set the CRC:
           $crc = $FORK-&gt;crc;
           $FORK-&gt;crc($crc);

UNDER THE HOOD
       Design issues

       BinHex needs a stateful parser
           Unlike its cousins base64 and uuencode, BinHex format is not amenable
           to being parsed line-by-line.  There appears to be no guarantee that
           lines contain 4n encoded characters... and even if there is one, the
           BinHex compression algorithm interferes: even when you can decode one
           line at a time, you can&apos;t necessarily decompress a line at a time.

           For example: a decoded line ending with the byte &quot;\x90&quot; (the escape
           or &quot;mark&quot; character) is ambiguous: depending on the next decoded
           byte, it could mean a literal &quot;\x90&quot; (if the next byte is a &quot;\x00&quot;),
           or it could mean n-1 more repetitions of the previous character (if
           the next byte is some nonzero &quot;n&quot;).

           For this reason, a BinHex parser has to be somewhat stateful: you
           cannot have code like this:

               #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! #### NO! ####
               while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {            # read HEX
                   print hexbin($_);          # convert and write BIN
               }

           unless something is happening &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to keep track of
           what was last done.  The dangerous thing, however, is that this
           approach will seem to work, if you only test it on BinHex files which
           do not use compression and which have 4n HEX characters on each line.

           Since we have to be stateful anyway, we use the parser object to keep
           our state.

       We need to be handle large input files
           Solutions that demand reading everything into core don&apos;t cut it in my
           book.  The first MPEG file that comes along can louse up your whole
           day.  So, there are no size limitations in this module: the data is
           read on-demand, and filehandles are always an option.

       Boy, is this slow!
           A lot of the byte-level manipulation that has to go on, particularly
           the CRC computing (which involves intensive bit-shifting and masking)
           slows this module down significantly.  What is needed perhaps is an
           optional extension library where the slow pieces can be done more
           quickly... a Convert::BinHex::CRC, if you will.  Volunteers, anyone?

           Even considering that, however, it&apos;s slower than I&apos;d like.  I&apos;m sure
           many improvements can be made in the HEX-to-BIN end of things.  No
           doubt I&apos;ll attempt some as time goes on...

       How it works

       Since BinHex is a layered format, consisting of...

             A Macintosh file [the &quot;BIN&quot;]...
                Encoded as a structured 8-bit bytestream, then...
                   Compressed to reduce duplicate bytes, then...
                      Encoded as 7-bit ASCII [the &quot;HEX&quot;]

       ...there is a layered parsing algorithm to reverse the process.  Basi&#8208;
       cally, it works in a similar fashion to stdio&apos;s fread():

              0. There is an internal buffer of decompressed (BIN) data,
                 initially empty.
              1. Application asks to read() n bytes of data from object
              2. If the buffer is not full enough to accomodate the request:
                   2a. The read() method grabs the next available chunk of input
                       data (the HEX).
                   2b. HEX data is converted and decompressed into as many BIN
                       bytes as possible.
                   2c. BIN bytes are added to the read() buffer.
                   2d. Go back to step 2a. until the buffer is full enough
                       or we hit end-of-input.

       The conversion-and-decompression algorithms need their own internal buf&#8208;
       fers and state (since the next input chunk may not contain all the data
       needed for a complete conversion/decompression operation).  These are
       maintained in the object, so parsing two different input streams simulta&#8208;
       neously is possible.

WARNINGS
       Only handles &quot;Hqx7&quot; files, as per RFC-1741.

       Remember that Macintosh text files use &quot;\r&quot; as end-of-line: this means
       that if you want a textual file to look normal on a non-Mac system, you
       probably want to do this to the data:

           # Get the data, and output it according to normal conventions:
           foreach ($HQX-&gt;read_data) { s/\r/\n/g; print }

CHANGE LOG
       Current version: $Id: BinHex.pm,v 1.119 1997/06/28 05:12:42 eryq Exp $

       Version 1.118
           Ready to go public (with Paul&apos;s version, patched for native Mac sup&#8208;
           port)!  Warnings have been suppressed in a few places where undefined
           values appear.

       Version 1.115
           Fixed another bug in comp2bin, related to the MARK falling on a
           boundary between inputs.  Added testing code.

       Version 1.114
           Added BIN-to-HEX conversion.  Eh.  It&apos;s a start.  Also, a lot of doc&#8208;
           umentation additions and cleanups.  Some methods were also renamed.

       Version 1.103
           Fixed bug in decompression (wasn&apos;t saving last character).  Fixed
           &quot;NoComment&quot; bug.

       Version 1.102
           Initial release.
