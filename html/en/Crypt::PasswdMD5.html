NAME
       Crypt::PasswdMD5 - Provides interoperable MD5-based crypt() functions

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::PasswdMD5;

           $cryptedpassword = unix_md5_crypt($password, $salt);
           $apachepassword = apache_md5_crypt($password, $salt);

DESCRIPTION
       the &quot;unix_md5_crypt()&quot; provides a crypt()-compatible interface to the
       rather new MD5-based crypt() function found in modern operating systems.
       It&apos;s based on the implementation found on FreeBSD 2.2.[56]-RELEASE and
       contains the following license in it:

        &quot;THE BEER-WARE LICENSE&quot; (Revision 42):
        &lt;phk@login.dknet.dk&gt; wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
        can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
        this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp

       &quot;apache_md5_crypt()&quot; provides a function compatible with Apache&apos;s
       &quot;.htpasswd&quot; files. This was contributed by Bryan Hart &lt;bryan@eai.com&gt;.
       As suggested by William A. Rowe, Jr. &lt;wrowe@lnd.com&gt;, it is exported by
       default.

       For both functions, if a salt value is not supplied, a random salt will
       be generated.  Contributed by John Peacock &lt;jpeacock@cpan.org&gt;.

   EXPORT
       None by default.
