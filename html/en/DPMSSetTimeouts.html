NAME
       DPMSSetTimeouts  - permits applications to set the timeout values used by
       the X server for DPMS timings

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/dpms.h&gt;

       Status DPMSSetTimeouts
              (
                    Display *display,
                    CARD16 standby,
                    CARD16 suspend,
                    CARD16 off
              );

ARGUMENTS
       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server

       standby
              Specifies the new standby timeout in seconds

       suspend
              Specifies the new suspend timeout in seconds

       off    Specifies the new off timeout in seconds

DESCRIPTION
       The DPMSSetTimeouts function permits applications to set the timeout val&#8208;
       ues  used  by  the X server for Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS)
       timings.

       The value standby is the amount of inactivity time,  in  seconds,  before
       standby mode is invoked. The actual effects of this mode are dependent on
       the characteristics of the monitor and frame buffer card. Standby mode is
       implemented  by  shutting off the horizontal sync signal, and pulsing the
       vertical sync signal. Standby mode provides the quickest monitor recovery
       time.  Note also that many monitors implement this mode identical to sus&#8208;
       pend mode.  A value of zero disables the standby mode.

       The value suspend is the amount of time of inactivity, in seconds, before
       the second level of power savings is invoked. Suspend mode&apos;s physical and
       electrical characteristics are implementation defined. For DPMS compliant
       hardware, setting the suspend mode is implemented by pulsing the horizon&#8208;
       tal sync signal and shutting off the vertical sync signal.   In  general,
       suspend  mode  recovery is considered to be slower than standby mode, but
       faster than off mode. However it may vary from monitor  to  monitor.   As
       noted  above,  many monitors implement this mode identical to the standby
       mode.  A value of zero disables this mode.

       The value off is the amount of time of inactivity,in seconds, before  the
       third  and  final  level of power savings is invoked. Off mode&apos;s physical
       and electrical characteristics are implementation defined. In  DPMS  com&#8208;
       pliant  hardware,  it  is implemented by shutting off both horizontal and
       vertical sync signals, resulting in powering down of the monitor.  Recov&#8208;
       ery  time is implementation dependent.  Usually the recovery time is very
       close to the power-up time of the monitor. A value of zero disables  this
       mode.

       Chronologically,  standby  mode occurs before or simultaneously with sus&#8208;
       pend mode, and suspend mode must occur before or simultaneously with  off
       mode.   Therefore,  non-zero  mode timeout values must be greater than or
       equal to the timeout values of earlier modes.  If inconsistent values are
       supplied, a BadValue error will result.

RETURN VALUES
       TRUE           The  DPMSSetTimeouts  function returns TRUE when the func&#8208;
                      tion has succeeded.

ERRORS
       BadValue       An argument is out of range.
