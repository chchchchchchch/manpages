NAME
       Data::UUID - OSSP uuid Backward Compatibility Perl Binding

DESCRIPTION
       Data::UUID is the OSSP uuid backward compatibility Perl binding to the
       API of the original Data::UUID module. It allows other Data::UUID based
       Perl modules to run with OSSP::uuid without changes.

SEE ALSO
       OSSP::uuid.

HISTORY
       The backward compatibility Perl binding Data::UUID for OSSP uuid was
       originally implemented in 2004 by Piotr Roszatycki &lt;dexter@debian.org&gt;.
       It was later cleaned up and speed optimized in December 2005 by David
       Wheeler &lt;david@justatheory.com&gt;.
