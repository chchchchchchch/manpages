NAME
       Date::Format - Date formating subroutines

SYNOPSIS
               use Date::Format;

               @lt = localtime(time);

               print time2str($template, time);
               print strftime($template, @lt);

               print time2str($template, time, $zone);
               print strftime($template, @lt, $zone);

               print ctime(time);
               print asctime(@lt);

               print ctime(time, $zone);
               print asctime(@lt, $zone);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides routines to format dates into ASCII strings. They
       correspond to the C library routines &quot;strftime&quot; and &quot;ctime&quot;.

       time2str(TEMPLATE, TIME [, ZONE])
           &quot;time2str&quot; converts &quot;TIME&quot; into an ASCII string using the conversion
           specification given in &quot;TEMPLATE&quot;. &quot;ZONE&quot; if given specifies the zone
           which the output is required to be in, &quot;ZONE&quot; defaults to your
           current zone.

       strftime(TEMPLATE, TIME [, ZONE])
           &quot;strftime&quot; is similar to &quot;time2str&quot; with the exception that the time
           is passed as an array, such as the array returned by &quot;localtime&quot;.

       ctime(TIME [, ZONE])
           &quot;ctime&quot; calls &quot;time2str&quot; with the given arguments using the
           conversion specification &quot;%a %b %e %T %Y\n&quot;

       asctime(TIME [, ZONE])
           &quot;asctime&quot; calls &quot;time2str&quot; with the given arguments using the
           conversion specification &quot;%a %b %e %T %Y\n&quot;

MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT
       Date::Format is capable of formating into several languages by creating a
       language specific object and calling methods, see Date::Language

               my $lang = Date::Language-&gt;new(&apos;German&apos;);
               $lang-&gt;time2str(&quot;%a %b %e %T %Y\n&quot;, time);

       I am open to suggestions on this.

CONVERSION SPECIFICATION
       Each conversion specification  is  replaced  by  appropriate characters
       as   described  in  the  following  list.   The appropriate  characters
       are  determined  by   the   LC_TIME category of the program&apos;s locale.

               %%      PERCENT
               %a      day of the week abbr
               %A      day of the week
               %b      month abbr
               %B      month
               %c      MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS
               %C      ctime format: Sat Nov 19 21:05:57 1994
               %d      numeric day of the month, with leading zeros (eg 01..31)
               %e      like %d, but a leading zero is replaced by a space (eg  1..32)
               %D      MM/DD/YY
               %G      GPS week number (weeks since January 6, 1980)
               %h      month abbr
               %H      hour, 24 hour clock, leading 0&apos;s)
               %I      hour, 12 hour clock, leading 0&apos;s)
               %j      day of the year
               %k      hour
               %l      hour, 12 hour clock
               %L      month number, starting with 1
               %m      month number, starting with 01
               %M      minute, leading 0&apos;s
               %n      NEWLINE
               %o      ornate day of month -- &quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;25th&quot;, etc.
               %p      AM or PM
               %P      am or pm (Yes %p and %P are backwards :)
               %q      Quarter number, starting with 1
               %r      time format: 09:05:57 PM
               %R      time format: 21:05
               %s      seconds since the Epoch, UCT
               %S      seconds, leading 0&apos;s
               %t      TAB
               %T      time format: 21:05:57
               %U      week number, Sunday as first day of week
               %w      day of the week, numerically, Sunday == 0
               %W      week number, Monday as first day of week
               %x      date format: 11/19/94
               %X      time format: 21:05:57
               %y      year (2 digits)
               %Y      year (4 digits)
               %Z      timezone in ascii. eg: PST
               %z      timezone in format -/+0000

       %d, %e, %H, %I, %j, %k, %l, %m, %M, %q, %y and %Y can be output in Roman
       numerals by prefixing the letter with &quot;O&quot;, e.g. %OY will output the year
       as roman numerals.

LIMITATION
       The functions in this module are limited to the time range that can be
       represented by the time_t data type, i.e. 1901-12-13 20:45:53 GMT to
       2038-01-19 03:14:07 GMT.
