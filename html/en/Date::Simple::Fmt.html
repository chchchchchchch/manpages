NAME
       Date::Simple::Fmt - Sub class of Date::Simple with per object level
       formatting for overloaded stringification.

SYNOPSIS
           use Date::Simple::Fmt;

DESCRIPTION
       This module changes the default stringification behaviour of Date::Simple
       objects to use the format() method instead. It also changes the behaviour
       of the constructor.

       Date::Simple::Fmt-&gt;new (FMT, [ARG, ...])
       date_fmt (FMT, [ARG, ...])
           Follows the same rules as for the equivelent method (new) and
           subroutine (date) in Date::Simple except that the first argument is
           expected to be the default format for the newly created object.  It
           is this format that will be used when using overloaded
           stringification or when not providing a format argument to the
           format() method.
