SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime;

         $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year       =&gt; 1964,
             month      =&gt; 10,
             day        =&gt; 16,

         $dow    = $dt-&gt;day_of_week;    # 1-7 (Monday is 1)

         $hour   = $dt-&gt;hour;           # 0-23
         $minute = $dt-&gt;minute;         # 0-59

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations, and
       is part of the Perl DateTime project. For details on this project please
       see &lt;http://datetime.perl.org/&gt;. The DateTime site has a FAQ which may
       help answer many &quot;how do I do X?&quot; questions. The FAQ is at
       &lt;http://datetime.perl.org/wiki/datetime/page/FAQ&gt;.

       It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time before
       its creation (in 1582). This is sometimes known as the &quot;proleptic
       Gregorian calendar&quot;. In this calendar, the first day of the calendar (the
       epoch), is the first day of year 1, which corresponds to the date which
       was (incorrectly) believed to be the birth of Jesus Christ.

       The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs from
       how dates are often written using &quot;BCE/CE&quot; or &quot;BC/AD&quot;.

       For infinite datetimes, please see the DateTime::Infinite module.

USAGE
   0-based Versus 1-based Numbers
       The DateTime.pm module follows a simple consistent logic for determining
       whether or not a given number is 0-based or 1-based.

       Month, day of month, day of week, and day of year are 1-based. Any method
       that is 1-based also has an equivalent 0-based method ending in &quot;_0&quot;. So
       for example, this class provides both &quot;day_of_week()&quot; and
       &quot;day_of_week_0()&quot; methods.

       The &quot;day_of_week_0()&quot; method still treats Monday as the first day of the
       week.

       All time-related numbers such as hour, minute, and second are 0-based.

       Years are neither, as they can be both positive or negative, unlike any
       other datetime component. There is a year 0.

       There is no &quot;quarter_0()&quot; method.

   Error Handling
       Some errors may cause this module to die with an error string. This can
       only happen when calling constructor methods, methods that change the
       object, such as &quot;set()&quot;, or methods that take parameters.  Methods that
       retrieve information about the object, such as &quot;year()&quot; or &quot;epoch()&quot;,
       will never die.

   Locales
       All the object methods which return names or abbreviations return data
       based on a locale. This is done by setting the locale when constructing a
       DateTime object. There is also a &quot;DefaultLocale()&quot; class method which may
       be used to set the default locale for all DateTime objects created. If
       this is not set, then &quot;en_US&quot; is used.

   Floating DateTimes
       The default time zone for new DateTime objects, except where stated
       otherwise, is the &quot;floating&quot; time zone. This concept comes from the iCal
       standard. A floating datetime is one which is not anchored to any
       particular time zone. In addition, floating datetimes do not include leap
       seconds, since we cannot apply them without knowing the datetime&apos;s time
       zone.

       The results of date math and comparison between a floating datetime and
       one with a real time zone are not really valid, because one includes leap
       seconds and the other does not. Similarly, the results of datetime math
       between two floating datetimes and two datetimes with time zones are not
       really comparable.

       If you are planning to use any objects with a real time zone, it is
       strongly recommended that you do not mix these with floating datetimes.

   Math
       If you are going to be using doing date math, please read the section
       &quot;How DateTime Math Works&quot;.

   Time Zone Warnings
       Determining the local time zone for a system can be slow. If $ENV{TZ} is
       not set, it may involve reading a number of files in /etc or elsewhere.
       If you know that the local time zone won&apos;t change while your code is
       running, and you need to make many objects for the local time zone, it is
       strongly recommended that you retrieve the local time zone once and cache
       it:

         our $App::LocalTZ = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; &apos;local&apos; );

         ... # then everywhere else

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( ..., time_zone =&gt; $App::LocalTZ );

       DateTime itself does not do this internally because local time zones can
       change, and there&apos;s no good way to determine if it&apos;s changed without
       doing all the work to look it up.

       Do not try to use named time zones (like &quot;America/Chicago&quot;) with dates
       very far in the future (thousands of years). The current implementation
       of &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot; will use a huge amount of memory calculating all
       the DST changes from now until the future date. Use UTC or the floating
       time zone and you will be safe.

   Methods
       Constructors

       All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;new( ... )

           This class method accepts parameters for each date and time
           component: &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, &quot;second&quot;,
           &quot;nanosecond&quot;.  It also accepts &quot;locale&quot;, &quot;time_zone&quot;, and &quot;formatter&quot;
           parameters.

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
                 year       =&gt; 1966,
                 month      =&gt; 10,
                 day        =&gt; 25,
                 hour       =&gt; 7,
                 minute     =&gt; 15,
                 second     =&gt; 47,
                 nanosecond =&gt; 500000000,
                 time_zone  =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
             );
&#12;           DateTime validates the &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, and
           &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;nanosecond&quot; parameters. The valid values for these
           parameters are:

           &#183;       month

                   An integer from 1-12.

           &#183;       day

                   An integer from 1-31, and it must be within the valid range
                   of days for the specified month.

           &#183;       hour

                   An integer from 0-23.

           &#183;       minute

                   An integer from 0-59.

           &#183;       second

                   An integer from 0-61 (to allow for leap seconds). Values of
                   60 or 61 are only allowed when they match actual leap
                   seconds.

           &#183;       nanosecond

                   An integer &gt;= 0. If this number is greater than 1 billion, it
                   will be normalized into the second value for the DateTime
                   object.

           Invalid parameter types (like an array reference) will cause the
           constructor to die.

           The value for seconds may be from 0 to 61, to account for leap
           seconds. If you give a value greater than 59, DateTime does check to
           see that it really matches a valid leap second.

           All of the parameters are optional except for &quot;year&quot;. The &quot;month&quot; and
           &quot;day&quot; parameters both default to 1, while the &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;,
           &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;nanosecond&quot; parameters all default to 0.

           The &quot;locale&quot; parameter should be a string matching one of the valid
           locales, or a &quot;DateTime::Locale&quot; object. See the DateTime::Locale
           documentation for details.

           The time_zone parameter can be either a scalar or a
           &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot; object. A string will simply be passed to the
           &quot;DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new&quot; method as its &quot;name&quot; parameter. This string
           may be an Olson DB time zone name (&quot;America/Chicago&quot;), an offset
           string (&quot;+0630&quot;), or the words &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;local&quot;. See the
           &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot; documentation for more details.

           The default time zone is &quot;floating&quot;.

           The &quot;formatter&quot; can be either a scalar or an object, but the class
           specified by the scalar or the object must implement a
           &quot;format_datetime()&quot; method.

       Parsing Dates

       This module does not parse dates! That means there is no constructor to
       which you can pass things like &quot;March 3, 1970 12:34&quot;.

       Instead, take a look at the various &quot;DateTime::Format::*&quot; modules on
       CPAN. These parse all sorts of different date formats, and you&apos;re bound
       to find something that can handle your particular needs.

       Ambiguous Local Times
&#12;       Because of Daylight Saving Time, it is possible to specify a local time
       that is ambiguous. For example, in the US in 2003, the transition from to
       saving to standard time occurred on October 26, at 02:00:00 local time.
       The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (saving time) to 01:00:00 (standard
       time). This means that the hour from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 actually
       occurs twice, though the UTC time continues to move forward.

       If you specify an ambiguous time, then the latest UTC time is always
       used, in effect always choosing standard time. In this case, you can
       simply subtract an hour to the object in order to move to saving time,
       for example:

         # This object represent 01:30:00 standard time
         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 10,
             day       =&gt; 26,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             minute    =&gt; 30,
             second    =&gt; 0,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         print $dt-&gt;hms;  # prints 01:30:00

         # Now the object represent 01:30:00 saving time
         $dt-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

         print $dt-&gt;hms;  # still prints 01:30:00

       Alternately, you could create the object with the UTC time zone, and then
       call the &quot;set_time_zone()&quot; method to change the time zone. This is a good
       way to ensure that the time is not ambiguous.

       Invalid Local Times

       Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain local
       times just do not exist. For example, in the US in 2003, the transition
       from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the change to
       2:00:00 local time. The local clock changes from 01:59:59 (standard time)
       to 03:00:00 (saving time). This means that there is no 02:00:00 through
       02:59:59 on April 6!

       Attempting to create an invalid time currently causes a fatal error.
       This may change in future version of this module.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;from_epoch( epoch =&gt; $epoch, ... )

           This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
           an epoch time instead of components. Just as with the &quot;new()&quot; method,
           it accepts &quot;time_zone&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;, and &quot;formatter&quot; parameters.

           If the epoch value is not an integer, the part after the decimal will
           be converted to nanoseconds. This is done in order to be compatible
           with &quot;Time::HiRes&quot;. If the floating portion extends past 9 decimal
           places, it will be truncated to nine, so that 1.1234567891 will
           become 1 second and 123,456,789 nanoseconds.

           By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;now( ... )

           This class method is equivalent to calling &quot;from_epoch()&quot; with the
           value returned from Perl&apos;s &quot;time()&quot; function. Just as with the
           &quot;new()&quot; method, it accepts &quot;time_zone&quot; and &quot;locale&quot; parameters.

           By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;today( ... )

           This class method is equivalent to:
&#12;             DateTime-&gt;now-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; &apos;day&apos; );

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;from_object( object =&gt; $object, ... )

           This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
           any object that implements the &quot;utc_rd_values()&quot; method. All
           &quot;DateTime::Calendar&quot; modules must implement this method in order to
           provide cross-calendar compatibility. This method accepts a &quot;locale&quot;
           and &quot;formatter&quot; parameter

           If the object passed to this method has a &quot;time_zone()&quot; method, that
           is used to set the time zone of the newly created &quot;DateTime.pm&quot;
           object.

           Otherwise, the returned object will be in the floating time zone.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;last_day_of_month( ... )

           This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
           &quot;new()&quot; method, except for &quot;day&quot;. Additionally, both &quot;year&quot; and
           &quot;month&quot; are required.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;from_day_of_year( ... )

           This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
           &quot;new()&quot; method, except that it does not accept a &quot;month&quot; or &quot;day&quot;
           argument. Instead, it requires both &quot;year&quot; and &quot;day_of_year&quot;. The day
           of year must be between 1 and 366, and 366 is only allowed for leap
           years.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;clone()

           This object method returns a new object that is replica of the object
           upon which the method is called.

       &quot;Get&quot; Methods

       This class has many methods for retrieving information about an object.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;year()

           Returns the year.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;ce_year()

           Returns the year according to the BCE/CE numbering system. The year
           before year 1 in this system is year -1, aka &quot;1 BCE&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;era_name()

           Returns the long name of the current era, something like &quot;Before
           Christ&quot;. See the Locales section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;era_abbr()

           Returns the abbreviated name of the current era, something like &quot;BC&quot;.
           See the Locales section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;christian_era()

           Returns a string, either &quot;BC&quot; or &quot;AD&quot;, according to the year.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;secular_era()

           Returns a string, either &quot;BCE&quot; or &quot;CE&quot;, according to the year.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;year_with_era()

           Returns a string containing the year immediately followed by its era
           abbreviation. The year is the absolute value of &quot;ce_year()&quot;, so that
           year 1 is &quot;1AD&quot; and year 0 is &quot;1BC&quot;.
&#12;       &#183;   $dt-&gt;year_with_christian_era()

           Like &quot;year_with_era()&quot;, but uses the christian_era() method to get
           the era name.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;year_with_secular_era()

           Like &quot;year_with_era()&quot;, but uses the secular_era() method to get the
           era name.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;month()

           Returns the month of the year, from 1..12.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;mon()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;month_name()

           Returns the name of the current month. See the Locales section for
           more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;month_abbr()

           Returns the abbreviated name of the current month. See the Locales
           section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day()

           Returns the day of the month, from 1..31.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;mday()&quot; and &quot;$dt-&gt;day_of_month()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day_of_week()

           Returns the day of the week as a number, from 1..7, with 1 being
           Monday and 7 being Sunday.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;wday()&quot; and &quot;$dt-&gt;dow()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;local_day_of_week()

           Returns the day of the week as a number, from 1..7. The day
           corresponding to 1 will vary based on the locale.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day_name()

           Returns the name of the current day of the week. See the Locales
           section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day_abbr()

           Returns the abbreviated name of the current day of the week. See the
           Locales section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day_of_year()

           Returns the day of the year.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;doy()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;quarter()

           Returns the quarter of the year, from 1..4.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;quarter_name()

           Returns the name of the current quarter. See the Locales section for
           more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;quarter_abbr()

           Returns the abbreviated name of the current quarter. See the Locales
           section for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;day_of_quarter()

           Returns the day of the quarter.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;doq()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;weekday_of_month()

           Returns a number from 1..5 indicating which week day of the month
           this is. For example, June 9, 2003 is the second Monday of the month,
           and so this method returns 2 for that day.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;ymd( $optional_separator )

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;mdy( $optional_separator )

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;dmy( $optional_separator )

           Each method returns the year, month, and day, in the order indicated
           by the method name. Years are zero-padded to four digits. Months and
           days are 0-padded to two digits.

           By default, the values are separated by a dash (-), but this can be
           overridden by passing a value to the method.

           The &quot;$dt-&gt;ymd()&quot; method is also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;date()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hour()

           Returns the hour of the day, from 0..23.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hour_1()

           Returns the hour of the day, from 1..24.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hour_12()

           Returns the hour of the day, from 1..12.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hour_12_0()

           Returns the hour of the day, from 0..11.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;am_or_pm()

           Returns the appropriate localized abbreviation, depending on the
           current hour.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;minute()

           Returns the minute of the hour, from 0..59.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;min()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;second()

           Returns the second, from 0..61. The values 60 and 61 are used for
           leap seconds.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;sec()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;fractional_second()

           Returns the second, as a real number from 0.0 until 61.999999999

           The values 60 and 61 are used for leap seconds.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;millisecond()

           Returns the fractional part of the second as milliseconds (1E-3
           seconds).

           Half a second is 500 milliseconds.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;microsecond()

           Returns the fractional part of the second as microseconds (1E-6
           seconds). This value will be rounded to an integer.

           Half a second is 500_000 microseconds. This value will be rounded to
           an integer.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;nanosecond()

           Returns the fractional part of the second as nanoseconds (1E-9
           seconds).

           Half a second is 500_000_000 nanoseconds.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hms( $optional_separator )

           Returns the hour, minute, and second, all zero-padded to two digits.
           If no separator is specified, a colon (:) is used by default.

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;time()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;datetime()

           This method is equivalent to:

             $dt-&gt;ymd(&apos;-&apos;) . &apos;T&apos; . $dt-&gt;hms(&apos;:&apos;)

           Also available as &quot;$dt-&gt;iso8601()&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;is_leap_year()

           This method returns a true or false indicating whether or not the
           datetime object is in a leap year.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;week()

            ($week_year, $week_number) = $dt-&gt;week;

           Returns information about the calendar week which contains this
           datetime object. The values returned by this method are also
           available separately through the week_year and week_number methods.

           The first week of the year is defined by ISO as the one which
           contains the fourth day of January, which is equivalent to saying
           that it&apos;s the first week to overlap the new year by at least four
           days.

           Typically the week year will be the same as the year that the object
           is in, but dates at the very beginning of a calendar year often end
           up in the last week of the prior year, and similarly, the final few
           days of the year may be placed in the first week of the next year.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;week_year()

           Returns the year of the week. See &quot;$dt-&gt;week()&quot; for details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;week_number()

           Returns the week of the year, from 1..53. See &quot;$dt-&gt;week()&quot; for
           details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;week_of_month()

           The week of the month, from 0..5. The first week of the month is the
           first week that contains a Thursday. This is based on the ICU
           definition of week of month, and correlates to the ISO8601 week of
           year definition. A day in the week before the week with the first
           Thursday will be week 0.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;jd()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;mjd()

           These return the Julian Day and Modified Julian Day, respectively.
           The value returned is a floating point number. The fractional portion
           of the number represents the time portion of the datetime.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;time_zone()

           This returns the &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot; object for the datetime object.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;offset()

           This returns the offset from UTC, in seconds, of the datetime object
           according to the time zone.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;is_dst()

           Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the datetime object is
           currently in Daylight Saving Time or not.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;time_zone_long_name()

           This is a shortcut for &quot;$dt-&gt;time_zone-&gt;name&quot;. It&apos;s provided so that
           one can use &quot;%{time_zone_long_name}&quot; as a strftime format specifier.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;time_zone_short_name()

           This method returns the time zone abbreviation for the current time
           zone, such as &quot;PST&quot; or &quot;GMT&quot;. These names are not definitive, and
           should not be used in any application intended for general use by
           users around the world.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;strftime( $format, ... )

           This method implements functionality similar to the &quot;strftime()&quot;
           method in C. However, if given multiple format strings, then it will
           return multiple scalars, one for each format string.

           See the &quot;strftime Patterns&quot; section for a list of all possible
           strftime patterns.

           If you give a pattern that doesn&apos;t exist, then it is simply treated
           as text.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;format_cldr( $format, ... )

           This method implements formatting based on the CLDR date patterns. If
           given multiple format strings, then it will return multiple scalars,
           one for each format string.

           See the &quot;CLDR Patterns&quot; section for a list of all possible CLDR
           patterns.

           If you give a pattern that doesn&apos;t exist, then it is simply treated
           as text.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;epoch()

           Return the UTC epoch value for the datetime object. Internally, this
           is implemented using &quot;Time::Local&quot;, which uses the Unix epoch even on
           machines with a different epoch (such as MacOS). Datetimes before the
           start of the epoch will be returned as a negative number.

           The return value from this method is always an integer.

           Since the epoch does not account for leap seconds, the epoch time for
           1972-12-31T23:59:60 (UTC) is exactly the same as that for
           1973-01-01T00:00:00.

           This module uses &quot;Time::Local&quot; to calculate the epoch, which may or
           may not handle epochs before 1904 or after 2038 (depending on the
           size of your system&apos;s integers, and whether or not Perl was compiled
           with 64-bit int support).

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;hires_epoch()

           Returns the epoch as a floating point number. The floating point
           portion of the value represents the nanosecond value of the object.
           This method is provided for compatibility with the &quot;Time::HiRes&quot;
           module.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;is_finite()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;is_infinite()

           These methods allow you to distinguish normal datetime objects from
           infinite ones. Infinite datetime objects are documented in
           DateTime::Infinite.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;utc_rd_values()

           Returns the current UTC Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as a
           three element list. This exists primarily to allow other calendar
           modules to create objects based on the values provided by this
           object.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;local_rd_values()

           Returns the current local Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as
           a three element list. This exists for the benefit of other modules
           which might want to use this information for date math, such as
           &quot;DateTime::Event::Recurrence&quot;.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;leap_seconds()

           Returns the number of leap seconds that have happened up to the
           datetime represented by the object. For floating datetimes, this
           always returns 0.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;utc_rd_as_seconds()

           Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds purely as seconds.
           This number ignores any fractional seconds stored in the object, as
           well as leap seconds.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;locale()

           Returns the current locale object.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;formatter()

           Returns current formatter object or class. See &quot;Formatters And
           Stringification&quot; for details.

       &quot;Set&quot; Methods

       The remaining methods provided by &quot;DateTime.pm&quot;, except where otherwise
       specified, return the object itself, thus making method chaining
       possible. For example:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now-&gt;set_time_zone( &apos;Australia/Sydney&apos; );

         my $first = DateTime
                       -&gt;last_day_of_month( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 3 )
                       -&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 )
                       -&gt;subtract( seconds =&gt; 1 );

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set( .. )

           This method can be used to change the local components of a date
           time, or its locale. This method accepts any parameter allowed by the
           &quot;new()&quot; method except for &quot;time_zone&quot;. Time zones may be set using
           the &quot;set_time_zone()&quot; method.

           This method performs parameters validation just as is done in the
           &quot;new()&quot; method.

           Do not use this method to do date math. Use the &quot;add()&quot; and
           &quot;subtract()&quot; methods instead.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_year()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_month()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_day()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_hour()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_minute()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_second()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_nanosecond()

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_locale()

           These are shortcuts to calling &quot;set()&quot; with a single key. They all
           take a single parameter.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; ... )

           This method allows you to reset some of the local time components in
           the object to their &quot;zero&quot; values. The &quot;to&quot; parameter is used to
           specify which values to truncate, and it may be one of &quot;year&quot;,
           &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, or &quot;second&quot;. For example,
           if &quot;month&quot; is specified, then the local day becomes 1, and the hour,
           minute, and second all become 0.

           If &quot;week&quot; is given, then the datetime is set to the beginning of the
           week in which it occurs, and the time components are all set to 0.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_time_zone( $tz )

           This method accepts either a time zone object or a string that can be
           passed as the &quot;name&quot; parameter to &quot;DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new()&quot;.  If
           the new time zone&apos;s offset is different from the old time zone, then
           the local time is adjusted accordingly.

           For example:

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
                 year      =&gt; 2000,
                 month     =&gt; 5,
                 day       =&gt; 10,
                 hour      =&gt; 15,
                 minute    =&gt; 15,
                 time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Los_Angeles&apos;,
             );

             print $dt-&gt;hour; # prints 15

             $dt-&gt;set_time_zone( &apos;America/Chicago&apos; );

             print $dt-&gt;hour; # prints 17

           If the old time zone was a floating time zone, then no adjustments to
           the local time are made, except to account for leap seconds. If the
           new time zone is floating, then the UTC time is adjusted in order to
           leave the local time untouched.

           Fans of Tsai Ming-Liang&apos;s films will be happy to know that this does
           work:

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;Asia/Taipei&apos; );

             $dt-&gt;set_time_zone( &apos;Europe/Paris&apos; );

           Yes, now we can know &quot;ni3 na4 bian1 ji2dian3?&quot;

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;set_formatter( $formatter )

           Set the formatter for the object. See &quot;Formatters And
           Stringification&quot; for details.

           You can set this to &quot;undef&quot; to revert to the default formatter.

       Math Methods

       Like the set methods, math related methods always return the object
       itself, to allow for chaining:

         $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 )-&gt;subtract( seconds =&gt; 1 );

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;duration_class()

           This returns &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot;, but exists so that a subclass of
           &quot;DateTime.pm&quot; can provide a different value.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;add_duration( $duration_object )

           This method adds a &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; to the current datetime. See
           the DateTime::Duration docs for more details.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;add( DateTime::Duration-&gt;new parameters )

           This method is syntactic sugar around the &quot;add_duration()&quot; method. It
           simply creates a new &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; object using the parameters
           given, and then calls the &quot;add_duration()&quot; method.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;subtract_duration( $duration_object )

           When given a &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; object, this method simply calls
           &quot;invert()&quot; on that object and passes that new duration to the
           &quot;add_duration&quot; method.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;subtract( DateTime::Duration-&gt;new parameters )

           Like &quot;add()&quot;, this is syntactic sugar for the &quot;subtract_duration()&quot;
           method.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;subtract_datetime( $datetime )

           This method returns a new &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; object representing
           the difference between the two dates. The duration is relative to the
           object from which $datetime is subtracted. For example:

               2003-03-15 00:00:00.00000000
            -  2003-02-15 00:00:00.00000000
            -------------------------------
            = 1 month

           Note that this duration is not an absolute measure of the amount of
           time between the two datetimes, because the length of a month varies,
           as well as due to the presence of leap seconds.

           The returned duration may have deltas for months, days, minutes,
           seconds, and nanoseconds.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;delta_md( $datetime )

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;delta_days( $datetime )

           Each of these methods returns a new &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; object
           representing some portion of the difference between two datetimes.
           The &quot;delta_md()&quot; method returns a duration which contains only the
           month and day portions of the duration is represented. The
           &quot;delta_days()&quot; method returns a duration which contains only days.

           The &quot;delta_md&quot; and &quot;delta_days&quot; methods truncate the duration so that
           any fractional portion of a day is ignored. Both of these methods
           operate on the date portion of a datetime only, and so effectively
           ignore the time zone.

           Unlike the subtraction methods, these methods always return a
           positive (or zero) duration.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;delta_ms( $datetime )

           Returns a duration which contains only minutes and seconds. Any day
           and month differences to minutes are converted to minutes and
           seconds. This method also always return a positive (or zero)
           duration.

       &#183;   $dt-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute( $datetime )

           This method returns a new &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot; object representing
           the difference between the two dates in seconds and nanoseconds. This
           is the only way to accurately measure the absolute amount of time
           between two datetimes, since units larger than a second do not
           represent a fixed number of seconds.

       Class Methods

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;DefaultLocale( $locale )

           This can be used to specify the default locale to be used when
           creating DateTime objects. If unset, then &quot;en_US&quot; is used.

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;compare( $dt1, $dt2 )

       &#183;   DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating( $dt1, $dt2 )

             $cmp = DateTime-&gt;compare( $dt1, $dt2 );

             $cmp = DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating( $dt1, $dt2 );

           Compare two DateTime objects. The semantics are compatible with
           Perl&apos;s &quot;sort()&quot; function; it returns -1 if $dt1 &lt; $dt2, 0 if $dt1 ==
           $dt2, 1 if $dt1 &gt; $dt2.

           If one of the two DateTime objects has a floating time zone, it will
           first be converted to the time zone of the other object. This is what
           you want most of the time, but it can lead to inconsistent results
           when you compare a number of DateTime objects, some of which are
           floating, and some of which are in other time zones.

           If you want to have consistent results (because you want to sort a
           number of objects, for example), you can use the
           &quot;compare_ignore_floating()&quot; method:

             @dates = sort { DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating($a, $b) } @dates;

           In this case, objects with a floating time zone will be sorted as if
           they were UTC times.

           Since DateTime objects overload comparison operators, this:

             @dates = sort @dates;

           is equivalent to this:

             @dates = sort { DateTime-&gt;compare($a, $b) } @dates;

           DateTime objects can be compared to any other calendar class that
           implements the &quot;utc_rd_values()&quot; method.
&#12;   How DateTime Math Works
       It&apos;s important to have some understanding of how datetime math is
       implemented in order to effectively use this module and
       &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot;.

       Making Things Simple

       If you want to simplify your life and not have to think too hard about
       the nitty-gritty of datetime math, I have several recommendations:

       &#183;   use the floating time zone

           If you do not care about time zones or leap seconds, use the
           &quot;floating&quot; timezone:

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;floating&apos; );

           Math done on two objects in the floating time zone produces very
           predictable results.

           Note that in most cases you will want to start by creating an object
           in a specific zone and then convert it to the floating time zone.
           When an object goes from a real zone to the floating zone, the time
           for the object remains the same.

           This means that passing the floating zone to a constructor may not do
           what you want.

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;floating&apos; );

           is equivalent to

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;UTC&apos; )-&gt;set_time_zone(&apos;floating&apos;);

           This might not be what you wanted. Instead, you may prefer to do
           this:

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;local&apos; )-&gt;set_time_zone(&apos;floating&apos;);

       &#183;   use UTC for all calculations

           If you do care about time zones (particularly DST) or leap seconds,
           try to use non-UTC time zones for presentation and user input only.
           Convert to UTC immediately and convert back to the local time zone
           for presentation:

             my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( %user_input, time_zone =&gt; $user_tz );
             $dt-&gt;set_time_zone(&apos;UTC&apos;);

             # do various operations - store it, retrieve it, add, subtract, etc.

             $dt-&gt;set_time_zone($user_tz);
             print $dt-&gt;datetime;

       &#183;   math on non-UTC time zones

           If you need to do date math on objects with non-UTC time zones,
           please read the caveats below carefully. The results &quot;DateTime.pm&quot;
           produces are predictable and correct, and mostly intuitive, but
           datetime math gets very ugly when time zones are involved, and there
           are a few strange corner cases involving subtraction of two datetimes
           across a DST change.

           If you can always use the floating or UTC time zones, you can skip
           ahead to Leap Seconds and Date Math

       &#183;   date vs datetime math

           If you only care about the date (calendar) portion of a datetime, you
           should use either &quot;delta_md()&quot; or &quot;delta_days()&quot;, not
           &quot;subtract_datetime()&quot;. This will give predictable, unsurprising
           results, free from DST-related complications.

       &#183;   subtract_datetime() and add_duration()

           You must convert your datetime objects to the UTC time zone before
           doing date math if you want to make sure that the following formulas
           are always true:

             $dt2 - $dt1 = $dur
             $dt1 + $dur = $dt2
             $dt2 - $dur = $dt1

           Note that using &quot;delta_days&quot; ensures that this formula always works,
           regardless of the timezone of the objects involved, as does using
           &quot;subtract_datetime_absolute()&quot;. Other methods of subtraction are not
           always reversible.

       Adding a Duration to a Datetime

       The parts of a duration can be broken down into five parts. These are
       months, days, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. Adding one month to a
       date is different than adding 4 weeks or 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
       Similarly, due to DST and leap seconds, adding a day can be different
       than adding 86,400 seconds, and adding a minute is not exactly the same
       as 60 seconds.

       We cannot convert between these units, except for seconds and
       nanoseconds, because there is no fixed conversion between the two units,
       because of things like leap seconds, DST changes, etc.

       &quot;DateTime.pm&quot; always adds (or subtracts) days, then months, minutes, and
       then seconds and nanoseconds. If there are any boundary overflows, these
       are normalized at each step. For the days and months the local (not UTC)
       values are used. For minutes and seconds, the local values are used. This
       generally just works.

       This means that adding one month and one day to February 28, 2003 will
       produce the date April 1, 2003, not March 29, 2003.

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 2, day =&gt; 28 );

         $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, days =&gt; 1 );

         # 2003-04-01 - the result

       On the other hand, if we add months first, and then separately add days,
       we end up with March 29, 2003:

         $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );

         # 2003-03-29

       We see similar strangeness when math crosses a DST boundary:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             minute    =&gt; 58,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1, minutes =&gt; 3 );
         # 2003-04-06 02:01:00

         $dt-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 3 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );
         # 2003-04-06 03:01:00

       Note that if you converted the datetime object to UTC first you would get
       predictable results.

       If you want to know how many seconds a duration object represents, you
       have to add it to a datetime to find out, so you could do:

        my $now = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; &apos;UTC&apos; );
        my $later = $now-&gt;clone-&gt;add_duration($duration);

        my $seconds_dur = $later-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute($now);

       This returns a duration which only contains seconds and nanoseconds.

       If we were add the duration to a different datetime object we might get a
       different number of seconds.

       DateTime::Duration supports three different end-of-month algorithms for
       adding months. This comes into play when an addition results in a day
       past the end of the month (for example, adding one month to January 30).

        # 2010-08-31 + 1 month = 2010-10-01
        $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; &apos;wrap&apos; );

        # 2010-01-30 + 1 month = 2010-02-28
        $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; &apos;limit&apos; );

        # 2010-04-30 + 1 month = 2010-05-31
        $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; &apos;preserve&apos; );

       By default, it uses &quot;wrap&quot; for positive durations and &quot;preserve&quot; for
       negative durations. See DateTime::Duration for a detailed explanation of
       these algorithms.

       If you need to do lots of work with durations, take a look at Rick
       Measham&apos;s &quot;DateTime::Format::Duration&quot; module, which lets you present
       information from durations in many useful ways.

       There are other subtract/delta methods in DateTime.pm to generate
       different types of durations. These methods are &quot;subtract_datetime()&quot;,
       &quot;subtract_datetime_absolute()&quot;, &quot;delta_md()&quot;, &quot;delta_days()&quot;, and
       &quot;delta_ms()&quot;.

       Datetime Subtraction

       Date subtraction is done solely based on the two object&apos;s local
       datetimes, with one exception to handle DST changes. Also, if the two
       datetime objects are in different time zones, one of them is converted to
       the other&apos;s time zone first before subtraction. This is best explained
       through examples:

       The first of these probably makes the most sense:

         my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 5,
             day       =&gt; 6,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         # not DST

         my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 11,
             day       =&gt; 6,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         # is DST

         my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
         # 6 months

       Nice and simple.

       This one is a little trickier, but still fairly logical:

         my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             minute    =&gt; 58,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         # is DST

         my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 7,
             hour      =&gt; 2,
             minute    =&gt; 1,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         # not DST

         my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

         # 2 days and 3 minutes

       Which contradicts the result this one gives, even though they both make
       sense:

         my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             minute    =&gt; 58,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         # is DST

         my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 6,
             hour      =&gt; 3,
             minute    =&gt; 1,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         # not DST

         my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

         # 1 day and 3 minutes

       This last example illustrates the &quot;DST&quot; exception mentioned earlier.  The
       exception accounts for the fact 2003-04-06 only lasts 23 hours.

       And finally:

         my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 10,
             day       =&gt; 26,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         my $dt1 = $dt2-&gt;clone-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

         my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
         # 60 minutes

       This seems obvious until you realize that subtracting 60 minutes from
       $dt2 in the above example still leaves the clock time at &quot;01:00:00&quot;. This
       time we are accounting for a 25 hour day.

       Reversibility

       Date math operations are not always reversible. This is because of the
       way that addition operations are ordered. As was discussed earlier,
       adding 1 day and 3 minutes in one call to &quot;add()&quot; is not the same as
       first adding 3 minutes and 1 day in two separate calls.

       If we take a duration returned from &quot;subtract_datetime()&quot; and then try to
       add or subtract that duration from one of the datetimes we just used, we
       sometimes get interesting results:

         my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 1,
             minute    =&gt; 58,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 6,
             hour      =&gt; 3,
             minute    =&gt; 1,
             time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
         );

         my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
         # 1 day and 3 minutes

         $dt1-&gt;add_duration($dur);
         # gives us $dt2

         $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration($dur);
         # gives us 2003-04-05 02:58:00 - 1 hour later than $dt1

       The &quot;subtract_duration()&quot; operation gives us a (perhaps) unexpected
       answer because it first subtracts one day to get 2003-04-05T03:01:00 and
       then subtracts 3 minutes to get the final result.

       If we explicitly reverse the order we can get the original value of $dt1.
       This can be facilitated by &quot;DateTime::Duration&quot;&apos;s &quot;calendar_duration()&quot;
       and &quot;clock_duration()&quot; methods:

         $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;clock_duration )
             -&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;calendar_duration );

       Leap Seconds and Date Math

       The presence of leap seconds can cause even more anomalies in date math.
       For example, the following is a legal datetime:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 1972,
             month     =&gt; 12,
             day       =&gt; 31,
             hour      =&gt; 23,
             minute    =&gt; 59,
             second    =&gt; 60,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;UTC&apos;
         );

       If we do the following:
&#12;        $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 );

       Then the datetime is now &quot;1973-02-01 00:00:00&quot;, because there is no
       23:59:60 on 1973-01-31.

       Leap seconds also force us to distinguish between minutes and seconds
       during date math. Given the following datetime:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 1972,
             month     =&gt; 12,
             day       =&gt; 31,
             hour      =&gt; 23,
             minute    =&gt; 59,
             second    =&gt; 30,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;UTC&apos;
         );

       we will get different results when adding 1 minute than we get if we add
       60 seconds. This is because in this case, the last minute of the day,
       beginning at 23:59:00, actually contains 61 seconds.

       Here are the results we get:

         # 1972-12-31 23:59:30 - our starting datetime

         $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 1 );
         # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - one minute later

         $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 60 );
         # 1973-01-01 00:00:29 - 60 seconds later

         $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 61 );
         # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - 61 seconds later

       Local vs. UTC and 24 hours vs. 1 day

       When math crosses a daylight saving boundary, a single day may have more
       or less than 24 hours.

       For example, if you do this:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 2,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );

       then you will produce an invalid local time, and therefore an exception
       will be thrown.

       However, this works:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
             year      =&gt; 2003,
             month     =&gt; 4,
             day       =&gt; 5,
             hour      =&gt; 2,
             time_zone =&gt; &apos;America/Chicago&apos;,
         );

         $dt-&gt;add( hours =&gt; 24 );

       and produces a datetime with the local time of &quot;03:00&quot;.

       If all this makes your head hurt, there is a simple alternative. Just
       convert your datetime object to the &quot;UTC&quot; time zone before doing date
       math on it, and switch it back to the local time zone afterwards.  This
       avoids the possibility of having date math throw an exception, and makes
       sure that 1 day equals 24 hours. Of course, this may not always be
       desirable, so caveat user!

   Overloading
       This module explicitly overloads the addition (+), subtraction (-),
       string and numeric comparison operators. This means that the following
       all do sensible things:

         my $new_dt = $dt + $duration_obj;

         my $new_dt = $dt - $duration_obj;

         my $duration_obj = $dt - $new_dt;

         foreach my $dt ( sort @dts ) { ... }

       Additionally, the fallback parameter is set to true, so other derivable
       operators (+=, -=, etc.) will work properly. Do not expect increment (++)
       or decrement (--) to do anything useful.

       The string comparison operators, &quot;eq&quot; or &quot;ne&quot;, will use the string value
       to compare with non-DateTime objects.

       DateTime objects do not have a numeric value, using &quot;==&quot; or &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; to
       compare a DateTime object with a non-DateTime object will result in an
       exception. To safely sort mixed DateTime and non-DateTime objects, use
       &quot;sort { $a cmp $b } @dates&quot;.

       The module also overloads stringification using the object&apos;s formatter,
       defaulting to &quot;iso8601()&quot; method. See &quot;Formatters And Stringification&quot;
       for details.

   Formatters And Stringification
       You can optionally specify a &quot;formatter&quot;, which is usually a
       DateTime::Format::* object/class, to control the stringification of the
       DateTime object.

       Any of the constructor methods can accept a formatter argument:

         my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Strptime-&gt;new(...);
         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(year =&gt; 2004, formatter =&gt; $formatter);

       Or, you can set it afterwards:

         $dt-&gt;set_formatter($formatter);
         $formatter = $dt-&gt;formatter();

       Once you set the formatter, the overloaded stringification method will
       use the formatter. If unspecified, the &quot;iso8601()&quot; method is used.

       A formatter can be handy when you know that in your application you want
       to stringify your DateTime objects into a special format all the time,
       for example to a different language.

       If you provide a formatter class name or object, it must implement a
       &quot;format_datetime&quot; method. This method will be called with just the
       DateTime object as its argument.

   CLDR Patterns
       The CLDR pattern language is both more powerful and more complex than
       strftime. Unlike strftime patterns, you often have to explicitly escape
       text that you do not want formatted, as the patterns are simply letters
       without any prefix.

       For example, &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot; is a valid CLDR pattern. If you want to include
       any lower or upper case ASCII characters as-is, you can surround them
       with single quotes (&apos;). If you want to include a single quote, you must
       escape it as two single quotes (&apos;&apos;).

         &apos;Today is &apos; EEEE
         &apos;It is now&apos; h &apos;o&apos;&apos;clock&apos; a
&#12;       Spaces and any non-letter text will always be passed through as-is.

       Many CLDR patterns which produce numbers will pad the number with leading
       zeroes depending on the length of the format specifier. For example, &quot;h&quot;
       represents the current hour from 1-12. If you specify &quot;hh&quot; then the 1-9
       will have a leading zero prepended.

       However, CLDR often uses five of a letter to represent the narrow form of
       a pattern. This inconsistency is necessary for backwards compatibility.

       CLDR often distinguishes between the &quot;format&quot; and &quot;stand-alone&quot; forms of
       a pattern. The format pattern is used when the thing in question is being
       placed into a larger string. The stand-alone form is used when displaying
       that item by itself, for example in a calendar.

       It also often provides three sizes for each item, wide (the full name),
       abbreviated, and narrow. The narrow form is often just a single
       character, for example &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Tuesday&quot;, and may not be unique.

       CLDR provides a fairly complex system for localizing time zones that we
       ignore entirely. The time zone patterns just use the information provided
       by &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;, and do not follow the CLDR spec.

       The output of a CLDR pattern is always localized, when applicable.

       CLDR provides the following patterns:

       &#183;   G{1,3}

           The abbreviated era (BC, AD).

       &#183;   GGGG

           The wide era (Before Christ, Anno Domini).

       &#183;   GGGGG

           The narrow era, if it exists (and it mostly doesn&apos;t).

       &#183;   y and y{3,}

           The year, zero-prefixed as needed. Negative years will start with a
           &quot;-&quot;, and this will be included in the length calculation.

           In other, words the &quot;yyyyy&quot; pattern will format year -1234 as
           &quot;-1234&quot;, not &quot;-01234&quot;.

       &#183;   yy

           This is a special case. It always produces a two-digit year, so
           &quot;1976&quot; becomes &quot;76&quot;. Negative years will start with a &quot;-&quot;, making
           them one character longer.

       &#183;   Y{1,}

           The week of the year, from &quot;$dt-&gt;week_year()&quot;.

       &#183;   u{1,}

           Same as &quot;y&quot; except that &quot;uu&quot; is not a special case.

       &#183;   Q{1,2}

           The quarter as a number (1..4).

       &#183;   QQQ

           The abbreviated format form for the quarter.

       &#183;   QQQQ

           The wide format form for the quarter.
&#12;       &#183;   q{1,2}

           The quarter as a number (1..4).

       &#183;   qqq

           The abbreviated stand-alone form for the quarter.

       &#183;   qqqq

           The wide stand-alone form for the quarter.

       &#183;   M{1,2]

           The numerical month.

       &#183;   L{1,2]

           The numerical month.

       &#183;   LLL

           The abbreviated stand-alone form for the month.

       &#183;   LLLL

           The wide stand-alone form for the month.

       &#183;   w{1,2}

           The week of the year, from &quot;$dt-&gt;week_number()&quot;.

       &#183;   W

           The week of the month, from &quot;$dt-&gt;week_of_month()&quot;.

       &#183;   d{1,2}

           The numeric day of of the month.

       &#183;   D{1,3}

           The numeric day of of the year.

       &#183;   F

           The day of the week in the month, from &quot;$dt-&gt;weekday_of_month()&quot;.

       &#183;   g{1,}

       &#183;   e{1,2}

           The local numeric day of the week, from 1 to 7. This number depends
           on what day is considered the first day of the week, which varies by
           locale. For example, in the US, Sunday is the first day of the week,
           so this returns 2 for Monday.

       &#183;   c

           The numeric day of the week from 1 to 7, treating Monday as the first
           of the week, regardless of locale.

       &#183;   ccc

           The abbreviated stand-alone form for the day of the week.

       &#183;   cccc

           The wide stand-alone form for the day of the week.

           The hour, in 12 or 24 hour form, based on the preferred form for the
           locale. In other words, this is equivalent to either &quot;h{1,2}&quot; or
           &quot;H{1,2}&quot;.

       &#183;   m{1,2}

           The minute.

       &#183;   s{1,2}

           The second.

       &#183;   S{1,}

           The fractional portion of the seconds, rounded based on the length of
           the specifier. This returned without a leading decimal point, but may
           have leading or trailing zeroes.

       &#183;   A{1,}

           The millisecond of the day, based on the current time. In other
           words, if it is 12:00:00.00, this returns 43200000.

       &#183;   z{1,3}

           The time zone short name.

       &#183;   zzzz

   strftime Patterns
       The following patterns are allowed in the format string given to the
       &quot;$dt-&gt;strftime()&quot; method:

       &#183;   %a

           The abbreviated weekday name.

           The abbreviated month name.

       &#183;   %B

           The full month name.

           The default datetime format for the object&apos;s locale.

       &#183;   %C

           The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.

       &#183;   %D

           Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. This is not a good standard format if you
           want folks from both the United States and the rest of the world to
           understand the date!

       &#183;   %e
&#12;           Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero
           is replaced by a space.

       &#183;   %F

           Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format)

       &#183;   %G

           The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year
           corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V). This has the same
           format and value as %Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to
           the previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)

       &#183;   %g

           Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).

       &#183;   %h

           Equivalent to %b.

       &#183;   %H

       &#183;   %j

           The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).

       &#183;   %k

           The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single
           digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.)

       &#183;   %l

           The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single

           The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).

       &#183;   %M

           The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).

       &#183;   %n

           A newline character.

       &#183;   %N

           The fractional seconds digits. Default is 9 digits (nanoseconds).

             %3N   milliseconds (3 digits)
             %6N   microseconds (6 digits)
             %9N   nanoseconds  (9 digits)

       &#183;   %p

           Either `AM&apos; or `PM&apos; according to the given time value, or the
           corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated as `pm&apos;
           and midnight as `am&apos;.

       &#183;   %P

           Like %p but in lowercase: `am&apos; or `pm&apos; or a corresponding string for
           the current locale.

       &#183;   %r

           The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this is
           equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p&apos;.

       &#183;   %R

           The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). (SU) For a version including

           number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at
           least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of
           the week. See also %U and %W.

       &#183;   %{method}

           Any method name may be specified using the format &quot;%{method}&quot; name
           where &quot;method&quot; is a valid &quot;DateTime.pm&quot; object method.

   DateTime.pm and Storable
       DateTime implements Storable hooks in order to reduce the size of a
       serialized DateTime object.

THE DATETIME PROJECT ECOSYSTEM
       This module is part of a larger ecosystem of modules in the DateTime
       family.

   DateTime::Set
       The DateTime::Set module represents sets (including recurrences) of
       datetimes. Many modules return sets or recurrences.

   Format Modules
       The various format modules exist to parse and format datetimes. For
       example, DateTime::Format::HTTP parses dates according to the RFC 1123
       format:

         my $datetime
             = DateTime::Format::HTTP-&gt;parse_datetime(&apos;Thu Feb  3 17:03:55 GMT 1994&apos;);

         print DateTime::Format::HTTP-&gt;format_datetime($datetime);

       Most format modules are suitable for use as a &quot;formatter&quot; with a DateTime
       object.

       All format modules start with &quot;DateTime::Format::&quot;.

   Calendar Modules
       There are a number of modules on CPAN that implement non-Gregorian
       calendars, such as the Chinese, Mayan, and Julian calendars.

       All calendar modules start with &quot;DateTime::Calendar::&quot;.

   Event Modules
       There are a number of modules that calculate the dates for events, such
       as Easter, Sunrise, etc.

       All event modules start with &quot;DateTime::Event::&quot;.

   Others
       There are many other modules that work with DateTime, including modules
       in the &quot;DateTimeX&quot; namespace, as well as others.

       See the datetime wiki &lt;http://datetime.perl.org&gt; and search.cpan.org
       &lt;http://search.cpan.org/search?query=datetime&amp;mode=dist&gt; for more
       details.

KNOWN BUGS
       The tests in 20infinite.t seem to fail on some machines, particularly on
       Win32. This appears to be related to Perl&apos;s internal handling of IEEE
       infinity and NaN, and seems to be highly platform/compiler/phase of moon
       dependent.

       If you don&apos;t plan to use infinite datetimes you can probably ignore this.
       This will be fixed (perhaps) in future versions.

       offer.

       Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
       me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do
       so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

       Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
       this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
       consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
       best.

       To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
       button on this page: http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html
