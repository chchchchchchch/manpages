NAME
       DateTime::Format::Builder - Create DateTime parser classes and objects.

SYNOPSIS
           package DateTime::Format::Brief;
           our $VERSION = &apos;0.07&apos;;
           use DateTime::Format::Builder
           (
               parsers =&gt; {
                   parse_datetime =&gt; [
                   {
                       regex =&gt; qr/^(\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
                       params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )],
                   },
                   {
                       regex =&gt; qr/^(\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
                       params =&gt; [qw( year month day )],
                   },
                   ],
               }
           );

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime::Format::Builder creates DateTime parsers.  Many string formats
       of dates and times are simple and just require a basic regular expression
       to extract the relevant information. Builder provides a simple way to do
       this without writing reams of structural code.

       Builder provides a number of methods, most of which you&apos;ll never need, or
       at least rarely need. They&apos;re provided more for exposing of the module&apos;s
       innards to any subclasses, or for when you need to do something slightly
       beyond what I expected.

TUTORIAL
       See DateTime::Format::Builder::Tutorial.

ERROR HANDLING AND BAD PARSES
       Often, I will speak of &quot;undef&quot; being returned, however that&apos;s not
       strictly true.

       When a simple single specification is given for a method, the method
       isn&apos;t given a single parser directly. It&apos;s given a wrapper that will call
       &quot;on_fail()&quot; if the single parser returns &quot;undef&quot;. The single parser must
       return &quot;undef&quot; so that a multiple parser can work nicely and actual
       errors can be thrown from any of the callbacks.

       Similarly, any multiple parsers will only call &quot;on_fail()&quot; right at the
       end when it&apos;s tried all it could.

       &quot;on_fail()&quot; (see later) is defined, by default, to throw an error.

       Multiple parser specifications can also specify &quot;on_fail&quot; with a coderef
       as an argument in the options block. This will take precedence over the
       inheritable and over-ridable method.

       That said, don&apos;t throw real errors from callbacks in multiple parser
       specifications unless you really want parsing to stop right there and not
       try any other parsers.

       In summary: calling a method will result in either a &quot;DateTime&quot; object
       being returned or an error being thrown (unless you&apos;ve overridden
       &quot;on_fail()&quot; or &quot;create_method()&quot;, or you&apos;ve specified a &quot;on_fail&quot; key to
       a multiple parser specification).

       Individual parsers (be they multiple parsers or single parsers) will
       return either the &quot;DateTime&quot; object or &quot;undef&quot;.

SINGLE SPECIFICATIONS
       A single specification is a hash ref of instructions on how to create a
       parser.

       The precise set of keys and values varies according to parser type. There
       are some common ones though:

       &#183;   length is an optional parameter that can be used to specify that this
           particular regex is only applicable to strings of a certain fixed
           length. This can be used to make parsers more efficient. It&apos;s
           strongly recommended that any parser that can use this parameter
           does.

           You may happily specify the same length twice. The parsers will be
           tried in order of specification.

           You can also specify multiple lengths by giving it an arrayref of
           numbers rather than just a single scalar.  If doing so, please keep
           the number of lengths to a minimum.

           If any specifications without lengths are given and the particular
           length parser fails, then the non-length parsers are tried.

           This parameter is ignored unless the specification is part of a
           multiple parser specification.

       &#183;   label provides a name for the specification and is passed to some of
           the callbacks about to mentioned.

       &#183;   on_match and on_fail are callbacks. Both routines will be called with
           parameters of:

           &#183;   input, being the input to the parser (after any preprocessing
               callbacks).

           &#183;   label, being the label of the parser, if there is one.

           &#183;   self, being the object on which the method has been invoked
               (which may just be a class name). Naturally, you can then invoke
               your own methods on it do get information you want.

           &#183;   args, being an arrayref of any passed arguments, if any.  If
               there were no arguments, then this parameter is not given.

           These routines will be called depending on whether the regex match
           succeeded or failed.

       &#183;   preprocess is a callback provided for cleaning up input prior to
           parsing. It&apos;s given a hash as arguments with the following keys:

           &#183;   input being the datetime string the parser was given (if using
               multiple specifications and an overall preprocess then this is
               the date after it&apos;s been through that preprocessor).

           &#183;   parsed being the state of parsing so far. Usually empty at this
               point unless an overall preprocess was given.  Items may be
               placed in it and will be given to any postprocessor and
               &quot;DateTime-&gt;new&quot; (unless the postprocessor deletes it).

           &#183;   self, args, label as per on_match and on_fail.
&#12;           The return value from the routine is what is given to the regex. Note
           that this is last code stop before the match.

           Note: mixing length and a preprocess that modifies the length of the
           input string is probably not what you meant to do. You probably meant
           to use the multiple parser variant of preprocess which is done before
           any length calculations. This &quot;single parser&quot; variant of preprocess
           is performed after any length calculations.

       &#183;   postprocess is the last code stop before &quot;DateTime-&gt;new()&quot; is called.
           It&apos;s given the same arguments as preprocess. This allows it to modify
           the parsed parameters after the parse and before the creation of the
           object. For example, you might use:

               {
                   regex  =&gt; qr/^(\d\d) (\d\d) (\d\d)$/,
                   params =&gt; [qw( year  month  day   )],
                   postprocess =&gt; \&amp;_fix_year,
               }

           where &quot;_fix_year&quot; is defined as:

               sub _fix_year
               {
                   my %args = @_;
                   my ($date, $p) = @args{qw( input parsed )};
                   $p-&gt;{year} += $p-&gt;{year} &gt; 69 ? 1900 : 2000;
                   return 1;
               }

           This will cause the two digit years to be corrected according to the
           cut off. If the year was &apos;69&apos; or lower, then it is made into 2069 (or
           2045, or whatever the year was parsed as). Otherwise it is assumed to
           be 19xx. The DateTime::Format::Mail module uses code similar to this
           (only it allows the cut off to be configured and it doesn&apos;t use
           Builder).

           Note: It is very important to return an explicit value from the
           postprocess callback. If the return value is false then the parse is
           taken to have failed. If the return value is true, then the parse is
           taken to have succeeded and &quot;DateTime-&gt;new()&quot; is called.

       See the documentation for the individual parsers for their valid keys.

       Parsers at the time of writing are:

       &#183;   DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::Regex - provides regular
           expression based parsing.

       &#183;   DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::Strptime - provides strptime based
           parsing.

   Subroutines / coderefs as specifications.
       A single parser specification can be a coderef. This was added mostly
       because it could be and because I knew someone, somewhere, would want to
       use it.

       If the specification is a reference to a piece of code, be it a
       subroutine, anonymous, or whatever, then it&apos;s passed more or less
       straight through. The code should return &quot;undef&quot; in event of failure (or
       any false value, but &quot;undef&quot; is strongly preferred), or a true value in
       the event of success (ideally a &quot;DateTime&quot; object or some object that has
       the same interface).

       This all said, I generally wouldn&apos;t recommend using this feature unless
       you have to.

   Callbacks
       I mention a number of callbacks in this document.

       Any time you see a callback being mentioned, you can, if you like,
       substitute an arrayref of coderefs rather than having the straight
       coderef.

MULTIPLE SPECIFICATIONS
       These are very easily described as an array of single specifications.

       Note that if the first element of the array is an arrayref, then you&apos;re
       specifying options.

       &#183;   preprocess lets you specify a preprocessor that is called before any
           of the parsers are tried. This lets you do things like strip off
           timezones or any unnecessary data. The most common use people have
           for it at present is to get the input date to a particular length so
           that the length is usable (DateTime::Format::ICal would use it to
           strip off the variable length timezone).

           Arguments are as for the single parser preprocess variant with the
           exception that label is never given.

       &#183;   on_fail should be a reference to a subroutine that is called if the
           parser fails. If this is not provided, the default action is to call
           &quot;DateTime::Format::Builder::on_fail&quot;, or the &quot;on_fail&quot; method of the
           subclass of DTFB that was used to create the parser.

EXECUTION FLOW
       Builder allows you to plug in a fair few callbacks, which can make
       following how a parse failed (or succeeded unexpectedly) somewhat tricky.

   For Single Specifications
       A single specification will do the following:

       User calls parser:

              my $dt = $class-&gt;parse_datetime( $string );

       1.  preprocess is called. It&apos;s given $string and a reference to the
           parsing workspace hash, which we&apos;ll call $p. At this point, $p is
           empty. The return value is used as $date for the rest of this single
           parser.  Anything put in $p is also used for the rest of this single
           parser.

       2.  regex is applied.

       3.  If regex did not match, then on_fail is called (and is given $date
           and also label if it was defined). Any return value is ignored and
           the next thing is for the single parser to return &quot;undef&quot;.

           If regex did match, then on_match is called with the same arguments
           as would be given to on_fail. The return value is similarly ignored,
           but we then move to step 4 rather than exiting the parser.

       4.  postprocess is called with $date and a filled out $p. The return
           value is taken as a indication of whether the parse was a success or
           not. If it wasn&apos;t a success then the single parser will exit at this
           point, returning undef.

       5.  &quot;DateTime-&gt;new()&quot; is called and the user is given the resultant
           &quot;DateTime&quot; object.

       See the section on error handling regarding the &quot;undef&quot;s mentioned above.
&#12;   For Multiple Specifications
       With multiple specifications:

       User calls parser:

             my $dt = $class-&gt;complex_parse( $string );

       1.  The overall preprocessor is called and is given $string and the
           hashref $p (identically to the per parser preprocess mentioned in the
           previous flow).

           If the callback modifies $p then a copy of $p is given to each of the
           individual parsers.  This is so parsers won&apos;t accidentally pollute
           each other&apos;s workspace.

       2.  If an appropriate length specific parser is found, then it is called
           and the single parser flow (see the previous section) is followed,
           and the parser is given a copy of $p and the return value of the
           overall preprocessor as $date.

           If a &quot;DateTime&quot; object was returned so we go straight back to the
           user.

           If no appropriate parser was found, or the parser returned &quot;undef&quot;,
           then we progress to step 3!

       3.  Any non-length based parsers are tried in the order they were
           specified.

           For each of those the single specification flow above is performed,
           and is given a copy of the output from the overall preprocessor.

           If a real &quot;DateTime&quot; object is returned then we exit back to the
           user.

           If no parser could parse, then an error is thrown.

       See the section on error handling regarding the &quot;undef&quot;s mentioned above.

METHODS
       In the general course of things you won&apos;t need any of the methods. Life
       often throws unexpected things at us so the methods are all available for
       use.

   import
       &quot;import()&quot; is a wrapper for &quot;create_class()&quot;. If you specify the class
       option (see documentation for &quot;create_class()&quot;) it will be ignored.

   create_class
       This method can be used as the runtime equivalent of &quot;import()&quot;. That is,
       it takes the exact same parameters as when one does:

          use DateTime::Format::Builder ( blah blah blah )

       That can be (almost) equivalently written as:

          use DateTime::Format::Builder;
          DateTime::Format::Builder-&gt;create_class( blah blah blah );

       The difference being that the first is done at compile time while the
       second is done at run time.

       In the tutorial I said there were only two parameters at present. I lied.
       There are actually three of them.

       &#183;   parsers takes a hashref of methods and their parser specifications.
           See the tutorial above for details.

           Note that if you define a subroutine of the same name as one of the
           methods you define here, an error will be thrown.

       &#183;   constructor determines whether and how to create a &quot;new()&quot; function
           in the new class. If given a true value, a constructor is created. If
           given a false value, one isn&apos;t.

           If given an anonymous sub or a reference to a sub then that is used
           as &quot;new()&quot;.

           The default is 1 (that is, create a constructor using our default
           code which simply creates a hashref and blesses it).

           If your class defines its own &quot;new()&quot; method it will not be
           overwritten. If you define your own &quot;new()&quot; and also tell Builder to
           define one an error will be thrown.

       &#183;   verbose takes a value. If the value is undef, then logging is
           disabled. If the value is a filehandle then that&apos;s where logging will
           go. If it&apos;s a true value, then output will go to &quot;STDERR&quot;.

           Alternatively, call &quot;$DateTime::Format::Builder::verbose()&quot; with the
           relevant value. Whichever value is given more recently is adhered to.

           Be aware that verbosity is a global wide setting.

       &#183;   class is optional and specifies the name of the class in which to
           create the specified methods.

           If using this method in the guise of &quot;import()&quot; then this field will
           cause an error so it is only of use when calling as &quot;create_class()&quot;.

       &#183;   version is also optional and specifies the value to give $VERSION in
           the class. It&apos;s generally not recommended unless you&apos;re combining
           with the class option. A &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; / &quot;CPAN&quot; compliant
           version specification is much better.

       In addition to creating any of the methods it also creates a &quot;new()&quot;
       method that can instantiate (or clone) objects.

SUBCLASSING
       In the rest of the documentation I&apos;ve often lied in order to get some of
       the ideas across more easily. The thing is, this module&apos;s very flexible.
       You can get markedly different behaviour from simply subclassing it and
       overriding some methods.

   create_method
       Given a parser coderef, returns a coderef that is suitable to be a
       method.

       The default action is to call &quot;on_fail()&quot; in the event of a non-parse,
       but you can make it do whatever you want.

   on_fail
       This is called in the event of a non-parse (unless you&apos;ve overridden
       &quot;create_method()&quot; to do something else.

       The single argument is the input string. The default action is to call
       &quot;croak()&quot;. Above, where I&apos;ve said parsers or methods throw errors, this
       is the method that is doing the error throwing.

       You could conceivably override this method to, say, return &quot;undef&quot;.

USING BUILDER OBJECTS aka USERS USING BUILDER
       The methods listed in the METHODS section are all you generally need when
       creating your own class. Sometimes you may not want a full blown class to
       parse something just for this one program. Some methods are provided to
       make that task easier.

   new
       The basic constructor. It takes no arguments, merely returns a new
       &quot;DateTime::Format::Builder&quot; object.

           my $parser = DateTime::Format::Builder-&gt;new();

       If called as a method on an object (rather than as a class method), then
       it clones the object.

           my $clone = $parser-&gt;new();

   clone
       Provided for those who prefer an explicit &quot;clone()&quot; method rather than
       using &quot;new()&quot; as an object method.

           my $clone_of_clone = $clone-&gt;clone();

   parser
       Given either a single or multiple parser specification, sets the object
       to have a parser based on that specification.

           $parser-&gt;parser(
               regex  =&gt; qr/^ (\d{4}) (\d\d) (\d\d) $/x;
               params =&gt; [qw( year    month  day    )],
           );

       The arguments given to &quot;parser()&quot; are handed directly to
       &quot;create_parser()&quot;. The resultant parser is passed to &quot;set_parser()&quot;.

       If called as an object method, it returns the object.

       If called as a class method, it creates a new object, sets its parser and
       returns that object.

   set_parser
       Sets the parser of the object to the given parser.

          $parser-&gt;set_parser( $coderef );

       Note: this method does not take specifications. It also does not take
       anything except coderefs. Luckily, coderefs are what most of the other
       methods produce.

       The method return value is the object itself.

   get_parser
       Returns the parser the object is using.

          my $code = $parser-&gt;get_parser();

   parse_datetime
       Given a string, it calls the parser and returns the &quot;DateTime&quot; object
       that results.

          my $dt = $parser-&gt;parse_datetime( &quot;1979 07 16&quot; );

       The return value, if not a &quot;DateTime&quot; object, is whatever the parser
       wants to return. Generally this means that if the parse failed an error
       will be thrown.

   format_datetime
       If you call this function, it will throw an errror.

LONGER EXAMPLES
       Some longer examples are provided in the distribution. These implement
       some of the common parsing DateTime modules using Builder. Each of them
       are, or were, drop in replacements for the modules at the time of writing
       them.

SUPPORT
       Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email list.
       See http://lists.perl.org/ for more details.

       Alternatively, log them via the CPAN RT system via the web or email:

           http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=DateTime%3A%3AFormat%3A%3ABuilder
           bug-datetime-format-builder@rt.cpan.org

       This makes it much easier for me to track things and thus means your
       problem is less likely to be neglected.
