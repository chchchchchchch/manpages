NAME
       DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::Regex - Regex based date parsing

SYNOPSIS
          my $parser = DateTime::Format::Builder-&gt;create_parser(
               regex  =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
               params =&gt; [ qw( year month day hour minute second ) ],
          );

SPECIFICATION
       In addition to the common keys, &quot;Regex&quot; supports:

       &#183;   regex is a regular expression that should capture elements of the
           datetime string.  This is a required element. This is the key whose
           presence indicates it&apos;s a specification that belongs to this class.

       &#183;   params is an arrayref of key names. The captures from the regex are
           mapped to these ($1 to the first element, $2 to the second, and so
           on) and handed to &quot;DateTime-&gt;new()&quot;.  This is a required element.

       &#183;   extra is a hashref of extra arguments you wish to give to
           &quot;DateTime-&gt;new()&quot;. For example, you could set the &quot;year&quot; or
           &quot;time_zone&quot; to defaults:

               extra =&gt; { year =&gt; 2004, time_zone =&gt; &quot;Australia/Sydney&quot; },

       &#183;   constructor is either an arrayref or a coderef. If an arrayref then
           the first element is a class name or object, and the second element
           is a method name (or coderef since Perl allows that sort of thing).
           The arguments to the call are anything in $p and anything given in
           the &quot;extra&quot; option above.

           If only a coderef is supplied, then it is called with arguments of
           $self, $p and &quot;extra&quot;.

           In short:

                       $self-&gt;$coderef( %$p, %{ $self-&gt;{extra} } );

           The method is expected to return a valid DateTime object, or undef in
           event of failure, but can conceivably return anything it likes. So
           long as it&apos;s &apos;true&apos;.

SUPPORT
       Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email list.
       See http://lists.perl.org/ for more details.

       Alternatively, log them via the CPAN RT system via the web or email:

           http://perl.dellah.org/rt/dtbuilder
           bug-datetime-format-builder@rt.cpan.org

       This makes it much easier for me to track things and thus means your
       problem is less likely to be neglected.
