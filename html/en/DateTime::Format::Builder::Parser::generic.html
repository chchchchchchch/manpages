NAME
       DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::generic - Useful routines

METHODS
   Useful
       new

       Standard constructor. Returns a blessed hash; any arguments are placed in
       the hash. This is useful for storing information between methods.

       generic_parser

       This is a method provided solely for the benefit of &quot;Parser&quot;
       implementations. It semi-neatly abstracts a lot of the work involved.

       Basically, it takes parameters matching the assorted callbacks from the
       parser declarations and makes a coderef out of it all.

       Currently recognized callbacks are:

       &#183;   on_match

       &#183;   on_fail

       &#183;   preprocess

       &#183;   postprocess

   Methods for subclassing
       These are methods you should define when writing your own subclass.

       Note: these methods do not exist in this class. There is no point trying
       to call &quot;$self-&gt;SUPER::do_match( ... )&quot;.

       do_match

       &quot;do_match&quot; is the first phase. Arguments are the date and @args.  &quot;self&quot;,
       &quot;label&quot;, &quot;args&quot;. Return value must be defined if you match successfully.

       post_match

       &quot;post_match&quot; is called after the appropriate callback out of
       &quot;on_match&quot;/&quot;on_fail&quot; is done. It&apos;s passed the date, the return value from
       &quot;do_match&quot; and the parsing hash.

       Its return value is used as the &quot;post&quot; argument to the &quot;postprocess&quot;
       callback, and as the second argument to &quot;make&quot;.

       make

       &quot;make&quot; takes the original input, the return value from &quot;post_match&quot; and
       the parsing hash and should return a &quot;DateTime&quot; object or undefined.

   Delegations
       For use of &quot;Parser&quot;, this module also delegates &quot;valid_params&quot; and
       &quot;params&quot;. This is just convenience to save typing the following:

           DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser-&gt;valid_params( blah )

       Instead we get to type:

           $self-&gt;valid_params( blah );
           __PACKAGE__-&gt;valid_params( blah );
&#12;WRITING A SUBCLASS
       Rather than attempt to explain how it all works, I think it&apos;s best if you
       take a look at Regex.pm and Strptime.pm as examples and work from there.

SUPPORT
       Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email list.
       See http://lists.perl.org/ for more details.

       Alternatively, log them via the CPAN RT system via the web or email:

           http://perl.dellah.org/rt/dtbuilder
           bug-datetime-format-builder@rt.cpan.org

       This makes it much easier for me to track things and thus means your
       problem is less likely to be neglected.
