NAME
       DateTime::Infinite - Infinite past and future DateTime objects

VERSION
       version 0.75

SYNOPSIS
         my $future = DateTime::Infinite::Future-&gt;new();
         my $past   = DateTime::Infinite::Past-&gt;new();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides two DateTime.pm subclasses,
       &quot;DateTime::Infinite::Future&quot; and &quot;DateTime::Infinite::Past&quot;.

       The objects are in the &quot;floating&quot; timezone, and this cannot be changed.

BUGS
       There seem to be lots of problems when dealing with infinite numbers on
       Win32. This may be a problem with this code, Perl, or Win32&apos;s IEEE math
       implementation. Either way, the module may not be well-behaved on Win32
       operating systems.

METHODS
       The only constructor for these two classes is the &quot;new()&quot; method, as
       shown in the SYNOPSIS. This method takes no parameters.

       All &quot;get&quot; methods in this module simply return infinity, positive or
       negative. If the method is expected to return a string, it return the
       string representation of positive or negative infinity used by your
       system. For example, on my system calling &quot;year()&quot; returns a number which
       when printed appears either &quot;inf&quot; or &quot;-inf&quot;.

       The object is not mutable, so the &quot;set()&quot;, &quot;set_time_zone()&quot;, and
       &quot;truncate()&quot; methods are all do-nothing methods that simply return the
       object they are called with.

       Obviously, the &quot;is_finite()&quot; method returns false and the &quot;is_infinite()&quot;
       method returns true.
