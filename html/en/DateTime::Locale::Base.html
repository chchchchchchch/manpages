NAME
       DateTime::Locale::Base - DateTime locale package for &quot;Base&quot; - Base class
       for individual locale objects

SYNOPSIS
         use base &apos;DateTime::Locale::Base&apos;;

DEFAULT FORMATS
       Each locale has a set of four default date and time formats.  They are
       distinguished by length, and are called &quot;full&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and
       &quot;short&quot;. Each locale may have a different default length which it uses
       when its &quot;$locale-&gt;date_format_default()&quot;,
       &quot;$locale-&gt;time_format_default()&quot;, or &quot;$locale-&gt;datetime_format_default()&quot;
       methods are called.

       This can be changed by calling the &quot;$locale-&gt;set_default_date_format()&quot;
       or &quot;$locale-&gt;set_default_time_format()&quot; methods.  These methods accept a
       string which must be one of &quot;full&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, or &quot;short&quot;.

NAME FORMS
       Most names come in a number of variations. First, they may vary based on
       length, with wide, abbreviated, and narrow forms. The wide form is
       typically the full name, while the narrow form is often a single
       character. The narrow forms may not be unique. For example, &quot;T&quot; may be
       used for Tuesday and Thursday in the English narrow forms.

       Many names also distinguish between &quot;format&quot; and &quot;stand-alone&quot; forms of a
       pattern. The format pattern is used when the thing in question is being
       placed into a larger string. The stand-alone form is used when displaying
       that item by itself, for example in a calendar.
