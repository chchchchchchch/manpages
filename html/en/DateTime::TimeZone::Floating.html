DateTime::TimeZone::FloUsergContributed Perl DoDateTime::TimeZone::Floating(3pm)



NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Floating - A time zone that is always local

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         my $floating_tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Floating-&gt;new;

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
       DateTime.pm, but for floating times, as defined by the RFC 2445 spec.  A
       floating time has no time zone, and has an effective offset of zero.

USAGE
       This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
       &quot;short_name_for_datetime()&quot;, and &quot;category()&quot; methods both return undef.
