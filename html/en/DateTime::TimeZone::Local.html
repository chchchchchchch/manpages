NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local - Determine the local system&apos;s time zone

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; &apos;local&apos; );

         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gt;TimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface for determining the local system&apos;s time
       zone. Most of the functionality for doing this is in OS-specific
       subclasses.

USAGE
       This class provides the following methods:

   DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gt;TimeZone()
       This attempts to load an appropriate subclass and asks it to find the
       local time zone. This method is called by when you pass &quot;local&quot; as the
       time zone name to &quot;DateTime:TimeZone-&gt;new()&quot;.

       If your OS is not explicitly handled, you can create a module with a name
       of the form &quot;DateTime::TimeZone::Local::$^O&quot;. If it exists, it will be
       used instead of falling back to the Unix subclass.

       If no OS-specific module exists, we fall back to using the Unix subclass.

       See DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Unix, DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32,
       and DateTime::TimeZone::Local::VMS for OS-specific details.

SUBCLASSING
       If you want to make a new OS-specific subclass, there are several methods
       provided by this module you should know about.

   $class-&gt;Methods()
       This method should be provided by your class. It should provide a list of
       methods that will be called to try to determine the local time zone.

       Each of these methods is expected to return a new &quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;
       object if it determines the time zone.

   $class-&gt;FromEnv()
       This method tries to find a valid time zone in an %ENV value. It calls
       &quot;$class-&gt;EnvVars()&quot; to determine which keys to look at.

       To use this from a subclass, simply return &quot;FromEnv&quot; as one of the items
       from &quot;$class-&gt;Methods()&quot;.

   $class-&gt;EnvVars()
       This method should be provided by your subclass. It should return a list
       of env vars to be checked by &quot;$class-&gt;FromEnv()&quot;.

   $class-&gt;_IsValidName($name)
       Given a possible time zone name, this returns a boolean indicating
       whether or not the the name looks valid. It always return false for
       &quot;local&quot; in order to avoid infinite loops.

EXAMPLE SUBCLASS
       Here is a simple example subclass:
&#12;         package DateTime::TimeZone::SomeOS;

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         use base &apos;DateTime::TimeZone::Local&apos;;


         sub Methods { qw( FromEnv FromEther ) }

         sub EnvVars { qw( TZ ZONE ) }

         sub FromEther
         {
             my $class = shift;

             ...
         }
