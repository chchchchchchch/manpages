NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Unix - Determine the local system&apos;s time zone
       on Unix

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; &apos;local&apos; );

         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gt;TimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for determining the local time zone on a
       Unix platform.

HOW THE TIME ZONE IS DETERMINED
       This class tries the following methods of determining the local time
       zone:

       &#183;   $ENV{TZ}

           It checks $ENV{TZ} for a valid time zone name.

       &#183;   /etc/localtime

           If this file is a symlink to an Olson database time zone file
           (usually in /usr/share/zoneinfo) then it uses the target file&apos;s path
           name to determine the time zone name. For example, if the path is
           /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago, the time zone is
           &quot;America/Chicago&quot;.

           Some systems just copy the relevant file to /etc/localtime instead of
           making a symlink.  In this case, we look in /usr/share/zoneinfo for a
           file that has the same size and content as /etc/localtime to
           determine the local time zone.

       &#183;   /etc/timezone

           If this file exists, it is read and its contents are used as a time
           zone name.

       &#183;   /etc/TIMEZONE

           If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
           like &quot;TZ = ...&quot;. If this is found, it should indicate a time zone
           name.

       &#183;   /etc/sysconfig/clock

           If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
           like &quot;TIMEZONE = ...&quot; or &quot;ZONE = ...&quot;. If this is found, it should
           indicate a time zone name.

       &#183;   /etc/default/init

           If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
           like &quot;TZ=...&quot;. If this is found, it should indicate a time zone name.
