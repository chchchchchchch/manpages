NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local::VMS - Determine the local system&apos;s time zone
       on VMS

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; &apos;local&apos; );

         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gt;TimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for determining the local time zone on a VMS
       platform.

       NOTE: This is basically a stub pending an implementation by someone who
       knows something about VMS.

HOW THE TIME ZONE IS DETERMINED
       This class tries the following methods of determining the local time
       zone:

       &#183;   %ENV

           We check the following environment variables:

           &#183;       TZ

           &#183;       SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE

           &#183;       SYS$TIMEZONE_NAME

           &#183;       UCX$TZ

           &#183;       TCPIP$TZ
