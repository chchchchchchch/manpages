DateTime::TimeZone::OffUsernContributed Perl DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly(3pm)



NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly - A DateTime::TimeZone object that just
       contains an offset

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         my $offset_tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; &apos;-0300&apos; );

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
       DateTime.pm, but with a fixed offset.  An object in this class always
       returns the same offset as was given in its constructor, regardless of
       the date.

USAGE
       This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
       &quot;category()&quot; method returns undef.

   DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly-&gt;new ( offset =&gt; $offset )
       The value given to the offset parameter must be a string such as &quot;+0300&quot;.
       Strings will be converted into numbers by the
       &quot;DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds()&quot; function.

   $tz-&gt;offset_for_datetime( $datetime )
       No matter what date is given, the offset provided to the constructor is
       always used.

   $tz-&gt;name()
   $tz-&gt;short_name_for_datetime()
       Both of these methods return the offset in string form.
