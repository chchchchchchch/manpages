NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::OlsonDB - An object to represent an Olson time zone
       database

VERSION
       version 1.58

SYNOPSIS
         none yet

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses the Olson database time zone definition files and
       creates various objects representing time zone data.

       Each time zone is broken down into several parts.  The first piece is an
       observance, which is an offset from UTC and an abbreviation.  A single
       zone may contain many observances, reflecting historical changes in that
       time zone over time.  An observance may also refer to a set of rules.

       Rules are named, and may apply to many different zones.  For example, the
       &quot;US&quot; rules apply to most of the time zones in the US, unsurprisingly.
       Rules are made of an offset from standard time and a definition of when
       that offset changes.  Changes can be a one time thing, or they can recur
       at regular times through a span of years.

       Each rule may have an associated letter, which is used to generate an
       abbreviated name for the time zone, along with the offset&apos;s abbreviation.
       For example, if the offset&apos;s abbreviation is &quot;C%sT&quot;, and the a rule
       specifies the letter &quot;S&quot;, then the abbreviation when that rule is in
       effect is &quot;CST&quot;.

USAGE
       Not yet documented.  This stuff is a mess.
