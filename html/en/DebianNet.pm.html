DebianNet(3pm)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             DebianNet(3pm)



NAME
       DebianNet.pm - create, remove, enable or disable entry in /etc/inetd.conf


SYNOPSIS
       require DebianNet;

       DebianNet::add_service($newentry, $group);

       DebianNet::remove_service($entry);

       DebianNet::enable_service($service, $pattern);

       DebianNet::disable_service($service, $pattern);



DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use  the functions in DebianNet.pm to to add, remove, enable or
       disable entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file.  After  the  /etc/inetd.conf
       file  has been changed, a SIGHUP signal will be sent to the inetd process
       to make sure that inetd will use the new /etc/inetd.conf file. The  func&#8208;
       tions  can also be used to add entries that are commented out by default.
       They will be treated like normal entries. That also  means  that  if  you
       already  have  an  entry that is commented out you can&apos;t add an entry for
       the same service without removing the old one first.

       The DebianNet functions treat entries that are commented out by a  single
       &apos;#&apos; character as entries that have been commented out by a user. It won&apos;t
       change such entries.

        For shell scripts  you  can  also  use  the  update-inetd  command.  See
       update-inetd(8) for further information.


VARIABLES
       $DebianNet::inetdcf = &#8221;FILENAME&quot;;
              Use  FILENAME  instead  of  /etc/inetd.conf (e.g. for testing pur&#8208;
              poses).


       $DebianNet::sep = &#8221;#&lt;off&gt;# &#8221;;
              &#8221;#&lt;off&gt;# &#8221; will be used as the default  comment  characters.   You
              can use this option to specify different comment characters.  This
              is only necessary if you have to deal with two (or more)  services
              of the same name.


       $DebianNet::multi = &#8221;true&quot;;
              If  you  want  to disable/remove more than one entry at a time you
              should use this option. If you try to remove more than  one  entry
              at  a time without using this option the program will show a warn&#8208;
              ing and asks the user if he want to continue.


       $DebianNet::verbose = &#8221;true&quot;;
              Explain what is being done.


FUNCTIONS
       DebianNet::add_service($newentry, $group);
              Add $newentry to the group $group of the /etc/inetd.conf file.  If
              the  entry  already  exist it will be enabled (it will also detect
              entries with different program options). Using $group is  optional
              (the  default  group  is  the group OTHER).  If the group does not
              exist the entry will be placed at the end of the file.


       DebianNet::remove_service($entry);
              Remove $entry from /etc/inetd.conf . You can use a regular expres&#8208;
              sion to remove the entry.


       DebianNet::enable_service($service, $pattern);
              Enable  $service  (e.g. &#8221;ftp&quot;) in /etc/inetd.conf . Using $pattern
              is optional. It can be used to select a service.   You  only  need
              this  option  if you have two (or more) services of the same name.
              An example: you have three ftp entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file
              (all  disabled  by default) and you want to enable the entry which
              uses the wu-ftpd daemon. To do this, use the pattern &#8221;wu-ftpd&quot; (or
              any other regular expression that matches this entry).


       DebianNet::disable_service($service, $pattern);
              Disable  SERVICE  (e.g. &#8221;ftp&quot;) in /etc/inetd.conf . Using $pattern
              is optional (see above).
