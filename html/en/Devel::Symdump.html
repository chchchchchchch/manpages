NAME
       Devel::Symdump - dump symbol names or the symbol table

SYNOPSIS
           # Constructor
           require Devel::Symdump;
           @packs = qw(some_package another_package);
           $obj = Devel::Symdump-&gt;new(@packs);        # no recursion
           $obj = Devel::Symdump-&gt;rnew(@packs);       # with recursion

           # Methods
           @array = $obj-&gt;packages;
           @array = $obj-&gt;scalars;
           @array = $obj-&gt;arrays;
           @array = $obj-&gt;hashes;
           @array = $obj-&gt;functions;
           @array = $obj-&gt;filehandles;  # deprecated, use ios instead
           @array = $obj-&gt;dirhandles;   # deprecated, use ios instead
           @array = $obj-&gt;ios;
           @array = $obj-&gt;unknowns;     # only perl version &lt; 5.003 had some

           $string = $obj-&gt;as_string;
           $string = $obj-&gt;as_HTML;
           $string = $obj1-&gt;diff($obj2);

           $string = Devel::Symdump-&gt;isa_tree;    # or $obj-&gt;isa_tree
           $string = Devel::Symdump-&gt;inh_tree;    # or $obj-&gt;inh_tree

           # Methods with autogenerated objects
           # all of those call new(@packs) internally
           @array = Devel::Symdump-&gt;packages(@packs);
           @array = Devel::Symdump-&gt;scalars(@packs);
           @array = Devel::Symdump-&gt;arrays(@packs);
           @array = Devel::Symdump-&gt;hashes(@packs);
           @array = Devel::Symdump-&gt;functions(@packs);

DESCRIPTION
       This little package serves to access the symbol table of perl.

       &quot;Devel::Symdump-&gt;rnew(@packages)&quot;
           returns a symbol table object for all subtrees below @packages.
           Nested Modules are analyzed recursively. If no package is given as
           argument, it defaults to &quot;main&quot;. That means to get the whole symbol
           table, just do a &quot;rnew&quot; without arguments.

           The global variable $Devel::Symdump::MAX_RECURSION limits the
           recursion to prevent contention. The default value is set to 97, just
           low enough to survive the test suite without a warning about deep
           recursion.

       &quot;Devel::Symdump-&gt;new(@packages)&quot;
           does not go into recursion and only analyzes the packages that are
           given as arguments.

       packages, scalars, arrays, hashes, functions, ios
           The methods packages(), scalars(), arrays(), hashes(), functions(),
           ios(), and (for older perls) unknowns() each return an array of fully
           qualified symbols of the specified type in all packages that are held
           within a Devel::Symdump object, but without the leading &quot;$&quot;, &quot;@&quot; or
           &quot;%&quot;. In a scalar context, they will return the number of such
           symbols. Unknown symbols are usually either formats or variables that
           haven&apos;t yet got a defined value.

       as_string
       as_HTML
           As_string() and as_HTML() return a simple string/HTML representations
           of the object.

       diff
           Diff() prints the difference between two Devel::Symdump objects in
           human readable form. The format is similar to the one used by the
           as_string method.

       isa_tree
       inh_tree
           Isa_tree() and inh_tree() both return a simple string representation
           of the current inheritance tree. The difference between the two
           methods is the direction from which the tree is viewed: top-down or
           bottom-up. As I&apos;m sure, many users will have different expectation
           about what is top and what is bottom, I&apos;ll provide an example what
           happens when the Socket module is loaded:

       % print Devel::Symdump-&gt;inh_tree
               AutoLoader
                       DynaLoader
                               Socket
               DynaLoader
                       Socket
               Exporter
                       Carp
                       Config
                       Socket

           The inh_tree method shows on the left hand side a package name and
           indented to the right the packages that use the former.

       % print Devel::Symdump-&gt;isa_tree
               Carp
                       Exporter
               Config
                       Exporter
               DynaLoader
                       AutoLoader
               Socket
                       Exporter
                       DynaLoader
                               AutoLoader

           The isa_tree method displays from left to right ISA relationships, so
           Socket IS A DynaLoader and DynaLoader IS A AutoLoader. (Actually,
           they were at the time this manpage was written)

       You may call both methods, isa_tree() and inh_tree(), with an object. If
       you do that, the object will store the output and retrieve it when you
       call the same method again later. The typical usage would be to use them
       as class methods directly though.

SUBCLASSING
       The design of this package is intentionally primitive and allows it to be
       subclassed easily. An example of a (maybe) useful subclass is
       Devel::Symdump::Export, a package which exports all methods of the
       Devel::Symdump package and turns them into functions.
