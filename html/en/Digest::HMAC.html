NAME
       Digest::HMAC - Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

SYNOPSIS
        # Functional style
        use Digest::HMAC qw(hmac hmac_hex);
        $digest = hmac($data, $key, \&amp;myhash);
        print hmac_hex($data, $key, \&amp;myhash);

        # OO style
        use Digest::HMAC;
        $hmac = Digest::HMAC-&gt;new($key, &quot;Digest::MyHash&quot;);

        $hmac-&gt;add($data);
        $hmac-&gt;addfile(*FILE);

        $digest = $hmac-&gt;digest;
        $digest = $hmac-&gt;hexdigest;
        $digest = $hmac-&gt;b64digest;

DESCRIPTION
       HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that share
       a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest algorithm,
       usually MD5 or SHA-1.  The HMAC mechanism is described in RFC 2104.

       HMAC follow the common &quot;Digest::&quot; interface, but the constructor takes
       the secret key and the name of some other simple &quot;Digest::&quot; as argument.

       The hmac() and hmac_hex() functions and the Digest::HMAC-&gt;new()
       constructor takes an optional $blocksize argument as well.  The HMAC
       algorithm assumes the digester to hash by iterating a basic compression
       function on blocks of data and the $blocksize should match the byte-
       length of such blocks.

       The default $blocksize is 64 which is suitable for the MD5 and SHA-1
       digest functions.  For stronger algorithms the blocksize probably needs
       to be increased.
