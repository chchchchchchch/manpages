Dpkg::BuildFlags(3)               libdpkg-perl               Dpkg::BuildFlags(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::BuildFlags - query build flags

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::BuildFlags object is used by dpkg-buildflags and can be used to
       query the same information.

FUNCTIONS
       my $bf = Dpkg::BuildFlags-&gt;new()
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildFlags object. It will be initialized based on
           the value of several configuration files and environment variables.

       $bf-&gt;load_vendor_defaults()
           Reset the flags stored to the default set provided by the vendor.

       $bf-&gt;load_system_config()
           Update flags from the system configuration.

       $bf-&gt;load_user_config()
           Update flags from the user configuration.

       $bf-&gt;load_environment_config()
           Update flags based on user directives stored in the environment. See
           dpkg-buildflags(1) for details.

       $bf-&gt;load_maintainer_config()
           Update flags based on maintainer directives stored in the
           environment. See dpkg-buildflags(1) for details.

       $bf-&gt;load_config()
           Call successively load_system_config(), load_user_config(),
           load_environment_config() and load_maintainer_config() to update the
           default build flags defined by the vendor.

       $bf-&gt;set($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Update the build flag $flag with value $value and record its origin
           as $source (if defined). Record it as maintainer modified if $maint
           is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;set_feature($area, $feature, $enabled)
           Update the boolean state of whether a specific feature within a known
           feature area has been enabled. The only currently known feature area
           is &quot;hardening&quot;.

       $bf-&gt;strip($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Update the build flag $flag by stripping the flags listed in $value
           and record its origin as $source (if defined). Record it as
           maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;append($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Append the options listed in $value to the current value of the flag
           $flag.  Record its origin as $source (if defined). Record it as
           maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;prepend($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Prepend the options listed in $value to the current value of the flag
           $flag.  Record its origin as $source (if defined). Record it as
           maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;update_from_conffile($file, $source)
           Update the current build flags based on the configuration directives
           contained in $file. See dpkg-buildflags(1) for the format of the
           directives.

           $source is the origin recorded for any build flag set or modified.

       $bf-&gt;get($flag)
           Return the value associated to the flag. It might be undef if the
           flag doesn&apos;t exist.

       $bf-&gt;get_feature_areas()
           Return the feature areas (i.e. the area values has_features will
           return true for).

       $bf-&gt;get_features($area)
           Return, for the given area, a hash with keys as feature names, and
           values as booleans indicating whether the feature is enabled or not.

       $bf-&gt;get_origin($flag)
           Return the origin associated to the flag. It might be undef if the
           flag doesn&apos;t exist.

       $bf-&gt;is_maintainer_modified($flag)
           Return true if the flag is modified by the maintainer.

       $bf-&gt;has_features($area)
           Returns true if the given area of features is known, and false
           otherwise.  The only currently recognized area is &quot;hardening&quot;.

       $bf-&gt;has($option)
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the flags exists in the object.

       my @flags = $bf-&gt;list()
           Returns the list of flags stored in the object.

CHANGES
   Version 1.01
       New method: $bf-&gt;prepend() very similar to append(). Implement support of
       the prepend operation everywhere.

       New method: $bf-&gt;load_maintainer_config() that update the build flags
       based on the package maintainer directives.

   Version 1.02
       New methods: $bf-&gt;get_features(), $bf-&gt;has_features(),
       $bf-&gt;set_feature().

   Version 1.03
       New method: $bf-&gt;get_feature_areas() to list possible values for
       $bf-&gt;get_features.

       New method $bf-&gt;is_maintainer_modified() and new optional parameter to
       $bf-&gt;set(), $bf-&gt;append(), $bf-&gt;prepend(), $bf-&gt;strip().
