Dpkg::BuildOptions(3)             libdpkg-perl             Dpkg::BuildOptions(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::BuildOptions - parse and update build options

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::BuildOptions object can be used to manipulate options stored in
       environment variables like DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.

FUNCTIONS
       my $bo = Dpkg::BuildOptions-&gt;new(%opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildOptions object. It will be initialized based
           on the value of the environment variable named $opts{&apos;envvar&apos;} (or
           DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS if that option is not set).

       $bo-&gt;reset()
           Reset the object to not have any option (it&apos;s empty).

       $bo-&gt;merge($content, $source)
           Merge the options set in $content and record that they come from the
           source $source. $source is mainly used in warning messages currently
           to indicate where invalid options have been detected.

           $content is a space separated list of options with optional assigned
           values like &quot;nocheck parallel=2&quot;.

       $bo-&gt;set($option, $value, [$source])
           Store the given option in the objet with the given value. It&apos;s
           legitimate for a value to be undefined if the option is a simple
           boolean (its presence means true, its absence means false). The
           $source is optional and indicates where the option comes from.

           The known options have their values checked for sanity. Options
           without values have their value removed and options with invalid
           values are discarded.

       $bo-&gt;get($option)
           Return the value associated to the option. It might be undef even if
           the option exists. You might want to check with $bo-&gt;has($option) to
           verify if the option is stored in the object.

       $bo-&gt;has($option)
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the option is stored in the
           object.

       $string = $bo-&gt;output($fh)
           Return a string representation of the build options suitable to be
           assigned to an environment variable. Can optionnaly output that
           string to the given filehandle.

       $bo-&gt;export([$var])
           Export the build options to the given environment variable. If
           omitted, the environment variable defined at creation time is
           assumed. The value set to the variable is also returned.

CHANGES
   Version 1.01
       Enable to use another environment variable instead of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
       Thus add support for the &quot;envvar&quot; option at creation time.
