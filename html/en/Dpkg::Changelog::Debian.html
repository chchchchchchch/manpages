NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Debian - parse Debian changelogs

DESCRIPTION
       Dpkg::Changelog::Debian parses Debian changelogs as described in the
       Debian policy (version 3.6.2.1 at the time of this writing). See section
       &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; for locations where to find this definition.

       The parser tries to ignore most cruft like # or /* */ style comments, CVS
       comments, vim variables, emacs local variables and stuff from older
       changelogs with other formats at the end of the file.  NOTE: most of
       these are ignored silently currently, there is no parser error issued for
       them. This should become configurable in the future.

   METHODS
       $c-&gt;parse($fh, $description)

       Read the filehandle and parse a Debian changelog in it. Returns the
       number of changelog entries that have been parsed with success.
