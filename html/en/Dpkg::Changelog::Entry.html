NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Entry - represents a changelog entry

DESCRIPTION
       This object represents a changelog entry. It is composed of a set of
       lines with specific purpose: an header line, changes lines, a trailer
       line. Blank lines can be between those kind of lines.

FUNCTIONS
       my $entry = Dpkg::Changelog::Entry-&gt;new()
           Creates a new object. It doesn&apos;t represent a real changelog entry
           until one has been successfully parsed or built from scratch.

       my $str = $entry-&gt;output()
       &quot;$entry&quot;
           Get a string representation of the changelog entry.

       $entry-&gt;output($fh)
           Print the string representation of the changelog entry to a
           filehandle.

       $entry-&gt;get_part($part)
           Return either a string (for a single line) or an array ref (for
           multiple lines) corresponding to the requested part. $part can be
           &quot;header, &quot;changes&quot;, &quot;trailer&quot;, &quot;blank_after_header&quot;,
           &quot;blank_after_changes&quot;, &quot;blank_after_trailer&quot;.

       $entry-&gt;set_part($part, $value)
           Set the value of the corresponding part. $value can be a string or an
           array ref.

       $entry-&gt;extend_part($part, $value)
           Concatenate $value at the end of the part. If the part is already a
           multi-line value, $value is added as a new line otherwise it&apos;s
           concatenated at the end of the current line.

       $is_empty = $entry-&gt;is_empty()
           Returns 1 if the changelog entry doesn&apos;t contain anything at all.
           Returns 0 as soon as it contains something in any of its non-blank
           parts.

       $entry-&gt;normalize()
           Normalize the content. Strip whitespaces at end of lines, use a
           single empty line to separate each part.

       my $src = $entry-&gt;get_source()
           Return the name of the source package associated to the changelog
           entry.

           Return a set of optional fields exposed by the changelog entry.  It
           always returns a Dpkg::Control object (possibly empty though).

           entry.
