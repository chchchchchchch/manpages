NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Entry::Debian - represents a Debian changelog entry

DESCRIPTION
       This object represents a Debian changelog entry. It implements the
       generic interface Dpkg::Changelog::Entry. Only functions specific to this
       implementation are described below.

VARIABLES
       $regex_header, $regex_trailer are two regular expressions that can be
       used to match a line and know whether it&apos;s a valid header/trailer line.

       The matched content for $regex_header is the source package name ($1),
       the version ($2), the target distributions ($3) and the options on the
       rest of the line ($4). For $regex_trailer, it&apos;s the maintainer name ($1),
       its email ($2), some blanks ($3) and the timestamp ($4).

FUNCTIONS
       my @items = $entry-&gt;get_change_items()
           Return a list of change items. Each item contains at least one line.
           A change line starting with an asterisk denotes the start of a new
           item.  Any change line like &quot;[ Rapha&#195;&#171;l Hertzog ]&quot; is treated like an
           item of its own even if it starts a set of items attributed to this
           person (the following line necessarily starts a new item).

       my @errors = $entry-&gt;check_header()
       my @errors = $entry-&gt;check_trailer()
           Return a list of errors. Each item in the list is an error message
           describing the problem. If the empty list is returned, no errors have
           been found.

       $entry-&gt;normalize()
           Normalize the content. Strip whitespaces at end of lines, use a
           single empty line to separate each part.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
       my @closed_bugs = find_closes($changes)

       Takes one string as argument and finds &quot;Closes: #123456, #654321&quot;
       statements as supported by the Debian Archive software in it. Returns all
       closed bug numbers in an array.
