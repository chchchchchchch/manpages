NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Parse - generic changelog parser for dpkg-parsechangelog

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a single function changelog_parse() which reproduces
       all the features of dpkg-parsechangelog.

   Functions
       my $fields = changelog_parse(%opt)

       This function will parse a changelog. In list context, it return as many
       Dpkg::Control object as the parser did output. In scalar context, it will
       return only the first one. If the parser didn&apos;t return any data, it will
       return an empty in list context or undef on scalar context. If the parser
       failed, it will die.

       The parsing itself is done by an external program (searched in the
       following list of directories: $opt{libdir},
       /usr/local/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog, /usr/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog) That
       program is named according to the format that it&apos;s able to parse. By
       default it&apos;s either &quot;debian&quot; or the format name lookep up in the 40 last
       lines of the changelog itself (extracted with this perl regular
       expression &quot;\schangelog-format:\s+([0-9a-z]+)\W&quot;). But it can be
       overridden with $opt{changelogformat}. The program expects the content of
       the changelog file on its standard input.

       The changelog file that is parsed is debian/changelog by default but it
       can be overridden with $opt{file}.

       All the other keys in %opt are forwarded as parameter to the external
       parser. If the key starts with &quot;-&quot;, it&apos;s passed as is. If not, it&apos;s
       passed as &quot;--&lt;key&gt;&quot;. If the value of the corresponding hash entry is
       defined, then it&apos;s passed as the parameter that follows.
