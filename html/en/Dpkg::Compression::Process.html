NAME
       Dpkg::Compression::Process - run compression/decompression processes

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object oriented interface to run and manage
       compression/decompression processes.

METHODS
       my $proc = Dpkg::Compression::Process-&gt;new(%opts)
           Create a new instance of the object. Supported options are
           &quot;compression&quot; and &quot;compression_level&quot; (see corresponding set_*
           functions).

       $proc-&gt;set_compression($comp)
           Select the compression method to use. It errors out if the method is
           not supported according to &quot;compression_is_supported&quot; (of
           Dpkg::Compression).

       $proc-&gt;set_compression_level($level)
           Select the compression level to use. It errors out if the level is
           not valid according to &quot;compression_is_valid_level&quot; (of
           Dpkg::Compression).

       my @exec = $proc-&gt;get_compress_cmdline()
       my @exec = $proc-&gt;get_uncompress_cmdline()
           Returns a list ready to be passed to &quot;exec&quot;, its first element is the
           program name (either for compression or decompression) and the
           following elements are parameters for the program.

           When executed the program acts as a filter between its standard input
           and its standard output.

       $proc-&gt;compress(%opts)
           Starts a compressor program. You must indicate where it will read its
           uncompressed data from and where it will write its compressed data
           to.  This is accomplished by passing one parameter &quot;to_*&quot; and one
           parameter &quot;from_*&quot; as accepted by Dpkg::IPC::spawn.

           You must call &quot;wait_end_process&quot; after having called this method to
           properly close the sub-process (and verify that it exited without
           error).

       $proc-&gt;uncompress(%opts)
           Starts a decompressor program. You must indicate where it will read
           its compressed data from and where it will write its uncompressed
           data to.  This is accomplished by passing one parameter &quot;to_*&quot; and
           one parameter &quot;from_*&quot; as accepted by Dpkg::IPC::spawn.

           You must call &quot;wait_end_process&quot; after having called this method to
           properly close the sub-process (and verify that it exited without
           error).

       $proc-&gt;wait_end_process(%opts)
           Call Dpkg::IPC::wait_child to wait until the sub-process has exited
           and verify its return code. Any given option will be forwarded to the
           &quot;wait_child&quot; function. Most notably you can use the &quot;nocheck&quot; option
           to verify the return code yourself instead of letting &quot;wait_child&quot; do
           it for you.
