Dpkg::Control(3)                  libdpkg-perl                  Dpkg::Control(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::Control - parse and manipulate official control-like information

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::Control object is a smart version of Dpkg::Control::Hash.  It
       associates a type to the control information. That type can be used to
       know what fields are allowed and in what order they must be output.

       The types are constants that are exported by default. Here&apos;s the full
       list:

       CTRL_UNKNOWN
           This type is the default type, it indicates that the type of control
           information is not yet known.

       CTRL_INFO_SRC
           Corresponds to the first block of information in a debian/control
           file in a Debian source package.

       CTRL_INFO_PKG
           Corresponds to subsequent blocks of information in a debian/control
           file in a Debian source package.

       CTRL_INDEX_SRC
           Corresponds to an entry in a Sources file of a source package
           repository.

       CTRL_INDEX_PKG
           Corresponds to an entry in a Packages file of a binary package
           repository.

       CTRL_PKG_SRC
           Corresponds to a .dsc file of a Debian source package.

       CTRL_PKG_DEB
           Corresponds to the control file generated by dpkg-gencontrol
           (DEBIAN/control) and to the same file inside .deb packages.

       CTRL_FILE_CHANGES
           Corresponds to a .changes file.

       CTRL_FILE_VENDOR
           Corresponds to a vendor file in /etc/dpkg/origins/.

       CTRL_FILE_STATUS
           Corresponds to an entry in dpkg&apos;s status file (/var/lib/dpkg/status).

       CTRL_CHANGELOG
           Corresponds to the output of dpkg-parsechangelog.

FUNCTIONS
       All the methods of Dpkg::Control::Hash are available. Those listed below
       are either new or overridden with a different behaviour.

       my $c = Dpkg::Control-&gt;new(%opts)
           If the &quot;type&quot; option is given, it&apos;s used to setup default values for
           other options. See set_options() for more details.

       $c-&gt;set_options(%opts)
           Changes the value of one or more options. If the &quot;type&quot; option is
           changed, it is used first to define default values for others
           options. The option &quot;allow_pgp&quot; is set to 1 for CTRL_PKG_SRC and
           CTRL_FILE_CHANGES and to 0 otherwise. The option &quot;drop_empty&quot; is set
           to 0 for CTRL_INFO_PKG and CTRL_INFO_SRC and to 1 otherwise. The
           option &quot;name&quot; is set to a textual description of the type of control
           information.

           The output order is also set to match the ordered list returned by
           Dpkg::Control::Fields::field_ordered_list($type).

       $c-&gt;get_type()
           Returns the type of control information stored. See the type
           parameter set during new().
