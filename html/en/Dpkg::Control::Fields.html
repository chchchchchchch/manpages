Dpkg::Control::Fields(3)          libdpkg-perl          Dpkg::Control::Fields(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::Control::Fields - manage (list of official) control fields

DESCRIPTION
       The modules contains a list of fieldnames with associated meta-data
       explaining in which type of control information they are allowed. The
       types are the CTRL_* constants exported by Dpkg::Control.

FUNCTIONS
       my $f = field_capitalize($field_name)
           Returns the field name properly capitalized. All characters are
           lowercase, except the first of each word (words are separated by a
           dash in field names).

       field_is_official($fname)
           Returns true if the field is official and known.

       field_is_allowed_in($fname, @types)
           Returns true (1) if the field $fname is allowed in all the types
           listed in the list. Note that you can use type sets instead of
           individual types (ex: CTRL_FILE_CHANGES | CTRL_CHANGELOG).

           field_allowed_in(A|B, C) returns true only if the field is allowed in
           C and either A or B.

           Undef is returned for non-official fields.

       field_transfer_single($from, $to, $field)
           If appropriate, copy the value of the field named $field taken from
           the $from Dpkg::Control object to the $to Dpkg::Control object.

           Official fields are copied only if the field is allowed in both types
           of objects. Custom fields are treated in a specific manner. When the
           target is not among CTRL_PKG_SRC, CTRL_PKG_DEB or CTRL_FILE_CHANGES,
           then they are alway copied as is (the X- prefix is kept). Otherwise
           they are not copied except if the target object matches the target
           destination encoded in the field name. The initial X denoting custom
           fields can be followed by one or more letters among &quot;S&quot; (Source:
           corresponds to CTRL_PKG_SRC), &quot;B&quot; (Binary: corresponds to
           CTRL_PKG_DEB) or &quot;C&quot; (Changes: corresponds to CTRL_FILE_CHANGES).

           Returns undef if nothing has been copied or the name of the new field
           added to $to otherwise.

       field_transfer_all($from, $to)
           Transfer all appropriate fields from $from to $to. Calls
           field_transfer_single() on all fields available in $from.

           Returns the list of fields that have been added to $to.

       field_ordered_list($type)
           Returns an ordered list of fields for a given type of control
           information.  This list can be used to output the fields in a
           predictable order.  The list might be empty for types where the order
           does not matter much.

       field_list_src_dep()
           List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a
           source Debian package.

       field_list_pkg_dep()
           List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a
           binary Debian package. The fields that express real dependencies are
           sorted from the stronger to the weaker.

       field_get_dep_type($field)
           Return the type of the dependency expressed by the given field. Can
           either be &quot;normal&quot; for a real dependency field (Pre-Depends, Depends,
           ...)  or &quot;union&quot; for other relation fields sharing the same syntax
           (Conflicts, Breaks, ...). Returns undef for fields which are not
           dependencies.

       field_register($field, $allowed_types, %opts)
           Register a new field as being allowed in control information of
           specified types. %opts is optional

       field_insert_after($type, $ref, @fields)
           Place field after another one ($ref) in output of control information
           of type $type.

       field_insert_before($type, $ref, @fields)
           Place field before another one ($ref) in output of control
           information of type $type.
