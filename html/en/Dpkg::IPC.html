Dpkg::IPC(3)                      libdpkg-perl                      Dpkg::IPC(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::IPC - helper functions for IPC

DESCRIPTION
       Dpkg::IPC offers helper functions to allow you to execute other programs
       in an easy, yet flexible way, while hiding all the gory details of IPC
       (Inter-Process Communication) from you.

METHODS
       spawn
           Creates a child process and executes another program in it.  The
           arguments are interpreted as a hash of options, specifying how to
           handle the in and output of the program to execute.  Returns the pid
           of the child process (unless the wait_child option was given).

           Any error will cause the function to exit with one of the
           Dpkg::ErrorHandling functions.

           Options:

           exec
               Can be either a scalar, i.e. the name of the program to be
               executed, or an array reference, i.e. the name of the program
               plus additional arguments. Note that the program will never be
               executed via the shell, so you can&apos;t specify additional arguments
               in the scalar string and you can&apos;t use any shell facilities like
               globbing.

               Mandatory Option.

           from_file, to_file, error_to_file
               Filename as scalar. Standard input/output/error of the child
               process will be redirected to the file specified.

           from_handle, to_handle, error_to_handle
               Filehandle. Standard input/output/error of the child process will
               be dup&apos;ed from the handle.

           from_pipe, to_pipe, error_to_pipe
               Scalar reference or object based on IO::Handle. A pipe will be
               opened for each of the two options and either the reading
               (&quot;to_pipe&quot; and &quot;error_to_pipe&quot;) or the writing end (&quot;from_pipe&quot;)
               will be returned in the referenced scalar. Standard
               input/output/error of the child process will be dup&apos;ed to the
               other ends of the pipes.

           from_string, to_string, error_to_string
               Scalar reference. Standard input/output/error of the child
               process will be redirected to the string given as reference. Note
               that it wouldn&apos;t be strictly necessary to use a scalar reference
               for &quot;from_string&quot;, as the string is not modified in any way. This
               was chosen only for reasons of symmetry with &quot;to_string&quot; and
               &quot;error_to_string&quot;. &quot;to_string&quot; and &quot;error_to_string&quot; imply the
               &quot;wait_child&quot; option.

           wait_child
               Scalar. If containing a true value, wait_child() will be called
               before returning. The return value will of spawn() will be a true
               value, but not the pid.

           nocheck
               Scalar. Option of the wait_child() call.
&#12;           timeout
               Scalar. Option of the wait_child() call.

           chdir
               Scalar. The child process will chdir in the indicated directory
               before calling exec.

           env Hash reference. The child process will populate %ENV with the
               items of the hash before calling exec. This allows exporting
               environment variables.

           delete_env
               Array reference. The child process will remove all environment
               variables listed in the array before calling exec.

       wait_child
           Takes as first argument the pid of the process to wait for.
           Remaining arguments are taken as a hash of options. Returns nothing.
           Fails if the child has been ended by a signal or if it exited non-
           zero.

           Options:

           cmdline
               String to identify the child process in error messages.  Defaults
               to &quot;child process&quot;.

           nocheck
               If true do not check the return status of the child (and thus do
               not fail it it has been killed or if it exited with a non-zero
               return code).

           timeout
               Set a maximum time to wait for the process, after that fail with
               an error message.
