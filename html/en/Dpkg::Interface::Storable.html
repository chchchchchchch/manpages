NAME
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable - common methods related to object
       serialization

DESCRIPTION
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable is only meant to be used as parent class for
       other objects. It provides common methods that are all implemented on top
       of two basic methods parse() and output().

BASE METHODS
       Those methods must be provided by the object that wish to inherit from
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable so that the methods provided can work.

       $obj-&gt;parse($fh, $desc)
           This methods initialize the object with the data stored in the
           filehandle. $desc is optional and is a textual description of the
           filehandle used in error messages.

       $string = $obj-&gt;output($fh)
           This method returns a string representation of the object in $string
           and it writes the same string to $fh (if it&apos;s defined).

PROVIDED METHODS
       $obj-&gt;load($filename)
           Initialize the object with the data stored in the file. The file can
           be compressed, it will be uncompressed on the fly by using a
           Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle object. If $filename is &quot;-&quot;, then the
           standard input is read (no compression is allowed in that case).

       $obj-&gt;save($filename)
           Store the object in the file. If the filename ends with a known
           compression extension, it will be compressed on the fly by using a
           Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle object. If $filename is &quot;-&quot;, then the
           standard output is used (data are written uncompressed in that case).

       &quot;$obj&quot;
           Return a string representation of the object.
