Dpkg::Path(3)                     libdpkg-perl                     Dpkg::Path(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::Path - some common path handling functions

DESCRIPTION
       It provides some functions to handle various path.

METHODS
       get_pkg_root_dir($file)
               This function will scan upwards the hierarchy of directory to
               find out the directory which contains the &quot;DEBIAN&quot; sub-directory
               and it will return its path. This directory is the root directory
               of a package being built.

               If no DEBIAN subdirectory is found, it will return undef.

       relative_to_pkg_root($file)
               Returns the filename relative to get_pkg_root_dir($file).

       guess_pkg_root_dir($file)
               This function tries to guess the root directory of the package
               build tree.  It will first use get_pkg_root_dir(), but it will
               fallback to a more imprecise check: namely it will use the parent
               directory that is a sub-directory of the debian directory.

               It can still return undef if a file outside of the debian sub-
               directory is provided.

       check_files_are_the_same($file1, $file2, $resolve_symlink)
               This function verifies that both files are the same by checking
               that the device numbers and the inode numbers returned by
               stat()/lstat() are the same. If $resolve_symlink is true then
               stat() is used, otherwise lstat() is used.

       canonpath($file)
               This function returns a cleaned path. It simplifies double //,
               and remove /./ and /../ intelligently. For /../ it simplifies the
               path only if the previous element is not a symlink. Thus it
               should only be used on real filenames.

       $newpath = resolve_symlink($symlink)
               Return the filename of the file pointed by the symlink. The new
               name is canonicalized by canonpath().

       my $cmdpath = find_command($command)
               Return the path of the command if available on an absolute or
               relative path or on the $PATH, undef otherwise.

       my $control_file = get_control_path($pkg, $filetype)
               Return the path of the control file of type $filetype for the
               given package.

       my @control_files = get_control_path($pkg)
               Return the path of all available control files for the given
               package.

       my $file = find_build_file($basename)
               Selects the right variant of the given file: the arch-specific
               variant (&quot;$basename.$arch&quot;) has priority over the OS-specific
               variant (&quot;$basename.$os&quot;) which has priority over the default
               variant (&quot;$basename&quot;). If none of the files exists, then it
               returns undef.
&#12;       my @files = find_build_file($basename)
               Return the available variants of the given file. Returns an empty
               list if none of the files exists.
