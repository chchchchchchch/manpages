NAME
       Dpkg::Source::Package - manipulate Debian source packages

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object that can manipulate Debian source
       packages. While it supports both the extraction and the creation of
       source packages, the only API that is officially supported is the one
       that supports the extraction of the source package.

FUNCTIONS
       $p = Dpkg::Source::Package-&gt;new(filename =&gt; $dscfile, options =&gt; {})
           Creates a new object corresponding to the source package described by
           the file $dscfile.

           The options hash supports the following options:

           skip_debianization
                   If set to 1, do not apply Debian changes on the extracted
                   source package.

           skip_patches
                   If set to 1, do not apply Debian-specific patches. This
                   options is specific for source packages using format &quot;2.0&quot;
                   and &quot;3.0 (quilt)&quot;.

           require_valid_signature
                   If set to 1, the check_signature() method will be stricter
                   and will error out if the signature can&apos;t be verified.

           copy_orig_tarballs
                   If set to 1, the extraction will copy the upstream tarballs
                   next the target directory. This is useful if you want to be
                   able to rebuild the source package after its extraction.

       $p-&gt;get_filename()
           Returns the filename of the DSC file.

       $p-&gt;get_files()
           Returns the list of files referenced by the source package. The
           filenames usually do not have any path information.

       $p-&gt;check_checksums()
           Verify the checksums embedded in the DSC file. It requires the
           presence of the other files constituting the source package. If any
           inconsistency is discovered, it immediately errors out.

       $bool = $p-&gt;is_signed()
           Returns 1 if the DSC files contains an embedded OpenPGP signature.
           Otherwise returns 0.

       $p-&gt;check_signature()
           Implement the same OpenPGP signature check that dpkg-source does.  In
           case of problems, it prints a warning or errors out.

           If the object has been created with the &quot;require_valid_signature&quot;
           option, then any problem will result in a fatal error.

       $p-&gt;extract($targetdir)
           Extracts the source package in the target directory $targetdir.
           Beware that if $targetdir already exists, it will be erased.
