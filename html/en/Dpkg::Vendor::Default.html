Dpkg::Vendor::Default(3)          libdpkg-perl          Dpkg::Vendor::Default(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::Vendor::Default - default vendor object

DESCRIPTION
       A vendor object is used to provide vendor specific behaviour in various
       places. This is the default object used in case there&apos;s none for the
       current vendor or in case the vendor could not be identified (see
       Dpkg::Vendor documentation).

       It provides some hooks that are called by various dpkg-* tools.  If you
       need a new hook, please file a bug against dpkg-dev and explain your
       need. Note that the hook API has no guaranty to be stable over an
       extended period. If you run an important distribution that makes use of
       vendor hooks, you&apos;d better submit them for integration so that we avoid
       breaking your code.

FUNCTIONS
       $vendor_obj = Dpkg::Vendor::Default-&gt;new()
           Creates the default vendor object. Can be inherited by all vendor
           objects if they don&apos;t need any specific initialization at object
           creation time.

       $vendor_obj-&gt;run_hook($id, @params)
           Run the corresponding hook. The parameters are hook-specific. The
           supported hooks are:

           before-source-build ($srcpkg)
                   The first parameter is a Dpkg::Source::Package object. The
                   hook is called just before the execution of $srcpkg-&gt;build().

           keyrings ()
                   The hook is called when dpkg-source is checking a signature
                   on a source package. It takes no parameters, but returns a
                   (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.

           register-custom-fields ()
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::Control::Fields to register
                   custom fields.  You should return a list of arrays. Each
                   array is an operation to perform.  The first item is the name
                   of the operation and corresponds to a field_* function
                   provided by Dpkg::Control::Fields. The remaining fields are
                   the parameters that are passed unchanged to the corresponding
                   function.

                   Known operations are &quot;register&quot;, &quot;insert_after&quot; and
                   &quot;insert_before&quot;.

           post-process-changelog-entry ($fields)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::Changelog to post-process a
                   Dpkg::Changelog::Entry after it has been created and filled
                   with the appropriate values.

           update-buildflags ($flags)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildFlags to allow the vendor to
                   override the default values set for the various build flags.
                   $flags is a Dpkg::BuildFlags object.
