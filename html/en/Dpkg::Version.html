Dpkg::Version(3)                  libdpkg-perl                  Dpkg::Version(3)



NAME
       Dpkg::Version - handling and comparing dpkg-style version numbers

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::Version module provides pure-Perl routines to compare dpkg-
       style version numbers (as used in Debian packages) and also an object
       oriented interface overriding perl operators to do the right thing when
       you compare Dpkg::Version object between them.

OBJECT INTERFACE
       my $v = Dpkg::Version-&gt;new($version, %opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::Version object corresponding to the version
           indicated in the string (scalar) $version. By default it will accepts
           any string and consider it as a valid version. If you pass the option
           &quot;check =&gt; 1&quot;, it will return undef if the version is invalid (see
           version_check for details).

           You can always call $v-&gt;is_valid() later on to verify that the
           version is valid.

       boolean evaluation
           When the Dpkg::Version object is used in a boolean evaluation (for
           example in &quot;if ($v)&quot; or &quot;$v || &apos;default&apos;&quot;) it returns its string
           representation if the version stored is valid ($v-&gt;is_valid()) and
           undef otherwise.

       $v-&gt;is_valid()
           Returns true if the version is valid, false otherwise.

       $v-&gt;epoch(), $v-&gt;version(), $v-&gt;revision()
           Returns the corresponding part of the full version string.

       $v1 &lt;=&gt; $v2, $v1 &lt; $v2, $v1 &lt;= $v2, $v1 &gt; $v2, $v1 &gt;= $v2
           Numerical comparison of various versions numbers. One of the two
           operands needs to be a Dpkg::Version, the other one can be anything
           provided that its string representation is a version number.

       &quot;$v&quot;, $v-&gt;as_string()
           Returns the string representation of the version number.

FUNCTIONS
       All the functions are exported by default.

       version_compare($a, $b)
           Returns -1 if $a is earlier than $b, 0 if they are equal and 1 if $a
           is later than $b.

           If $a or $b are not valid version numbers, it dies with an error.

       version_compare_relation($a, $rel, $b)
           Returns the result (0 or 1) of the given comparison operation. This
           function is implemented on top of version_compare().

           Allowed values for $rel are the exported constants REL_GT, REL_GE,
           REL_EQ, REL_LE, REL_LT. Use version_normalize_relation() if you have
           an input string containing the operator.

       my $rel = version_normalize_relation($rel_string)
           Returns the normalized constant of the relation $rel (a value among
           REL_GT, REL_GE, REL_EQ, REL_LE and REL_LT). Supported relations names
           in input are: &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;ge&quot;, &quot;eq&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, &quot;lt&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;,
           &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;. &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; are also supported but should not be used as they
           are obsolete aliases of &quot;&gt;=&quot; and &quot;&lt;=&quot;.

       version_compare_string($a, $b)
           String comparison function used for comparing non-numerical parts of
           version numbers. Returns -1 if $a is earlier than $b, 0 if they are
           equal and 1 if $a is later than $b.

           The &quot;~&quot; character always sort lower than anything else. Digits sort
           lower than non-digits. Among remaining characters alphabetic
           characters (A-Za-z) sort lower than the other ones. Within each
           range, the ASCII decimal value of the character is used to sort
           between characters.

       version_compare_part($a, $b)
           Compare two corresponding sub-parts of a version number (either
           upstream version or debian revision).

           Each parameter is split by version_split_digits() and resulting items
           are compared together. As soon as a difference happens, it returns -1
           if $a is earlier than $b, 0 if they are equal and 1 if $a is later
           than $b.

       my @items = version_split_digits($version)
           Splits a string in items that are each entirely composed either of
           digits or of non-digits. For instance for &quot;1.024~beta1+svn234&quot; it
           would return (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;024&quot;, &quot;~beta&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;+svn&quot;, &quot;234&quot;).

       my ($ok, $msg) = version_check($version)
       my $ok = version_check($version)
           Checks the validity of $version as a version number. Returns 1 in $ok
           if the version is valid, 0 otherwise. In the latter case, $msg
           contains a description of the problem with the $version scalar.
