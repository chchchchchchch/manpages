EVP_DigestSignInit(3SSL)             OpenSSL            EVP_DigestSignInit(3SSL)



NAME
       EVP_DigestSignInit, EVP_DigestSignUpdate, EVP_DigestSignFinal - EVP
       signing functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;

        int EVP_DigestSignInit(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY_CTX **pctx,
                               const EVP_MD *type, ENGINE *e, EVP_PKEY *pkey);
        int EVP_DigestSignUpdate(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, const void *d, unsigned int cnt);
        int EVP_DigestSignFinal(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *sig, size_t *siglen);

DESCRIPTION
       The EVP signature routines are a high level interface to digital
       signatures.

       EVP_DigestSignInit() sets up signing context ctx to use digest type from
       ENGINE impl and private key pkey. ctx must be initialized with
       EVP_MD_CTX_init() before calling this function. If pctx is not NULL the
       EVP_PKEY_CTX of the signing operation will be written to *pctx: this can
       be used to set alternative signing options.

       EVP_DigestSignUpdate() hashes cnt bytes of data at d into the signature
       context ctx. This function can be called several times on the same ctx to
       include additional data. This function is currently implemented usig a
       macro.

       EVP_DigestSignFinal() signs the data in ctx places the signature in sig.
       If sig is NULL then the maximum size of the output buffer is written to
       the siglen parameter. If sig is not NULL then before the call the siglen
       parameter should contain the length of the sig buffer, if the call is
       successful the signature is written to sig and the amount of data written
       to siglen.

RETURN VALUES
       EVP_DigestSignInit() EVP_DigestSignUpdate() and EVP_DigestSignaFinal()
       return 1 for success and 0 or a negative value for failure. In particular
       a return value of -2 indicates the operation is not supported by the
       public key algorithm.

       The error codes can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3).

NOTES
       The EVP interface to digital signatures should almost always be used in
       preference to the low level interfaces. This is because the code then
       becomes transparent to the algorithm used and much more flexible.

       In previous versions of OpenSSL there was a link between message digest
       types and public key algorithms. This meant that &quot;clone&quot; digests such as
       EVP_dss1() needed to be used to sign using SHA1 and DSA. This is no
       longer necessary and the use of clone digest is now discouraged.

       For some key types and parameters the random number generator must be
       seeded or the operation will fail.

       The call to EVP_DigestSignFinal() internally finalizes a copy of the
       digest context. This means that calls to EVP_DigestSignUpdate() and
       EVP_DigestSignFinal() can be called later to digest and sign additional
       data.

       Since only a copy of the digest context is ever finalized the context
       must be cleaned up after use by calling EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup() or a memory
       leak will occur.

       The use of EVP_PKEY_size() with these functions is discouraged because
       some signature operations may have a signature length which depends on
       the parameters set. As a result EVP_PKEY_size() would have to return a
       value which indicates the maximum possible signature for any set of
       parameters.
