EVP_DigestVerifyInit(3SSL)           OpenSSL          EVP_DigestVerifyInit(3SSL)



NAME
       EVP_DigestVerifyInit, EVP_DigestVerifyUpdate, EVP_DigestVerifyFinal - EVP
       signature verification functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;

        int EVP_DigestVerifyInit(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY_CTX **pctx,
                               const EVP_MD *type, ENGINE *e, EVP_PKEY *pkey);
        int EVP_DigestVerifyUpdate(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, const void *d, unsigned int cnt);
        int EVP_DigestVerifyFinal(EVP_MD_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *sig, size_t siglen);

DESCRIPTION
       The EVP signature routines are a high level interface to digital
       signatures.

       EVP_DigestVerifyInit() sets up verification context ctx to use digest
       type from ENGINE impl and public key pkey. ctx must be initialized with
       EVP_MD_CTX_init() before calling this function. If pctx is not NULL the
       EVP_PKEY_CTX of the verification operation will be written to *pctx: this
       can be used to set alternative verification options.

       EVP_DigestVerifyUpdate() hashes cnt bytes of data at d into the
       verification context ctx. This function can be called several times on
       the same ctx to include additional data. This function is currently
       implemented using a macro.

       EVP_DigestVerifyFinal() verifies the data in ctx against the signature in
       sig of length siglen.

RETURN VALUES
       EVP_DigestVerifyInit() and EVP_DigestVerifyUpdate() return 1 for success
       and 0 or a negative value for failure. In particular a return value of -2
       indicates the operation is not supported by the public key algorithm.

       Unlike other functions the return value 0 from EVP_DigestVerifyFinal()
       only indicates that the signature did not not verify successfully (that
       is tbs did not match the original data or the signature was of invalid
       form) it is not an indication of a more serious error.

       The error codes can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3).

NOTES
       The EVP interface to digital signatures should almost always be used in
       preference to the low level interfaces. This is because the code then
       becomes transparent to the algorithm used and much more flexible.

       In previous versions of OpenSSL there was a link between message digest
       types and public key algorithms. This meant that &quot;clone&quot; digests such as
       EVP_dss1() needed to be used to sign using SHA1 and DSA. This is no
       longer necessary and the use of clone digest is now discouraged.

       For some key types and parameters the random number generator must be
       seeded or the operation will fail.

       The call to EVP_DigestVerifyFinal() internally finalizes a copy of the
       digest context. This means that calls to EVP_VerifyUpdate() and
       EVP_VerifyFinal() can be called later to digest and verify additional
       data.

       Since only a copy of the digest context is ever finalized the context
       must be cleaned up after use by calling EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup() or a memory
       leak will occur.
