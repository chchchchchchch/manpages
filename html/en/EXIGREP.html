EXIGREP(8)                                                            EXIGREP(8)



NAME
       EXIGREP - Search Exim&apos;s main log

SYNOPSIS
       exigrep [-l] pattern [log file] ...


DESCRIPTION
       The  exigrep  utility is a Perl script that searches one or more main log
       files for entries that match a given pattern.  When it finds a match,  it
       extracts  all  the  log  entries for the relevant message, not just those
       that match the pattern.  Thus, exigrep can extract complete  log  entries
       for  a  given message, or all mail for a given user, or for a given host,
       for example.

       The -l flag means &#8216;literal&#8217;, that is, treat all characters in the pattern
       as standing for themselves.  Otherwise the pattern must be a Perl regular
       expression.  The pattern match is case-insensitive.  If no file names are
       given on the command line, the standard input is read.

       If  the  location  of  a  zcat  command  is  known from the definition of
       ZCAT_COMMAND in Local/Makefile, exigrep  automatically  passes  any  file
       whose name ends in COMPRESS_SUFFIX through zcat as it searches it.


BUGS
       This  manual  page  needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
       than us and has more experience in  writing  manual  pages,  any  patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
