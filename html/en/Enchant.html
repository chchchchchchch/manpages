ENCHANT(1)                   Enchant Mini Help File                   ENCHANT(1)



NAME
       Enchant - a spellchecker

SYNOPSIS
       enchant [-a] [-d dict] [-h] [-l] [-L] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Enchant is an ispell-compatible spellchecker.

   OPTIONS
       -a     List suggestions in ispell pipe mode format.

       -d dict
              Use dictionary &lt;dict&gt;.

       -h     Show short help.

       -l     List only the misspellings.

       -L     Include the line number in the output.

       -v     Prints the program&apos;s version.

ENCHANT ORDERING FILE
       Enchant has a global and a per-user ordering file named enchant.ordering.
       It lets the user specify which spelling backend  to  use  for  individual
       languages  in  the case when you care which backend gets used. The global
       file is located in $(datadir)/enchant and the per-user file is located in
       ~/.enchant.  The per-user file takes precedence, if found.

       The  ordering  file  takes the form language_tag:&lt;comma-separated list of
       spelling backends&gt;. I am  currently  aware  of  the  following  backends:
       aspell,  myspell,  ispell,  uspell,  hspell, voikko, and zemberek. &apos;*&apos; is
       used to mean &quot;use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed oth&#8208;
       erwise.&quot; For example:

       *:aspell,myspell,ispell
       en:aspell,myspell,ispell
       en_UK:myspell,aspell,ispell
       fr:myspell,ispell:aspell

DIRECTORIES IMPORTANT TO ENCHANT
       Unless  configured otherwise, Enchant&apos;s Myspell, Ispell, and Uspell back&#8208;
       ends will look for dictionaries in directories specific to  Enchant,  and
       will  not  use your system-wide installed dictionaries. This is for prag&#8208;
       matic reasons since many distributions install  these  dictionaries  into
       different locations.

       Like  the  enchant.ordering  file  described  above, Enchant looks in the
       global directory for these dictionaries and a  per-user  directory.   The
       per-user  directory  takes  precedence if it is found.  Enchant looks for
       Myspell     dictionaries      in      $(datadir)/enchant/myspell      and
       ~/.enchant/myspell.    Enchant   looks   for   Ispell   dictionaries   in
       $(datadir)/enchant/ispell  and  ~/.enchant/ispell.   Enchant  looks   for
       Uspell dictionaries in $(datadir)/enchant/uspell and ~/.enchant/uspell.

       Packagers  and  users  may wish to make symbolic links to the system-wide
       dictionary  directories.  Or,  preferably,  use  the  --with-myspell-dir,
       --with-ispell-dir, and --with-uspell-dir &apos;configure&apos; arguments.
