NAME
       Exporter::Lite - Lightweight exporting of variables

SYNOPSIS
         package Foo;
         use Exporter::Lite;

         # Just like Exporter.
         @EXPORT       = qw($This That);
         @EXPORT_OK    = qw(@Left %Right);


         # Meanwhile, in another piece of code!
         package Bar;
         use Foo;  # exports $This and &amp;That.

DESCRIPTION
       This is an alternative to Exporter intended to provide a lightweight
       subset of its functionality.  It supports &quot;import()&quot;, @EXPORT and
       @EXPORT_OK and not a whole lot else.

       Unlike Exporter, it is not necessary to inherit from Exporter::Lite (ie.
       no &quot;@ISA = qw(Exporter::Lite)&quot; mantra).  Exporter::Lite simply exports
       its import() function.  This might be called a &quot;mix-in&quot;.

       Setting up a module to export its variables and functions is simple:

           package My::Module;
           use Exporter::Lite;

           @EXPORT = qw($Foo bar);

       now when you &quot;use My::Module&quot;, $Foo and &quot;bar()&quot; will show up.

       In order to make exporting optional, use @EXPORT_OK.

           package My::Module;
           use Exporter::Lite;

           @EXPORT_OK = qw($Foo bar);

       when My::Module is used, $Foo and &quot;bar()&quot; will not show up.  You have to
       ask for them.  &quot;use My::Module qw($Foo bar)&quot;.

Methods
       Export::Lite has one public method, import(), which is called automaticly
       when your modules is use()&apos;d.

       In normal usage you don&apos;t have to worry about this at all.

       import
             Some::Module-&gt;import;
             Some::Module-&gt;import(@symbols);

           Works just like &quot;Exporter::import()&quot; excepting it only honors
           @Some::Module::EXPORT and @Some::Module::EXPORT_OK.

           The given @symbols are exported to the current package provided they
           are in @Some::Module::EXPORT or @Some::Module::EXPORT_OK.  Otherwise
           an exception is thrown (ie. the program dies).

           If @symbols is not given, everything in @Some::Module::EXPORT is
           exported.

DIAGNOSTICS
       &apos;&quot;%s&quot; is not exported by the %s module&apos;
           Attempted to import a symbol which is not in @EXPORT or @EXPORT_OK.

       &apos;Can\&apos;t export symbol: %s&apos;
           Attempted to import a symbol of an unknown type (ie. the leading $@%
           salad wasn&apos;t recognized).

BUGS and CAVEATS
       Its not yet clear if this is actually any lighter or faster than
       Exporter.  I know its at least on par.

       OTOH, the docs are much clearer and not having to say &quot;@ISA =
       qw(Exporter)&quot; is kinda nice.
