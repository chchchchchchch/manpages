FcFileScan(3)                                                      FcFileScan(3)



NAME
       FcFileScan - scan a font file

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fontconfig.h&gt;

       FcBool  FcFileScan  (FcFontSet  *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache,
       FcBlanks *blanks, const FcChar8 *file, FcBool force);

DESCRIPTION
       Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to set.  If force is FcTrue,
       then  the  file  is  scanned  even  if associated information is found in
       cache.  If file is a directory, it is added to dirs.  Whether  fonts  are
       found  depends on fontconfig policy as well as the current configuration.
       Internally, fontconfig will ignore BDF and PCF fonts  which  are  not  in
       Unicode (or the effectively equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are
       not usable by Unicode-based applications. The  configuration  can  ignore
       fonts  based  on  filename  or  contents of the font file itself. Returns
       FcFalse if any of the fonts cannot be added (due to allocation  failure).
       Otherwise returns FcTrue.

VERSION
       Fontconfig version 2.9.0



                                  16 April 2012                    FcFileScan(3)
