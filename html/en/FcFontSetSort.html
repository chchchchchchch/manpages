FcFontSetSort(3)                                                FcFontSetSort(3)



NAME
       FcFontSetSort - Add to a font set

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fontconfig.h&gt;

       FcFontSetSort  (FcConfig  *config,  FcFontSet **sets, intnsets, FcPattern
       *pattern, FcBool trim, FcCharSet **csp, FcResult *result);

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of fonts from sets sorted by closeness to  pattern.   If
       trim is FcTrue, elements in the list which don&apos;t include Unicode coverage
       not provided by earlier elements in the list are elided.   The  union  of
       Unicode  coverage  of  all of the fonts is returned in csp, if csp is not
       NULL.  This function should be called only after  FcConfigSubstitute  and
       FcDefaultSubstitute  have  been  called for p; otherwise the results will
       not be correct.

       The returned FcFontSet  references  FcPattern  structures  which  may  be
       shared  by  the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications
       cannot modify these patterns.  Instead, they should be passed, along with
       pattern  to  FcFontRenderPrepare which combines them into a complete pat&#8208;
       tern.

       The  FcFontSet  returned  by  FcFontSetSort  is  destroyed   by   calling
       FcFontSetDestroy.

VERSION
       Fontconfig version 2.9.0
