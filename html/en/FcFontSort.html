FcFontSort(3)                                                      FcFontSort(3)



NAME
       FcFontSort - Return list of matching fonts

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fontconfig.h&gt;

       FcFontSet  *  FcFontSort  (FcConfig  *config,  FcPattern *p, FcBool trim,
       FcCharSet **csp, FcResult *result);

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of fonts sorted by closeness to p.  If trim  is  FcTrue,
       elements in the list which don&apos;t include Unicode coverage not provided by
       earlier elements in the list are elided.  The union of  Unicode  coverage
       of  all  of the fonts is returned in csp, if csp is not NULL.  This func&#8208;
       tion should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and  FcDefaultSubsti&#8208;
       tute have been called for p; otherwise the results will not be correct.

       The  returned  FcFontSet  references  FcPattern  structures  which may be
       shared by the return value from multiple FcFontSort  calls,  applications
       must  not  modify  these patterns.  Instead, they should be passed, along
       with p to FcFontRenderPrepare which combines them into  a  complete  pat&#8208;
       tern.

       The FcFontSet returned by FcFontSort is destroyed by calling FcFontSetDe&#8208;
       stroy.  If config is NULL, the current configuration is used.

VERSION
       Fontconfig version 2.9.0
