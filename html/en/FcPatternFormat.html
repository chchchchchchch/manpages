NAME
       FcPatternFormat  -  Format  a pattern into a string according to a format
       specifier

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fontconfig.h&gt;

       FcChar8 * FcPatternFormat (FcPattern *pat, const FcChar8 *format);

DESCRIPTION
       Converts given pattern pat into text described by  the  format  specifier
       format.   The  return value refers to newly allocated memory which should
       be freed by the caller using free(), or NULL if format is invalid.

       The format is loosely modeled after printf-style format string.  The for&#8208;
       mat  string  is composed of zero or more  directives: ordinary characters
       (not &quot;%&quot;), which are copied unchanged to  the  output  stream;  and  tags
       which  are interpreted to construct text from the pattern in a variety of
       ways (explained below).  Special characters can be  escaped  using  back&#8208;
       slash.   C-string  style  special characters like \n and \r are also sup&#8208;
       ported (this is useful when the format string is not a C string literal).
       It is advisable to always escape curly braces that are meant to be copied
       to the output as ordinary characters.

       Each tag is introduced by the character &quot;%&quot;, followed by an optional min&#8208;
       imum  field width, followed by tag contents in curly braces ({}).  If the
       minimum field width value is provided the tag will be  expanded  and  the
       result  padded  to achieve the minimum width.  If the minimum field width
       is positive, the padding will right-align the text.  Negative field width
       will  left-align.   The  rest of this section describes various supported
       tag contents and their expansion.

       A simple tag is one where the content is an identifier.  When simple tags
       are  expanded,  the named identifier will be looked up in pattern and the
       resulting list of values returned,  joined  together  using  comma.   For
       example,  to print the family name and style of the pattern, use the for&#8208;
       mat &quot;%{family} %{style}\n&quot;.  To extend the family column to forty charac&#8208;
       ters use &quot;%-40{family}%{style}\n&quot;.

       Simple  tags expand to list of all values for an element.  To only choose
       one of the values, one can index using  the  syntax  &quot;%{elt[idx]}&quot;.   For
       example, to get the first family name only, use &quot;%{family[0]}&quot;.

       If  a  simple  tag ends with &quot;=&quot; and the element is found in the pattern,
       the name of the element followed by &quot;=&quot; will be output before the list of
       values.   For example, &quot;%{weight=}&quot; may expand to the string &quot;weight=80&quot;.
       Or to the empty string if pattern does not have weight set.

       If a simple tag starts with &quot;:&quot; and the element is found in the  pattern,
       &quot;:&quot;  will  be printed first.  For example, combining this with the =, the
       format &quot;%{:weight=}&quot; may expand to &quot;:weight=80&quot; or to the empty string if
       pattern does not have weight set.

       If  a  simple  tag contains the string &quot;:-&quot;, the rest of the the tag con&#8208;
       tents will be used as a default string.  The default string is output  if
       the  element  is  not  found  in  the  pattern.   For example, the format
       &quot;%{:weight=:-123}&quot;  may  expand  to  &quot;:weight=80&quot;  or   to   the   string
       &quot;:weight=123&quot; if pattern does not have weight set.

       A count tag is one that starts with the character &quot;#&quot; followed by an ele&#8208;
       ment name, and expands to the number of values for  the  element  in  the
       pattern.  For example, &quot;%{#family}&quot; expands to the number of family names
       pattern has set, which may be zero.

       A sub-expression tag is one that expands a sub-expression.  The tag  con&#8208;
       tents are the sub-expression to expand placed inside another set of curly
       braces.  Sub-expression tags are  useful  for  aligning  an  entire  sub-
       expression,  or  to apply converters (explained later) to the entire sub-
       expression output.  For example, the format  &quot;%40{{%{family}  %{style}}}&quot;
       expands  the  sub-expression to construct the family name followed by the
       style, then takes the entire string and pads it on  the  left  to  be  at
       least forty characters.

       A  filter-out  tag  is  one starting with the character &quot;-&quot; followed by a
       comma-separated list of  element  names,  followed  by  a  sub-expression
       enclosed in curly braces.  The sub-expression will be expanded but with a
       pattern that has the listed elements removed from it.  For  example,  the
       format &quot;%{-size,pixelsize{sub-expr}}&quot; will expand &quot;sub-expr&quot; with pattern
       sans the size and pixelsize elements.

       A filter-in tag is one starting with the  character  &quot;+&quot;  followed  by  a
       comma-separated  list  of  element  names,  followed  by a sub-expression
       enclosed in curly braces.  The sub-expression will be expanded but with a
       pattern  that  only has the listed elements from the surrounding pattern.
       For example, the  format  &quot;%{+family,familylang{sub-expr}}&quot;  will  expand
       &quot;sub-expr&quot;  with a sub-pattern consisting only the family and family lang
       elements of pattern.

       A conditional tag is one starting with the character &quot;?&quot;  followed  by  a
       comma-separated  list  of element conditions, followed by two sub-expres&#8208;
       sion enclosed in curly braces.  An element condition can  be  an  element
       name,  in  which case it tests whether the element is defined in pattern,
       or the character &quot;!&quot; followed by an element name, in which case the  test
       is  negated.   The conditional passes if all the element conditions pass.
       The tag expands the first sub-expression if the conditional  passes,  and
       expands  the  second  sub-expression  otherwise.  For example, the format
       &quot;%{?size,dpi,!pixelsize{pass}{fail}}&quot; will expand to  &quot;pass&quot;  if  pattern
       has  size and dpi elements but no pixelsize element, and to &quot;fail&quot; other&#8208;
       wise.

       An enumerate tag is one starting with  the  string  &quot;[]&quot;  followed  by  a
       comma-separated  list  of  element  names,  followed  by a sub-expression
       enclosed in curly braces.  The list of values for the named elements  are
       walked  in parallel and the sub-expression expanded each time with a pat&#8208;
       tern just having a single value for those  elements,  starting  from  the
       first  value and continuing as long as any of those elements has a value.
       For  example,  the  format  &quot;%{[]family,familylang{%{family}   (%{family&#8208;
       lang})\n}}&quot;  will expand the pattern &quot;%{family} (%{familylang})\n&quot; with a
       pattern having only the first value of the  family  and  familylang  ele&#8208;
       ments, then expands it with the second values, then the third, etc.

       As  a  special  case,  if an enumerate tag has only one element, and that
       element has only one value in the pattern, and  that  value  is  of  type
       FcLangSet, the individual languages in the language set are enumerated.

       A  builtin  tag  is  one  starting  with  the character &quot;=&quot; followed by a
       builtin name.  The following builtins are defined:

       unparse
              Expands to the result of calling FcNameUnparse() on the pattern.

       fcmatch
              Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-match
              command on the pattern, without the final newline.

       fclist Expands  to the output of the default output format of the fc-list
              command on the pattern, without the final newline.
&#12;       fccat  Expands to the output of the default output format of  the  fc-cat
              command on the pattern, without the final newline.

       pkgkit Expands  to  the  list  of PackageKit font() tags for the pattern.
              Currently this includes tags for each family name, and  each  lan&#8208;
              guage  from  the  pattern,  enumerated and sanitized into a set of
              tags terminated by newline.  Package management  systems  can  use
              these  tags  to  tag their packages accordingly.  For example, the
              format  &quot;%{+family,style{%{=unparse}}}\n&quot;  will   expand   to   an
              unparsed  name containing only the family and style element values
              from pattern.

       The contents of any tag can be followed by a set of zero or more convert&#8208;
       ers.   A converter is specified by the character &quot;|&quot; followed by the con&#8208;
       verter name and arguments.  The following converters are defined:

       basename
              Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrBasename() on it.

       dirname
              Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDirname() on it.

       downcase
              Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDowncase() on it.

       shescape
              Escapes text for one level of shell expansion.   (Escapes  single-
              quotes, also encloses text in single-quotes.)

       cescape
              Escapes  text  such that it can be used as part of a C string lit&#8208;
              eral.  (Escapes backslash and double-quotes.)

       xmlescape
              Escapes text such that it can be used in XML and  HTML.   (Escapes
              less-than, greater-than, and ampersand.)

       delete(chars)
              Deletes  all  occurrences  of each of the characters in chars from
              the text.  FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

       escape(chars)
              Escapes all occurrences of each of  the  characters  in  chars  by
              prepending  it  by the first character in chars.  FIXME: This con&#8208;
              verter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

       translate(from,to)
              Translates all occurrences of each of the characters  in  from  by
              replacing  them  with  their corresponding character in to.  If to
              has fewer characters than from, it will be extended  by  repeating
              its last character.  FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.
              For example,  the  format  &quot;%{family|downcase|delete(  )}\n&quot;  will
              expand to the values of the family element in pattern, lower-cased
              and with spaces removed.
