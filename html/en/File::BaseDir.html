NAME
       File::BaseDir - Use the Freedesktop.org base directory specification

SYNOPSIS
               use File::BaseDir qw/xdg_data_files/;
               for ( xdg_data_files(&apos;mime/globs&apos;) ) {
                       # do something
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to find directories and files as specified by the
       Freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. This specifications gives a
       mechanism to locate directories for configuration, application data and
       cache data. It is suggested that desktop applications for e.g. the Gnome,
       KDE or Xfce platforms follow this layout. However, the same layout can
       just as well be used for non-GUI applications.

       This module forked from File::MimeInfo.

       This module follows version 0.6 of BaseDir specification.

EXPORT
       None by default, but all methods can be exported on demand.  Also the
       groups &quot;:lookup&quot; and &quot;:vars&quot; are defined. The &quot;:vars&quot; group contains all
       routines with a &quot;xdg_&quot; prefix; the &quot;:lookup&quot; group contains the routines
       to locate files and directories.

METHODS
       &quot;new()&quot;
           Simple constructor to allow Object Oriented use of this module.

   Lookup
       The following methods are used to lookup files and folders in one of the
       search paths.

       &quot;data_home(@PATH)&quot;
           Takes a list of file path elements and returns a new path by
           appending them to the data home directory. The new path does not need
           to exist.  Use this when writing user specific application data.

           Example:

             # data_home is: /home/USER/.local/share
             $path = $bd-&gt;data_home(&apos;Foo&apos;, &apos;Bar&apos;, &apos;Baz&apos;);
             # returns: /home/USER/.local/share/Foo/Bar/Baz

       &quot;data_dirs(@PATH)&quot;
           Looks for directories specified by @PATH in the data home and other
           data directories. Returns (possibly empty) list of readable
           directories. In scalar context only the first directory found is
           returned. Use this to lookup application data.

       &quot;data_files(@PATH)&quot;
           Looks for files specified by @PATH in the data home and other data
           directories. Only returns files that are readable. In scalar context
           only the first file found is returned. Use this to lookup application
           data.

       &quot;config_home(@PATH)&quot;
           Takes a list of path elements and appends them to the config home
           directory returning a new path. The new path does not need to exist.
           Use this when writing user specific configuration.

       &quot;config_dirs(@PATH)&quot;
           Looks for directories specified by @PATH in the config home and other
           config directories. Returns (possibly empty) list of readable
           directories. In scalar context only the first directory found is
           returned. Use this to lookup configuration.

       &quot;config_files(@PATH)&quot;
           Looks for files specified by @PATH in the config home and other
           config directories. Returns a (possibly empty) list of files that are
           readable. In scalar context only the first file found is returned.
           Use this to lookup configuration.

       &quot;cache_home(@PATH)&quot;
           Takes a list of path elements and appends them to the cache home
           directory returning a new path. The new path does not need to exist.

   Variables
       The following methods only returns the value of one of the XDG variables.

       &quot;xdg_data_home&quot;
           Returns either $ENV{XDG_DATA_HOME} or it&apos;s default value.  Default is
           $HOME/.local/share.

       &quot;xdg_data_dirs&quot;
           Returns either $ENV{XDG_DATA_DIRS} or it&apos;s default value as list.
           Default is /usr/local/share, /usr/share.

       &quot;xdg_config_home&quot;
           Returns either $ENV{XDG_CONFIG_HOME} or it&apos;s default value.  Default
           is $HOME/.config.

       &quot;xdg_config_dirs&quot;
           Returns either $ENV{XDG_CONFIG_DIRS} or it&apos;s default value as list.
           Default is /etc/xdg.

       &quot;xdg_cache_home&quot;
           Returns either $ENV{XDG_CACHE_HOME} or it&apos;s default value.  Default
           is $HOME/.cache.

NON-UNIX PLATFORMS
       The use of File::Spec ensures that all paths are returned in the
       apropriate form for the current platform. On Windows this module will try
       to set $HOME to a sensible value if it is not defined yet. On other
       platforms one can use e.g. File::HomeDir to set $HOME before loading
       File::BaseDir.

       Please note that the specification is targeting Unix platforms only and
       will only have limited relevance on other platforms. Any platform
       dependend behavior in this module should be considerd an extension of the
       spec.

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
       The methods &quot;xdg_data_files()&quot; and &quot;xdg_config_files()&quot; are exported for
       backwards compatibility with version 0.02. They are identical to
       &quot;data_files()&quot; and &quot;config_files()&quot; respectively but without the
       &quot;wantarray&quot; behavior.

BUGS
       Please mail the author if you encounter any bugs.
