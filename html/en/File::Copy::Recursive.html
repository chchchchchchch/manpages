NAME
       File::Copy::Recursive - Perl extension for recursively copying files and
       directories

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Copy::Recursive qw(fcopy rcopy dircopy fmove rmove dirmove);

         fcopy($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;
         rcopy($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;
         dircopy($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;

         fmove($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;
         rmove($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;
         dirmove($orig,$new[,$buf]) or die $!;

         rcopy_glob(&quot;orig/stuff-*&quot;, $trg [, $buf]) or die $!;
         rmove_glob(&quot;orig/stuff-*&quot;, $trg [,$buf]) or die $!;

DESCRIPTION
       This module copies and moves directories recursively (or single files,
       well... singley) to an optional depth and attempts to preserve each file
       or directory&apos;s mode.

EXPORT
       None by default. But you can export all the functions as in the example
       above and the path* functions if you wish.

   fcopy()
       This function uses File::Copy&apos;s copy() function to copy a file but not a
       directory. Any directories are recursively created if need be.  One
       difference to File::Copy::copy() is that fcopy attempts to preserve the
       mode (see Preserving Mode below) The optional $buf in the synopsis if the
       same as File::Copy::copy()&apos;s 3rd argument returns the same as
       File::Copy::copy() in scalar context and 1,0,0 in list context to
       accomidate rcopy()&apos;s list context on regular files. (See below for more
       info)

   dircopy()
       This function recursively traverses the $orig directory&apos;s structure and
       recursively copies it to the $new directory.  $new is created if
       necessary (multiple non existant directories is ok (IE foo/bar/baz). The
       script logically and portably creates all of them if necessary).  It
       attempts to preserve the mode (see Preserving Mode below) and by default
       it copies all the way down into the directory, (see Managing Depth)
       below.  If a directory is not specified it croaks just like fcopy croaks
       if its not a file that is specified.

       returns true or false, for true in scalar context it returns the number
       of files and directories copied, In list context it returns the number of
       files and directories, number of directories only, depth level traversed.

         my $num_of_files_and_dirs = dircopy($orig,$new);
         my($num_of_files_and_dirs,$num_of_dirs,$depth_traversed) = dircopy($orig,$new);

       Normally it stops and return&apos;s if a copy fails, to continue on regardless
       set $File::Copy::Recursive::SkipFlop to true.

           local $File::Copy::Recursive::SkipFlop = 1;

       That way it will copy everythgingit can ina directory and won&apos;t stop
       because of permissions, etc...
&#12;   rcopy()
       This function will allow you to specify a file *or* directory. It calls
       fcopy() if its a file and dircopy() if its a directory.  If you call
       rcopy() (or fcopy() for that matter) on a file in list context, the
       values will be 1,0,0 since no directories and no depth are used.  This is
       important becasue if its a directory in list context and there is only
       the initial directory the return value is 1,1,1.

   rcopy_glob()
       This function lets you specify a pattern suitable for perl&apos;s glob() as
       the first argument. Subsequently each path returned by perl&apos;s glob() gets
       rcopy()ied.

       It returns and array whose items are array refs that contain the return
       value of each rcopy() call.

       It forces behavior as if $File::Copy::Recursive::CPRFComp is true.

   fmove()
       Copies the file then removes the original. You can manage the path the
       original file is in according to $RemvBase.

   dirmove()
       Uses dircopy() to copy the directory then removes the original. You can
       manage the path the original directory is in according to $RemvBase.

   rmove()
       Like rcopy() but calls fmove() or dirmove() instead.

   rmove_glob()
       Like rcopy_glob() but calls rmove() instead of rcopy()

       $RemvBase

       Default is false. When set to true the *move() functions will not only
       attempt to remove the original file or directory but will remove the
       given path it is in.

       So if you:

          rmove(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;, &apos;/etc/&apos;);
          # &quot;baz&quot; is removed from foo/bar after it is successfully copied to /etc/

          local $File::Copy::Recursive::Remvbase = 1;
          rmove(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;,&apos;/etc/&apos;);
          # if baz is successfully copied to /etc/ :
          # first &quot;baz&quot; is removed from foo/bar
          # then &quot;foo/bar is removed via pathrm()

       $ForcePth

       Default is false. When set to true it calls pathempty() before any
       directories are removed to empty the directory so it can be rmdir()&apos;ed
       when $RemvBase is in effect.

   Creating and Removing Paths
       $NoFtlPth

       Default is false. If set to true  rmdir(), mkdir(), and pathempty() calls
       in pathrm() and pathmk() do not return() on failure.

       If its set to true they just silently go about their business regardless.
       This isn&apos;t a good idea but its there if you want it.

       $DirPerms
&#12;       Mode to pass to any mkdir() calls. Defaults to 0777 as per umask()&apos;s POD.
       Explicitly having this allows older perls to be able to use FCR and might
       add a bit of flexibility for you.

       Any value you set it to should be suitable for oct()

       Path functions

       These functions exist soley because they were necessary for the move and
       copy functions to have the features they do and not because they are of
       themselves the purpose of this module. That being said, here is how they
       work so you can understand how the copy and move funtions work and use
       them by themselves if you wish.

       pathrm()

       Removes a given path recursively. It removes the *entire* path so be
       carefull!!!

       Returns 2 if the given path is not a directory.

         File::Copy::Recursive::pathrm(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;) or die $!;
         # foo no longer exists

       Same as:

         rmdir &apos;foo/bar/baz&apos; or die $!;
         rmdir &apos;foo/bar&apos; or die $!;
         rmdir &apos;foo&apos; or die $!;

       An optional second argument makes it call pathempty() before any
       rmdir()&apos;s when set to true.

         File::Copy::Recursive::pathrm(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;, 1) or die $!;
         # foo no longer exists

       Same as:PFSCheck

         File::Copy::Recursive::pathempty(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;) or die $!;
         rmdir &apos;foo/bar/baz&apos; or die $!;
         File::Copy::Recursive::pathempty(&apos;foo/bar/&apos;) or die $!;
         rmdir &apos;foo/bar&apos; or die $!;
         File::Copy::Recursive::pathempty(&apos;foo/&apos;) or die $!;
         rmdir &apos;foo&apos; or die $!;

       An optional third argument acts like $File::Copy::Recursive::NoFtlPth,
       again probably not a good idea.

       pathempty()

       Recursively removes the given directory&apos;s contents so it is empty.
       returns 2 if argument is not a directory, 1 on successfully emptying the
       directory.

          File::Copy::Recursive::pathempty($pth) or die $!;
          # $pth is now an empty directory

       pathmk()

       Creates a given path recursively. Creates foo/bar/baz even if foo does
       not exist.

          File::Copy::Recursive::pathmk(&apos;foo/bar/baz&apos;) or die $!;

       An optional second argument if true acts just like
       $File::Copy::Recursive::NoFtlPth, which means you&apos;d never get your die()
       if something went wrong. Again, probably a *bad* idea.

       pathrmdir()

       Same as rmdir() but it calls pathempty() first to recursively empty it
       first since rmdir can not remove a directory with contents.  Just removes
       the top directory the path given instead of the entire path like
       pathrm(). Return 2 if given argument does not exist (IE its already
       gone). Return false if it exists but is not a directory.

   Preserving Mode
       By default a quiet attempt is made to change the new file or directory to
       the mode of the old one.  To turn this behavior off set
         $File::Copy::Recursive::KeepMode to false;

   Managing Depth
       You can set the maximum depth a directory structure is recursed by
       setting:
         $File::Copy::Recursive::MaxDepth to a whole number greater than 0.

   SymLinks
       If your system supports symlinks then symlinks will be copied as symlinks
       instead of as the target file.  Perl&apos;s symlink() is used instead of
       File::Copy&apos;s copy() You can customize this behavior by setting
       $File::Copy::Recursive::CopyLink to a true or false value.  It is already
       set to true or false dending on your system&apos;s support of symlinks so you
       can check it with an if statement to see how it will behave:

           if($File::Copy::Recursive::CopyLink) {
               print &quot;Symlinks will be preserved\n&quot;;
           } else {
               print &quot;Symlinks will not be preserved because your system does not support it\n&quot;;
           }

       If symlinks are being copied you can set $File::Copy::Recursive::BdTrgWrn
       to true to make it carp when it copies a link whose target does not
       exist. Its false by default.

           local $File::Copy::Recursive::BdTrgWrn  = 1;

   Removing existing target file or directory before copying.
       This can be done by setting $File::Copy::Recursive::RMTrgFil or
       $File::Copy::Recursive::RMTrgDir for file or directory behavior
       respectively.

       0 = off (This is the default)

       1 = carp() $! if removal fails

       2 = return if removal fails

           local $File::Copy::Recursive::RMTrgFil = 1;
           fcopy($orig, $target) or die $!;
           # if it fails it does warn() and keeps going

           local $File::Copy::Recursive::RMTrgDir = 2;
           dircopy($orig, $target) or die $!;
           # if it fails it does your &quot;or die&quot;

       This should be unnecessary most of the time but its there if you need it
       :)

   Turning off stat() check
       By default the files or directories are checked to see if they are the
       same (IE linked, or two paths (absolute/relative or different relative
       paths) to the same file) by comparing the file&apos;s stat() info.  It&apos;s a
       very efficient check that croaks if they are and shouldn&apos;t be turned off
       but if you must for some weird reason just set
       $File::Copy::Recursive::PFSCheck to a false value. (&quot;PFS&quot; stands for
       &quot;Physical File System&quot;)

   Emulating cp -rf dir1/ dir2/
       By default dircopy($dir1,$dir2) will put $dir1&apos;s contents right into
       $dir2 whether $dir2 exists or not.

       You can make dircopy() emulate cp -rf by setting
       $File::Copy::Recursive::CPRFComp to true.

       NOTE: This only emulates -f in the sense that it does not prompt. It does
       not remove the target file or directory if it exists.  If you need to do
       that then use the variables $RMTrgFil and $RMTrgDir described in
       &quot;Removing existing target file or directory before copying&quot; above.

       That means that if $dir2 exists it puts the contents into $dir2/$dir1
       instead of $dir2 just like cp -rf.  If $dir2 does not exist then the
       contents go into $dir2 like normal (also like cp -rf)

       So assuming &apos;foo/file&apos;:

           dircopy(&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;) or die $!;
           # if bar does not exist the result is bar/file
           # if bar does exist the result is bar/file

           $File::Copy::Recursive::CPRFComp = 1;
           dircopy(&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;) or die $!;
           # if bar does not exist the result is bar/file
           # if bar does exist the result is bar/foo/file

       You can also specify a star for cp -rf glob type behavior:

           dircopy(&apos;foo/*&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;) or die $!;
           # if bar does not exist the result is bar/file
           # if bar does exist the result is bar/file

           $File::Copy::Recursive::CPRFComp = 1;
           dircopy(&apos;foo/*&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;) or die $!;
           # if bar does not exist the result is bar/file
           # if bar does exist the result is bar/file

       NOTE: The &apos;*&apos; is only like cp -rf foo/* and *DOES NOT EXPAND PARTIAL
       DIRECTORY NAMES LIKE YOUR SHELL DOES* (IE not like cp -rf fo* to copy
       foo/*)

   Allowing Copy Loops
       If you want to allow:

         cp -rf . foo/

       type behavior set $File::Copy::Recursive::CopyLoop to true.

       This is false by default so that a check is done to see if the source
       directory will contain the target directory and croaks to avoid this
       problem.

       If you ever find a situation where $CopyLoop = 1 is desirable let me know
       (IE its a bad bad idea but is there if you want it)

       (Note: On Windows this was necessary since it uses stat() to detemine
       samedness and stat() is essencially useless for this on Windows.  The
       test is now simply skipped on Windows but I&apos;d rather have an actual
       reliable check if anyone in Microsoft land would care to share)

TO DO
       I am currently working on and reviewing some other modules to use in the
       new interface so we can lose the horrid globals as well as some other
       undesirable traits and also more easily make available some long standing
       requests.

       Tests will be easier to do with the new interface and hence the testing
       focus will shift to the new interface and aim to be comprehensive.

       The old interface will work, it just won&apos;t be brought in until it is
       used, so it will add no overhead for users of the new interface.

       I&apos;ll add this after the latest verision has been out for a while with no
       new features or issues found :)
