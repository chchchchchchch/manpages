NAME
       File::DesktopEntry - Object to handle .desktop files

SYNOPSIS
               use File::DesktopEntry;

               my $entry = File::DesktopEntry-&gt;new(&apos;firefox&apos;);

               print &quot;Using &quot;.$entry-&gt;Name.&quot; to open http://perl.org\n&quot;;
               $entry-&gt;run(&apos;http://perl.org&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to work with .desktop files. The format of these
       files is specified by the freedesktop &quot;Desktop Entry&quot; specification. This
       module can parse these files but also knows how to run the applciations
       defined by these files.

       For this module version 1.0 of the specification was used.

       This module was written to support File::MimeInfo::Applications.

       Please remember: case is significant for the names of Desktop Entry keys.

VARIABLES
       You can set the global variable $File::DesktopEntry::VERBOSE. If set the
       module print a warning every time a command gets executed.

       The global variable $File::DesktopEntry::LOCALE tells you what the
       default locale being used is. However, changing it will not change the
       default locale.

AUTOLOAD
       All methods that start with a capital are autoloaded as &quot;get(KEY)&quot; where
       key is the autoloaded method name.

METHODS
       &quot;new(FILE)&quot;
       &quot;new(\$TEXT)&quot;
       &quot;new(NAME)&quot;
           Constructor. FILE, NAME or TEXT are optional arguments.

           When a name is given (a string without &apos;&quot;/&quot;&apos;, &apos;&quot;\&quot;&apos; or &apos;&quot;.&quot;&apos;) a
           lookup is done using File::BaseDir. If the file found in this lookup
           is not writable or if no file was found, the XDG_DATA_HOME path will
           be used when writing.

       &quot;lookup(NAME)&quot;
           Returns a filename for a desktop entry with desktop file id NAME.

       &quot;wants_uris( )&quot;
           Returns true if the Exec string for this desktop entry specifies that
           the application uses URIs instead of paths. This can be used to
           determine whether an application uses a VFS library.

       &quot;wants_list( )&quot;
           Returns true if the Exec tring for this desktop entry specifies that
           the application can handle multiple arguments at once.

       &quot;run(@FILES)&quot;
           Forks and runs the application specified in this Desktop Entry with
           arguments FILES as a background process. Returns the pid.
&#12;           The child process fails when this is not a Desktop Entry of type
           Application or if the Exec key is missing or invalid.

           If the desktop entry specifies that the program needs to be executed
           in a terminal the $TERMINAL environment variable is used. If this
           variable is not set &quot;xterm -e&quot; is used as default.

           (On Windows this method returns a Win32::Process object.)

       &quot;system(@FILES)&quot;
           Like &quot;run()&quot; but using the &quot;system()&quot; system call.  It only return
           after the application has ended.

       &quot;exec(@FILES)&quot;
           Like &quot;run()&quot; but using the &quot;exec()&quot; system call. This method is
           expected not to return but to replace the current process with the
           application you try to run.

           On Windows this method doesn&apos;t always work the way you want it to due
           to the &quot;fork()&quot; emulation on this platform. Try using &quot;run()&quot; or
           &quot;system()&quot; instead.

       &quot;parse_Exec(@FILES)&quot;
           Expands the Exec format in this desktop entry with. Returns a
           properly quoted string in scalar context or a list of words in list
           context. Dies when the Exec key is invalid.

           It supports the following fields:

                   %f      single file
                   %F      multiple files
                   %u      single url
                   %U      multiple urls
                   %i      Icon field prefixed by --icon
                   %c      Name field, possibly translated
                   %k      location of this .desktop file
                   %%      literal &apos;%&apos;

           If necessary this method tries to convert between paths and URLs but
           this is not perfect.

           Fields that are deprecated, but (still) supported by this module:

                   %d      single directory
                   %D      multiple directories

           The fields %n, %N, %v and %m are deprecated and will cause a warning
           if $VERBOSE is used. Any other unknown fields will cause an error.

           The fields %F, %U, %D and %i can only occur as seperate words because
           they expand to multiple arguments.

           Also see &quot;LIMITATIONS&quot;.

       &quot;get(KEY)&quot;
       &quot;get(GROUP, KEY)&quot;
           Get a value for KEY from GROUP. If GROUP is not specified &apos;Desktop
           Entry&apos; is used. All values are treated as string, so e.g. booleans
           will be returned as the literal strings &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

           When KEY does not contain a language code you get the translation in
           the current locale if available or a sensible default. The request a
           specific language you can add the language part. E.g.
           &quot;$entry-&gt;get(&apos;Name[nl_NL]&apos;)&quot; can return either the value of the
           &apos;Name[nl_NL]&apos;, the &apos;Name[nl]&apos; or the &apos;Name&apos; key in the Desktop Entry
           file. Exact language parsing order can be found in the spec. To force
           you get the untranslated key use either &apos;Name[C]&apos; or &apos;Name[POSIX]&apos;.

       &quot;set(KEY =&gt; VALUE, ...)&quot;
       &quot;set(GROUP, KEY =&gt; VALUE, ...)&quot;
           Set values for one or more keys. If GROUP is not given &quot;Desktop
           Entry&quot; is used.  All values are treated as strings, backslashes,
           newlines and tabs are escaped.  To set a boolean key you need to use
           the literal strings &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

           Unlike the &quot;get()&quot; call languages are not handled automatically for
           &quot;set()&quot;.  KEY should include the language part if you want to set a
           translation.  E.g. &quot;$entry-&gt;set(&quot;Name[nl_NL]&quot; =&gt; &quot;Tekst Verwerker&quot;)&quot;
           will set a Dutch translation for the Name key. Using either &quot;Name[C]&quot;
           or &quot;Name[POSIX]&quot; will be equivalent with not giving a language
           argument.

           When setting the the Exec key without specifying a group it will be
           parsed and quoted correctly as required by the spec. You can use
           quoted arguments to include whitespace in a argument, escaping
           whitespace does not work.  To circumvent this quoting explicitly give
           the group name &apos;Desktop Entry&apos;.

       &quot;text()&quot;
           Returns the (modified) text of the file.

       &quot;read(FILE)&quot;
       &quot;read(\$SCALAR)&quot;
           Read Desktop Entry data from file or memory buffer.  Without argument
           defaults to file given at constructor.

           If you gave a file, text buffer or name to the constructor this
           method will be called automatically.

       &quot;read_fh(IO)&quot;
           Read Desktop Entry data from filehandle or IO object.

       &quot;write(FILE)&quot;
           Write the Desktop Entry data to FILE. Without arguments it writes to
           the filename given to the constructor if any.

           The keys Name and Type are required. Type can be either
           &quot;Application&quot;, &quot;Link&quot; or &quot;Directory&quot;. For an application set the
           optional key &quot;Exec&quot;. For a link set the &quot;URL&quot; key.

   Backwards Compatibility
       Methods supported for backwards compatibility with 0.02.

       &quot;new_from_file(FILE)&quot;
           Alias for &quot;new(FILE)&quot;.

       &quot;new_from_data(TEXT)&quot;
           Alias for &quot;new(\$TEXT)&quot;.

       &quot;get_value(NAME, GROUP, LANG)&quot;
           Identical to &quot;get(GROUP, &quot;NAME[LANG]&quot;)&quot;.  LANG defaults to &apos;C&apos;, GROUP
           is optional.

NON-UNIX PLATFORMS
       This module has a few bit of code to make it save on Windows. It handles
       &quot;file://&quot; uri a bit different and it uses Win32::Process. On other
       platforms your mileage may vary.

       Please note that the specification is targeting Unix platforms only and
       will only have limited relevance on other platforms. Any platform
       dependend behavior in this module should be considerd an extension of the
       spec.

LIMITATIONS
       If you try to exec a remote file with an application that can only handle
       files on the local file system we should -according to the spec- download
       the file to a temp location. This is not supported. Use the
       &quot;wants_uris()&quot; method to check if an application supports urls.

       The values of the various Desktop Entry keys are not parsed (except for
       the Exec key). This means that booleans will be returned as the strings
       &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; and lists will still be &quot;;&quot; seperated.

       If the icon is given as name and not as path it should be resolved for
       the %i code in the Exec key. We need a seperate module for the icon spec
       to deal with this.

       Files are read and writen using utf8, this is not available on perl
       versions before 5.8. As a result for older perl versions translations in
       UTF-8 will not be translated properly.

       According to the spec comments can contain any encoding. However since
       this module read files as utf8, invalid UTF-8 characters in a comment
       will cause an error.

       There is no support for Legacy-Mixed Encoding. Everybody is using utf8
       now ... right ?
