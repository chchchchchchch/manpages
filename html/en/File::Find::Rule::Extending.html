NAME
       File::Find::Rule::Extending - the mini-guide to extending
       File::Find::Rule

SYNOPSIS
        package File::Find::Rule::Random;
        use strict;

        # take useful things from File::Find::Rule
        use base &apos;File::Find::Rule&apos;;

        # and force our crack into the main namespace
        sub File::Find::Rule::random () {
            my $self = shift()-&gt;_force_object;
            $self-&gt;exec( sub { rand &gt; 0.5 } );
        }

        1;

DESCRIPTION
       File::Find::Rule went down so well with the buying public that everyone
       wanted to add extra features.  With the 0.07 release this became a
       possibility, using the following conventions.

   Declare your package
        package File::Find::Rule::Random;
        use strict;

   Inherit methods from File::Find::Rule
        # take useful things from File::Find::Rule
        use base &apos;File::Find::Rule&apos;;

       Force your madness into the main package

        # and force our crack into the main namespace
        sub File::Find::Rule::random () {
            my $self = shift()-&gt;_force_object;
            $self-&gt;exec( sub { rand &gt; 0.5 } );
        }

       Yes, we&apos;re being very cavalier here and defining things into the main
       File::Find::Rule namespace.  This is due to lack of imaginiation on my
       part - I simply can&apos;t find a way for the functional and oo interface to
       work without doing this or some kind of inheritance, and inheritance
       stops you using two File::Find::Rule::Foo modules together.

       For this reason try and pick distinct names for your extensions.  If this
       becomes a problem then I may institute a semi-official registry of taken
       names.

   Taking no arguments.
       Note the null prototype on random.  This is a cheat for the procedural
       interface to know that your sub takes no arguments, and so allows this to
       happen:

        find( random =&gt; in =&gt; &apos;.&apos; );

       If you hadn&apos;t declared &quot;random&quot; with a null prototype it would have
       consumed &quot;in&quot; as a parameter to it, then got all confused as it doesn&apos;t
       know about a &apos;.&apos; rule.

       File::Find::Rule::MMagic was the first extension module, so maybe check
