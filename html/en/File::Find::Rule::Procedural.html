NAME
       File::Find::Rule::Procedural - File::Find::Rule&apos;s procedural interface

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Find::Rule;

         # find all .pm files, procedurally
         my @files = find(file =&gt; name =&gt; &apos;*.pm&apos;, in =&gt; \@INC);

DESCRIPTION
       In addition to the regular object-oriented interface, File::Find::Rule
       provides two subroutines for you to use.

       &quot;find( @clauses )&quot;
       &quot;rule( @clauses )&quot;
           &quot;find&quot; and &quot;rule&quot; can be used to invoke any methods available to the
           OO version.  &quot;rule&quot; is a synonym for &quot;find&quot;

       Passing more than one value to a clause is done with an anonymous array:

        my $finder = find( name =&gt; [ &apos;*.mp3&apos;, &apos;*.ogg&apos; ] );

       &quot;find&quot; and &quot;rule&quot; both return a File::Find::Rule instance, unless one of
       the arguments is &quot;in&quot;, in which case it returns a list of things that
       match the rule.

        my @files = find( name =&gt; [ &apos;*.mp3&apos;, &apos;*.ogg&apos; ], in =&gt; $ENV{HOME} );

       Please note that &quot;in&quot; will be the last clause evaluated, and so this code
       will search for mp3s regardless of size.

        my @files = find( name =&gt; &apos;*.mp3&apos;, in =&gt; $ENV{HOME}, size =&gt; &apos;&lt;2k&apos; );
                                                           ^
                                                           |
                      Clause processing stopped here ------/

       It is also possible to invert a single rule by prefixing it with &quot;!&quot;
       like so:

        # large files that aren&apos;t videos
        my @files = find( file    =&gt;
                          &apos;!name&apos; =&gt; [ &apos;*.avi&apos;, &apos;*.mov&apos; ],
                          size    =&gt; &apos;&gt;20M&apos;,
                          in      =&gt; $ENV{HOME} );
