NAME
       File::MimeInfo::Applications - Find programs to open a file by mimetype

SYNOPSIS
         use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
         use File::MimeInfo::Applications;

         my $file = &apos;/foo/bar&apos;;
         my $mimetype = mimetype($file)
             || die &quot;Could not find mimetype for $file\n&quot;;

         my ($default, @other) = mime_applications($mimetype);

         if (defined $default) {
             $default-&gt;system($file)
         }
         else {
                 # prompt user with choice from @others
                 # ...
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module tries to find applications that can open files with a certain
       mimetype. This is done in the way suggested by the freedesktop Desktop
       Entry specification. This module is intended to be compatible with file
       managers and other applications that implement this specification.

       This module depends on File::DesktopEntry being installed.

       To use this module effectively you need to have the desktop-file-utils
       package from freedesktop and run update-desktop-database after installing
       new .desktop files.  See
       http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils
       &lt;http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils&gt;.

       At the moment of writing this module is compatible with the way Nautilus
       (Gnome) and with Thunar (XFCE) handle applications for mimetypes. I
       understand KDE is still working on implementing the freedesktop mime
       specifications but will follow. At the very least all perl applications
       using this module are using the same defaults.

EXPORT
       All methods are exported by default.

METHODS
       &quot;mime_applications(MIMETYPE)&quot;
           Returns an array of File::DesktopEntry objects. The first is the
           default application for this mimetype, the rest are applications that
           say they can handle this mimetype.

           If the first result is undefined there is no default application and
           it is good practise to ask the user which application he wants to
           use.

       &quot;mime_applications_all(MIMETYPE)&quot;
           Like &quot;mime_applications()&quot; but also takes into account applications
           that can open mimetypes from which MIMETYPE inherits. Parent
           mimetypes tell aomething about the data format, all code inherits
           from text/plain for example.

       &quot;mime_applications_set_default(MIMETYPE, APPLICATION)&quot;
           Save a default application for this mimetype. This action will affect
           other applications using the same mechanism to find a default
           appliction.

           APPLICATION can either be a File::DesktopEntry object or the basename
           of a .desktop file.

       &quot;mime_applications_set_custom(MIMETYPE, COMMAND)&quot;
           Save a custom shell command as default application.  Generates a
           DesktopEntry file on the fly and calls
           &quot;mime_applications_set_custom&quot;.  Returns the DesktopEntry object.

           No checks are done at all on COMMAND.  It should however contain at
           least one word.

NOTES
       At present the file with defaults is
       $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/defaults.list.  This file is not specified in
       any freedesktop spec and if it gets standardized it should probably be
       located in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. For this module I tried to implement the
       status quo.
