NAME
       File::MimeInfo::Cookbook - various code snippets

DESCRIPTION
       Some code snippets for non-basic uses of the File::MimeInfo module:

       Matching an extension
           A file does not have to actually exist in order to get a mimetype for
           it. This means that the following will work:

             my $extension = &apos;*.txt&apos;;
             my $mimetype = mimetype( $extension );

       Mimetyping an scalar
           If you want to find the mimetype of a scalar value you need magic
           mimetyping; after all a scalar doesn&apos;t have a filename or inode.
           What you need to do is to use IO::Scalar :

             use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
             use IO::Scalar;

             my $io_scalar = new IO::Scalar \$data;
             my $mimetype = mimetype( $io_scalar );

           In fact most other &quot;IO::&quot; will work as long as they support the
           &quot;seek()&quot; and &quot;read()&quot; methods. Of course if you want really obscure
           things to happen you can always write your own IO object and feed it
           in there.

           Be aware that when using a filehandle like this you need to set the
           &quot;:utf8&quot; binmode yourself if apropriate.

       Mimetyping a filehandle
           Regrettably for non-seekable filehandles like STDIN simply using an
           &quot;IO::&quot; object will not work. You will need to buffer enough of the
           data for a proper mimetyping. For example you could mimetype data
           from STDIN like this:

             use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
             use IO::Scalar;

             my $data;
             read(STDIN, $data, $File::MimeInfo::Magic::max_buffer);
             my $io_scalar = new IO::Scalar \$data;
             my $mimetype = mimetype( $io_scalar );

           Be aware that when using a filehandle like this you need to set the
           &quot;:utf8&quot; binmode yourself if apropriate.

       Creating a new filename
           Say you have a temporary file that you want to save with a more
           proper filename.

             use File::MimeInfo::Magic qw#mimetype extensions#;
             use File::Copy;

             my $tmpfile = &apos;/tmp/foo&apos;;
             my $mimetype = mimetype($tmpfile);
             my $extension = extensions($mimetype);
             my $newfile = &apos;untitled1&apos;;
             $newfile .= &apos;.&apos;.$extension if length $extension;
             move($tmpfile, $newfile);

       Force the use of a certain database directory
           Normally you just need to add the dir where your mime database lives
           to either the XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables
           for it to be found. But in some rare cases you may want to by-pass
           this system all together. Try one of the following:

             @File::MimeInfo::DIRS = (&apos;/home/me/share/mime&apos;);
             eval &apos;use File::MimeInfo&apos;;
             die if $@;

           or:

             use File::MimeInfo;
             @File::MimeInfo::DIRS = (&apos;/home/me/share/mime&apos;);
             File::MimeInfo-&gt;rehash();

           This can also be used for switching between databases at run time
           while leaving other XDG configuration stuff alone.
