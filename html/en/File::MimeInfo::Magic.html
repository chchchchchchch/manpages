NAME
       File::MimeInfo::Magic - Determine file type with magic

SYNOPSIS
               use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
               my $mime_type = mimetype($file);

DESCRIPTION
       This module inherits from File::MimeInfo, it is transparent to its
       functions but adds support for the freedesktop magic file.

       Magic data is hashed when you need it for the first time.  If you want to
       force hashing earlier use the &quot;rehash()&quot; function.

EXPORT
       The method &quot;mimetype&quot; is exported by default. The methods &quot;magic&quot;,
       &quot;inodetype&quot;, &quot;globs&quot; and &quot;describe&quot; can be exported on demand.

METHODS
       See also File::MimeInfo for methods that are inherited.

       &quot;mimetype($file)&quot;
           Returns a mime-type string for $file, returns undef on failure.

           This method bundles &quot;inodetype()&quot;, &quot;globs()&quot; and &quot;magic()&quot;.

           Magic rules with an priority of 80 and higher are checked before
           &quot;globs()&quot; is called, all other magic rules afterwards.

           If this doesn&apos;t work the file is read and the mime-type defaults to
           &apos;text/plain&apos; or to &apos;application/octet-stream&apos; when the first ten
           chars of the file match ascii control chars (white spaces excluded).
           If the file doesn&apos;t exist or isn&apos;t readable &quot;undef&quot; is returned.

           If $file is an object reference only &quot;magic&quot; and the default method
           are used. See below for details.

       &quot;magic($file)&quot;
           Returns a mime-type string for $file based on the magic rules,
           returns undef on failure.

           $file can be an object reference, in that case it is supposed to have
           a &quot;seek()&quot; and a &quot;read()&quot; method. This allows you for example to
           determine the mimetype of data in memory by using IO::Scalar.

           Be aware that when using a filehandle or an &quot;IO::&quot; object you need to
           set the &quot;:utf8&quot; binmode yourself if apropriate.

       &quot;rehash()&quot;
           Rehash the data files. Glob and magic information is preparsed when
           this method is called.

           If you want to by-pass the XDG basedir system you can specify your
           database directories by setting @File::MimeInfo::DIRS. But normally
           it is better to change the XDG basedir environment variables.

       &quot;default&quot;
       &quot;describe&quot;
       &quot;extensions&quot;
       &quot;globs&quot;
       &quot;inodetype&quot;
           These routines are imported from File::MimeInfo.
