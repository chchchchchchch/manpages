NAME
       File::Slurp - Simple and Efficient Reading/Writing/Modifying of Complete
       Files

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Slurp;

       # read in a whole file into a scalar
         my $text = read_file( &apos;filename&apos; ) ;

       # read in a whole file into an array of lines
         my @lines = read_file( &apos;filename&apos; ) ;

       # write out a whole file from a scalar
         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, $text ) ;

       # write out a whole file from an array of lines
         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, @lines ) ;

       # Here is a simple and fast way to load and save a simple config file #
       made of key=value lines.
         my %conf = read_file( $file_name ) =~ /^(\w+)=(.*)$/mg ;
         write_file( $file_name, {atomic =&gt; 1}, map &quot;$_=$conf{$_}\n&quot;, keys %conf
       ) ;

       # insert text at the beginning of a file
         prepend_file( &apos;filename&apos;, $text ) ;

       # in-place edit to replace all &apos;foo&apos; with &apos;bar&apos; in file
         edit_file { s/foo/bar/g } &apos;filename&apos; ;

       # in-place edit to delete all lines with &apos;foo&apos; from file
         edit_file_lines sub { $_ = &apos;&apos; if /foo/ }, &apos;filename&apos; ;

       # read in a whole directory of file names (skipping . and ..)
         my @files = read_dir( &apos;/path/to/dir&apos; ) ;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire files
       with one simple call. They are designed to be simple to use, have
       flexible ways to pass in or get the file contents and to be very
       efficient.  There is also a sub to read in all the files in a directory
       other than &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;

       These slurp/spew subs work for files, pipes and sockets, stdio, pseudo-
       files, and the DATA handle. Read more about why slurping files is a good
       thing in the file &apos;slurp_article.pod&apos; in the extras/ directory.

       If you are interested in how fast these calls work, check out the
       slurp_bench.pl program in the extras/ directory. It compares many
       different forms of slurping. You can select the I/O direction, context
       and file sizes. Use the --help option to see how to run it.

   read_file
       This sub reads in an entire file and returns its contents to the caller.
       In scalar context it returns the entire file as a single scalar. In list
       context it will return a list of lines (using the current value of $/ as
       the separator including support for paragraph mode when it is set to &apos;&apos;).

         my $text = read_file( &apos;filename&apos; ) ;
         my $bin = read_file( &apos;filename&apos; { binmode =&gt; &apos;:raw&apos; } ) ;
         my @lines = read_file( &apos;filename&apos; ) ;
         my $lines = read_file( &apos;filename&apos;, array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
&#12;       The first argument is the file to slurp in. If the next argument is a
       hash reference, then it is used as the options. Otherwise the rest of the
       argument list are is used as key/value options.

       If the file argument is a handle (if it is a ref and is an IO or GLOB
       object), then that handle is slurped in. This mode is supported so you
       slurp handles such as &quot;DATA&quot; and &quot;STDIN&quot;. See the test handle.t for an
       example that does &quot;open( &apos;-|&apos; )&quot; and the child process spews data to the
       parant which slurps it in.  All of the options that control how the data
       is returned to the caller still work in this case.

       If the first argument is an overloaded object then its stringified value
       is used for the filename and that file is opened.  This is a new feature
       in 9999.14. See the stringify.t test for an example.

       By default &quot;read_file&quot; returns an undef in scalar contex or a single
       undef in list context if it encounters an error. Those are both
       impossible to get with a clean read_file call which means you can check
       the return value and always know if you had an error. You can change how
       errors are handled with the &quot;err_mode&quot; option.

       Speed Note: If you call read_file and just get a scalar return value it
       is now optimized to handle shorter files. This is only used if no options
       are used, the file is shorter then 100k bytes, the filename is a plain
       scalar and a scalar file is returned. If you want the fastest slurping,
       use the &quot;buf_ref&quot; or &quot;scalar_ref&quot; options (see below)

       NOTE: as of version 9999.06, read_file works correctly on the &quot;DATA&quot;
       handle. It used to need a sysseek workaround but that is now handled when
       needed by the module itself.

       You can optionally request that &quot;slurp()&quot; is exported to your code. This
       is an alias for read_file and is meant to be forward compatible with Perl
       6 (which will have slurp() built-in).

       The options for &quot;read_file&quot; are:

       binmode

       If you set the binmode option, then its value is passed to a call to
       binmode on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read
       in binary mode, utf8, etc. See perldoc -f binmode for more.

               my $bin_data = read_file( $bin_file, binmode =&gt; &apos;:raw&apos; ) ;
               my $utf_text = read_file( $bin_file, binmode =&gt; &apos;:utf8&apos; ) ;

       array_ref

       If this boolean option is set, the return value (only in scalar context)
       will be an array reference which contains the lines of the slurped file.
       The following two calls are equivalent:

               my $lines_ref = read_file( $bin_file, array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
               my $lines_ref = [ read_file( $bin_file ) ] ;

       chomp

       If this boolean option is set, the lines are chomped. This only happens
       if you are slurping in a list context or using the &quot;array_ref&quot; option.

       scalar_ref

       If this boolean option is set, the return value (only in scalar context)
       will be an scalar reference to a string which is the contents of the
       slurped file. This will usually be faster than returning the plain
       scalar. It will also save memory as it will not make a copy of the file
       to return. Run the extras/slurp_bench.pl script to see speed comparisons.
&#12;               my $text_ref = read_file( $bin_file, scalar_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;

       buf_ref

       You can use this option to pass in a scalar reference and the slurped
       file contents will be stored in the scalar. This can be used in
       conjunction with any of the other options. This saves an extra copy of
       the slurped file and can lower ram usage vs returning the file. It is
       usually the fastest way to read a file into a scalar. Run the
       extras/slurp_bench.pl script to see speed comparisons.

               read_file( $bin_file, buf_ref =&gt; \$buffer ) ;

       blk_size

       You can use this option to set the block size used when slurping from an
       already open handle (like \*STDIN). It defaults to 1MB.

               my $text_ref = read_file( $bin_file, blk_size =&gt; 10_000_000,
                                                    array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;

       err_mode

       You can use this option to control how read_file behaves when an error
       occurs. This option defaults to &apos;croak&apos;. You can set it to &apos;carp&apos; or to
       &apos;quiet to have no special error handling. This code wants to carp and
       then read another file if it fails.

               my $text_ref = read_file( $file, err_mode =&gt; &apos;carp&apos; ) ;
               unless ( $text_ref ) {

                       # read a different file but croak if not found
                       $text_ref = read_file( $another_file ) ;
               }

               # process ${$text_ref}

   write_file
       This sub writes out an entire file in one call.

         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, @data ) ;

       The first argument to &quot;write_file&quot; is the filename. The next argument is
       an optional hash reference and it contains key/values that can modify the
       behavior of &quot;write_file&quot;. The rest of the argument list is the data to be
       written to the file.

         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, {append =&gt; 1 }, @data ) ;
         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, {binmode =&gt; &apos;:raw&apos;}, $buffer ) ;

       As a shortcut if the first data argument is a scalar or array reference,
       it is used as the only data to be written to the file. Any following
       arguments in @_ are ignored. This is a faster way to pass in the output
       to be written to the file and is equivalent to the &quot;buf_ref&quot; option of
       &quot;read_file&quot;. These following pairs are equivalent but the pass by
       reference call will be faster in most cases (especially with larger
       files).

         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, \$buffer ) ;
         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, $buffer ) ;

         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, \@lines ) ;
         write_file( &apos;filename&apos;, @lines ) ;

       If the first argument is a handle (if it is a ref and is an IO or GLOB
       object), then that handle is written to. This mode is supported so you
       spew to handles such as \*STDOUT. See the test handle.t for an example
       that does &quot;open( &apos;-|&apos; )&quot; and child process spews data to the parent which
       slurps it in.  All of the options that control how the data are passed
       into &quot;write_file&quot; still work in this case.

       If the first argument is an overloaded object then its stringified value
       is used for the filename and that file is opened.  This is new feature in
       9999.14. See the stringify.t test for an example.

       By default &quot;write_file&quot; returns 1 upon successfully writing the file or
       undef if it encountered an error. You can change how errors are handled
       with the &quot;err_mode&quot; option.

       The options are:

       binmode

       If you set the binmode option, then its value is passed to a call to
       binmode on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read
       in binary mode, utf8, etc. See perldoc -f binmode for more.

               write_file( $bin_file, {binmode =&gt; &apos;:raw&apos;}, @data ) ;
               write_file( $bin_file, {binmode =&gt; &apos;:utf8&apos;}, $utf_text ) ;

       perms

       The perms option sets the permissions of newly-created files. This value
       is modified by your process&apos;s umask and defaults to 0666 (same as
       sysopen).

       NOTE: this option is new as of File::Slurp version 9999.14;

       buf_ref

       You can use this option to pass in a scalar reference which has the data
       to be written. If this is set then any data arguments (including the
       scalar reference shortcut) in @_ will be ignored. These are equivalent:

               write_file( $bin_file, { buf_ref =&gt; \$buffer } ) ;
               write_file( $bin_file, \$buffer ) ;
               write_file( $bin_file, $buffer ) ;

       atomic

       If you set this boolean option, the file will be written to in an atomic
       fashion. A temporary file name is created by appending the pid ($$) to
       the file name argument and that file is spewed to. After the file is
       closed it is renamed to the original file name (and rename is an atomic
       operation on most OS&apos;s). If the program using this were to crash in the
       middle of this, then the file with the pid suffix could be left behind.

       append

       If you set this boolean option, the data will be written at the end of
       the current file. Internally this sets the sysopen mode flag O_APPEND.

               write_file( $file, {append =&gt; 1}, @data ) ;

        You
       can import append_file and it does the same thing.

       no_clobber

       If you set this boolean option, an existing file will not be overwritten.

               write_file( $file, {no_clobber =&gt; 1}, @data ) ;

       err_mode

       You can use this option to control how &quot;write_file&quot; behaves when an error
       occurs. This option defaults to &apos;croak&apos;. You can set it to &apos;carp&apos; or to
       &apos;quiet&apos; to have no error handling other than the return value. If the
       first call to &quot;write_file&quot; fails it will carp and then write to another
       file. If the second call to &quot;write_file&quot; fails, it will croak.

               unless ( write_file( $file, { err_mode =&gt; &apos;carp&apos;, \$data ) ;

                       # write a different file but croak if not found
                       write_file( $other_file, \$data ) ;
               }

   overwrite_file
       This sub is just a typeglob alias to write_file since write_file always
       overwrites an existing file. This sub is supported for backwards
       compatibility with the original version of this module. See write_file
       for its API and behavior.

   append_file
       This sub will write its data to the end of the file. It is a wrapper
       around write_file and it has the same API so see that for the full
       documentation. These calls are equivalent:

               append_file( $file, @data ) ;
               write_file( $file, {append =&gt; 1}, @data ) ;

   prepend_file
       This sub writes data to the beginning of a file. The previously existing
       data is written after that so the effect is prepending data in front of a
       file. It is a counterpart to the append_file sub in this module. It works
       by first using &quot;read_file&quot; to slurp in the file and then calling
       &quot;write_file&quot; with the new data and the existing file data.

       The first argument to &quot;prepend_file&quot; is the filename. The next argument
       is an optional hash reference and it contains key/values that can modify
       the behavior of &quot;prepend_file&quot;. The rest of the argument list is the data
       to be written to the file and that is passed to &quot;write_file&quot; as is (see
       that for allowed data).

       Only the &quot;binmode&quot; and &quot;err_mode&quot; options are supported. The &quot;write_file&quot;
       call has the &quot;atomic&quot; option set so you will always have a consistant
       file. See above for more about those options.

       &quot;prepend_file&quot; is not exported by default, you need to import it
       explicitly.

               use File::Slurp qw( prepend_file ) ;
               prepend_file( $file, $header ) ;
               prepend_file( $file, \@lines ) ;
               prepend_file( $file, { binmode =&gt; &apos;raw:&apos;}, $bin_data ) ;

   edit_file, edit_file_lines
       These subs read in a file into $_, execute a code block which should
       modify $_ and then write $_ back to the file. The difference between them
       is that &quot;edit_file&quot; reads the whole file into $_ and calls the code block
       one time. With &quot;edit_file_lines&quot; each line is read into $_ and the code
       is called for each line. In both cases the code should modify $_ if
       desired and it will be written back out. These subs are the equivalent of
       the -pi command line options of Perl but you can call them from inside
       your program and not fork out a process. They are in @EXPORT_OK so you
       need to request them to be imported on the use line or you can import
       both of them with:

               use File::Slurp qw( :edit ) ;

       The first argument to &quot;edit_file&quot; and &quot;edit_file_lines&quot; is a code block
       or a code reference. The code block is not followed by a comma (as with
       grep and map) but a code reference is followed by a comma. See the
       examples below for both styles. The next argument is the filename. The
       last argument is an optional hash reference and it contains key/values
       that can modify the behavior of &quot;prepend_file&quot;.

       Only the &quot;binmode&quot; and &quot;err_mode&quot; options are supported. The &quot;write_file&quot;
       call has the &quot;atomic&quot; option set so you will always have a consistant
       file. See above for more about those options.

       Each group of calls below show a Perl command line instance and the
       equivalent calls to &quot;edit_file&quot; and &quot;edit_file_lines&quot;.

               perl -0777 -pi -e &apos;s/foo/bar/g&apos; filename
               use File::Slurp qw( edit_file ) ;
               edit_file { s/foo/bar/g } &apos;filename&apos; ;
               edit_file sub { s/foo/bar/g }, &apos;filename&apos; ;
               edit_file \&amp;replace_foo, &apos;filename&apos; ;
               sub replace_foo { s/foo/bar/g }

               perl -pi -e &apos;$_ = &quot;&quot; if /foo/&apos; filename
               use File::Slurp qw( edit_file_lines ) ;
               use File::Slurp ;
               edit_file_lines { $_ = &apos;&apos; if /foo/ } &apos;filename&apos; ;
               edit_file_lines sub { $_ = &apos;&apos; if /foo/ }, &apos;filename&apos; ;
               edit_file \&amp;delete_foo, &apos;filename&apos; ;
               sub delete_foo { $_ = &apos;&apos; if /foo/ }

   read_dir
       This sub reads all the file names from directory and returns them to the
       caller but &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; are removed by default.

               my @files = read_dir( &apos;/path/to/dir&apos; ) ;

       The first argument is the path to the directory to read.  If the next
       argument is a hash reference, then it is used as the options.  Otherwise
       the rest of the argument list are is used as key/value options.

       In list context &quot;read_dir&quot; returns a list of the entries in the
       directory. In a scalar context it returns an array reference which has
       the entries.

       err_mode

       If the &quot;err_mode&quot; option is set, it selects how errors are handled (see
       &quot;err_mode&quot; in &quot;read_file&quot; or &quot;write_file&quot;).

       keep_dot_dot

       If this boolean option is set, &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; are not removed from the list
       of files.

               my @all_files = read_dir( &apos;/path/to/dir&apos;, keep_dot_dot =&gt; 1 ) ;

       prefix

       If this boolean option is set, the string &quot;$dir/&quot; is prefixed to each dir
       entry. This means you can directly use the results to open files. A
       common newbie mistake is not putting the directory in front of entries
       when opening themn.

               my @paths = read_dir( &apos;/path/to/dir&apos;, prefix =&gt; 1 ) ;

   EXPORT
         These are exported by default or with
               use File::Slurp qw( :std ) ;

         read_file write_file overwrite_file append_file read_dir

         These are exported with
               use File::Slurp qw( :edit ) ;

         edit_file edit_file_lines

         You can get all subs in the module exported with
               use File::Slurp qw( :all ) ;

   LICENSE
         Same as Perl.

   BUGS
       If run under Perl 5.004, slurping from the DATA handle will fail as that
       requires B.pm which didn&apos;t get into core until 5.005.
