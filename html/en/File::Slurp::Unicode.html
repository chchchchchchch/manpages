NAME
       File::Slurp::Unicode - Reading/Writing of Complete Files with Character
       Encoding Support

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Slurp::Unicode;

         my $text = read_file(&apos;filename&apos;, encoding =&gt; &apos;utf8&apos;);
         my @lines = read_file(&apos;filename&apos;); # utf8 is assumed if no encoding.

         write_file(&apos;filename&apos;, { encoding =&gt; &apos;utf16&apos; }, @lines);

         # same as File::Slurp::write_file (ie. no encoding):
         write_file(&apos;filename&apos;, { encoding =&gt; &apos;binary&apos; }, @lines);

         use File::Slurp::Unicode qw(slurp);

         my $text = slurp(&apos;filename&apos;, encoding =&gt; &apos;latin1&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This module wraps File::Slurp and adds character encoding support through
       the &quot;encoding&quot; parameter. It exports the same functions which take all
       the same parameters as File::Slurp. Please see the File::Slurp
       documentation for basic usage; only the differences are described from
       here on out.

   read_file
       Pass in an argument called &quot;encoding&quot; to change the file encoding. If no
       argument is passed in, UTF-8 encoding is assumed.

       The special encoding &apos;binary&apos; is interpreted to mean that there should be
       no decoding done to the data after reading it. This is pretty much the
       same as calling &quot;File::Slurp::read_file()&quot; directly. This option is here
       only to make code which needs to read both binary and text files look
       uniform.

   write_file
       Pass in an argument called &quot;encoding&quot; to change the file encoding. If no
       argument is passed in and no wide characters are present in the output
       data, then no conversion will be done. If there are wide characters in
       the output data then UTF-8 encoding is assumed.

       The special encoding &apos;binary&apos; is interpreted to mean that there should be
       no encoding done to the data before writing. If you pass a wide string (a
       string with Perl&apos;s internal &apos;utf8 bit&apos; set) to &quot;write_file&quot; and set the
       encoding to &apos;binary&apos; it will die with an appropriate message. This is
       pretty much the same as calling &quot;File::Slurp::write_file()&quot; directly.
       This option is here only to make code which needs write both binary and
       text files look uniform.
