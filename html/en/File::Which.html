NAME
       File::Which - Portable implementation of the `which&apos; utility

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Which;                  # exports which()
         use File::Which qw(which where);  # exports which() and where()

         my $exe_path = which(&apos;perldoc&apos;);

         my @paths = where(&apos;perl&apos;);
         - Or -
         my @paths = which(&apos;perl&apos;); # an array forces search for all of them

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;File::Which&quot; was created to be able to get the paths to executable
       programs on systems under which the `which&apos; program wasn&apos;t implemented in
       the shell.

       &quot;File::Which&quot; searches the directories of the user&apos;s &quot;PATH&quot; (as returned
       by &quot;File::Spec-&gt;path()&quot;), looking for executable files having the name
       specified as a parameter to &quot;which()&quot;. Under Win32 systems, which do not
       have a notion of directly executable files, but uses special extensions
       such as &quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.bat&quot; to identify them, &quot;File::Which&quot; takes extra
       steps to assure that you will find the correct file (so for example, you
       might be searching for &quot;perl&quot;, it&apos;ll try perl.exe, perl.bat, etc.)

Steps Used on Win32, DOS, OS2 and VMS
   Windows NT
       Windows NT has a special environment variable called &quot;PATHEXT&quot;, which is
       used by the shell to look for executable files. Usually, it will contain
       a list in the form &quot;.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS&quot; etc. If &quot;File::Which&quot; finds
       such an environment variable, it parses the list and uses it as the
       different extensions.

   Windows 9x and other ancient Win/DOS/OS2
       This set of operating systems don&apos;t have the &quot;PATHEXT&quot; variable, and
       usually you will find executable files there with the extensions &quot;.exe&quot;,
       &quot;.bat&quot; and (less likely) &quot;.com&quot;. &quot;File::Which&quot; uses this hardcoded list
       if it&apos;s running under Win32 but does not find a &quot;PATHEXT&quot; variable.

   VMS
       Same case as Windows 9x: uses &quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; (in that order).

Functions
   which($short_exe_name)
       Exported by default.

       $short_exe_name is the name used in the shell to call the program (for
       example, &quot;perl&quot;).

       If it finds an executable with the name you specified, &quot;which()&quot; will
       return the absolute path leading to this executable (for example,
       /usr/bin/perl or C:\Perl\Bin\perl.exe).

       If it does not find the executable, it returns &quot;undef&quot;.

       If &quot;which()&quot; is called in list context, it will return all the matches.

   where($short_exe_name)
       Not exported by default.

       Same as &quot;which($short_exe_name)&quot; in array context. Same as the `where&apos;
       utility, will return an array containing all the path names matching
       $short_exe_name.

BUGS AND CAVEATS
       Not tested on VMS or MacOS, although there is platform specific code for
       those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to send me a report
       of how it went.

       File::Spec adds the current directory to the front of PATH if on Win32,
       VMS or MacOS. I have no knowledge of those so don&apos;t know if the current
       directory is searced first or not. Could someone please tell me?

       Originated in modperl-2.0/lib/Apache/Build.pm. Changed for use in DocSet
       (for the mod_perl site) and Win32-awareness by me, with slight
       modifications by Stas Bekman, then extracted to create &quot;File::Which&quot;.

       Version 0.04 had some significant platform-related changes, taken from
       the Perl Power Tools `which&apos; implementation by Abigail with enhancements
       from Peter Prymmer. See
