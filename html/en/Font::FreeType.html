NAME
       Font::FreeType - read font files and render glyphs from Perl using
       FreeType2

SYNOPSIS
           use Font::FreeType;

           my $freetype = Font::FreeType-&gt;new;
           my $face = $freetype-&gt;face(&apos;Vera.ttf&apos;);

           $face-&gt;set_char_size(24, 24, 100, 100);
           my $glyph = $face-&gt;glyph_from_char(&apos;A&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows Perl programs to conveniently read information from
       font files.  All the font access is done through the FreeType2 library,
       which supports many formats.  It can render images of characters with
       high-quality hinting and antialiasing, extract metrics information, and
       extract the outlines of characters in scalable formats like TrueType.

       Warning: this module is currently in &apos;beta&apos; stage.  It&apos;ll be another
       release or two before it stabilizes.  The API may change in ways that
       break programs based on it, but I don&apos;t think it will change much.  Some
       of the values returned may be wrong, or not scaled correctly.  See the
       TODO file to get a handle on how far along this work is.  Contributions
       welcome, particularly if you know more than I do (which isn&apos;t much) about
       fonts and the FreeType2 library.

       The Font::FreeType API is not intended to replicate the C API of the
       FreeType library -- it offers a much more Perl-friendly interface.

       The quickest way to get started with this library is to look at the
       examples in the examples directory of the distribution.  Full details of
       the API are contained in this documentation, and (more importantly) the
       documentation for the Font::FreeType::Face and Font::FreeType::Glyph
       classes.

       To use the library, first create a Font::FreeType object.  This can be
       used to load faces from files, for example:

           my $freetype = Font::FreeType-&gt;new;
           my $face = $freetype-&gt;face(&apos;Vera.ttf&apos;);

       If your font is scalable (i.e., not a bitmapped font) then set the size
       and resolution you want to see it at, for example 24pt at 100dpi:

           $face-&gt;set_char_size(24, 24, 100, 100);

       Then load a particular glyph (an image of a character), either by
       character code (in Unicode) or the actual character:

           my $glyph = $face-&gt;glyph_from_char_code(65);
           my $glyph = $face-&gt;glyph_from_char(&apos;A&apos;);

       Glyphs can be rendered to bitmap images, among other things:

           my $bitmap = $glyph-&gt;bitmap;

       See the documentation for Font::FreeType::Glyph for details of the format
       of the bitmap array reference that returns, and for other ways to get
       information about a glyph.
&#12;METHODS
       Unless otherwise stated, all methods will die if there is an error.

       new()
           Create a new &apos;instance&apos; of the freetype library and return the
           object.  This is a class method, which doesn&apos;t take any arguments.
           If you only want to load one face, then it&apos;s probably not even worth
           saving the object to a variable:

               my $face = Font::FreeType-&gt;new-&gt;face(&apos;Vera.ttf&apos;);

       face(filename, %options)
           Return a Font::FreeType::Face object representing a font face from
           the specified file.

           The &quot;index&quot; option specifies which face to load from the file.  It
           defaults to 0, and since most fonts only contain one face it rarely
           needs to be provided.

           The &quot;load_flags&quot; option takes various flags which alter the way
           glyphs are loaded.  The default is usually OK for rendering fonts to
           bitmap images.  When extracting outlines from fonts, be sure to set
           the FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING flag.

           The following load flags are available.  They can be combined with
           the bitwise OR operator (&quot;|&quot;).  The symbols are exported by the
           module and so will be available once you do &quot;use Font::FreeType&quot;.

           FT_LOAD_DEFAULT
               The same as doing nothing special.

           FT_LOAD_CROP_BITMAP
               Remove extraneous black bits round the edges of bitmaps when
               loading embedded bitmaps.

           FT_LOAD_FORCE_AUTOHINT
               Use FreeType&apos;s own automatic hinting algorithm rather than the
               normal TrueType one.  Probably only useful for testing the
               FreeType library.

           FT_LOAD_IGNORE_GLOBAL_ADVANCE_WIDTH
               Probably only useful for loading fonts with wrong metrics.

           FT_LOAD_IGNORE_TRANSFORM
               Don&apos;t transform glyphs.  This module doesn&apos;t yet have support for
               transformations.

           FT_LOAD_LINEAR_DESIGN
               Don&apos;t scale the metrics.

           FT_LOAD_NO_AUTOHINT
               Don&apos;t use the FreeType autohinting algorithm.  Hinting with other
               algorithms (such as the TrueType one) will still be done if
               possible.  Apparently some fonts look worse with the autohinter
               than without any hinting.

               This option is only available with FreeType 2.1.3 or newer.

           FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP
               Don&apos;t load embedded bitmaps provided with scalable fonts.  Bitmap
               fonts are still loaded normally.  This probably doesn&apos;t make much
               difference in the current version of this module, as embedded
               bitmaps aren&apos;t deliberately used.

           FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING
               Prevents the coordinates of the outline from being adjusted
               (&apos;grid fitted&apos;) to the current size.  Hinting should be turned on
               when rendering bitmap images of glyphs, and off when extracting
               the outline information if you don&apos;t know at what resolution it
               will be rendered.  For example, when converting glyphs to
               PostScript or PDF, use this to turn the hinting off.

           FT_LOAD_NO_SCALE
               Don&apos;t scale the font&apos;s outline or metrics to the right size.
               This will currently generate bad numbers.  To be fixed in a later
               version.

           FT_LOAD_PEDANTIC
               Raise errors when a font file is broken, rather than trying to
               work around it.

           FT_LOAD_VERTICAL_LAYOUT
               Return metrics and glyphs suitable for vertical layout.  This
               module doesn&apos;t yet provide any intentional support for vertical
               layout, so this probably won&apos;t be much use.

       version()
           Returns the version number of the underlying FreeType library being
           used.  If called in scalar context returns a string containing three
           numbers in the format &quot;major.minor.patch&quot;.  In list context returns
           the three numbers as separate values.
