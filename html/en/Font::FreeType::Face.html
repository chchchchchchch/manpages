NAME
       Font::FreeType::Face - font typefaces loaded from Font::FreeType

SYNOPSIS
           use Font::FreeType;

           my $freetype = Font::FreeType-&gt;new;
           my $face = $freetype-&gt;face(&apos;Vera.ttf&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a font face (or typeface) loaded from a font file.
       Usually a face represents all the information in the font file (such as a
       TTF file), although it is possible to have multiple faces in a single
       file.

       Never &apos;use&apos; this module directly; the class is loaded automatically from
       Font::FreeType.  Use the &quot;Font::FreeType-&gt;face()&quot; method to create a new
       Font::FreeType::Face object from a filename.

METHODS
       Unless otherwise stated, all methods will die if there is an error.

       ascender()
           The height above the baseline of the &apos;top&apos; of the font&apos;s glyphs,
           scaled to the current size of the face.

       attach_file(filename)
           Informs FreeType of an ancillary file needed for reading the font.
           Hasn&apos;t been tested yet.

       current_face_index()
           The index number of the current font face.  Usually this will be
           zero, which is the default.  See &quot;Font::FreeType-&gt;face()&quot; for how to
           load other faces from the same file.

       descender()
           The depth below the baseline of the &apos;bottom&apos; of the font&apos;s glyphs,
           scaled to the current size of the face.  Actually represents the
           distance moving up from the baseline, so usually negative.

       family_name()
           A string containing the name of the family this font claims to be
           from.

       fixed_sizes()
           In scalar context returns the number of fixed sizes (of embedded
           bitmaps) available in the font.  In list context returns a list of
           hashes which detail those sizes.  Each hash can contain the following
           keys, but they will be absent if the information isn&apos;t available:

           size
               Size of the glyphs in points.  Only available with Freetype 2.1.5
               or newer.

           height
               Height of the bitmaps in pixels.

           width
               Width of the bitmaps in pixels.

           x_res_dpi, y_res_dpi
               Resolution the bitmaps were designed for, in dots per inch.  Only
               available with Freetype 2.1.5 or newer.

           x_res_ppem, y_res_ppem
               Resolution the bitmaps were designed for, in pixels per em.  Only
               available with Freetype 2.1.5 or newer.

       foreach_char(code-ref)
           Iterates through all the characters in the font, and calls code-ref
           for each of them in turn.  Glyphs which don&apos;t correspond to Unicode
           characters are ignored.  There is currently no facility for iterating
           over all glyphs.

           Each time your callback code is called, $_ will be set to a
           Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the current glyph.  For an example
           see the program list-characters.pl provided in the distribution.

       glyph_from_char(character)
           Returns a Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the glyph corresponding to
           the first character in the string provided.  Note that currently non-
           ASCII characters are not likely to work with this, so you might be
           better using the &quot;glyph_from_char_code()&quot; method below and the Perl
           &quot;ord&quot; function.

           Returns undef if the glyph is not available in the font.

       glyph_from_char_code(char-code)
           Returns a Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the glyph corresponding to
           Unicode character char-code.  FreeType supports using other character
           sets, but this module doesn&apos;t yet.

           Returns undef if the glyph is not available in the font.

       has_glyph_names()
           True if individual glyphs have names.  If so, the names can be
           retrieved with the &quot;name()&quot; method on Font::FreeType::Glyph objects.

           See also &quot;has_reliable_glyph_names()&quot; below.

       has_horizontal_metrics()
       has_vertical_metrics()
           These return true if the font contains metrics for the corresponding
           directional layout.  Most fonts will contain horizontal metrics,
           describing (for example) how the characters should be spaced out
           across a page when being written horizontally like English.  Some
           fonts, such as Chinese ones, may contain vertical metrics as well,
           allowing typesetting down the page.

       has_kerning()
           True if the font provides kerning information.  See the &quot;kerning()&quot;
           method below.

       has_reliable_glyph_names()
           True if the font contains reliable PostScript glyph names.  Some Some
           fonts contain bad glyph names.  This method always returns false when
           used with Freetype versions earlier than 2.1.1.

           See also &quot;has_glyph_names()&quot; above.

       height()
           The height of the text.  Not entirely sure what that corresponds to
           (is it the line height or what?).

       is_bold()
           True if the font claims to be in a bold style.

       is_fixed_width()
           True if all the characters in the font are the same width.  Will be
           true for monospaced fonts like Courier.

       is_italic()
           Returns true if the font claims to be in an italic style.

       is_scalable()
           True if the font has a scalable outline, meaning it can be rendered
           nicely at virtually any size.  Returns false for bitmap fonts.

       is_sfnt()
           True if the font file is in the &apos;sfnt&apos; format, meaning it is either
           TrueType or OpenType.  This isn&apos;t much use yet, but future versions
           of this library might provide access to extra information about sfnt
           fonts.

       kerning(left-glyph-index, right-glyph-index, [mode])
           Returns the suggested kerning adjustment between two glyphs.  When
           called in scalar context returns a single value, which should be
           added to the position of the second glyph on the x axis for
           horizontal layouts, or the y axis for vertical layouts.

           Note: currently always returns the x axis kerning, but this will be
           fixed when vertical layouts are handled properly.

           For example, assuming $left and $right are two Font::FreeType::Glyph
           objects:

               my $kern_distance = $face-&gt;kerning($left-&gt;index, $right-&gt;index);

           In list context this returns two values corresponding to the x and y
           axes, which should be treated in the same way.

           The &quot;mode&quot; argument controls how the kerning is calculated, with the
           following options available:

           FT_KERNING_DEFAULT
               Grid-fitting (hinting) and scaling are done.  Use this when
               rendering glyphs to bitmaps to make the kerning take the
               resolution of the output in to account.

           FT_KERNING_UNFITTED
               Scaling is done, but not hinting.  Use this when extracting the
               outlines of glyphs.  If you used the &quot;FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING&quot; option
               when creating the face then use this when calculating the
               kerning.

           FT_KERNING_UNSCALED
               Leave the measurements in font units, without scaling, and
               without hinting.

       number_of_faces()
           The number of faces contained in the file from which this one was
           created.  Usually there is only one.  See &quot;Font::FreeType-&gt;face()&quot;
           for how to load the others if there are more.

       number_of_glyphs()
           The number of glyphs in the font face.

       postscript_name()
           A string containing the PostScript name of the font, or undef if it
           doesn&apos;t have one.

       set_char_size(width, height, x_res, y_res)
           Set the size at which glyphs should be rendered.  Metrics are also
           scaled to match.  The width and height will usually be the same, and
           are in points.  The resolution is in dots-per-inch.

           When generating PostScript outlines a resolution of 72 will scale to
           PostScript points.

       set_pixel_size(width, height)
           Set the size at which bitmapped fonts will be loaded.  Bitmap fonts
           are automatically set to the first available standard size, so this
           usually isn&apos;t needed.

       style_name()
           A string describing the style of the font, such as &apos;Roman&apos; or &apos;Demi
           Bold&apos;.  Most TrueType fonts are just &apos;Regular&apos;.

       underline_position()
       underline_thickness()
           The suggested position and thickness of underlining for the font, or
           undef if the information isn&apos;t provided.  Currently in font units,
           but this is likely to be changed in a future version.

       units_per_em()
           The size of the em square used by the font designer.  This can be
           used to scale font-specific measurements to the right size, although
           that&apos;s usually done for you by FreeType.  Usually this is 2048 for
           TrueType fonts.
