DESCRIPTION
       GNU dbm is a library of routines that manages  data  files  that  contain
       key/data  pairs.   The access provided is that of storing, retrieval, and
       deletion by key and a non-sorted traversal of all  keys.   A  process  is
       allowed to use multiple data files at the same time.

       A  process  that  opens  a  gdbm  file  is  designated as a &quot;reader&quot; or a
       &quot;writer&quot;.  Only one writer may open a gdbm file and many readers may open
       the  file.   Readers  and  writers can not open the gdbm file at the same
       time. The procedure for opening a gdbm file is:

         GDBM_FILE dbf;

         dbf = gdbm_open ( name, block_size, read_write, mode, fatal_func )

       Name is the name of the file (the complete name, gdbm does not append any
       characters  to  this  name).  Block_size is the size of a single transfer
       from disk to memory. This parameter is ignored unless the file is  a  new
       file.  The minimum size is 512.  If it is less than 512, dbm will use the
       stat block size for the file system.  Read_write can have one of the fol&#8208;
       lowing values:
       GDBM_READER reader
       GDBM_WRITER writer
       GDBM_WRCREAT writer - if database does not exist create new one
       GDBM_NEWDB writer - create new database regardless if one exists
       For  the  last three (writers of the database) the following may be added
       added to read_write by bitwise or: GDBM_SYNC, which causes  all  database
       operations  to  be  synchronized to the disk, and GDBM_NOLOCK, which pre&#8208;
       vents the library from performing any locking on the database file.   The
       option GDBM_FAST is now obsolete, since gdbm defaults to no-sync mode.
       Mode  is the file mode (see chmod(2) and open(2)) if the file is created.
       (*Fatal_func) () is a function for dbm to call  if  it  detects  a  fatal
       error.  The only parameter of this function is a string.  If the value of
       0 is provided, gdbm will use a default function.

       The return value dbf is the pointer  needed  by  all  other  routines  to
       access  that gdbm file.  If the return is the NULL pointer, gdbm_open was
       not successful.  The errors can be found in gdbm_errno  for  gdbm  errors
       and in errno for system errors.  (For error codes, see gdbmerrno.h.)

       In  all  of  the following calls, the parameter dbf refers to the pointer
       returned from gdbm_open.

       It is important that every file opened is also closed.  This is needed to
       update the reader/writer count on the file.  This is done by:

         gdbm_close (dbf);


       The database is used by 3 primary routines.  The first stores data in the
       database.

         ret = gdbm_store ( dbf, key, content, flag )

       Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open.  Key is the key data.   Content
       is the data to be associated with the key.  Flag can have one of the fol&#8208;
       lowing values:
       GDBM_INSERT insert only, generate an error if key exists
       GDBM_REPLACE replace contents if key exists.

       If a reader calls gdbm_store, the return value will  be  -1.   If  called
       with  GDBM_INSERT and key is in the database, the return value will be 1.
       Otherwise, the return value is 0.

       NOTICE: If you store data for a key that is already  in  the  data  base,
       gdbm replaces the old data with the new data if called with GDBM_REPLACE.
       You do not get two data items for the same key and  you  do  not  get  an
       error from gdbm_store.

       NOTICE:  The  size in gdbm is not restricted like dbm or ndbm.  Your data
       can be as large as you want.


       To search for some data:

         content = gdbm_fetch ( dbf, key )

       Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open.  Key is the key data.


       If the dptr element of the return value is NULL, no data was found.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise  the  return  value  is  a pointer to the found data.  The storage
       space for the dptr element is allocated using malloc(3C).  Gdbm does  not
       automatically  free  this data.  It is the programmer&apos;s responsibility to
       free this storage when it is no longer needed.


       To search for some data, without retrieving it:

         ret = gdbm_exists ( dbf, key )

       Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open.  Key is the key data to  search
       for.

       If  the  key  is  found within the database, the return value ret will be
       true.  If nothing appropiate is found, ret will be false.   This  routine
       is  useful for checking for the existance of a record, without performing
       the memory allocation done by gdbm_fetch.


       To remove some data from the database:

         ret = gdbm_delete ( dbf, key )

       Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open.  Key is the key data.

       The return value is -1 if the item is not present or the requester  is  a
       reader.  The return value is 0 if there was a successful delete.


       The  next  two  routines  allow  for accessing all items in the database.
       This access is not key sequential, but it is guaranteed  to  visit  every
       key in the database once.  (The order has to do with the hash values.)

         key = gdbm_firstkey ( dbf )

         nextkey = gdbm_nextkey ( dbf, key )

       Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key data.

       The  return  values  are  both of type datum.  If the dptr element of the
       return value is NULL, there is no first key or next  key.   Again  notice
       that  dptr  points to data allocated by malloc(3C) and gdbm will not free
       it for you.

       These functions were intended to visit the database  in  read-only  algo&#8208;
       rithms, for instance, to validate the database or similar operations.

       File  `visiting&apos; is based on a `hash table&apos;.  gdbm_delete re-arranges the
       hash table to make sure that any collisions in the  table  do  not  leave
       some  item  `un-findable&apos;.   The  original key order is NOT guaranteed to
       remain unchanged in ALL instances.  It is possible that some key will not
       be visited if a loop like the following is executed:

          key = gdbm_firstkey ( dbf );
          while ( key.dptr ) {
             nextkey = gdbm_nextkey ( dbf, key );
             if ( some condition ) {
                gdbm_delete ( dbf, key );
                free ( key.dptr );
             }
             key = nextkey;
          }


       The following routine should be used very infrequently.

         ret = gdbm_reorganize ( dbf )

       If  you  have  had  a lot of deletions and would like to shrink the space
       used by the gdbm file, this routine will reorganize the  database.   Gdbm
       will not shorten the length of a gdbm file except by using this reorgani&#8208;
       zation.  (Deleted file space will be reused.)


       Unless your database was opened with the GDBM_SYNC flag,  gdbm  does  not
       wait for writes to be flushed to the disk before continuing.  The follow&#8208;
       ing routine can be used to guarantee  that  the  database  is  physically
       written to the disk file.

         gdbm_sync ( dbf )

       It  will not return until the disk file state is syncronized with the in-
       memory state of the database.


       To convert a gdbm error code into English text, use this routine:

         ret = gdbm_strerror ( errno )

       Where  errno  is  of  type  gdbm_error,  usually  the   global   variable
       gdbm_errno.  The appropiate phrase is returned.


       Gdbm  now  supports the ability to set certain options on an already open
       database.

         ret = gdbm_setopt ( dbf, option, value, size )

       Where dbf is the return value from a  previous  call  to  gdbm_open,  and
       option specifies which option to set.  The valid options are currently:

         GDBM_CACHESIZE - Set the size of the internal bucket
         cache. This option may only be set once on each GDBM_FILE
         descriptor, and is set automatically to 100 upon the first
         access to the database.

         GDBM_FASTMODE - Set fast mode to either on or off.  This
         allows fast mode to be toggled on an already open and
         active database. value (see below) should be set to either
         TRUE or FALSE.  This option is now obsolete.

         GDBM_SYNCMODE - Turn on or off file system synchronization operations.
         This setting defaults to off; value (see below) should be set to either
         TRUE or FALSE.

         GDBM_CENTFREE - Set central free block pool to either on or off.
         The default is off, which is how previous versions of Gdbm
         handled free blocks. If set, this option causes all subsequent free
         blocks to be placed in the global pool, allowing (in thoery)
         more file space to be reused more quickly. value (see below) should
         be set to either TRUE or FALSE.
         NOTICE: This feature is still under study.

         GDBM_COALESCEBLKS - Set free block merging to either on or off.
         The default is off, which is how previous versions of Gdbm
         handled free blocks. If set, this option causes adjacent free blocks
         to  be  merged.  This  can  become  a  CPU expensive process with time,
       though,
         especially if used in conjunction with GDBM_CENTFREE. value
         (see below) should be set to either TRUE or FALSE.
         NOTICE: This feature is still under study.

       value is the value to set option to, specified  as  an  integer  pointer.
       size  is the size of the data pointed to by value.  The return value will
       be -1 upon failure, or 0 upon success.  The  global  variable  gdbm_errno
       will be set upon failure.

       For  instance,  to  set a database to use a cache of 10, after opening it
       with gdbm_open, but prior to accessing it in any way, the following  code
       could be used:

         int value = 10;

         ret = gdbm_setopt( dbf, GDBM_CACHESIZE, &amp;value, sizeof(int));
&#12;       If  the  database was opened with the GDBM_NOLOCK flag, the user may wish
       to perform their own file locking on the database file in order  to  pre&#8208;
       vent multiple writers operating on the same file simultaneously.

       In order to support this, the gdbm_fdesc routine is provided.

         ret = gdbm_fdesc ( dbf )

       Where  dbf  is  the  return value from a previous call to gdbm_open.  The
       return value will be the file descriptor of the database.

       The following two external variables may be useful:

       gdbm_errno is the variable that  contains  more  information  about  gdbm
       errors.   (gdbm.h  has  the  definitions  of the error values and defines
       gdbm_errno as an external variable.)
       gdbm_version is the string containing the version information.


       There are a few more things of  interest.   First,  gdbm  files  are  not
       &quot;sparse&quot;.   You  can  copy them with the UNIX cp(1) command and they will
       not expand in the copying process.  Also, there is a  compatibility  mode
       for  use  with programs that already use UNIX dbm.  In this compatibility
       mode, no gdbm file pointer is required by the programmer,  and  only  one
       file  may  be  opened  at  a  time.   All users in compatibility mode are
       assumed to be writers.  If the gdbm file is a read only, it will fail  as
       a  writer, but will also try to open it as a reader.  All returned point&#8208;
       ers in datum structures point to data that gdbm WILL free.   They  should
       be treated as static pointers (as standard UNIX dbm does).



LINKING
       This  library  is  accessed by specifying -lgdbm as the last parameter to
       the compile line, e.g.:

            gcc -o prog prog.c -lgdbm

       If you wish to use the dbm or ndbm compatibility routines, you must  link
       in the gdbm_compat library as well.  For example:

            gcc -o prog proc.c -lgdbm -lgdbm_compat
