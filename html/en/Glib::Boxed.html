NAME
       Glib::Boxed -  Generic wrappers for C structures

DESCRIPTION
       Glib::Boxed is a generic wrapper mechanism for arbitrary C structures.
       For the most part you don&apos;t care about this as a Perl developer, but it
       is important to know that all Glib::Boxed descendents can be copied with
       the &quot;copy&quot; method.

HIERARCHY
         Glib::Boxed

METHODS
   copy_of_boxed = $boxed-&gt;copy
       Create and return a new copy of $boxed.
