NAME
       Glib::Flags -  Overloaded operators representing GLib flags

HIERARCHY
         Glib::Flags

DESCRIPTION
       Glib maps flag and enum values to the nicknames strings provided by the
       underlying C libraries.  Representing flags this way in Perl is an
       interesting problem, which Glib solves by using some cool overloaded
       operators.

       The functions described here actually do the work of those overloaded
       operators.  See the description of the flags operators in the &quot;This Is
       Now That&quot; section of Glib for more info.

METHODS
   scalar = $class-&gt;new ($a)
       &#183;   $a (scalar)

       Create a new flags object with given bits.  This is for use from a
       subclass, it&apos;s not possible to create a &quot;Glib::Flags&quot; object as such.
       For example,

           my $f1 = Glib::ParamFlags-&gt;new (&apos;readable&apos;);
           my $f2 = Glib::ParamFlags-&gt;new ([&apos;readable&apos;,&apos;writable&apos;]);

       An object like this can then be used with the overloaded operators.

   scalar = $a-&gt;all ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (scalar)

   aref = $f-&gt;as_arrayref
       Return the bits of $f as a reference to an array of strings, like
       [&apos;flagbit1&apos;,&apos;flagbit2&apos;].  This is the overload function for &quot;@{}&quot;, ie.
       arrayizing $f.  You can call it directly as a method too.

       Note that @$f gives the bits as a list, but as_arrayref gives an
       arrayref.  If an arrayref is what you want then the method style
       somefunc()-&gt;as_arrayref can be more readable than [@{somefunc()}].

   bool = $f-&gt;bool
       Return 1 if any bits are set in $f, or 0 if none are set.  This is the
       overload for $f in boolean context (like &quot;if&quot;, etc).  You can call it as
       a method to get a true/false directly too.

   integer = $a-&gt;eq ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (integer)

   integer = $a-&gt;ge ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (integer)

   scalar = $a-&gt;intersect ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (scalar)
&#12;   integer = $a-&gt;ne ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (integer)

   scalar = $a-&gt;sub ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (scalar)

   scalar = $a-&gt;union ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (scalar)

   scalar = $a-&gt;xor ($b, $swap)
       &#183;   $b (scalar)

       &#183;   $swap (scalar)
