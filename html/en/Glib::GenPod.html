NAME
       Glib::GenPod - POD generation utilities for Glib-based modules

SYNOPSIS
        use Glib::GenPod;

        # use the defaults:
        xsdoc2pod ($xsdocparse_output_file, $destination_dir);

        # or take matters into your own hands
        require $xsdocparse_output_file;
        foreach my $package (sort keys %$data) {
            print &quot;=head1 NAME\n\n$package\n\n&quot;;
            print &quot;=head1 METHODS\n\n&quot; . podify_methods ($package) . &quot;\n\n&quot;;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module includes several utilities for creating pod for xs-based Perl
       modules which build on the Glib module&apos;s foundations.  The most important
       bits are the logic to convert the data structures created by
       xsdocparse.pl to describe xsubs and pods into method docs, with call
       signatures and argument descriptions, and converting C type names into
       Perl type names.  The rest of the module is mostly boiler-plate code to
       format and pretty-print information that may be queried from the Glib
       type system.

       To make life easy for module maintainers, we also include a do-it-all
       function, xsdoc2pod(), which does pretty much everything for you.  All of
       the pieces it uses are publically usable, so you can do whatever you like
       if you don&apos;t like the default output.

DOCUMENTING THE XS FILES
       All of the information used as input to the methods included here comes
       from the XS files of your project, and is extracted by Glib::ParseXSDoc&apos;s
       &quot;xsdocparse&quot;.  This function creates an file containing Perl code that
       may be eval&apos;d or require&apos;d to recreate the parsed data structures, which
       are a list of pods from the verbatim C portion of the XS file (the xs api
       docs), and a hash of the remaining data, keyed by package name, and
       including the pods and xsubs read from the rest of each XS file following
       the first MODULE line.

       Several custom POD directives are recognized in the XSubs section.  Note
       that each one is sought as a paragraph starter, and must follow a &quot;=cut&quot;
       directive.

       =for object Package::Name
           All xsubs and pod from here until the next object directive or MODULE
           line will be placed under the key &apos;Package::Name&apos; in xsdocparse&apos;s
           data structure.  Everything from this line to the next &quot;=cut&quot; is
           included as a description POD.

       =for object Package::Name (Other::Package::Name)
           Generate POD in Package::Name but for the package
           Other::Package::Name.  This is useful if you want POD to appear in a
           different namespace but still want the automatically generated
           hierarchy, signal and property listing, etc. from the original
           namespace.  For example:

             =for object Gnome2::PanelApplet::main (Gnome2::PanelApplet)
             =cut

           This will create Gnome2/PanelApplet/main.pod containing the
           automatically generated documentation for Gnome2::PanelApplet
           (hierarchy, signals, etc.) plus the method listing from the current
           XS file.

       =for enum Package::Name
       =for flags Package::Name
           This causes xsdoc2pod to call &quot;podify_values&quot; on Package::Name when
           writing the pod for the current package (as set by an object
           directive or MODULE line).  Any text in this paragraph, to the next
           &quot;=cut&quot;, is included in that section.

       =for deprecated_by Package::Name
           Used to add a deprecation warning, indicating Package::Name as an
           alternative way to achieve the same functionality.  There may be any
           number these in each package.

       =for see_also some_thing_to_see
           Used to add extra see alsos onto the end of the parents, if any, for
           a given object.  Anything following the space behind see_also up to
           the end of the line will be placed onto the list of &quot;see also&quot;s.
           There may be any number of these in each package.

       =for apidoc
       =for apidoc Full::Symbol::name
           Paragraphs of this type document xsubs, and are associated with the
           xsubs by xsdocparse.pl.  If the full symbol name is not included, the
           paragraph must be attached to the xsub declaration (no blank lines
           between &quot;=cut&quot; and the xsub).

           Within the apidoc PODs, we recognize a few special directives (the
           &quot;for\s+&quot; is optional on these):

           =for signature ...
               Override the generated call signature with the ... text.  If you
               include multiple signature directives, they will all be used.
               This is handy when you want to change the return type or list
               different ways to invoke an overloaded method, like this:

                =for apidoc

                =signature bool Class-&gt;foo

                =signature ($thing, @other) = $object-&gt;foo ($it, $something)

                Text in here is included in the generated documentation.
                You can actually include signature and arg directives
                at any point in this pod -- they are stripped after.
                In fact, any pod is valid in here, until the =cut.

                =cut
                void foo (...)
                    PPCODE:
                       /* crazy code follows */

           =for arg name (type) description
           =for arg name description
               The arg directive adds or overrides an argument description.  The
               description text is optional, as is the type specification (the
               part in parentheses).  If you want to hide an argument, specify
               &quot;__hide__&quot; as its type.  The arg name does not need to include a
               sigil, as dollar signs will be added.  FIXME what about @ for
               lists?

           Also, we honor a couple of &quot;modifiers&quot; on the =for apidoc line,
           following the symbol name, if present:
&#12;           - __hide__
               Do not document this xsub.  This is handy in certain situations,
               e.g., for private functions.  DESTROY always has this turned on,
               for example.

           - __gerror__
               This function or method can generate a Glib::Error exception.

           - __function__
               Generate a function-style signature for this xsub.  The default
               is to generate method-style signatures.

           - __deprecated__
               This function or method is deprecated and should not be used in
               newly written code.

           (These are actually handled by Glib::ParseXSDoc, but we list them
           here because, well, they&apos;re an important part of how you document the
           XS files.)

FUNCTIONS
       xsdoc2pod ($datafile, $outdir=&apos;blib/lib&apos;, index=undef)
           Given a $datafile containing the output of xsdocparse.pl, create in
           $outdir a pod file for each package, containing everything we can
           think of for that module.  Output is controlled by the &quot;=for object&quot;
           directives and such in the source code.

           If you don&apos;t want each package to create a separate pod file, then
           use this function&apos;s code as a starting point for your own pretty-
           printer.

       add_types (@filenames)
           Parse the given @filenames for entries to add to the %basic_types
           used for C type name to Perl package name mappings of types that are
           not registered with the Glib type system.  The file format is dead
           simple: blank lines are ignored; /#.*$/ is stripped from each line as
           comments; the first token on each line is considered to be a C type
           name, and the remaining tokens are the description of that type.  For
           example, a valid file may look like this:

             # a couple of special types
             FooBar      Foo::Bar
             Frob        localized frobnicator

           C type decorations such as &quot;const&quot; and &quot;*&quot; are implied (do not
           include them), and the _ornull variant is handled for you.

       $string = podify_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the object properties owned by the Glib::Object
           derivative $packagename and return the text as a string.  Returns
           undef if there are no properties or $package is not a Glib::Object.

       $string = podify_child_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the child properties owned by the Gtk2::Container
           derivative $packagename and return the text as a string.  Returns
           undef if there are no child properties or $package is not a
           Gtk2::Container or similar class with a &quot;list_child_properties()&quot;
           method.

       $string = podify_style_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the style properties owned by the Gtk2::Widget
           derivative $packagename and return the text as a string.  Returns
           undef if there are no style properties or $package is not a
           Gtk2::Widget or similar class with a &quot;list_style_properties()&quot;
           method.
&#12;       $string = podify_values ($packagename)
           List and pretty-print the values of the GEnum or GFlags type
           $packagename, and return the text as a string.  Returns undef if
           $packagename isn&apos;t an enum or flags type.

       $string = podify_signals ($packagename)
           Query, list, and pretty-print the signals associated with
           $packagename.  Returns the text as a string, or undef if there are no
           signals or $packagename is not a Glib::Object derivative.

       $string = podify_deprecated_by ($packagename, @deprecated_by)
           Creates a deprecation warning for $packagename, suggesting using the
           items inside @deprecated_by instead.

       $string = podify_pods ($pods, $position)
           Helper function to allow specific placement of generic pod within the
           auto generated pages. Pod sections starting out with =for position
           XXX, where XXX is one of the following will be placed at a specified
           position. In the case of pod that is to be placed after a particular
           section that doesn&apos;t exist, that pod will be still be placed there.

           This function is called at all of the specified points through out
           the process of generating pod for a page. Any pod matching the
           position passed will be returned, undef if no matches were found.  If
           position is undef all pods without sepcific postion information will
           be returned. pods is a reference to an array of pod hashes.

       $string = podify_ancestors ($packagename)
           Pretty-prints the ancestry of $packagename from the Glib type
           system&apos;s point of view.  This uses Glib::Type-&gt;list_ancestors; see
           that function&apos;s docs for an explanation of why that&apos;s different from
           looking at @ISA.

           Returns the new text as a string, or undef if $packagename is not a
           registered GType.

       $string = podify_interfaces ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the list of GInterfaces that $packagename implements.
           Returns the text as a string, or undef if the type implements no
           interfaces.

       $string = podify_methods ($packagename)
           Call &quot;xsub_to_pod&quot; on all the xsubs under the key $packagename in the
           data extracted by xsdocparse.pl.

           Returns the new text as a string, or undef if there are no xsubs in
           $packagename.

       $string = podify_see_alsos (@entries)
           Creates a list of links to be placed in the SEE ALSO section of the
           page.  Returns undef if nothing is in the input list.

       $string = get_copyright
           Returns a string that will/should be placed on each page.  You can
           control the text of this string by calling the class method
           set_copyright.

           If no text has been set, we will attempt to create one for you, using
           what has been passed to set_year, set_authors, and set_main_mod.  The
           year defaults to the current year, the authors default to &apos;The
           Gtk2-Perl Team&apos;, and the main mod is empty by default.  You want the
           main mod to be set to the main module of your extension for the SEE
           ALSO section, and on the assumption that a decent license notice can
           be found in that module&apos;s doc, we point the reader there.

           So, in general, you will want to specify at least one of these, so
           that you don&apos;t credit your work to us under the LGPL.

           To set them do something similar to the following in the first part
           of your postamble section in Makefile.PL.  All occurences of &lt;br&gt; in
           the copyright are replaced with newlines, to make it easier to put in
           a multi-line string.

             POD_SET=Glib::GenPod::set_copyright(qq{Copyright 1999 team-foobar&lt;br&gt;LGPL});

           Glib::MakeHelper::postamble_docs_full() does this sort of thing for
           you.

   Helpers
       $perl_type = convert_type ($ctypestring)
           Convert a C type name to a Perl type name.

           Uses %Glib::GenPod::basic_types to look for some known basic types,
           and uses Glib::Type-&gt;package_from_cname to look up the registered
           package corresponding to a C type name.  If no suitable mapping can
           be found, this just returns the input string.

       $string = xsub_to_pod ($xsub, $sigprefix=&apos;&apos;)
           Convert an xsub hash into a string of pod describing it.  Includes
           the call signature, argument listing, and description, honoring
           special switches in the description pod (arg and signature
           overrides).

       $string = compile_signature ($xsub)
           Given an xsub hash, return a string with the call signature for that
           xsub.

       $string = fixup_arg_name ($name)
           Prepend a $ to anything that&apos;s not the literal ellipsis string &apos;...&apos;.

       fixup_default
           Mangle default parameter values from C to Perl values.  Mostly, this
           does NULL =&gt; undef.

       convert_arg_type
           C type to Perl type conversion for argument types.

       convert_return_type_to_name
           C type to Perl type conversion suitable for return types.
