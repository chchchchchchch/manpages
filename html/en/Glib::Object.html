NAME
       Glib::Object -  Bindings for GObject

DESCRIPTION
       GObject is the base object class provided by the gobject library.  It
       provides object properties with a notification system, and emittable
       signals.

       Glib::Object is the corresponding Perl object class.  Glib::Objects are
       represented by blessed hash references, with a magical connection to the
       underlying C object.

   get and set
       Some subclasses of &quot;Glib::Object&quot; override &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot; with methods
       more useful to the subclass, for example &quot;Gtk2::TreeModel&quot; getting and
       setting row contents.

       This is usually done when the subclass has no object properties.  Any
       object properties it or a further subclass does have can always be
       accessed with &quot;get_property&quot; and &quot;set_property&quot; (together with
       &quot;find_property&quot; and &quot;list_properties&quot; to enquire about them).

       Generic code for any object subclass can use the names &quot;get_property&quot; and
       &quot;set_property&quot; to be sure of getting the object properties as such.

HIERARCHY
         Glib::Object

METHODS
   object = $class-&gt;new (...)
       &#183;   ... (list) key/value pairs, property values to set on creation

       Instantiate a Glib::Object of type $class.  Any key/value pairs in ...
       are used to set properties on the new object; see &quot;set&quot;.  This is
       designed to be inherited by Perl-derived subclasses (see
       Glib::Object::Subclass), but you can actually use it to create any
       GObject-derived type.

   scalar = Glib::Object-&gt;new_from_pointer ($pointer, $noinc=FALSE)
       &#183;   $pointer (unsigned) a C pointer value as an integer.

       &#183;   $noinc (boolean) if true, do not increase the GObject&apos;s reference
           count when creating the Perl wrapper.  this typically means that when
           the Perl wrapper will own the object.  in general you don&apos;t want to
           do that, so the default is false.

       Create a Perl Glib::Object reference for the C object pointed to by
       $pointer.  You should need this very rarely; it&apos;s intended to support
       foreign objects.

       NOTE: the cast from arbitrary integer to GObject may result in a core
       dump without warning, because the type-checking macro G_OBJECT() attempts
       to dereference the pointer to find a GTypeClass structure, and there is
       no portable way to validate the pointer.

   unsigned = $object-&gt;get_data ($key)
       &#183;   $key (string)

       Fetch the integer stored under the object data key $key.  These values do
       not have types; type conversions must be done manually.  See &quot;set_data&quot;.

   $object-&gt;set_data ($key, $data)
       &#183;   $key (string)
&#12;       &#183;   $data (scalar)

       GObject provides an arbitrary data mechanism that assigns unsigned
       integers to key names.  Functionality overlaps with the hash used as the
       Perl object instance, so we strongly recommend you use hash keys for your
       data storage.  The GObject data values cannot store type information, so
       they are not safe to use for anything but integer values, and you really
       should use this method only if you know what you are doing.

   pspec or undef = $object_or_class_name-&gt;find_property ($name)
       &#183;   $name (string)

       Find the definition of object property $name for $object_or_class_name.
       Return &quot;undef&quot; if no such property.  For the returned data see
       Glib::Object::list_properties.

   $object-&gt;freeze_notify
       Stops emission of &quot;notify&quot; signals on $object. The signals are queued
       until &quot;thaw_notify&quot; is called on $object.

   $object-&gt;get (...)
       &#183;   ... (list) list of property names

       Alias for &quot;get_property&quot; (see &quot;get and set&quot; above).

   $object-&gt;set (key =&gt; $value, ...)
       &#183;   ... (list) key/value pairs

       Alias for &quot;set_property&quot; (see &quot;get and set&quot; above).

   list = $object_or_class_name-&gt;list_properties
       List all the object properties for $object_or_class_name; returns them as
       a list of hashes, containing these keys:

       name
           The name of the property

       type
           The type of the property

       owner_type
           The type that owns the property

       descr
           The description of the property

       flags
           The Glib::ParamFlags of the property

   $object-&gt;notify ($property_name)
       &#183;   $property_name (string)

       Emits a &quot;notify&quot; signal for the property $property on $object.

   gpointer = $object-&gt;get_pointer
       Complement of &quot;new_from_pointer&quot;.

   $object-&gt;get_property (...)
       Fetch and return the values for the object properties named in ....

   $object-&gt;set_property (key =&gt; $value, ...)
       Set object properties.

   unsigned = $object_or_class_name-&gt;signal_add_emission_hook ($detailed_signal,
       $hook_func, $hook_data=undef)
       &#183;   $detailed_signal (string) of the form &quot;signal-name::detail&quot;

       &#183;   $hook_func (subroutine)
&#12;       &#183;   $hook_data (scalar)

       Add an emission hook for a signal.  The hook will be called for any
       emission of that signal, independent of the instance.  This is possible
       only for signals which don&apos;t have the &quot;G_SIGNAL_NO_HOOKS&quot; flag set.

       The $hook_func should be reference to a subroutine that looks something
       like this:

         sub emission_hook {
             my ($invocation_hint, $parameters, $hook_data) = @_;
             # $parameters is a reference to the @_ to be passed to
             # signal handlers, including the instance as $parameters-&gt;[0].
             return $stay_connected;  # boolean
         }

       This function returns an id that can be used with &quot;remove_emission_hook&quot;.

       Since 1.100.

   list = $instance-&gt;signal_chain_from_overridden (...)
       &#183;   ... (list)

       Chain up to an overridden class closure; it is only valid to call this
       from a class closure override.

       Translation: because of various details in how GObjects are implemented,
       the way to override a virtual method on a GObject is to provide a new
       &quot;class closure&quot;, or default handler for a signal.  This happens when a
       class is registered with the type system (see Glib::Type::register and
       Glib::Object::Subclass).  When called from inside such an override, this
       method runs the overridden class closure.  This is equivalent to calling
       $self-&gt;SUPER::$method (@_) in normal Perl objects.

   unsigned = $instance-&gt;signal_connect ($detailed_signal, $callback,
       $data=undef)
       &#183;   $detailed_signal (string)

       &#183;   $callback (subroutine)

       &#183;   $data (scalar) arbitrary data to be passed to each invocation of
           callback

       Register callback to be called on each emission of $detailed_signal.
       Returns an identifier that may be used to remove this handler with
       &quot;$object-&gt;signal_handler_disconnect&quot;.

   unsigned = $instance-&gt;signal_connect_after ($detailed_signal, $callback,
       $data=undef)
       &#183;   $detailed_signal (string)

       &#183;   $callback (scalar)

       &#183;   $data (scalar)

       Like &quot;signal_connect&quot;, except that $callback will be run after the
       default handler.

   unsigned = $instance-&gt;signal_connect_swapped ($detailed_signal, $callback,
       $data=undef)
       &#183;   $detailed_signal (string)

       &#183;   $callback (scalar)

       &#183;   $data (scalar)

       Like &quot;signal_connect&quot;, except that $data and $object will be swapped on
       invocation of $callback.
&#12;   retval = $object-&gt;signal_emit ($name, ...)
       &#183;   $name (string) the name of the signal

       &#183;   ... (list) any arguments to pass to handlers.

       Emit the signal name on $object.  The number and types of additional
       arguments in ... are determined by the signal; similarly, the presence
       and type of return value depends on the signal being emitted.

   $ihint = $instance-&gt;signal_get_invocation_hint
       Get a reference to a hash describing the innermost signal currently
       active on $instance.  Returns undef if no signal emission is active.
       This invocation hint is the same object passed to signal emission hooks,
       and contains these keys:

       signal_name
           The name of the signal being emitted.

       detail
           The detail passed on for this emission.  For example, a &quot;notify&quot;
           signal will have the property name as the detail.

       run_type
           The current stage of signal emission, one of &quot;run-first&quot;, &quot;run-last&quot;,
           or &quot;run-cleanup&quot;.

   $object-&gt;signal_handler_block ($handler_id)
       &#183;   $handler_id (unsigned)

   $object-&gt;signal_handler_disconnect ($handler_id)
       &#183;   $handler_id (unsigned)

   boolean = $object-&gt;signal_handler_is_connected ($handler_id)
       &#183;   $handler_id (unsigned)

   $object-&gt;signal_handler_unblock ($handler_id)
       &#183;   $handler_id (unsigned)

   integer = $instance-&gt;signal_handlers_block_by_func ($func, $data=undef)
       &#183;   $func (subroutine) function to block

       &#183;   $data (scalar) data to match, ignored if undef

   integer = $instance-&gt;signal_handlers_disconnect_by_func ($func, $data=undef)
       &#183;   $func (subroutine) function to block

       &#183;   $data (scalar) data to match, ignored if undef

   integer = $instance-&gt;signal_handlers_unblock_by_func ($func, $data=undef)
       &#183;   $func (subroutine) function to block

       &#183;   $data (scalar) data to match, ignored if undef

   scalar = $object_or_class_name-&gt;signal_query ($name)
       &#183;   $name (string)

       Look up information about the signal $name on the instance type
       $object_or_class_name, which may be either a Glib::Object or a package
       name.

       See also &quot;Glib::Type::list_signals&quot;, which returns the same kind of hash
       refs as this does.

       Since 1.080.

   $object_or_class_name-&gt;signal_remove_emission_hook ($signal_name, $hook_id)
       &#183;   $signal_name (string)

       &#183;   $hook_id (unsigned)
&#12;       Remove a hook that was installed by &quot;add_emission_hook&quot;.

       Since 1.100.

   $instance-&gt;signal_stop_emission_by_name ($detailed_signal)
       &#183;   $detailed_signal (string)

   $object-&gt;thaw_notify
       Reverts the effect of a previous call to &quot;freeze_notify&quot;. This causes all
       queued &quot;notify&quot; signals on $object to be emitted.

   boolean = Glib::Object-&gt;set_threadsafe ($threadsafe)
       &#183;   $threadsafe (boolean)

       Enables/disables threadsafe gobject tracking. Returns whether or not
       tracking will be successful and thus whether using perl ithreads will be
       possible.

   $object-&gt;tie_properties ($all=FALSE)
       &#183;   $all (boolean) if FALSE (or omitted) tie only properties for this
           object&apos;s class, if TRUE tie the properties of this and all parent
           classes.

       A special method available to Glib::Object derivatives, it uses perl&apos;s
       tie facilities to associate hash keys with the properties of the object.
       For example:

         $button-&gt;tie_properties;
         # equivilent to $button-&gt;set (label =&gt; &apos;Hello World&apos;);
         $button-&gt;{label} = &apos;Hello World&apos;;
         print &quot;the label is: &quot;.$button-&gt;{label}.&quot;\n&quot;;

       Attempts to write to read-only properties will croak, reading a write-
       only property will return &apos;[write-only]&apos;.

       Care must be taken when using tie_properties with objects of types
       created with Glib::Object::Subclass as there may be clashes with existing
       hash keys that could cause infinite loops. The solution is to use custom
       property get/set functions to alter the storage locations of the
       properties.
