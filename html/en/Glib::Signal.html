Glib::Signal(3pm)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     Glib::Signal(3pm)



NAME
       Glib::Signal -  Object customization and general purpose notification

DESCRIPTION
       This page describes some functions related to signals in Glib.  Since
       most things you can do with signals are tied to Glib::Object instances,
       the majority of the signal functions are documented there.

   Thread safety
       Some libraries, most notably GStreamer, sometimes invoke signal handlers
       from a foreign thread that has no Perl interpreter associated with it.
       When this happens, we have no choice but to hand the marshalling over to
       the main loop which in turn later wakes up the main thread and lets it
       handle the request.  We cannot invoke the signal handler from the foreign
       thread since the Perl interpreter may not be used concurrently.

       The downside to this approach is that the foreign thread is blocked until
       the main thread has finished executing the signal handler.  This might
       lead to deadlocks.  It might help in this case to wrap the crucial parts
       of the signal handler inside a Glib::Idle callback so that the signal
       handler can return directly.

METHODS
   integer = Glib-&gt;install_exception_handler ($func, $data=undef)
       &#183;   $func (subroutine)

       &#183;   $data (scalar)

       Install a subroutine to be executed when a signal emission traps an
       exception (a croak or die).  $func should return boolean (true if the
       handler should remain installed) and expect to receive a single scalar.
       This scalar will be a private copy of $@ which the handler can mangle to
       its heart&apos;s content.

       Returns an identifier that may be used with &quot;remove_exception_handler&quot;.

       See &quot;gperl_install_exception_handler()&quot; in Glib::xsapi.

   Glib-&gt;remove_exception_handler ($tag)
       &#183;   $tag (integer)

       Remove the exception handler identified by $tag, as returned by
       &quot;install_exception_handler&quot;.  If $tag cannot be found, this does nothing.

       WARNING:  Do not call this function from within an exception handler.  If
       you want to remove your handler during its execution just have it return
       false.

       See &quot;gperl_remove_exception_handler()&quot; in Glib::xsapi.
