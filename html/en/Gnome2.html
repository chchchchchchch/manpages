NAME
       Gnome2 - Perl interface to the 2.x series of the GNOME libraries

SYNOPSIS
         use Gnome2;
         Gnome2::Program-&gt;init ($appname, $appversion);
         my $app = Gnome2::App-&gt;new ($appname);
         $app-&gt;show;
         Gtk2-&gt;main;

ABSTRACT
       Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the GNOME libraries.  This module
       allows you to interface with the libgnome and libgnomeui libraries to
       create GNOME applications.

DESCRIPTION
       Since this module tries to stick very closely to the C API, the
       documentation found at

         http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/libgnome/index.html

       and

         http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/libgnomeui/index.html

       is the canonical reference.

       In addition to that, there&apos;s also the automatically generated API
       documentation: Gnome2::index(3pm).

       The mapping described in Gtk2::api(3pm) also applies to this module.

       To discuss this module, ask questions and flame/praise the authors, join
       gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

RENAMED METHODS
       gnome_program_get
           Gnome2::Program-&gt;get has been renamed to -&gt;get_program to avoid a
           clash with GObject-&gt;get.

       gnome_popup_menu_attach
           Gtk2::Menu-&gt;attach has been renamed to -&gt;attach_to to avoid a clash
           with gtk_menu_attach.

       gnome_popup_menu_append
           Gtk2::Menu-&gt;append has been renamed to -&gt;append_from to avoid a clash
           with gtk_menu_shell_append.

DIFFERENT CALL SIGNATURES OR SEMANTICS
       gnome_client_set_restart_command
       gnome_client_set_discard_command
       gnome_client_set_resign_command
       gnome_client_set_shutdown_command
       gnome_client_set_clone_command
           Instead of argc and argv you simply pass in a list.

       gnome_program_init
           Gnome2::Program-&gt;init automagically fills argc and argv so just omit
           these parameters.

AUTHOR
       muppet &lt;scott at asofyet dot org&gt; did the initial stuff.

       Torsten Schoenfeld &lt;kaffeetisch at gmx dot de&gt; took over between 0.34 and
       0.36, and implemented lots of tests and missing functionality, and
       corrected several of muppet&apos;s mistakes.
