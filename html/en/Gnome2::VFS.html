NAME
       Gnome2::VFS - Perl interface to the 2.x series of the GNOME VFS library

SYNOPSIS
         use Gnome2::VFS;

         sub die_already {
           my ($action) = @_;
           die(&quot;An error occured while $action.\n&quot;);

ABSTRACT
       This module allows you to interface with the GNOME Virtual File System
       library.  It provides the means to transparently access files on all
       kinds of filesystems.

DESCRIPTION
       Since this module tries to stick very closely to the C API, the
       documentation found at

         L&lt;http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gnome-vfs-2.0/&gt;

       is the canonical reference.

       In addition to that, there&apos;s also the automatically generated API
       documentation: Gnome2::VFS::index.

       The mapping described in Gtk2::api also applies to this module.

       To discuss this module, ask questions and flame/praise the authors, join
       gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

KNOWN BUGS
       There are some memory leaks especially with respect to callbacks.  This
       mainly affects GnomeVFSAsync as well as some parts of GnomeVFSXfer and
       GnomeVFSOps.  GnomeVFSMime leaks some list data.

       GnomeVFSAsync is also known to crash under certain conditions when there
       are many concurrent transfers.

SEE ALSO
       Gnome2::VFS::index, Glib, Gtk2, Gtk2::api.
