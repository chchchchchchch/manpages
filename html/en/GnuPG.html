NAME
       GnuPG - The GNU Privacy Guard suite of programs

DESCRIPTION
       GnuPG  is  a set of programs for public key encryption and digital signa&#8208;
       tures.  The program most users will want to use is  the  OpenPGP  command
       line  tool,  named  gpg.   gpgv is a stripped down version of gpg with no
       encryption functionality,  used  only  to  verify  signatures  against  a
       trusted  keyring.   There is also a tool called gpgsplit to split OpenPGP
       messages or keyrings into their component packets.  This is mainly useful
       for seeing how OpenPGP messages are put together.
