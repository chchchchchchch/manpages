NAME
       Gtk2::TrayIcon - Perl interface to the EggTrayIcon library

SYNOPSIS
         use Gtk2::TrayIcon;
         Gtk2-&gt;init;

         my $icon= Gtk2::TrayIcon-&gt;new(&quot;test&quot;);
         my $label= Gtk2::Label-&gt;new(&quot;test&quot;);
         $icon-&gt;add($label);
         $icon-&gt;show_all;

         Gtk2-&gt;main;

ABSTRACT
       This module allows a Perl developer to embed an arbitrary widget in a
       System Tray like the Gnome notification area.

DESCRIPTION
       EggTrayIcon is slated for inclusion in Gtk+ at some point, which is the
       reason the &quot;Gtk2::TrayIcon&quot; namespace. As all egg libs, EggTrayIcon is
       not considered api stable and its not installed as a shared object.

       Enough about what it is not, &quot;Gtk2::TrayIcon&quot; is first and foremost a
       simple way of giving a Gtk2 script access to the system tray.

       System Trays are found in both KDE and Gnome. But neither support the
       spec fully (see below).

       &quot;Gtk2::TrayIcon&quot; is a subclass of &quot;Gtk2::Plug&quot; and should be used as
       such.

METHODS
       5 methods are available.

       $trayicon= Gtk2::TrayIcon-&gt;new_from_screen($screen, $name)
           This creates a widget already connected to the notification area of
           $screen. $screen should be a &quot;Gtk::Gdk::Screen&quot;.

       $trayicon= Gtk2::TrayIcon-&gt;new($name)
           Like &quot;new_from_screen&quot; but uses the default screen of the active
           display.

       $msgid= $trayicon-&gt;send_message($timeout, $message)
           Ask the tray to display $message for $timeout milliseconds.  If
           $timeout is 0, the message will not expire.

           Note that it is up to the tray to decide what to do with the message
           both Gnome and KDE just ignores it.

       $trayicon-&gt;cancel_message($msgid)
           Ask the tray to cancel the message.
