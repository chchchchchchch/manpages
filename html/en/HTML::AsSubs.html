NAME
       HTML::AsSubs - functions that construct a HTML syntax tree

VERSION
       This document describes version 5.02 of HTML::AsSubs, released June 27,
       2012 as part of HTML-Tree.

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::AsSubs;
        $h = body(
                  h1(&quot;This is the heading&quot;),
                  p(&quot;This is the first paragraph which contains a &quot;,
                    a({href=&gt;&apos;link.html&apos;}, &quot;link&quot;),
                    &quot; and an &quot;,
                    img({src=&gt;&apos;img.gif&apos;, alt=&gt;&apos;image&apos;}),
                    &quot;.&quot;
                   ),
                 );
        print $h-&gt;as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports functions that can be used to construct various HTML
       elements. The functions are named after the tags of the corresponding
       HTML element and are all written in lower case. If the first argument is
       a hash reference then it will be used to initialize the attributes of
       this element. The remaining arguments are regarded as content.

       For a similar idea (i.e., it&apos;s another case where the syntax tree of the
       Perl source mirrors the syntax tree of the HTML produced), see
       HTML::Element&apos;s &quot;new_from_lol&quot; method.

       For what I now think is a cleaner implementation of this same idea, see
       the excellent module &quot;XML::Generator&quot;, which is what I suggest for actual
       real-life use.  (I suggest this over &quot;HTML::AsSubs&quot; and over &quot;CGI.pm&quot;&apos;s
       HTML-making functions.)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
       This module was inspired by the following message:

        Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 16:11:30 +0100
        Subject: Wow! I have a large lightbulb above my head!

        Take a moment to consider these lines:

        %OVERLOAD=( &apos;&quot;&quot;&apos; =&gt; sub { join(&quot;&quot;, @{$_[0]}) } );

        sub html { my($type)=shift; bless [&quot;&lt;$type&gt;&quot;, @_, &quot;&lt;/$type&gt;&quot;]; }

        :-)  I *love* Perl 5!  Thankyou Larry and Ilya.

        Regards,
        Tim Bunce.

        p.s. If you didn&apos;t get it, think about recursive data types: html(html())
        p.p.s. I&apos;ll turn this into a much more practical example in a day or two.
        p.p.p.s. It&apos;s a pity that overloads are not inherited. Is this a bug?

BUGS
       The exported link() function overrides the builtin link() function.  The
       exported tr() function must be called using &amp;tr(...) syntax because it
       clashes with the builtin tr/../../ operator.

       A bunch of methods for creating tags.

Private Functions
   _elem()
       The _elem() function is wrapped by all the html &apos;tag&apos; functions. It takes
       a tag-name, optional hashref of attributes and a list of content as
       parameters.
