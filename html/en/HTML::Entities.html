NAME
       HTML::Entities - Encode or decode strings with HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Entities;

        $a = &quot;V&amp;aring;re norske tegn b&amp;oslash;r &amp;#230res&quot;;
        decode_entities($a);
        encode_entities($a, &quot;\200-\377&quot;);

       For example, this:

        $input = &quot;vis-a-vis Beyonce&apos;s naieve\npapier-mache resume&quot;;
        print encode_entities($input), &quot;\n&quot;

       Prints this out:

        vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Beyonc&amp;eacute;&apos;s na&amp;iuml;ve
        papier-m&amp;acirc;ch&amp;eacute; r&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute;

DESCRIPTION
       This module deals with encoding and decoding of strings with HTML
       character entities.  The module provides the following functions:

       decode_entities( $string, ... )
           This routine replaces HTML entities found in the $string with the
           corresponding Unicode character.  Unrecognized entities are left
           alone.

           If multiple strings are provided as argument they are each decoded
           separately and the same number of strings are returned.

           If called in void context the arguments are decoded in-place.

           This routine is exported by default.

       _decode_entities( $string, \%entity2char )
       _decode_entities( $string, \%entity2char, $expand_prefix )
           This will in-place replace HTML entities in $string.  The
           %entity2char hash must be provided.  Named entities not found in the
           %entity2char hash are left alone.  Numeric entities are expanded
           unless their value overflow.

           The keys in %entity2char are the entity names to be expanded and
           their values are what they should expand into.  The values do not
           have to be single character strings.  If a key has &quot;;&quot; as suffix,
           then occurrences in $string are only expanded if properly terminated
           with &quot;;&quot;.  Entities without &quot;;&quot; will be expanded regardless of how
           they are terminated for compatibility with how common browsers treat
           entities in the Latin-1 range.

           If $expand_prefix is TRUE then entities without trailing &quot;;&quot; in
           %entity2char will even be expanded as a prefix of a longer
           unrecognized name.  The longest matching name in %entity2char will be
           used. This is mainly present for compatibility with an MSIE
           misfeature.

              $string = &quot;foo&amp;nbspbar&quot;;
              _decode_entities($string, { nb =&gt; &quot;@&quot;, nbsp =&gt; &quot;\xA0&quot; }, 1);
              print $string;  # will print &quot;foo bar&quot;

           This routine is exported by default.

       encode_entities( $string )
       encode_entities( $string, $unsafe_chars )
           This routine replaces unsafe characters in $string with their entity
           representation. A second argument can be given to specify which
           characters to consider unsafe.  The unsafe characters is specified
           using the regular expression character class syntax (what you find
           within brackets in regular expressions).

           The default set of characters to encode are control chars, high-bit
           chars, and the &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&apos;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot; characters.  But this, for
           example, would encode just the &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;&quot; characters:

             $encoded = encode_entities($input, &apos;&lt;&gt;&amp;&quot;&apos;);

           and this would only encode non-plain ascii:

             $encoded = encode_entities($input, &apos;^\n\x20-\x25\x27-\x7e&apos;);

           This routine is exported by default.

       encode_entities_numeric( $string )
       encode_entities_numeric( $string, $unsafe_chars )
           This routine works just like encode_entities, except that the
           replacement entities are always &quot;&amp;#xhexnum;&quot; and never &quot;&amp;entname;&quot;.
           For example, &quot;encode_entities(&quot;r\xF4le&quot;)&quot; returns &quot;r&amp;ocirc;le&quot;, but
           &quot;encode_entities_numeric(&quot;r\xF4le&quot;)&quot; returns &quot;r&amp;#xF4;le&quot;.

           This routine is not exported by default.  But you can always export
           it with &quot;use HTML::Entities qw(encode_entities_numeric);&quot; or even
           &quot;use HTML::Entities qw(:DEFAULT encode_entities_numeric);&quot;

       All these routines modify the string passed as the first argument, if
       called in a void context.  In scalar and array contexts, the encoded or
       decoded string is returned (without changing the input string).

       If you prefer not to import these routines into your namespace, you can
       call them as:

         use HTML::Entities ();
         $decoded = HTML::Entities::decode($a);
         $encoded = HTML::Entities::encode($a);
         $encoded = HTML::Entities::encode_numeric($a);

       The module can also export the %char2entity and the %entity2char hashes,
       which contain the mapping from all characters to the corresponding
       entities (and vice versa, respectively).
