NAME
       HTML::LinkExtor - Extract links from an HTML document

SYNOPSIS
        require HTML::LinkExtor;
        $p = HTML::LinkExtor-&gt;new(\&amp;cb, &quot;http://www.perl.org/&quot;);
        sub cb {
            my($tag, %links) = @_;
            print &quot;$tag @{[%links]}\n&quot;;
        }
        $p-&gt;parse_file(&quot;index.html&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::LinkExtor is an HTML parser that extracts links from an HTML
       document.  The HTML::LinkExtor is a subclass of HTML::Parser. This means
       that the document should be given to the parser by calling the
       $p-&gt;parse() or $p-&gt;parse_file() methods.

       $p = HTML::LinkExtor-&gt;new
       $p = HTML::LinkExtor-&gt;new( $callback )
       $p = HTML::LinkExtor-&gt;new( $callback, $base )
           The constructor takes two optional arguments. The first is a
           reference to a callback routine. It will be called as links are
           found. If a callback is not provided, then links are just accumulated
           internally and can be retrieved by calling the $p-&gt;links() method.

           The $base argument is an optional base URL used to absolutize all
           URLs found.  You need to have the URI module installed if you provide
           $base.

           The callback is called with the lowercase tag name as first argument,
           and then all link attributes as separate key/value pairs.  All non-
           link attributes are removed.

       $p-&gt;links
           Returns a list of all links found in the document.  The returned
           values will be anonymous arrays with the following elements:

             [$tag, $attr =&gt; $url1, $attr2 =&gt; $url2,...]

           The $p-&gt;links method will also truncate the internal link list.  This
           means that if the method is called twice without any parsing between
           them the second call will return an empty list.

           Also note that $p-&gt;links will always be empty if a callback routine
           was provided when the HTML::LinkExtor was created.

EXAMPLE
       This is an example showing how you can extract links from a document
       received using LWP:

         use LWP::UserAgent;
         use HTML::LinkExtor;
         use URI::URL;

         $url = &quot;http://www.perl.org/&quot;;  # for instance
         $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;

         # Set up a callback that collect image links
         my @imgs = ();
         sub callback {
            my($tag, %attr) = @_;
            return if $tag ne &apos;img&apos;;  # we only look closer at &lt;img ...&gt;
            push(@imgs, values %attr);
         }

         # Make the parser.  Unfortunately, we don&apos;t know the base yet
         # (it might be different from $url)
         $p = HTML::LinkExtor-&gt;new(\&amp;callback);

         # Request document and parse it as it arrives
         $res = $ua-&gt;request(HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; $url),
                             sub {$p-&gt;parse($_[0])});

         # Expand all image URLs to absolute ones
         my $base = $res-&gt;base;
         @imgs = map { $_ = url($_, $base)-&gt;abs; } @imgs;

         # Print them out
         print join(&quot;\n&quot;, @imgs), &quot;\n&quot;;
