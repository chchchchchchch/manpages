NAME
       HTML::PullParser - Alternative HTML::Parser interface

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::PullParser;

        $p = HTML::PullParser-&gt;new(file =&gt; &quot;index.html&quot;,
                                   start =&gt; &apos;event, tagname, @attr&apos;,
                                   end   =&gt; &apos;event, tagname&apos;,
                                   ignore_elements =&gt; [qw(script style)],
                                  ) || die &quot;Can&apos;t open: $!&quot;;
        while (my $token = $p-&gt;get_token) {
            #...do something with $token
        }

DESCRIPTION
       The HTML::PullParser is an alternative interface to the HTML::Parser
       class.  It basically turns the HTML::Parser inside out.  You associate a
       file (or any IO::Handle object or string) with the parser at construction
       time and then repeatedly call $parser-&gt;get_token to obtain the tags and
       text found in the parsed document.

       The following methods are provided:

       $p = HTML::PullParser-&gt;new( file =&gt; $file, %options )
       $p = HTML::PullParser-&gt;new( doc =&gt; \$doc, %options )
           A &quot;HTML::PullParser&quot; can be made to parse from either a file or a
           literal document based on whether the &quot;file&quot; or &quot;doc&quot; option is
           passed to the parser&apos;s constructor.

           The &quot;file&quot; passed in can either be a file name or a file handle
           object.  If a file name is passed, and it can&apos;t be opened for
           reading, then the constructor will return an undefined value and $!
           will tell you why it failed.  Otherwise the argument is taken to be
           some object that the &quot;HTML::PullParser&quot; can read() from when it needs
           more data.  The stream will be read() until EOF, but not closed.

           A &quot;doc&quot; can be passed plain or as a reference to a scalar.  If a
           reference is passed then the value of this scalar should not be
           changed before all tokens have been extracted.

           Next the information to be returned for the different token types
           must be set up.  This is done by simply associating an argspec (as
           defined in HTML::Parser) with the events you have an interest in.
           For instance, if you want &quot;start&quot; tokens to be reported as the string
           &apos;S&apos; followed by the tagname and the attributes you might pass an
           &quot;start&quot;-option like this:

              $p = HTML::PullParser-&gt;new(
                     doc   =&gt; $document_to_parse,
                     start =&gt; &apos;&quot;S&quot;, tagname, @attr&apos;,
                     end   =&gt; &apos;&quot;E&quot;, tagname&apos;,
                   );

           At last other &quot;HTML::Parser&quot; options, like &quot;ignore_tags&quot;, and
           &quot;unbroken_text&quot;, can be passed in.  Note that you should not use the
           event_h options to set up parser handlers.  That would confuse the
           inner logic of &quot;HTML::PullParser&quot;.

       $token = $p-&gt;get_token
           This method will return the next token found in the HTML document, or
           &quot;undef&quot; at the end of the document.  The token is returned as an
           array reference.  The content of this array match the argspec set up
           during &quot;HTML::PullParser&quot; construction.

       $p-&gt;unget_token( @tokens )
           If you find out you have read too many tokens you can push them back,
           so that they are returned again the next time $p-&gt;get_token is
           called.

EXAMPLES
       The &apos;eg/hform&apos; script shows how we might parse the form section of
       HTML::Documents using HTML::PullParser.
