NAME
       HTML::Template - Perl module to use HTML-like templating language

SYNOPSIS
       First you make a template - this is just a normal HTML file with a few
       extra tags, the simplest being &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;

       For example, test.tmpl:

           &lt;html&gt;
           &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test Template&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
           &lt;body&gt;
           My Home Directory is &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=HOME&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;
           My Path is set to &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=PATH&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
           &lt;/html&gt;

       Now you can use it in a small CGI program:

           #!/usr/bin/perl -w
           use HTML::Template;

           # open the html template
           my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(filename =&gt; &apos;test.tmpl&apos;);

           # fill in some parameters
           $template-&gt;param(HOME =&gt; $ENV{HOME});
           $template-&gt;param(PATH =&gt; $ENV{PATH});

           # send the obligatory Content-Type and print the template output
           print &quot;Content-Type: text/html\n\n&quot;, $template-&gt;output;

       If all is well in the universe this should show something like this in
       your browser when visiting the CGI:

           My Home Directory is /home/some/directory
           My Path is set to /bin;/usr/bin

DESCRIPTION
       This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural.  It
       extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;
       &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;&quot; and
       &quot;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS&gt;&quot;.  The file written with HTML and these new tags is called
       a template.  It is usually saved separate from your script - possibly
       even created by someone else!  Using this module you fill in the values
       for the variables, loops and branches declared in the template.  This
       allows you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you
       generate in the Perl script.

       This module is licensed under the same terms as Perl. See the LICENSE
       section below for more details.

TUTORIAL
       If you&apos;re new to HTML::Template, I suggest you start with the
       introductory article available on Perl Monks:

           http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=65642

FAQ
       Please see HTML::Template::FAQ
&#12;MOTIVATION
       It is true that there are a number of packages out there to do HTML
       templates.  On the one hand you have things like HTML::Embperl which
       allows you freely mix Perl with HTML.  On the other hand lie home-grown
       variable substitution solutions.  Hopefully the module can find a place
       between the two.

       One advantage of this module over a full HTML::Embperl-esque solution is
       that it enforces an important divide - design and programming.  By
       limiting the programmer to just using simple variables and loops in the
       HTML, the template remains accessible to designers and other non-perl
       people.  The use of HTML-esque syntax goes further to make the format
       understandable to others.  In the future this similarity could be used to
       extend existing HTML editors/analyzers to support HTML::Template.

       An advantage of this module over home-grown tag-replacement schemes is
       the support for loops.  In my work I am often called on to produce tables
       of data in html.  Producing them using simplistic HTML templates results
       in programs containing lots of HTML since the HTML itself cannot
       represent loops.  The introduction of loop statements in the HTML
       simplifies this situation considerably.  The designer can layout a single
       row and the programmer can fill it in as many times as necessary - all
       they must agree on is the parameter names.

       For all that, I think the best thing about this module is that it does
       just one thing and it does it quickly and carefully.  It doesn&apos;t try to
       replace Perl and HTML, it just augments them to interact a little better.
       And it&apos;s pretty fast.

THE TAGS
   TMPL_VAR
           &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot;&gt;

       The &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot; tag is very simple.  For each &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot; tag in the
       template you call:

           $template-&gt;param(PARAMETER_NAME =&gt; &quot;VALUE&quot;)

       When the template is output the &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot; is replaced with the VALUE
       text you specified.  If you don&apos;t set a parameter it just gets skipped in
       the output.

       You can also specify the value of the parameter as a code reference in
       order to have &quot;lazy&quot; variables. These sub routines will only be
       referenced if the variables are used. See &quot;LAZY VALUES&quot; for more
       information.

       Attributes

       The following &quot;attributes&quot; can also be specified in template var tags:

       &#183;   escape

           This allows you to escape the value before it&apos;s put into the output.
           Th

           This is useful when you want to use a TMPL_VAR in a context where
           those characters would cause trouble. For example:

              &lt;input name=param type=text value=&quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR PARAM&gt;&quot;&gt;

           If you called &quot;param()&quot; with a value like &quot;sam&quot;my&quot; you&apos;ll get in
           trouble with HTML&apos;s idea of a double-quote.  On the other hand, if
           you use &quot;escape=html&quot;, like this:

              &lt;input name=param type=text value=&quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR PARAM ESCAPE=HTML&gt;&quot;&gt;
&#12;           You&apos;ll get what you wanted no matter what value happens to be passed
           in for param.

           The following escape values are supported:

           &#183;   html

               Replaces the following characters with their HTML entity
               equivalent: &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&apos;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;

           &#183;   js

               Escapes (with a backslash) the following characters: &quot;\&quot;, &quot;&apos;&quot;,
               &quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;

           &#183;   url

               URL escapes any ASCII characters except for letters, numbers,
               &quot;_&quot;, &quot;.&quot; and &quot;-&quot;.

           &#183;   none

               Performs no escaping. This is the default, but it&apos;s useful to be
               able to explicitly turn off escaping if you are using the
               &quot;default_escape&quot; option.

       &#183;   default

           With this attribute you can assign a default value to a variable.
           For example, this will output &quot;the devil gave me a taco&quot; if the &quot;who&quot;
           variable is not set.

               &lt;TMPL_VAR WHO DEFAULT=&quot;the devil&quot;&gt; gave me a taco.

   TMPL_LOOP
           &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=&quot;LOOP_NAME&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       The &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; tag is a bit more complicated than &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;.  The
       &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; tag allows you to delimit a section of text and give it a
       name.  Inside this named loop you place &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;s.  Now you pass to
       &quot;param()&quot; a list (an array ref) of parameter assignments (hash refs) for
       this loop.  The loop iterates over the list and produces output from the
       text block for each pass.  Unset parameters are skipped.  Here&apos;s an
       example:

       In the template:

          &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=EMPLOYEE_INFO&gt;
             Name: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=NAME&gt; &lt;br&gt;
             Job:  &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=JOB&gt;  &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       In your Perl code:

           $template-&gt;param(
               EMPLOYEE_INFO =&gt; [{name =&gt; &apos;Sam&apos;, job =&gt; &apos;programmer&apos;}, {name =&gt; &apos;Steve&apos;, job =&gt; &apos;soda jerk&apos;}]
           );
           print $template-&gt;output();

       The output is:

           Name: Sam
           Job: programmer

           Name: Steve
           Job: soda jerk
&#12;       As you can see above the &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; takes a list of variable
       assignments and then iterates over the loop body producing output.

       Often you&apos;ll want to generate a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;&apos;s contents
       programmatically.  Here&apos;s an example of how this can be done (many other
       ways are possible!):

           # a couple of arrays of data to put in a loop:
           my @words     = qw(I Am Cool);
           my @numbers   = qw(1 2 3);
           my @loop_data = ();              # initialize an array to hold your loop

           while (@words and @numbers) {
               my %row_data;      # get a fresh hash for the row data

               # fill in this row
               $row_data{WORD}   = shift @words;
               $row_data{NUMBER} = shift @numbers;

               # the crucial step - push a reference to this row into the loop!
               push(@loop_data, \%row_data);
           }

           # finally, assign the loop data to the loop param, again with a reference:
           $template-&gt;param(THIS_LOOP =&gt; \@loop_data);

       The above example would work with a template like:

           &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=&quot;THIS_LOOP&quot;&gt;
             Word: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;WORD&quot;&gt;
             Number: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;NUMBER&quot;&gt;

           &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       It would produce output like:

           Word: I
           Number: 1

           Word: Am
           Number: 2

           Word: Cool
           Number: 3

       &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;s within &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;s are fine and work as you would
       expect.  If the syntax for the &quot;param()&quot; call has you stumped, here&apos;s an
       example of a param call with one nested loop:

           $template-&gt;param(
               LOOP =&gt; [
                   {
                       name      =&gt; &apos;Bobby&apos;,
                       nicknames =&gt; [{name =&gt; &apos;the big bad wolf&apos;}, {name =&gt; &apos;He-Man&apos;}],
                   },
               ],
           );

       Basically, each &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; gets an array reference.  Inside the array
       are any number of hash references.  These hashes contain the name=&gt;value
       pairs for a single pass over the loop template.

       Inside a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;, the only variables that are usable are the ones
       from the &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;.  The variables in the outer blocks are not
       visible within a template loop.  For the computer-science geeks among
       you, a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; introduces a new scope much like a perl subroutine
       call.  If you want your variables to be global you can use &quot;global_vars&quot;
       option to &quot;new()&quot; described below.

   TMPL_INCLUDE
           &lt;TMPL_INCLUDE NAME=&quot;filename.tmpl&quot;&gt;

       This tag includes a template directly into the current template at the
       point where the tag is found.  The included template contents are used
       exactly as if its contents were physically included in the master
       template.

       The file specified can be an absolute path (beginning with a &apos;/&apos; under
       Unix, for example).  If it isn&apos;t absolute, the path to the enclosing file
       is tried first.  After that the path in the environment variable
       &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; is tried, if it exists.  Next, the &quot;path&quot; option is
       consulted, first as-is and then with &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; prepended if
       available.  As a final attempt, the filename is passed to &quot;open()&quot;
       directly.  See below for more information on &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; and the
       &quot;path&quot; option to &quot;new()&quot;.

       As a protection against infinitely recursive includes, an arbitrary limit
       of 10 levels deep is imposed.  You can alter this limit with the
       &quot;max_includes&quot; option.  See the entry for the &quot;max_includes&quot; option below
       for more details.

   TMPL_IF
           &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

       The &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot; tag allows you to include or not include a block of the
       template based on the value of a given parameter name.  If the parameter
       is given a value that is true for Perl - like &apos;1&apos; - then the block is
       included in the output.  If it is not defined, or given a false value -
       like &apos;0&apos; - then it is skipped.  The parameters are specified the same way
       as with &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;.

       Example Template:

           &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;BOOL&quot;&gt;
             Some text that only gets displayed if BOOL is true!
           &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

       Now if you call &quot;$template-&gt;param(BOOL =&gt; 1)&quot; then the above block will
       be included by output.

       &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt; &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;&quot; blocks can include any valid HTML::Template
       construct - &quot;VAR&quot;s and &quot;LOOP&quot;s and other &quot;IF&quot;/&quot;ELSE&quot; blocks.  Note,
       however, that intersecting a &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot; and a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; is invalid.

           Not going to work:
           &lt;TMPL_IF BOOL&gt;
             &lt;TMPL_LOOP SOME_LOOP&gt;
           &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;
             &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       If the name of a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; is used in a &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;, the &quot;IF&quot; block
       will output if the loop has at least one row.  Example:

           &lt;TMPL_IF LOOP_ONE&gt;
             This will output if the loop is not empty.
           &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

           &lt;TMPL_LOOP LOOP_ONE&gt;
             ....
           &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       WARNING: Much of the benefit of HTML::Template is in decoupling your Perl
       and HTML.  If you introduce numerous cases where you have &quot;TMPL_IF&quot;s and
       matching Perl &quot;if&quot;s, you will create a maintenance problem in keeping the
       two synchronized.  I suggest you adopt the practice of only using
       &quot;TMPL_IF&quot; if you can do so without requiring a matching &quot;if&quot; in your Perl
       code.

   TMPL_ELSE
           &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot;&gt; ... &lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt; ... &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

       You can include an alternate block in your &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot; block by using
       &quot;&lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;&quot;.  NOTE: You still end the block with &quot;&lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;, not
       &quot;&lt;/TMPL_ELSE&gt;&quot;!

          Example:
           &lt;TMPL_IF BOOL&gt;
             Some text that is included only if BOOL is true
           &lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;
             Some text that is included only if BOOL is false
           &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

   TMPL_UNLESS
           &lt;TMPL_UNLESS NAME=&quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

       This tag is the opposite of &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;.  The block is output if the
       &quot;PARAMETER_NAME&quot; is set false or not defined.  You can use &quot;&lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;&quot;
       with &quot;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS&gt;&quot; just as you can with &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;.

           Example:
           &lt;TMPL_UNLESS BOOL&gt;
             Some text that is output only if BOOL is FALSE.
           &lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;
             Some text that is output only if BOOL is TRUE.
           &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

       If the name of a &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot; is used in a &quot;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS&gt;&quot;, the
       &quot;&lt;UNLESS&gt;&quot; block output if the loop has zero rows.

           &lt;TMPL_UNLESS LOOP_ONE&gt;
             This will output if the loop is empty.
           &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

           &lt;TMPL_LOOP LOOP_ONE&gt;
             ....
           &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

   NOTES
       HTML::Template&apos;s tags are meant to mimic normal HTML tags.  However, they
       are allowed to &quot;break the rules&quot;.  Something like:

           &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR IMAGE_SRC&gt;&quot;&gt;

       is not really valid HTML, but it is a perfectly valid use and will work
       as planned.

       The &quot;NAME=&quot; in the tag is optional, although for extensibility&apos;s sake I
       recommend using it.  Example - &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP LOOP_NAME&gt;&quot; is acceptable.

       If you&apos;re a fanatic about valid HTML and would like your templates to
       conform to valid HTML syntax, you may optionally type template tags in
       the form of HTML comments. This may be of use to HTML authors who would
       like to validate their templates&apos; HTML syntax prior to HTML::Template
       processing, or who use DTD-savvy editing tools.

         &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR NAME=PARAM1 --&gt;

       In order to realize a dramatic savings in bandwidth, the standard (non-
       comment) tags will be used throughout this documentation.

METHODS
   new
       Call &quot;new()&quot; to create a new Template object:
&#12;           my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
               filename =&gt; &apos;file.tmpl&apos;,
               option   =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
           );

       You must call &quot;new()&quot; with at least one &quot;name =&quot; value&gt; pair specifying
       how to access the template text.  You can use &quot;filename =&gt; &apos;file.tmpl&apos;&quot;
       to specify a filename to be opened as the template.  Alternately you can
       use:

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
               scalarref =&gt; $ref_to_template_text,
               option    =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
           );

       and

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
               arrayref =&gt; $ref_to_array_of_lines,
               option   =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
           );

       These initialize the template from in-memory resources.  In almost every
       case you&apos;ll want to use the filename parameter.  If you&apos;re worried about
       all the disk access from reading a template file just use mod_perl and
       the cache option detailed below.

       You can also read the template from an already opened filehandle, either
       traditionally as a glob or as a FileHandle:

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new(filehandle =&gt; *FH, option =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

       The four &quot;new()&quot; calling methods can also be accessed as below, if you
       prefer.

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new_file(&apos;file.tmpl&apos;, option =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new_scalar_ref($ref_to_template_text, option =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new_array_ref($ref_to_array_of_lines, option =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new_filehandle($fh, option =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

       And as a final option, for those that might prefer it, you can call new
       as:

           my $t = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
               type   =&gt; &apos;filename&apos;,
               source =&gt; &apos;file.tmpl&apos;,
           );

       Which works for all three of the source types.

       If the environment variable &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; is set and your filename
       doesn&apos;t begin with &quot;/&quot;, then the path will be relative to the value of
       c&lt;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&gt;.

       Example - if the environment variable &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; is set to
       /home/sam and I call &quot;HTML::Template-&gt;new()&quot; with filename set to
       &quot;sam.tmpl&quot;, HTML::Template will try to open /home/sam/sam.tmpl to access
       the template file.  You can also affect the search path for files with
       the &quot;path&quot; option to &quot;new()&quot; - see below for more information.

       You can modify the Template object&apos;s behavior with &quot;new()&quot;. The options
       are available:

       Error Detection Options

       &#183;   die_on_bad_params
&#12;           If set to 0 the module will let you call:

               $template-&gt;param(param_name =&gt; &apos;value&apos;)

           even if &apos;param_name&apos; doesn&apos;t exist in the template body.  Defaults to
           1.

       &#183;   force_untaint

           If set to 1 the module will not allow you to set unescaped parameters
           with tainted values. If set to 2 you will have to untaint all
           parameters, including ones with the escape attribute.  This option
           makes sure you untaint everything so you don&apos;t accidentally introduce
           e.g. cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Requires taint mode.
           Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   strict - if set to 0 the module will allow things that look like they
           might be TMPL_* tags to get by without dieing.  Example:

               &lt;TMPL_HUH NAME=ZUH&gt;

           Would normally cause an error, but if you call new with &quot;strict =&gt; 0&quot;
           HTML::Template will ignore it.  Defaults to 1.

       &#183;   vanguard_compatibility_mode

           If set to 1 the module will expect to see &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;s that look
           like &quot;%NAME%&quot; in addition to the standard syntax.  Also sets
           &quot;die_on_bad_params =&quot; 0&gt;.  If you&apos;re not at Vanguard Media trying to
           use an old format template don&apos;t worry about this one.  Defaults to
           0.

       Caching Options

       &#183;   cache

           If set to 1 the module will cache in memory the parsed templates
           based on the filename parameter, the modification date of the file
           and the options passed to &quot;new()&quot;. This only applies to templates
           opened with the filename parameter specified, not scalarref or
           arrayref templates.  Caching also looks at the modification times of
           any files included using &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot; tags, but again, only if
           the template is opened with filename parameter.

           This is mainly of use in a persistent environment like
           Apache/mod_perl.  It has absolutely no benefit in a normal CGI
           environment since the script is unloaded from memory after every
           request.  For a cache that does work for a non-persistent environment
           see the &quot;shared_cache&quot; option below.

           My simplistic testing shows that using cache yields a 90% performance
           increase under mod_perl.  Cache defaults to 0.

       &#183;   shared_cache

           If set to 1 the module will store its cache in shared memory using
           the IPC::SharedCache module (available from CPAN).  The effect of
           this will be to maintain a single shared copy of each parsed template
           for all instances of HTML::Template on the same machine to use.  This
           can be a significant reduction in memory usage in an environment with
           a single machine but multiple servers.  As an example, on one of our
           systems we use 4MB of template cache and maintain 25 httpd processes
           - shared_cache results in saving almost 100MB!  Of course, some
           reduction in speed versus normal caching is to be expected.  Another
           difference between normal caching and shared_cache is that
           shared_cache will work in a non-persistent environment (like normal
           CGI) - normal caching is only useful in a persistent environment like
           Apache/mod_perl.

           By default HTML::Template uses the IPC key &apos;TMPL&apos; as a shared root
           segment (0x4c504d54 in hex), but this can be changed by setting the
           &quot;ipc_key&quot; &quot;new()&quot; parameter to another 4-character or integer key.
           Other options can be used to affect the shared memory cache
           correspond to IPC::SharedCache options - &quot;ipc_mode&quot;,
           &quot;ipc_segment_size&quot; and &quot;ipc_max_size&quot;.  See IPC::SharedCache for a
           description of how these work - in most cases you shouldn&apos;t need to
           change them from the defaults.

           For more information about the shared memory cache system used by
           HTML::Template see IPC::SharedCache.

       &#183;   double_cache

           If set to 1 the module will use a combination of &quot;shared_cache&quot; and
           normal cache mode for the best possible caching.  Of course, it also
           uses the most memory of all the cache modes.  All the same ipc_*
           options that work with &quot;shared_cache&quot; apply to &quot;double_cache&quot; as
           well. Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   blind_cache

           If set to 1 the module behaves exactly as with normal caching but
           does not check to see if the file has changed on each request.  This
           option should be used with caution, but could be of use on high-load
           servers.  My tests show &quot;blind_cache&quot; performing only 1 to 2 percent
           faster than cache under mod_perl.

           NOTE: Combining this option with shared_cache can result in stale
           templates stuck permanently in shared memory!

       &#183;   file_cache

           If set to 1 the module will store its cache in a file using the
           Storable module.  It uses no additional memory, and my simplistic
           testing shows that it yields a 50% performance advantage.  Like
           &quot;shared_cache&quot;, it will work in a non-persistent environments (like
           CGI). Default is 0.

           If you set this option you must set the &quot;file_cache_dir&quot; option. See
           below for details.

           NOTE: Storable uses &quot;flock()&quot; to ensure safe access to cache files.
           Using &quot;file_cache&quot; on a system or filesystem (like NFS) without
           &quot;flock()&quot; support is dangerous.

       &#183;   file_cache_dir

           Sets the directory where the module will store the cache files if
           &quot;file_cache&quot; is enabled.  Your script will need write permissions to
           this directory.  You&apos;ll also need to make sure the sufficient space
           is available to store the cache files.

       &#183;   file_cache_dir_mode

           Sets the file mode for newly created &quot;file_cache&quot; directories and
           subdirectories.  Defaults to &quot;0700&quot; for security but this may be
           inconvenient if you do not have access to the account running the
           webserver.

       &#183;   double_file_cache

           If set to 1 the module will use a combination of &quot;file_cache&quot; and
           normal &quot;cache&quot; mode for the best possible caching.  The file_cache_*
           options that work with file_cache apply to &quot;double_file_cache&quot; as
           well.  Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   cache_lazy_vars

           The option tells HTML::Template to cache the values returned from
           code references used for &quot;TMPL_VAR&quot;s. See &quot;LAZY VALUES&quot; for details.

       &#183;   cache_lazy_loops

           The option tells HTML::Template to cache the values returned from
           code references used for &quot;TMPL_LOOP&quot;s. See &quot;LAZY VALUES&quot; for details.

       Filesystem Options

       &#183;   path

           You can set this variable with a list of paths to search for files
           specified with the &quot;filename&quot; option to &quot;new()&quot; and for files
           included with the &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot; tag.  This list is only consulted
           when the filename is relative.  The &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; environment
           variable is always tried first if it exists.  Also, if
           &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; is set then an attempt will be made to prepend
           &quot;HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT&quot; onto paths in the path array.  In the case of a
           &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot; file, the path to the including file is also tried
           before path is consulted.

           Example:

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename =&gt; &apos;file.tmpl&apos;,
                   path     =&gt; [&apos;/path/to/templates&apos;, &apos;/alternate/path&apos;],
               );

           NOTE: the paths in the path list must be expressed as UNIX paths,
           separated by the forward-slash character (&apos;/&apos;).

       &#183;   search_path_on_include

           If set to a true value the module will search from the top of the
           array of paths specified by the path option on every &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot;
           and use the first matching template found.  The normal behavior is to
           look only in the current directory for a template to include.
           Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   utf8

           Setting this to true tells HTML::Template to treat your template
           files as UTF-8 encoded.  This will apply to any file&apos;s passed to
           &quot;new()&quot; or any included files. It won&apos;t do anything special to
           scalars templates passed to &quot;new()&quot; since you should be doing the
           encoding on those yourself.

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename =&gt; &apos;umlauts_are_awesome.tmpl&apos;,
                   utf8     =&gt; 1,
               );

           Most templates are either ASCII (the default) or UTF-8 encoded
           Unicode. But if you need some other encoding other than these 2, look
           at the &quot;open_mode&quot; option.

           NOTE: The &quot;utf8&quot; and &quot;open_mode&quot; options cannot be used at the same
           time.

       &#183;   open_mode

           You can set this option to an opening mode with which all template
           files will be opened.

           For example, if you want to use a template that is UTF-16 encoded
           unicode:

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename  =&gt; &apos;file.tmpl&apos;,
                   open_mode =&gt; &apos;&lt;:encoding(UTF-16)&apos;,
               );
&#12;           That way you can force a different encoding (than the default ASCII
           or UTF-8), CR/LF properties etc. on the template files. See PerlIO
           for details.

           NOTE: this only works in perl 5.7.1 and above.

           NOTE: you have to supply an opening mode that actually permits
           reading from the file handle.

           NOTE: The &quot;utf8&quot; and &quot;open_mode&quot; options cannot be used at the same
           time.

       Debugging Options

       &#183;   debug

           If set to 1 the module will write random debugging information to
           STDERR.  Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   stack_debug

           If set to 1 the module will use Data::Dumper to print out the
           contents of the parse_stack to STDERR.  Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   cache_debug

           If set to 1 the module will send information on cache loads, hits and
           misses to STDERR.  Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   shared_cache_debug

           If set to 1 the module will turn on the debug option in
           IPC::SharedCache. Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   memory_debug

           If set to 1 the module will send information on cache memory usage to
           STDERR.  Requires the GTop module.  Defaults to 0.

       Miscellaneous Options

       &#183;   associate

           This option allows you to inherit the parameter values from other
           objects.  The only requirement for the other object is that it have a
           &quot;param()&quot; method that works like HTML::Template&apos;s &quot;param()&quot;.  A good
           candidate would be a CGI query object. Example:

               my $query    = CGI-&gt;new;
               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename  =&gt; &apos;template.tmpl&apos;,
                   associate =&gt; $query,
               );

           Now, &quot;$template-&gt;output()&quot; will act as though

               $template-&gt;param(form_field =&gt; $cgi-&gt;param(&apos;form_field&apos;));

           had been specified for each key/value pair that would be provided by
           the &quot;$cgi-&gt;param()&quot; method.  Parameters you set directly take
           precedence over associated parameters.

           You can specify multiple objects to associate by passing an anonymous
           array to the associate option.  They are searched for parameters in
           the order they appear:

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename  =&gt; &apos;template.tmpl&apos;,
                   associate =&gt; [$query, $other_obj],
               );
&#12;           NOTE: The parameter names are matched in a case-insensitive manner.
           If you have two parameters in a CGI object like &apos;NAME&apos; and &apos;Name&apos; one
           will be chosen randomly by associate.  This behavior can be changed
           by the &quot;case_sensitive&quot; option.

       &#183;   case_sensitive

           Setting this option to true causes HTML::Template to treat template
           variable names case-sensitively.  The following example would only
           set one parameter without the &quot;case_sensitive&quot; option:

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename       =&gt; &apos;template.tmpl&apos;,
                   case_sensitive =&gt; 1
               );
               $template-&gt;param(
                   FieldA =&gt; &apos;foo&apos;,
                   fIELDa =&gt; &apos;bar&apos;,
               );

           This option defaults to off.

           NOTE: with &quot;case_sensitive&quot; and &quot;loop_context_vars&quot; the special loop
           variables are available in lower-case only.

       &#183;   loop_context_vars

           When this parameter is set to true (it is false by default) extra
           variables that depend on the loop&apos;s context are made available inside
           a loop. These are:

           &#183;   __first__

               Value that is true for the first iteration of the loop and false
               every other time.

           &#183;   __last__

               Value that is true for the last iteration of the loop and false
               every other time.

           &#183;   __inner__

               Value that is true for the every iteration of the loop except for
               the first and last.

           &#183;   __outer__

               Value that is true for the first and last iterations of the loop.

           &#183;   __odd__

               Value that is true for the every odd iteration of the loop.

           &#183;   __even__

               Value that is true for the every even iteration of the loop.

           &#183;   __counter__

               An integer (starting from 1) whose value increments for each
               iteration of the loop.

           &#183;   __index__

               An integer (starting from 0) whose value increments for each
               iteration of the loop.

           Just like any other &quot;TMPL_VAR&quot;s these variables can be used in
           &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;&quot; to control how a loop
           is output.

           Example:

               &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=&quot;FOO&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;__first__&quot;&gt;
                   This only outputs on the first pass.
                 &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

                 &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;__odd__&quot;&gt;
                   This outputs every other pass, on the odd passes.
                 &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

                 &lt;TMPL_UNLESS NAME=&quot;__odd__&quot;&gt;
                   This outputs every other pass, on the even passes.
                 &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

                 &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;__inner__&quot;&gt;
                   This outputs on passes that are neither first nor last.
                 &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

                 This is pass number &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;__counter__&quot;&gt;.

                 &lt;TMPL_IF NAME=&quot;__last__&quot;&gt;
                   This only outputs on the last pass.
                 &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;
               &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

           One use of this feature is to provide a &quot;separator&quot; similar in effect
           to the perl function &quot;join()&quot;.  Example:

               &lt;TMPL_LOOP FRUIT&gt;
                 &lt;TMPL_IF __last__&gt; and &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;
                 &lt;TMPL_VAR KIND&gt;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS __last__&gt;, &lt;TMPL_ELSE&gt;.&lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;
               &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

           Would output something like:

             Apples, Oranges, Brains, Toes, and Kiwi.

           Given an appropriate &quot;param()&quot; call, of course. NOTE: A loop with
           only a single pass will get both &quot;__first__&quot; and &quot;__last__&quot; set to
           true, but not &quot;__inner__&quot;.

       &#183;   no_includes

           Set this option to 1 to disallow the &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot; tag in the
           template file.  This can be used to make opening untrusted templates
           slightly less dangerous.  Defaults to 0.

       &#183;   max_includes

           Set this variable to determine the maximum depth that includes can
           reach.  Set to 10 by default.  Including files to a depth greater
           than this value causes an error message to be displayed.  Set to 0 to
           disable this protection.

       &#183;   die_on_missing_include

           If true, then HTML::Template will die if it can&apos;t find a file for a
           &quot;&lt;TMPL_INCLUDE&gt;&quot;. This defaults to true.

       &#183;   global_vars

           Normally variables declared outside a loop are not available inside a
           loop.  This option makes &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR&gt;&quot;s like global variables in Perl
           - they have unlimited scope.  This option also affects &quot;&lt;TMPL_IF&gt;&quot;
           and &quot;&lt;TMPL_UNLESS&gt;&quot;.

           Example:

               This is a normal variable: &lt;TMPL_VAR NORMAL&gt;.&lt;P&gt;
&#12;               &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=FROOT_LOOP&gt;
                 Here it is inside the loop: &lt;TMPL_VAR NORMAL&gt;&lt;P&gt;
               &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

           Normally this wouldn&apos;t work as expected, since &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR NORMAL&gt;&quot;&apos;s
           value outside the loop is not available inside the loop.

           The global_vars option also allows you to access the values of an
           enclosing loop within an inner loop.  For example, in this loop the
           inner loop will have access to the value of &quot;OUTER_VAR&quot; in the
           correct iteration:

               &lt;TMPL_LOOP OUTER_LOOP&gt;
                 OUTER: &lt;TMPL_VAR OUTER_VAR&gt;
                   &lt;TMPL_LOOP INNER_LOOP&gt;
                      INNER: &lt;TMPL_VAR INNER_VAR&gt;
                      INSIDE OUT: &lt;TMPL_VAR OUTER_VAR&gt;
                   &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;
               &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

           One side-effect of &quot;global_vars&quot; is that variables you set with
           &quot;param()&quot; that might otherwise be ignored when &quot;die_on_bad_params&quot; is
           off will stick around.  This is necessary to allow inner loops to
           access values set for outer loops that don&apos;t directly use the value.

           NOTE: &quot;global_vars&quot; is not &quot;global_loops&quot; (which does not exist).
           That means that loops you declare at one scope are not available
           inside other loops even when &quot;global_vars&quot; is on.

       &#183;   filter

           This option allows you to specify a filter for your template files.
           A filter is a subroutine that will be called after HTML::Template
           reads your template file but before it starts parsing template tags.

           In the most simple usage, you simply assign a code reference to the
           filter parameter.  This subroutine will receive a single argument - a
           reference to a string containing the template file text.  Here is an
           example that accepts templates with tags that look like &quot;!!!ZAP_VAR
           FOO!!!&quot; and transforms them into HTML::Template tags:

               my $filter = sub {
                   my $text_ref = shift;
                   $$text_ref =~ s/!!!ZAP_(.*?)!!!/&lt;TMPL_$1&gt;/g;
               };

               # open zap.tmpl using the above filter
               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename =&gt; &apos;zap.tmpl&apos;,
                   filter   =&gt; $filter,
               );

           More complicated usages are possible.  You can request that your
           filter receives the template text as an array of lines rather than as
           a single scalar.  To do that you need to specify your filter using a
           hash-ref.  In this form you specify the filter using the &quot;sub&quot; key
           and the desired argument format using the &quot;format&quot; key.  The
           available formats are &quot;scalar&quot; and &quot;array&quot;.  Using the &quot;array&quot; format
           will incur a performance penalty but may be more convenient in some
           situations.

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename =&gt; &apos;zap.tmpl&apos;,
                   filter   =&gt; {
                       sub    =&gt; $filter,
                       format =&gt; &apos;array&apos;,
                   }
               );

           You may also have multiple filters.  This allows simple filters to be
           combined for more elaborate functionality.  To do this you specify an
           array of filters.  The filters are applied in the order they are
           specified.

               my $template = HTML::Template-&gt;new(
                   filename =&gt; &apos;zap.tmpl&apos;,
                   filter   =&gt; [
                       {
                           sub    =&gt; \&amp;decompress,
                           format =&gt; &apos;scalar&apos;,
                       },
                       {
                           sub    =&gt; \&amp;remove_spaces,
                           format =&gt; &apos;array&apos;,
                       },
                   ]
               );

           The specified filters will be called for any &quot;TMPL_INCLUDE&quot;ed files
           just as they are for the main template file.

       &#183;   default_escape

           Set this parameter to a valid escape type (see the &quot;escape&quot; option)
           and HTML::Template will apply the specified escaping to all variables
           unless they declare a different escape in the template.

   param
       &quot;param()&quot; can be called in a number of ways

       1 - To return a list of parameters in the template :
               my @parameter_names = $self-&gt;param();

       2 - To return the value set to a param :
               my $value = $self-&gt;param(&apos;PARAM&apos;);

       3 - To set the value of a parameter :
               # For simple TMPL_VARs:
               $self-&gt;param(PARAM =&gt; &apos;value&apos;);

               # with a subroutine reference that gets called to get the value
               # of the scalar.  The sub will receive the template object as a
               # parameter.
               $self-&gt;param(PARAM =&gt; sub { return &apos;value&apos; });

               # And TMPL_LOOPs:
               $self-&gt;param(LOOP_PARAM =&gt; [{PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_FIRST_PASS}, {PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_SECOND_PASS}]);

       4 - To set the value of a number of parameters :
               # For simple TMPL_VARs:
               $self-&gt;param(
                   PARAM  =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
                   PARAM2 =&gt; &apos;value&apos;
               );

               # And with some TMPL_LOOPs:
               $self-&gt;param(
                   PARAM              =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
                   PARAM2             =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
                   LOOP_PARAM         =&gt; [{PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_FIRST_PASS}, {PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_SECOND_PASS}],
                   ANOTHER_LOOP_PARAM =&gt; [{PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_FIRST_PASS}, {PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_SECOND_PASS}],
               );

       5 - To set the value of a a number of parameters using a hash-ref :
               $self-&gt;param(
                   {
                       PARAM              =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
                       PARAM2             =&gt; &apos;value&apos;,
                       LOOP_PARAM         =&gt; [{PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_FIRST_PASS}, {PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_SECOND_PASS}],
                       ANOTHER_LOOP_PARAM =&gt; [{PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_FIRST_PASS}, {PARAM =&gt; VALUE_FOR_SECOND_PASS}],
                   }
               );

           An error occurs if you try to set a value that is tainted if the
           &quot;force_untaint&quot; option is set.

   clear_params
       Sets all the parameters to undef. Useful internally, if nowhere else!

   output
       &quot;output()&quot; returns the final result of the template.  In most situations
       you&apos;ll want to print this, like:

           print $template-&gt;output();

       When output is called each occurrence of &quot;&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=name&gt;&quot; is
       replaced with the value assigned to &quot;name&quot; via &quot;param()&quot;.  If a named
       parameter is unset it is simply replaced with &apos;&apos;.  &quot;&lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;&quot;s are
       evaluated once per parameter set, accumulating output on each pass.

       Calling &quot;output()&quot; is guaranteed not to change the state of the
       HTML::Template object, in case you were wondering.  This property is
       mostly important for the internal implementation of loops.

       You may optionally supply a filehandle to print to automatically as the
       template is generated.  This may improve performance and lower memory
       consumption.  Example:

           $template-&gt;output(print_to =&gt; *STDOUT);

       The return value is undefined when using the &quot;print_to&quot; option.

   query
       This method allow you to get information about the template structure.
       It can be called in a number of ways.  The simplest usage of query is
       simply to check whether a parameter name exists in the template, using
       the &quot;name&quot; option:

           if ($template-&gt;query(name =&gt; &apos;foo&apos;)) {
               # do something if a variable of any type named FOO is in the template
           }

       This same usage returns the type of the parameter.  The type is the same
       as the tag minus the leading &apos;TMPL_&apos;.  So, for example, a &quot;TMPL_VAR&quot;
       parameter returns &apos;VAR&apos; from &quot;query()&quot;.

           if ($template-&gt;query(name =&gt; &apos;foo&apos;) eq &apos;VAR&apos;) {
               # do something if FOO exists and is a TMPL_VAR
           }

       Note that the variables associated with &quot;TMPL_IF&quot;s and &quot;TMPL_UNLESS&quot;s
       will be identified as &apos;VAR&apos; unless they are also used in a &quot;TMPL_LOOP&quot;,
       in which case they will return &apos;LOOP&apos;.

       &quot;query()&quot; also allows you to get a list of parameters inside a loop (and
       inside loops inside loops).  Example loop:

           &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=&quot;EXAMPLE_LOOP&quot;&gt;
             &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;BEE&quot;&gt;
             &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;BOP&quot;&gt;
             &lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=&quot;EXAMPLE_INNER_LOOP&quot;&gt;
               &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;INNER_BEE&quot;&gt;
               &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=&quot;INNER_BOP&quot;&gt;
             &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;
           &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

       And some query calls:

           # returns &apos;LOOP&apos;
           $type = $template-&gt;query(name =&gt; &apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;);

           # returns (&apos;bop&apos;, &apos;bee&apos;, &apos;example_inner_loop&apos;)
           @param_names = $template-&gt;query(loop =&gt; &apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;);

           # both return &apos;VAR&apos;
           $type = $template-&gt;query(name =&gt; [&apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;, &apos;BEE&apos;]);
           $type = $template-&gt;query(name =&gt; [&apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;, &apos;BOP&apos;]);

           # and this one returns &apos;LOOP&apos;
           $type = $template-&gt;query(name =&gt; [&apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;, &apos;EXAMPLE_INNER_LOOP&apos;]);

           # and finally, this returns (&apos;inner_bee&apos;, &apos;inner_bop&apos;)
           @inner_param_names = $template-&gt;query(loop =&gt; [&apos;EXAMPLE_LOOP&apos;, &apos;EXAMPLE_INNER_LOOP&apos;]);

           # for non existent parameter names you get undef this returns undef.
           $type = $template-&gt;query(name =&gt; &apos;DWEAZLE_ZAPPA&apos;);

           # calling loop on a non-loop parameter name will cause an error. This dies:
           $type = $template-&gt;query(loop =&gt; &apos;DWEAZLE_ZAPPA&apos;);

       As you can see above the &quot;loop&quot; option returns a list of parameter names
       and both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;loop&quot; take array refs in order to refer to
       parameters inside loops.  It is an error to use &quot;loop&quot; with a parameter
       that is not a loop.

       Note that all the names are returned in lowercase and the types are
       uppercase.

       Just like &quot;param()&quot;, &quot;query()&quot; with no arguments returns all the
       parameter names in the template at the top level.

LAZY VALUES
       As mentioned above, both &quot;TMPL_VAR&quot; and &quot;TMPL_LOOP&quot; values can be code
       references.  These code references are only executed if the variable or
       loop is used in the template.  This is extremely useful if you want to
       make a variable available to template designers but it can be expensive
       to calculate, so you only want to do so if you have to.

       Maybe an example will help to illustrate. Let&apos;s say you have a template
       like this:

           &lt;tmpl_if we_care&gt;
             &lt;tmpl_if life_universe_and_everything&gt;
           &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;

       If &quot;life_universe_and_everything&quot; is expensive to calculate we can wrap
       it&apos;s calculation in a code reference and HTML::Template will only execute
       that code if &quot;we_care&quot; is also true.

           $tmpl-&gt;param(life_universe_and_everything =&gt; sub { calculate_42() });

       Your code reference will be given a single argument, the HTML::Template
       object in use. In the above example, if we wanted &quot;calculate_42()&quot; to
       have this object we&apos;d do something like this:

           $tmpl-&gt;param(life_universe_and_everything =&gt; sub { calculate_42(shift) });

       This same approach can be used for &quot;TMPL_LOOP&quot;s too:

           &lt;tmpl_if we_care&gt;
             &lt;tmpl_loop needles_in_haystack&gt;
               Found &lt;tmpl_var __counter&gt;!
             &lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
           &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;

       And in your Perl code:

           $tmpl-&gt;param(needles_in_haystack =&gt; sub { find_needles() });

       The only difference in the &quot;TMPL_LOOP&quot; case is that the subroutine needs
       to return a reference to an ARRAY, not just a scalar value.

   Multiple Calls
       It&apos;s important to recognize that while this feature is designed to save
       processing time when things aren&apos;t needed, if you&apos;re not careful it can
       actually increase the number of times you perform your calculation.
       HTML::Template calls your code reference each time it seems your loop in
       the template, this includes the times that you might use the loop in a
       conditional (&quot;TMPL_IF&quot; or &quot;TMPL_UNLESS&quot;). For instance:

           &lt;tmpl_if we care&gt;
             &lt;tmpl_if needles_in_haystack&gt;
                 &lt;tmpl_loop needles_in_haystack&gt;
                   Found &lt;tmpl_var __counter&gt;!
                 &lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
             &lt;tmpl_else&gt;
               No needles found!
             &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;
           &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;

       This will actually call &quot;find_needles()&quot; twice which will be even worse
       than you had before.  One way to work around this is to cache the return
       value yourself:

           my $needles;
           $tmpl-&gt;param(needles_in_haystack =&gt; sub { defined $needles ? $needles : $needles = find_needles() });
