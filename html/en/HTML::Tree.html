HTML::Tree(3pm)        User Contributed Perl Documentation       HTML::Tree(3pm)



NAME
       HTML::Tree - build and scan parse-trees of HTML

VERSION
       This document describes version 5.02 of HTML::Tree, released June 27,
       2012 as part of HTML-Tree.

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::TreeBuilder;
           my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();
           $tree-&gt;parse_file($filename);

               # Then do something with the tree, using HTML::Element
               # methods -- for example:

           $tree-&gt;dump

               # Finally:

           $tree-&gt;delete;

DESCRIPTION
       HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of HTML
       source.  It consists of mainly two modules, whose documentation you
       should refer to: HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element.

       HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees.  (It uses
       HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up into tokens.)

       The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the
       class HTML::Element.

       If you find that you do not properly understand the documentation for
       HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element, it may be because you are unfamiliar
       with tree-shaped data structures, or with object-oriented modules in
       general. Sean Burke has written some articles for The Perl Journal
       (&quot;www.tpj.com&quot;) that seek to provide that background.  The full text of
       those articles is contained in this distribution, as:

       HTML::Tree::AboutObjects
           &quot;User&apos;s View of Object-Oriented Modules&quot; from TPJ17.

       HTML::Tree::AboutTrees
           &quot;Trees&quot; from TPJ18

       HTML::Tree::Scanning
           &quot;Scanning HTML&quot; from TPJ19

       Readers already familiar with object-oriented modules and tree-shaped
       data structures should read just the last article.  Readers without that
       background should read the first, then the second, and then the third.

METHODS
       All these methods simply redirect to the corresponding method in
       HTML::TreeBuilder.  It&apos;s more efficient to use HTML::TreeBuilder
       directly, and skip loading HTML::Tree at all.

   new
       Redirects to &quot;new&quot; in HTML::TreeBuilder.

   new_from_file
       Redirects to &quot;new_from_file&quot; in HTML::TreeBuilder.
&#12;   new_from_content
       Redirects to &quot;new_from_content&quot; in HTML::TreeBuilder.

   new_from_url
       Redirects to &quot;new_from_url&quot; in HTML::TreeBuilder.

SUPPORT
