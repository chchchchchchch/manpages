NAME
       HTML::TreeBuilder - Parser that builds a HTML syntax tree

VERSION
       This document describes version 5.02 of HTML::TreeBuilder, released June
       27, 2012 as part of HTML-Tree.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::TreeBuilder 5 -weak; # Ensure weak references in use

         foreach my $file_name (@ARGV) {
           my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new; # empty tree
           $tree-&gt;parse_file($file_name);
           print &quot;Hey, here&apos;s a dump of the parse tree of $file_name:\n&quot;;
           $tree-&gt;dump; # a method we inherit from HTML::Element
           print &quot;And here it is, bizarrely rerendered as HTML:\n&quot;,
             $tree-&gt;as_HTML, &quot;\n&quot;;

           # Now that we&apos;re done with it, we must destroy it.
           # $tree = $tree-&gt;delete; # Not required with weak references
         }

DESCRIPTION
       (This class is part of the HTML::Tree dist.)

       This class is for HTML syntax trees that get built out of HTML source.
       The way to use it is to:

       1. start a new (empty) HTML::TreeBuilder object,

       2. then use one of the methods from HTML::Parser (presumably with
       &quot;$tree-&gt;parse_file($filename)&quot; for files, or with
       &quot;$tree-&gt;parse($document_content)&quot; and &quot;$tree-&gt;eof&quot; if you&apos;ve got the
       content in a string) to parse the HTML document into the tree $tree.

       (You can combine steps 1 and 2 with the &quot;new_from_file&quot; or
       &quot;new_from_content&quot; methods.)

       2b. call &quot;$root-&gt;elementify()&quot; if you want.

       3. do whatever you need to do with the syntax tree, presumably involving
       traversing it looking for some bit of information in it,

       4. previous versions of HTML::TreeBuilder required you to call
       &quot;$tree-&gt;delete()&quot; to erase the contents of the tree from memory when
       you&apos;re done with the tree.  This is not normally required anymore.  See
       &quot;Weak References&quot; in HTML::Element for details.

ATTRIBUTES
       Most of the following attributes native to HTML::TreeBuilder control how
       parsing takes place; they should be set before you try parsing into the
       given object.  You can set the attributes by passing a TRUE or FALSE
       value as argument.  E.g., &quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags&quot; returns the current
       setting for the &quot;implicit_tags&quot; option, &quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags(1)&quot; turns
       that option on, and &quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags(0)&quot; turns it off.

   implicit_tags
       Setting this attribute to true will instruct the parser to try to deduce
       implicit elements and implicit end tags.  If it is false you get a parse
       tree that just reflects the text as it stands, which is unlikely to be
       useful for anything but quick and dirty parsing.  (In fact, I&apos;d be
       curious to hear from anyone who finds it useful to have &quot;implicit_tags&quot;
       set to false.)  Default is true.

       Implicit elements have the &quot;implicit&quot; in HTML::Element attribute set.

   implicit_body_p_tag
       This controls an aspect of implicit element behavior, if &quot;implicit_tags&quot;
       is on:  If a text element (PCDATA) or a phrasal element (such as &quot;&lt;em&gt;&quot;)
       is to be inserted under &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;, two things can happen: if
       &quot;implicit_body_p_tag&quot; is true, it&apos;s placed under a new, implicit &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;
       tag.  (Past DTDs suggested this was the only correct behavior, and this
       is how past versions of this module behaved.)  But if
       &quot;implicit_body_p_tag&quot; is false, nothing is implicated -- the PCDATA or
       phrasal element is simply placed under &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;.  Default is false.

   no_expand_entities
       This attribute controls whether entities are decoded during the initial
       parse of the source. Enable this if you don&apos;t want entities decoded to
       their character value. e.g. &apos;&amp;amp;&apos; is decoded to &apos;&amp;&apos; by default, but
       will be unchanged if this is enabled.  Default is false (entities will be
       decoded.)

   ignore_unknown
       This attribute controls whether unknown tags should be represented as
       elements in the parse tree, or whether they should be ignored.  Default
       is true (to ignore unknown tags.)

   ignore_text
       Do not represent the text content of elements.  This saves space if all
       you want is to examine the structure of the document.  Default is false.

   ignore_ignorable_whitespace
       If set to true, TreeBuilder will try to avoid creating ignorable
       whitespace text nodes in the tree.  Default is true.  (In fact, I&apos;d be
       interested in hearing if there&apos;s ever a case where you need this off, or
       where leaving it on leads to incorrect behavior.)

   no_space_compacting
       This determines whether TreeBuilder compacts all whitespace strings in
       the document (well, outside of PRE or TEXTAREA elements), or leaves them
       alone.  Normally (default, value of 0), each string of contiguous
       whitespace in the document is turned into a single space.  But that&apos;s not
       done if &quot;no_space_compacting&quot; is set to 1.

       Setting &quot;no_space_compacting&quot; to 1 might be useful if you want to read in
       a tree just to make some minor changes to it before writing it back out.

       This method is experimental.  If you use it, be sure to report any
       problems you might have with it.

   p_strict
       If set to true (and it defaults to false), TreeBuilder will take a
       narrower than normal view of what can be under a &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; element; if it
       sees a non-phrasal element about to be inserted under a &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;, it will
       close that &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;.  Otherwise it will close &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; elements only for other
       &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;s, headings, and &quot;&lt;form&gt;&quot; (although the latter may be removed in
       future versions).

       For example, when going thru this snippet of code,

         &lt;p&gt;stuff
         &lt;ul&gt;

       TreeBuilder will normally (with &quot;p_strict&quot; false) put the &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot; element
       under the &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; element.  However, with &quot;p_strict&quot; set to true, it will
       close the &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; first.
&#12;       In theory, there should be strictness options like this for other/all
       elements besides just &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;; but I treat this as a special case simply
       because of the fact that &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; occurs so frequently and its end-tag is
       omitted so often; and also because application of strictness rules at
       parse-time across all elements often makes tiny errors in HTML coding
       produce drastically bad parse-trees, in my experience.

       If you find that you wish you had an option like this to enforce content-
       models on all elements, then I suggest that what you want is content-
       model checking as a stage after TreeBuilder has finished parsing.

   store_comments
       This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store comments found
       while parsing content into $root.  Currently, this is off by default.

   store_declarations
       This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store markup
       declarations found while parsing content into $root.  This is on by
       default.

   store_pis
       This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store processing
       instructions found while parsing content into $root -- assuming a recent
       version of HTML::Parser (old versions won&apos;t parse PIs correctly).
       Currently, this is off (false) by default.

       It is somewhat of a known bug (to be fixed one of these days, if anyone
       needs it?) that PIs in the preamble (before the &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; start-tag) end
       up actually under the &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; element.

   warn
       This determines whether syntax errors during parsing should generate
       warnings, emitted via Perl&apos;s &quot;warn&quot; function.

       This is off (false) by default.

METHODS
       Objects of this class inherit the methods of both HTML::Parser and
       HTML::Element.  The methods inherited from HTML::Parser are used for
       building the HTML tree, and the methods inherited from HTML::Element are
       what you use to scrutinize the tree.  Besides this (HTML::TreeBuilder)
       documentation, you must also carefully read the HTML::Element
       documentation, and also skim the HTML::Parser documentation -- probably
       only its parse and parse_file methods are of interest.

   new_from_file
         $root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_file($filename_or_filehandle);

       This &quot;shortcut&quot; constructor merely combines constructing a new object
       (with the &quot;new&quot; method, below), and calling &quot;$new-&gt;parse_file(...)&quot; on
       it.  Returns the new object.  Note that this provides no way of setting
       any parse options like &quot;store_comments&quot; (for that, call &quot;new&quot;, and then
       set options, before calling &quot;parse_file&quot;).  See the notes (below) on
       parameters to &quot;parse_file&quot;.

       If HTML::TreeBuilder is unable to read the file, then &quot;new_from_file&quot;
       dies.  The error can also be found in $!.  (This behavior is new in HTML-
       Tree 5. Previous versions returned a tree with only implicit elements.)

   new_from_content
         $root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content(...);

       This &quot;shortcut&quot; constructor merely combines constructing a new object
       (with the &quot;new&quot; method, below), and calling &quot;for(...){$new-&gt;parse($_)}&quot;
       and &quot;$new-&gt;eof&quot; on it.  Returns the new object.  Note that this provides
       no way of setting any parse options like &quot;store_comments&quot; (for that, call
       &quot;new&quot;, and then set options, before calling &quot;parse&quot;).  Example usages:
       &quot;HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content(@lines)&quot;, or
       &quot;HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_content($content)&quot;.

   new_from_url
         $root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_url($url)

       This &quot;shortcut&quot; constructor combines constructing a new object (with the
       &quot;new&quot; method, below), loading LWP::UserAgent, fetching the specified URL,
       and calling &quot;$new-&gt;parse( $response-&gt;decoded_content)&quot; and &quot;$new-&gt;eof&quot; on
       it.  Returns the new object.  Note that this provides no way of setting
       any parse options like &quot;store_comments&quot;.

       If LWP is unable to fetch the URL, or the response is not HTML (as
       determined by &quot;content_is_html&quot; in HTTP::Headers), then &quot;new_from_url&quot;
       dies, and the HTTP::Response object is found in
       $HTML::TreeBuilder::lwp_response.

       You must have installed LWP::UserAgent for this method to work.  LWP is
       not installed automatically, because it&apos;s a large set of modules and you
       might not need it.

   new
         $root = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();

       This creates a new HTML::TreeBuilder object.  This method takes no
       attributes.

   parse_file
        $root-&gt;parse_file(...)

       [An important method inherited from HTML::Parser, which see.  Current
       versions of HTML::Parser can take a filespec, or a filehandle object,
       like *FOO, or some object from class IO::Handle, IO::File, IO::Socket) or
       the like.  I think you should check that a given file exists before
       calling &quot;$root-&gt;parse_file($filespec)&quot;.]

       When you pass a filename to &quot;parse_file&quot;, HTML::Parser opens it in binary
       mode, which means it&apos;s interpreted as Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).  If the file
       is in another encoding, like UTF-8 or UTF-16, this will not do the right
       thing.

       One solution is to open the file yourself using the proper &quot;:encoding&quot;
       layer, and pass the filehandle to &quot;parse_file&quot;.  You can automate this
       process by using &quot;html_file&quot; in IO::HTML, which will use the HTML5
       encoding sniffing algorithm to automatically determine the proper
       &quot;:encoding&quot; layer and apply it.

       In the next major release of HTML-Tree, I plan to have it use IO::HTML
       automatically.  If you really want your file opened in binary mode, you
       should open it yourself and pass the filehandle to &quot;parse_file&quot;.

       The return value is &quot;undef&quot; if there&apos;s an error opening the file.  In
       that case, the error will be in $!.

   parse
         $root-&gt;parse(...)

       [A important method inherited from HTML::Parser, which see.  See the note
       below for &quot;$root-&gt;eof()&quot;.]

   eof
         $root-&gt;eof();

       This signals that you&apos;re finished parsing content into this tree; this
       runs various kinds of crucial cleanup on the tree.  This is called for
       you when you call &quot;$root-&gt;parse_file(...)&quot;, but not when you call
       &quot;$root-&gt;parse(...)&quot;.  So if you call &quot;$root-&gt;parse(...)&quot;, then you must
       call &quot;$root-&gt;eof()&quot; once you&apos;ve finished feeding all the chunks to
       &quot;parse(...)&quot;, and before you actually start doing anything else with the
       tree in $root.

   parse_content
         $root-&gt;parse_content(...);

       Basically a handy alias for &quot;$root-&gt;parse(...); $root-&gt;eof&quot;.  Takes the
       exact same arguments as &quot;$root-&gt;parse()&quot;.

   delete
         $root-&gt;delete();

       [A previously important method inherited from HTML::Element, which see.]

   elementify
         $root-&gt;elementify();

       This changes the class of the object in $root from HTML::TreeBuilder to
       the class used for all the rest of the elements in that tree (generally
       HTML::Element).  Returns $root.

       For most purposes, this is unnecessary, but if you call this after
       (after!!)  you&apos;ve finished building a tree, then it keeps you from
       accidentally trying to call anything but HTML::Element methods on it.
       (I.e., if you accidentally call &quot;$root-&gt;parse_file(...)&quot; on the already-
       complete and elementified tree, then instead of charging ahead and
       wreaking havoc, it&apos;ll throw a fatal error -- since $root is now an object
       just of class HTML::Element which has no &quot;parse_file&quot; method.

       Note that &quot;elementify&quot; currently deletes all the private attributes of
       $root except for &quot;_tag&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;, &quot;_content&quot;, &quot;_pos&quot;, and &quot;_implicit&quot;.
       If anyone requests that I change this to leave in yet more private
       attributes, I might do so, in future versions.

   guts
        @nodes = $root-&gt;guts();
        $parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;guts();

       In list context (as in the first case), this method returns the topmost
       non-implicit nodes in a tree.  This is useful when you&apos;re parsing HTML
       code that you know doesn&apos;t expect an HTML document, but instead just a
       fragment of an HTML document.  For example, if you wanted the parse tree
       for a file consisting of just this:

         &lt;li&gt;I like pie!

       Then you would get that with &quot;@nodes = $root-&gt;guts();&quot;.  It so happens
       that in this case, @nodes will contain just one element object,
       representing the &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; node (with &quot;I like pie!&quot; being its text child
       node).  However, consider if you were parsing this:

         &lt;hr&gt;Hooboy!&lt;hr&gt;

       In that case, &quot;$root-&gt;guts()&quot; would return three items: an element object
       for the first &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;, a text string &quot;Hooboy!&quot;, and another &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot; element
       object.

       For cases where you want definitely one element (so you can treat it as a
       &quot;document fragment&quot;, roughly speaking), call &quot;guts()&quot; in scalar context,
       as in &quot;$parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;guts()&quot;. That works like &quot;guts()&quot; in
       list context; in fact, &quot;guts()&quot; in list context would have returned
       exactly one value, and if it would have been an object (as opposed to a
       text string), then that&apos;s what &quot;guts&quot; in scalar context will return.
       Otherwise, if &quot;guts()&quot; in list context would have returned no values at
       all, then &quot;guts()&quot; in scalar context returns undef.  In all other cases,
       &quot;guts()&quot; in scalar context returns an implicit &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot; element node, with
       children consisting of whatever nodes &quot;guts()&quot; in list context would have
       returned.  Note that that may detach those nodes from $root&apos;s tree.

   disembowel
         @nodes = $root-&gt;disembowel();
         $parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;disembowel();

       The &quot;disembowel()&quot; method works just like the &quot;guts()&quot; method, except
       that disembowel definitively destroys the tree above the nodes that are
       returned.  Usually when you want the guts from a tree, you&apos;re just going
       to toss out the rest of the tree anyway, so this saves you the bother.
       (Remember, &quot;disembowel&quot; means &quot;remove the guts from&quot;.)

INTERNAL METHODS
       You should not need to call any of the following methods directly.

   element_class
         $classname = $h-&gt;element_class;

       This method returns the class which will be used for new elements.  It
       defaults to HTML::Element, but can be overridden by subclassing or
       esoteric means best left to those will will read the source and then not
       complain when those esoteric means change.  (Just subclass.)

       Accept a &quot;here&apos;s a comment&quot; signal from HTML::Parser.

   declaration
       Accept a &quot;here&apos;s a markup declaration&quot; signal from HTML::Parser.

SUBROUTINES
   DEBUG
       Are we in Debug mode?  This is a constant subroutine, to allow compile-
       time optimizations.  To control debug mode, set $HTML::TreeBuilder::DEBUG
       before loading HTML::TreeBuilder.

HTML AND ITS DISCONTENTS
       HTML is rather harder to parse than people who write it generally
       suspect.

       Here&apos;s the problem: HTML is a kind of SGML that permits &quot;minimization&quot;
       and &quot;implication&quot;.  In short, this means that you don&apos;t have to close
       every tag you open (because the opening of a subsequent tag may
       implicitly close it), and if you use a tag that can&apos;t occur in the
       context you seem to using it in, under certain conditions the parser will
       be able to realize you mean to leave the current context and enter the
       new one, that being the only one that your code could correctly be
       interpreted in.

       Now, this would all work flawlessly and unproblematically if: 1) all the
       rules that both prescribe and describe HTML were (and had been) clearly
       set out, and 2) everyone was aware of these rules and wrote their code in
       compliance to them.

       However, it didn&apos;t happen that way, and so most HTML pages are difficult
       if not impossible to correctly parse with nearly any set of
       straightforward SGML rules.  That&apos;s why the internals of
       HTML::TreeBuilder consist of lots and lots of special cases -- instead of
       being just a generic SGML parser with HTML DTD rules plugged in.

TRANSLATIONS?
       The techniques that HTML::TreeBuilder uses to perform what I consider
       very robust parses on everyday code are not things that can work only in
       Perl.  To date, the algorithms at the center of HTML::TreeBuilder have
       been implemented only in Perl, as far as I know; and I don&apos;t foresee
       getting around to implementing them in any other language any time soon.

       If, however, anyone is looking for a semester project for an applied
       programming class (or if they merely enjoy extra-curricular masochism),
       they might do well to see about choosing as a topic the
       implementation/adaptation of these routines to any other interesting
       programming language that you feel currently suffers from a lack of
       robust HTML-parsing.  I welcome correspondence on this subject, and point
       out that one can learn a great deal about languages by trying to
       translate between them, and then comparing the result.

       The HTML::TreeBuilder source may seem long and complex, but it is rather
       well commented, and symbol names are generally self-explanatory.  (You
       are encouraged to read the Mozilla HTML parser source for comparison.)
       Some of the complexity comes from little-used features, and some of it
       comes from having the HTML tokenizer (HTML::Parser) being a separate
       module, requiring somewhat of a different interface than you&apos;d find in a
       combined tokenizer and tree-builder.  But most of the length of the
       source comes from the fact that it&apos;s essentially a long list of special
       cases, with lots and lots of sanity-checking, and sanity-recovery --
       because, as Roseanne Rosannadanna once said, &quot;it&apos;s always something&quot;.

       Users looking to compare several HTML parsers should look at the source
       for Raggett&apos;s Tidy (&quot;&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/&gt;&quot;), Mozilla
       (&quot;&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/&gt;&quot;), and possibly root around the browsers
       section of Yahoo to find the various open-source ones
       (&quot;&lt;http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Browsers/&gt;&quot;).

BUGS
       * Framesets seem to work correctly now.  Email me if you get a strange
       parse from a document with framesets.

       * Really bad HTML code will, often as not, make for a somewhat
       objectionable parse tree.  Regrettable, but unavoidably true.

       * If you&apos;re running with &quot;implicit_tags&quot; off (God help you!), consider
       that &quot;$tree-&gt;content_list&quot; probably contains the tree or grove from the
       parse, and not $tree itself (which will, oddly enough, be an implicit
       &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; element).  This seems counter-intuitive and problematic; but
       seeing as how almost no HTML ever parses correctly with &quot;implicit_tags&quot;
       off, this interface oddity seems the least of your problems.

BUG REPORTS
       When a document parses in a way different from how you think it should, I
       ask that you report this to me as a bug.  The first thing you should do
       is copy the document, trim out as much of it as you can while still
       producing the bug in question, and then email me that mini-document and
       the code you&apos;re using to parse it, to the HTML::Tree bug queue at
       &quot;&lt;bug-html-tree at rt.cpan.org&gt;&quot;.

       Include a note as to how it parses (presumably including its
       &quot;$tree-&gt;dump&quot; output), and then a careful and clear explanation of where
       you think the parser is going astray, and how you would prefer that it
       work instead.
