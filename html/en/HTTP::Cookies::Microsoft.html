NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft - access to Microsoft cookies files

SYNOPSIS
        use LWP;
        use HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft;
        use Win32::TieRegistry(Delimiter =&gt; &quot;/&quot;);
        my $cookies_dir = $Registry-&gt;
             {&quot;CUser/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/Shell Folders/Cookies&quot;};

        $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft-&gt;new(
                          file     =&gt; &quot;$cookies_dir\\index.dat&quot;,
                          &apos;delayload&apos; =&gt; 1,
                      );
        my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
        $browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of &quot;HTTP::Cookies&quot; which loads Microsoft Internet
       Explorer 5.x and 6.x for Windows (MSIE) cookie files.

       See the documentation for HTTP::Cookies.

METHODS
       The following methods are provided:

       $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft-&gt;new;
           The constructor takes hash style parameters. In addition to the
           regular HTTP::Cookies parameters, HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft recognizes
           the following:

             delayload:       delay loading of cookie data until a request
                              is actually made. This results in faster
                              runtime unless you use most of the cookies
                              since only the domain&apos;s cookie data
                              is loaded on demand.

CAVEATS
       Please note that the code DOESN&apos;T support saving to the MSIE cookie file
       format.
