NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::Netscape - access to Netscape cookies files

SYNOPSIS
        use LWP;
        use HTTP::Cookies::Netscape;
        $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Netscape-&gt;new(
          file =&gt; &quot;c:/program files/netscape/users/ZombieCharity/cookies.txt&quot;,
        );
        my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
        $browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of &quot;HTTP::Cookies&quot; that reads (and optionally writes)
       Netscape/Mozilla cookie files.

       See the documentation for HTTP::Cookies.

CAVEATS
       Please note that the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format can&apos;t store all
       the information available in the Set-Cookie2 headers, so you will
       probably lose some information if you save in this format.

       At time of writing, this module seems to work fine with Mozilla
       Phoenix/Firebird.
