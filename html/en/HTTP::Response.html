NAME
       HTTP::Response - HTTP style response message

SYNOPSIS
       Response objects are returned by the request() method of the
       &quot;LWP::UserAgent&quot;:

           # ...
           $response = $ua-&gt;request($request)
           if ($response-&gt;is_success) {
               print $response-&gt;decoded_content;
           }
           else {
               print STDERR $response-&gt;status_line, &quot;\n&quot;;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;HTTP::Response&quot; class encapsulates HTTP style responses.  A response
       consists of a response line, some headers, and a content body. Note that
       the LWP library uses HTTP style responses even for non-HTTP protocol
       schemes.  Instances of this class are usually created and returned by the
       request() method of an &quot;LWP::UserAgent&quot; object.

       &quot;HTTP::Response&quot; is a subclass of &quot;HTTP::Message&quot; and therefore inherits
       its methods.  The following additional methods are available:

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg, $header )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg, $header, $content )
           Constructs a new &quot;HTTP::Response&quot; object describing a response with
           response code $code and optional message $msg.  The optional $header
           argument should be a reference to an &quot;HTTP::Headers&quot; object or a
           plain array reference of key/value pairs.  The optional $content
           argument should be a string of bytes.  The meaning these arguments
           are described below.

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;parse( $str )
           This constructs a new response object by parsing the given string.

       $r-&gt;code
       $r-&gt;code( $code )
           This is used to get/set the code attribute.  The code is a 3 digit
           number that encode the overall outcome of an HTTP response.  The
           &quot;HTTP::Status&quot; module provide constants that provide mnemonic names
           for the code attribute.

       $r-&gt;message
       $r-&gt;message( $message )
           This is used to get/set the message attribute.  The message is a
           short human readable single line string that explains the response
           code.

       $r-&gt;header( $field )
       $r-&gt;header( $field =&gt; $value )
           This is used to get/set header values and it is inherited from
           &quot;HTTP::Headers&quot; via &quot;HTTP::Message&quot;.  See HTTP::Headers for details
           and other similar methods that can be used to access the headers.

       $r-&gt;content
       $r-&gt;content( $bytes )
           This is used to get/set the raw content and it is inherited from the
           &quot;HTTP::Message&quot; base class.  See HTTP::Message for details and other
           methods that can be used to access the content.

       $r-&gt;decoded_content( %options )
           This will return the content after any &quot;Content-Encoding&quot; and
           charsets have been decoded.  See HTTP::Message for details.

       $r-&gt;request
       $r-&gt;request( $request )
           This is used to get/set the request attribute.  The request attribute
           is a reference to the the request that caused this response.  It does
           not have to be the same request passed to the $ua-&gt;request() method,
           because there might have been redirects and authorization retries in
           between.

       $r-&gt;previous
       $r-&gt;previous( $response )
           This is used to get/set the previous attribute.  The previous
           attribute is used to link together chains of responses.  You get
           chains of responses if the first response is redirect or
           unauthorized.  The value is &quot;undef&quot; if this is the first response in
           a chain.

           Note that the method $r-&gt;redirects is provided as a more convenient
           way to access the response chain.

       $r-&gt;status_line
           Returns the string &quot;&lt;code&gt; &lt;message&gt;&quot;.  If the message attribute is
           not set then the official name of &lt;code&gt; (see HTTP::Status) is
           substituted.

       $r-&gt;base
           Returns the base URI for this response.  The return value will be a
           reference to a URI object.

           The base URI is obtained from one the following sources (in priority
           order):

           1.  Embedded in the document content, for instance &lt;BASE HREF=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
               in HTML documents.

           2.  A &quot;Content-Base:&quot; or a &quot;Content-Location:&quot; header in the
               response.

               For backwards compatibility with older HTTP implementations we
               will also look for the &quot;Base:&quot; header.

           3.  The URI used to request this response. This might not be the
               original URI that was passed to $ua-&gt;request() method, because we
               might have received some redirect responses first.

           If none of these sources provide an absolute URI, undef is returned.

           When the LWP protocol modules produce the HTTP::Response object, then
           any base URI embedded in the document (step 1) will already have
           initialized the &quot;Content-Base:&quot; header. This means that this method
           only performs the last 2 steps (the content is not always available
           either).

       $r-&gt;filename
           Returns a filename for this response.  Note that doing sanity checks
           on the returned filename (eg. removing characters that cannot be used
           on the target filesystem where the filename would be used, and
           laundering it for security purposes) are the caller&apos;s responsibility;
           the only related thing done by this method is that it makes a simple
           attempt to return a plain filename with no preceding path segments.

           The filename is obtained from one the following sources (in priority
           order):

           1.  A &quot;Content-Disposition:&quot; header in the response.  Proper decoding
               of RFC 2047 encoded filenames requires the &quot;MIME::QuotedPrint&quot;
               (for &quot;Q&quot; encoding), &quot;MIME::Base64&quot; (for &quot;B&quot; encoding), and
               &quot;Encode&quot; modules.

           2.  A &quot;Content-Location:&quot; header in the response.

           3.  The URI used to request this response. This might not be the
               original URI that was passed to $ua-&gt;request() method, because we
               might have received some redirect responses first.

           If a filename cannot be derived from any of these sources, undef is
           returned.

       $r-&gt;as_string
       $r-&gt;as_string( $eol )
           Returns a textual representation of the response.

       $r-&gt;is_info
       $r-&gt;is_success
       $r-&gt;is_redirect
       $r-&gt;is_error
           These methods indicate if the response was informational, successful,
           a redirection, or an error.  See HTTP::Status for the meaning of
           these.

       $r-&gt;error_as_HTML
           Returns a string containing a complete HTML document indicating what
           error occurred.  This method should only be called when $r-&gt;is_error
           is TRUE.

       $r-&gt;redirects
           Returns the list of redirect responses that lead up to this response
           by following the $r-&gt;previous chain.  The list order is oldest first.

           In scalar context return the number of redirect responses leading up
           to this one.

       $r-&gt;current_age
           Calculates the &quot;current age&quot; of the response as specified by RFC 2616
           section 13.2.3.  The age of a response is the time since it was sent
           by the origin server.  The returned value is a number representing
           the age in seconds.

       $r-&gt;freshness_lifetime( %opt )
           Calculates the &quot;freshness lifetime&quot; of the response as specified by
           RFC 2616 section 13.2.4.  The &quot;freshness lifetime&quot; is the length of
           time between the generation of a response and its expiration time.
           The returned value is the number of seconds until expiry.

           If the response does not contain an &quot;Expires&quot; or a &quot;Cache-Control&quot;
           header, then this function will apply some simple heuristic based on
           the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header to determine a suitable lifetime.  The
           following options might be passed to control the heuristics:

           heuristic_expiry =&gt; $bool
               If passed as a FALSE value, don&apos;t apply heuristics and just
               return &quot;undef&quot; when &quot;Expires&quot; or &quot;Cache-Control&quot; is lacking.

           h_lastmod_fraction =&gt; $num
               This number represent the fraction of the difference since the
               &quot;Last-Modified&quot; timestamp to make the expiry time.  The default
               is 0.10, the suggested typical setting of 10% in RFC 2616.

           h_min =&gt; $sec
               This is the lower limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.  The
               default is 60 (1 minute).

           h_max =&gt; $sec
               This is the upper limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.  The
               default is 86400 (24 hours).

           h_default =&gt; $sec
               This is the expiry age to use when nothing else applies.  The
               default is 3600 (1 hour) or &quot;h_min&quot; if greater.

       $r-&gt;is_fresh( %opt )
           Returns TRUE if the response is fresh, based on the values of
           freshness_lifetime() and current_age().  If the response is no longer
           fresh, then it has to be re-fetched or re-validated by the origin
           server.

           Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the
           description of freshness_lifetime().

       $r-&gt;fresh_until( %opt )
           Returns the time (seconds since epoch) when this entity is no longer
           fresh.

           Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the
           description of freshness_lifetime().
