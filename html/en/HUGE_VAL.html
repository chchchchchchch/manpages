INFINITY(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                INFINITY(3)



NAME
       INFINITY, NAN, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL - floating-point constants

SYNOPSIS
       #define _ISOC99_SOURCE      /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       INFINITY

       NAN

       HUGE_VAL
       HUGE_VALF
       HUGE_VALL

DESCRIPTION
       The  macro  INFINITY  expands  to  a float constant representing positive
       infinity.

       The macro NAN expands to a float constant representing a quiet NaN  (when
       supported).   A  quiet  NaN is a NaN (&quot;not-a-number&quot;) that does not raise
       exceptions when it is used in arithmetic.  The opposite  is  a  signaling
       NaN.  See IEC 60559:1989.

       The  macros  HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL expand to constants of types
       double, float and long double, respectively, that represent a large posi&#8208;
       tive value, possibly plus infinity.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

AVAILABILITY
       On  a glibc system, the macro HUGE_VAL is always available.  Availability
       of the NAN macro can be tested using #ifdef NAN, and similarly for INFIN&#8208;
       ITY,   HUGE_VALF,  HUGE_VALL.   They  will  be  defined  by  &lt;math.h&gt;  if
       _ISOC99_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE is defined, or __STDC_VERSION__ is  defined
       and has a value not less than 199901L.
