Detailed Description
       These functions allow to read and write files in a platform-independent
       way.

Function Documentation
   __extern caca_file_t* caca_file_open (char const *path, const char *mode)
       Create a caca file handle for a file. If the file is zipped, it is
       decompressed on the fly.
       If an error occurs, NULL is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; ENOSTS Function not implemented.

       &#183; EINVAL File not found or permission denied.

       Parameters:
           path The file path
           mode The file open mode

       Returns:
           A file handle to path.

   __extern int caca_file_close (caca_file_t *fp) Close and destroy the
       resources associated with a caca file handle.
       This function is a wrapper for fclose() or, if available, gzclose().

       Parameters:
           fp The file handle

       Returns:
           The return value of fclose() or gzclose().

   __extern uint64_t caca_file_tell (caca_file_t *fp) Return the file handle
       position, in bytes.
       Parameters:
           fp The file handle

       Returns:
           The current offset in the file handle.
&#12;   __extern size_t caca_file_read (caca_file_t *fp, void *ptr, size_tsize) Read
       data from a file handle and copy them into the given buffer.
       Parameters:
           fp The file handle
           ptr The destination buffer
           size The number of bytes to read

       Returns:
           The number of bytes read

       Referenced by caca_import_canvas_from_file().

   __extern size_t caca_file_write (caca_file_t *fp, const void *ptr,
       size_tsize) Write the contents of the given buffer to the file handle.
       Parameters:
           fp The file handle
           ptr The source buffer
           size The number of bytes to write

       Returns:
           The number of bytes written

   __extern char* caca_file_gets (caca_file_t *fp, char *s, intsize) Read one
       line of data from a file handle, up to one less than the given number of
       bytes. A trailing zero is appended to the data.
       Parameters:
           fp The file handle
           s The destination buffer
           size The maximum number of bytes to read

       Returns:
           The number of bytes read, including the trailing zero

   __extern int caca_file_eof (caca_file_t *fp) Return the end-of-file status of
       the file handle.
       This function is a wrapper for feof() or, if available, gzeof().

       Parameters:
           fp The file handle

       Returns:
           1 if EOF was reached, 0 otherwise
