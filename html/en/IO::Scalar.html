NAME
       IO::Scalar - IO:: interface for reading/writing a scalar

SYNOPSIS
       Perform I/O on strings, using the basic OO interface...

           use 5.005;
           use IO::Scalar;
           $data = &quot;My message:\n&quot;;

           ### Open a handle on a string, and append to it:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           $SH-&gt;print(&quot;Hello&quot;);
           $SH-&gt;print(&quot;, world!\nBye now!\n&quot;);
           print &quot;The string is now: &quot;, $data, &quot;\n&quot;;

           ### Open a handle on a string, read it line-by-line, then close it:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           while (defined($_ = $SH-&gt;getline)) {
               print &quot;Got line: $_&quot;;
           }
           $SH-&gt;close;

           ### Open a handle on a string, and slurp in all the lines:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           print &quot;All lines:\n&quot;, $SH-&gt;getlines;

           ### Get the current position (either of two ways):
           $pos = $SH-&gt;getpos;
           $offset = $SH-&gt;tell;

           ### Set the current position (either of two ways):
           $SH-&gt;setpos($pos);
           $SH-&gt;seek($offset, 0);

           ### Open an anonymous temporary scalar:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar;
           $SH-&gt;print(&quot;Hi there!&quot;);
           print &quot;I printed: &quot;, ${$SH-&gt;sref}, &quot;\n&quot;;      ### get at value

       Don&apos;t like OO for your I/O?  No problem.  Thanks to the magic of an
       invisible tie(), the following now works out of the box, just as it does
       with IO::Handle:

           use 5.005;
           use IO::Scalar;
           $data = &quot;My message:\n&quot;;

           ### Open a handle on a string, and append to it:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           print $SH &quot;Hello&quot;;
           print $SH &quot;, world!\nBye now!\n&quot;;
           print &quot;The string is now: &quot;, $data, &quot;\n&quot;;

           ### Open a handle on a string, read it line-by-line, then close it:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           while (&lt;$SH&gt;) {
               print &quot;Got line: $_&quot;;
           }
           close $SH;

           ### Open a handle on a string, and slurp in all the lines:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           print &quot;All lines:\n&quot;, &lt;$SH&gt;;

           ### Get the current position (WARNING: requires 5.6):
           $offset = tell $SH;

           ### Set the current position (WARNING: requires 5.6):
           seek $SH, $offset, 0;

           ### Open an anonymous temporary scalar:
           $SH = new IO::Scalar;
           print $SH &quot;Hi there!&quot;;
           print &quot;I printed: &quot;, ${$SH-&gt;sref}, &quot;\n&quot;;      ### get at value

       And for you folks with 1.x code out there: the old tie() style still
       works, though this is unnecessary and deprecated:

           use IO::Scalar;

           ### Writing to a scalar...
           my $s;
           tie *OUT, &apos;IO::Scalar&apos;, \$s;
           print OUT &quot;line 1\nline 2\n&quot;, &quot;line 3\n&quot;;
           print &quot;String is now: $s\n&quot;

           ### Reading and writing an anonymous scalar...
           tie *OUT, &apos;IO::Scalar&apos;;
           print OUT &quot;line 1\nline 2\n&quot;, &quot;line 3\n&quot;;
           tied(OUT)-&gt;seek(0,0);
           while (&lt;OUT&gt;) {
               print &quot;Got line: &quot;, $_;
           }

       Stringification works, too!

           my $SH = new IO::Scalar \$data;
           print $SH &quot;Hello, &quot;;
           print $SH &quot;world!&quot;;
           print &quot;I printed: $SH\n&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       This class is part of the IO::Stringy distribution; see IO::Stringy for
       change log and general information.

       The IO::Scalar class implements objects which behave just like IO::Handle
       (or FileHandle) objects, except that you may use them to write to (or
       read from) scalars.  These handles are automatically tiehandle&apos;d (though
       please see &quot;WARNINGS&quot; for information relevant to your Perl version).

       Basically, this:

           my $s;
           $SH = new IO::Scalar \$s;
           $SH-&gt;print(&quot;Hel&quot;, &quot;lo, &quot;);         ### OO style
           $SH-&gt;print(&quot;world!\n&quot;);            ### ditto

       Or this:

           my $s;
           $SH = tie *OUT, &apos;IO::Scalar&apos;, \$s;
           print OUT &quot;Hel&quot;, &quot;lo, &quot;;           ### non-OO style
           print OUT &quot;world!\n&quot;;              ### ditto

       Causes $s to be set to:

           &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;
&#12;PUBLIC INTERFACE
   Construction
       new [ARGS...]
           Class method.  Return a new, unattached scalar handle.  If any
           arguments are given, they&apos;re sent to open().

       open [SCALARREF]
           Instance method.  Open the scalar handle on a new scalar, pointed to
           by SCALARREF.  If no SCALARREF is given, a &quot;private&quot; scalar is
           created to hold the file data.

           Returns the self object on success, undefined on error.

       opened
           Instance method.  Is the scalar handle opened on something?

       close
           Instance method.  Disassociate the scalar handle from its underlying
           scalar.  Done automatically on destroy.

   Input and output
       flush
           Instance method.  No-op, provided for OO compatibility.

       getc
           Instance method.  Return the next character, or undef if none remain.

       getline
           Instance method.  Return the next line, or undef on end of string.
           Can safely be called in an array context.  Currently, lines are
           delimited by &quot;\n&quot;.

       getlines
           Instance method.  Get all remaining lines.  It will croak() if
           accidentally called in a scalar context.

       print ARGS...
           Instance method.  Print ARGS to the underlying scalar.

           Warning: this continues to always cause a seek to the end of the
           string, but if you perform seek()s and tell()s, it is still safer to
           explicitly seek-to-end before subsequent print()s.

       read BUF, NBYTES, [OFFSET]
           Instance method.  Read some bytes from the scalar.  Returns the
           number of bytes actually read, 0 on end-of-file, undef on error.

       write BUF, NBYTES, [OFFSET]
           Instance method.  Write some bytes to the scalar.

       sysread BUF, LEN, [OFFSET]
           Instance method.  Read some bytes from the scalar.  Returns the
           number of bytes actually read, 0 on end-of-file, undef on error.

       syswrite BUF, NBYTES, [OFFSET]
           Instance method.  Write some bytes to the scalar.

   Seeking/telling and other attributes
       autoflush
           Instance method.  No-op, provided for OO compatibility.

       binmode
           Instance method.  No-op, provided for OO compatibility.

       clearerr
           Instance method.  Clear the error and EOF flags.  A no-op.
&#12;       eof Instance method.  Are we at end of file?

       seek OFFSET, WHENCE
           Instance method.  Seek to a given position in the stream.

       sysseek OFFSET, WHENCE
           Instance method. Identical to &quot;seek OFFSET, WHENCE&quot;, q.v.

       tell
           Instance method.  Return the current position in the stream, as a
           numeric offset.

       setpos POS
           Instance method.  Set the current position, using the opaque value
           returned by &quot;getpos()&quot;.

       getpos
           Instance method.  Return the current position in the string, as an
           opaque object.

       sref
           Instance method.  Return a reference to the underlying scalar.

WARNINGS
       Perl&apos;s TIEHANDLE spec was incomplete prior to 5.005_57; it was missing
       support for &quot;seek()&quot;, &quot;tell()&quot;, and &quot;eof()&quot;.  Attempting to use these
       functions with an IO::Scalar will not work prior to 5.005_57. IO::Scalar
       will not have the relevant methods invoked; and even worse, this kind of
       bug can lie dormant for a while.  If you turn warnings on (via $^W or
       &quot;perl -w&quot;), and you see something like this...

           attempt to seek on unopened filehandle

       ...then you are probably trying to use one of these functions on an
       IO::Scalar with an old Perl.  The remedy is to simply use the OO version;
       e.g.:

           $SH-&gt;seek(0,0);    ### GOOD: will work on any 5.005
           seek($SH,0,0);     ### WARNING: will only work on 5.005_57 and beyond

       The full set of contributors always includes the folks mentioned in
       &quot;CHANGE LOG&quot; in IO::Stringy.  But just the same, special thanks to the
       following individuals for their invaluable contributions (if I&apos;ve
       forgotten or misspelled your name, please email me!):

       Andy Glew, for contributing &quot;getc()&quot;.

       Brandon Browning, for suggesting &quot;opened()&quot;.

       David Richter, for finding and fixing the bug in &quot;PRINTF()&quot;.

       Eric L. Brine, for his offset-using read() and write() implementations.

       Richard Jones, for his patches to massively improve the performance of
       &quot;getline()&quot; and add &quot;sysread&quot; and &quot;syswrite&quot;.

       B. K. Oxley (binkley), for stringification and inheritance improvements,
       and sundry good ideas.

       Doug Wilson, for the IO::Handle inheritance and automatic tie-ing.

SEE ALSO
       IO::String, which is quite similar but which was designed more-recently
       and with an IO::Handle-like interface in mind, so you could mix OO- and
       native-filehandle usage without using tied().

       Note: as of version 2.x, these classes all work like their IO::Handle
       counterparts, so we have comparable functionality to IO::String.
