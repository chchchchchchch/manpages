NAME
       IO::String - Emulate file interface for in-core strings

SYNOPSIS
        use IO::String;
        $io = IO::String-&gt;new;
        $io = IO::String-&gt;new($var);
        tie *IO, &apos;IO::String&apos;;

        # read data
        &lt;$io&gt;;
        $io-&gt;getline;
        read($io, $buf, 100);

        # write data
        print $io &quot;string\n&quot;;
        $io-&gt;print(@data);
        syswrite($io, $buf, 100);

        select $io;
        printf &quot;Some text %s\n&quot;, $str;

        # seek
        $pos = $io-&gt;getpos;
        $io-&gt;setpos(0);        # rewind
        $io-&gt;seek(-30, -1);
        seek($io, 0, 0);

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;IO::String&quot; module provides the &quot;IO::File&quot; interface for in-core
       strings.  An &quot;IO::String&quot; object can be attached to a string, and makes
       it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or writing
       data, as well as for seeking to various locations of the string.  This is
       useful when you want to use a library module that only provides an inter&#8208;
       face to file handles on data that you have in a string variable.

       Note that perl-5.8 and better has built-in support for &quot;in memory&quot; files,
       which are set up by passing a reference instead of a filename to the
       open() call. The reason for using this module is that it makes the code
       backwards compatible with older versions of Perl.

       The &quot;IO::String&quot; module provides an interface compatible with &quot;IO::File&quot;
       as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods are not available:
       new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write, format_page_number, for&#8208;
       mat_lines_per_page, format_lines_left, format_name, format_top_name.

       The following methods are specific to the &quot;IO::String&quot; class:

       $io = IO::String-&gt;new
       $io = IO::String-&gt;new( $string )
           The constructor returns a newly-created &quot;IO::String&quot; object.  It
           takes an optional argument, which is the string to read from or write
           into.  If no $string argument is given, then an internal buffer (ini&#8208;
           tially empty) is allocated.

           The &quot;IO::String&quot; object returned is tied to itself.  This means that
           you can use most Perl I/O built-ins on it too: readline, &lt;&gt;, getc,
           print, printf, syswrite, sysread, close.

       $io-&gt;open
       $io-&gt;open( $string )
           Attaches an existing IO::String object to some other $string, or
           allocates a new internal buffer (if no argument is given).  The posi&#8208;
           tion is reset to 0.

       $io-&gt;string_ref
           Returns a reference to the string that is attached to the
           &quot;IO::String&quot; object.  Most useful when you let the &quot;IO::String&quot; cre&#8208;
           ate an internal buffer to write into.

       $io-&gt;pad
       $io-&gt;pad( $char )
           Specifies the padding to use if the string is extended by either the
           seek() or truncate() methods.  It is a single character and defaults
           to &quot;\0&quot;.

       $io-&gt;pos
       $io-&gt;pos( $newpos )
           Yet another interface for reading and setting the current read/write
           position within the string (the normal getpos/setpos/tell/seek meth&#8208;
           ods are also available).  The pos() method always returns the old
           position, and if you pass it an argument it sets the new position.

           There is (deliberately) a difference between the setpos() and seek()
           methods in that seek() extends the string (with the specified pad&#8208;
           ding) if you go to a location past the end, whereas setpos() just
           snaps back to the end.  If truncate() is used to extend the string,
           then it works as seek().

BUGS
       In Perl versions &lt; 5.6, the TIEHANDLE interface was incomplete.  If you
       use such a Perl, then seek(), tell(), eof(), fileno(), binmode() will not
       do anything on an &quot;IO::String&quot; handle.  See perltie for details.
