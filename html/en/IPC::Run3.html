NAME
       IPC::Run3 - run a subprocess with input/ouput redirection

VERSION
       version 0.045

SYNOPSIS
           use IPC::Run3;    # Exports run3() by default

           run3 \@cmd, \$in, \$out, \$err;

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to run a subprocess and redirect stdin, stdout,
       and/or stderr to files and perl data structures.  It aims to satisfy 99%
       of the need for using &quot;system&quot;, &quot;qx&quot;, and &quot;open3&quot; with a simple,
       extremely Perlish API.

       Speed, simplicity, and portability are paramount.  (That&apos;s speed of Perl
       code; which is often much slower than the kind of buffered I/O that this
       module uses to spool input to and output from the child command.)

   &quot;run3($cmd, $stdin, $stdout, $stderr, \%options)&quot;
       All parameters after $cmd are optional.

       The parameters $stdin, $stdout and $stderr indicate how the child&apos;s
       corresponding filehandle (&quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot;, resp.) will be
       redirected.  Because the redirects come last, this allows &quot;STDOUT&quot; and
       &quot;STDERR&quot; to default to the parent&apos;s by just not specifying them -- a
       common use case.

       &quot;run3&quot; throws an exception if the wrapped &quot;system&quot; call returned -1 or
       anything went wrong with &quot;run3&quot;&apos;s processing of filehandles.  Otherwise
       it returns true.  It leaves $? intact for inspection of exit and wait
       status.

       Note that a true return value from &quot;run3&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that the command
       had a successful exit code. Hence you should always check $?.

       See &quot;%options&quot; for an option to handle the case of &quot;system&quot; returning -1
       yourself.

       $cmd

       Usually $cmd will be an ARRAY reference and the child is invoked via

         system @$cmd;

       But $cmd may also be a string in which case the child is invoked via

         system $cmd;

       (cf. &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc for the difference and the pitfalls of using
       the latter form).

       $stdin, $stdout, $stderr

       The parameters $stdin, $stdout and $stderr can take one of the following
       forms:

       &quot;undef&quot; (or not specified at all)
           The child inherits the corresponding filehandle from the parent.
&#12;             run3 \@cmd, $stdin;                   # child writes to same STDOUT and STDERR as parent
             run3 \@cmd, undef, $stdout, $stderr;  # child reads from same STDIN as parent

       &quot;\undef&quot;
           The child&apos;s filehandle is redirected from or to the local equivalent
           of &quot;/dev/null&quot; (as returned by &quot;File::Spec-&gt;devnull()&quot;).

             run3 \@cmd, \undef, $stdout, $stderr; # child reads from /dev/null

       a simple scalar
           The parameter is taken to be the name of a file to read from or write
           to. In the latter case, the file will be opened via

             open FH, &quot;&gt;&quot;, ...

           i.e. it is created if it doesn&apos;t exist and truncated otherwise.  Note
           that the file is opened by the parent which will croak in case of
           failure.

             run3 \@cmd, \undef, &quot;out.txt&quot;;        # child writes to file &quot;out.txt&quot;

       a filehandle (either a reference to a GLOB or an &quot;IO::Handle&quot;)
           The filehandle is inherited by the child.

             open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;out.txt&quot;;
             print $fh &quot;prologue\n&quot;;
             ...
             run3 \@cmd, \undef, $fh;              # child writes to $fh
             ...
             print $fh &quot;epilogue\n&quot;;
             close $fh;

       a SCALAR reference
           The referenced scalar is treated as a string to be read from or
           written to. In the latter case, the previous content of the string is
           overwritten.

             my $out;
             run3 \@cmd, \undef, \$out;           # child writes into string
             run3 \@cmd, \&lt;&lt;EOF;                  # child reads from string (can use &quot;here&quot; notation)
             Input
             to
             child
             EOF

       an ARRAY reference
           For $stdin, the elements of @$stdin are simply spooled to the child.

           For $stdout or $stderr, the child&apos;s corresponding file descriptor is
           read line by line (as determined by the current setting of $/) into
           @$stdout or @$stderr, resp. The previous content of the array is
           overwritten.

             my @lines;
             run3 \@cmd, \undef, \@lines;         # child writes into array

       a CODE reference
           For $stdin, &amp;$stdin will be called repeatedly (with no arguments) and
           the return values are spooled to the child. &amp;$stdin must signal the
           end of input by returning &quot;undef&quot;.

           For $stdout or $stderr, the child&apos;s corresponding file descriptor is
           read line by line (as determined by the current setting of $/) and
           &amp;$stdout or &amp;$stderr, resp., is called with the contents of the line.
           Note that there&apos;s no end-of-file indication.
&#12;             my $i = 0;
             sub producer {
               return $i &lt; 10 ? &quot;line&quot;.$i++.&quot;\n&quot; : undef;
             }

             run3 \@cmd, \&amp;producer;              # child reads 10 lines

           Note that this form of redirecting the child&apos;s I/O doesn&apos;t imply any
           form of concurrency between parent and child - run3()&apos;s method of
           operation is the same no matter which form of redirection you
           specify.

       If the same value is passed for $stdout and $stderr, then the child will
       write both &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot; to the same filehandle.  In general,
       this means that

           run3 \@cmd, \undef, &quot;foo.txt&quot;, &quot;foo.txt&quot;;
           run3 \@cmd, \undef, \$both, \$both;

       will DWIM and pass a single file handle to the child for both &quot;STDOUT&quot;
       and &quot;STDERR&quot;, collecting all into file &quot;foo.txt&quot; or $both.

       &quot;\%options&quot;

       The last parameter, &quot;\%options&quot;, must be a hash reference if present.

       Currently the following keys are supported:

       &quot;binmode_stdin&quot;, &quot;binmode_stdout&quot;, &quot;binmode_stderr&quot;
           The value must a &quot;layer&quot; as described in &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.  If
           specified the corresponding parameter $stdin, $stdout or $stderr,
           resp., operates with the given layer.

           For backward compatibility, a true value that doesn&apos;t start with &quot;:&quot;
           (e.g. a number) is interpreted as &quot;:raw&quot;. If the value is false or
           not specified, the default is &quot;:crlf&quot; on Windows and &quot;:raw&quot;
           otherwise.

           Don&apos;t expect that values other than the built-in layers &quot;:raw&quot;,
           &quot;:crlf&quot;, and (on newer Perls) &quot;:bytes&quot;, &quot;:utf8&quot;, &quot;:encoding(...)&quot;
           will work.

       &quot;append_stdout&quot;, &quot;append_stderr&quot;
           If their value is true then the corresponding parameter $stdout or
           $stderr, resp., will append the child&apos;s output to the existing
           &quot;contents&quot; of the redirector. This only makes sense if the redirector
           is a simple scalar (the corresponding file is opened in append mode),
           a SCALAR reference (the output is appended to the previous contents
           of the string) or an ARRAY reference (the output is &quot;push&quot;ed onto the
           previous contents of the array).

       &quot;return_if_system_error&quot;
           If this is true &quot;run3&quot; does not throw an exception if &quot;system&quot;
           returns -1 (cf. &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc for possible failure
           scenarios.), but returns true instead.  In this case $? has the value
           -1 and $! contains the errno of the failing &quot;system&quot; call.

HOW IT WORKS
       (1) For each redirector $stdin, $stdout, and $stderr, &quot;run3()&quot; furnishes
           a filehandle:

           &#183;   if the redirector already specifies a filehandle it just uses
               that

           &#183;   if the redirector specifies a filename, &quot;run3()&quot; opens the file
               in the appropriate mode

           &#183;   in all other cases, &quot;run3()&quot; opens a temporary file (using
               tempfile)

       (2) If &quot;run3()&quot; opened a temporary file for $stdin in step (1), it writes
           the data using the specified method (either from a string, an array
           or returnd by a function) to the temporary file and rewinds it.

       (3) &quot;run3()&quot; saves the parent&apos;s &quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot; by
           duplicating them to new filehandles. It duplicates the filehandles
           from step (1) to &quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot;, resp.

       (4) &quot;run3()&quot; runs the child by invoking system with $cmd as specified
           above.

       (5) &quot;run3()&quot; restores the parent&apos;s &quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot; saved
           in step (3).

       (6) If &quot;run3()&quot; opened a temporary file for $stdout or $stderr in step
           (1), it rewinds it and reads back its contents using the specified
           method (either to a string, an array or by calling a function).

       (7) &quot;run3()&quot; closes all filehandles that it opened explicitly in step
           (1).

       Note that when using temporary files, &quot;run3()&quot; tries to amortize the
       overhead by reusing them (i.e. it keeps them open and rewinds and
       truncates them before the next operation).

LIMITATIONS
       Often uses intermediate files (determined by File::Temp, and thus by the
       File::Spec defaults and the TMPDIR env. variable) for speed, portability
       and simplicity.

       Use extrem caution when using &quot;run3&quot; in a threaded environment if
       concurrent calls of &quot;run3&quot; are possible. Most likely, I/O from different
       invocations will get mixed up. The reason is that in most thread
       implementations all threads in a process share the same
       STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.  Known failures are Perl ithreads on Linux and
       Win32. Note that &quot;fork&quot; on Win32 is emulated via Win32 threads and hence
       I/O mix up is possible between forked children here (&quot;run3&quot; is &quot;fork
       safe&quot; on Unix, though).

DEBUGGING
       To enable debugging use the IPCRUN3DEBUG environment variable to a non-
       zero integer value:

         $ IPCRUN3DEBUG=1 myapp

PROFILING
       To enable profiling, set IPCRUN3PROFILE to a number to enable emitting
       profile information to STDERR (1 to get timestamps, 2 to get a summary
       report at the END of the program, 3 to get mini reports after each run)
       or to a filename to emit raw data to a file for later analysis.

COMPARISON
       Here&apos;s how it stacks up to existing APIs:

   compared to &quot;system()&quot;, &quot;qx&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;open &quot;...|&quot;&quot;, &quot;open &quot;|...&quot;&quot;
       &#183;   better: redirects more than one file descriptor

       &#183;   better: returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure

       &#183;   better: throws an error if problems occur in the parent process (or
           the pre-exec child)
&#12;       &#183;   better: allows a very perlish interface to Perl data structures and
           subroutines

       &#183;   better: allows 1 word invocations to avoid the shell easily:

            run3 [&quot;foo&quot;];  # does not invoke shell

       &#183;   worse: does not return the exit code, leaves it in $?

   compared to &quot;open2()&quot;, &quot;open3()&quot;
       &#183;   better: no lengthy, error prone polling/select loop needed

       &#183;   better: hides OS dependencies

       &#183;   better: allows SCALAR, ARRAY, and CODE references to source and sink
           I/O

       &#183;   better: I/O parameter order is like &quot;open3()&quot;  (not like &quot;open2()&quot;).

       &#183;   worse: does not allow interaction with the subprocess

   compared to IPC::Run::run()
       &#183;   better: smaller, lower overhead, simpler, more portable

       &#183;   better: no select() loop portability issues

       &#183;   better: does not fall prey to Perl closure leaks

       &#183;   worse: does not allow interaction with the subprocess (which
           IPC::Run::run() allows by redirecting subroutines)

       &#183;   worse: lacks many features of &quot;IPC::Run::run()&quot; (filters, pipes,
           redirects, pty support)
