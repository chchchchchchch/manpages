NAME
       IPC::Run::Timer -- Timer channels for IPC::Run.

SYNOPSIS
          use IPC::Run qw( run  timer timeout );
          ## or IPC::Run::Timer ( timer timeout );
          ## or IPC::Run::Timer ( :all );

          ## A non-fatal timer:
          $t = timer( 5 ); # or...
          $t = IO::Run::Timer-&gt;new( 5 );
          run $t, ...;

          ## A timeout (which is a timer that dies on expiry):
          $t = timeout( 5 ); # or...
          $t = IO::Run::Timer-&gt;new( 5, exception =&gt; &quot;harness timed out&quot; );

DESCRIPTION
       This class and module allows timers and timeouts to be created for use by
       IPC::Run.  A timer simply expires when it&apos;s time is up.  A timeout is a
       timer that throws an exception when it expires.

       Timeouts are usually a bit simpler to use  than timers: they throw an
       exception on expiration so you don&apos;t need to check them:

          ## Give @cmd 10 seconds to get started, then 5 seconds to respond
          my $t = timeout( 10 );
          $h = start(
             \@cmd, \$in, \$out,
             $t,
          );
          pump $h until $out =~ /prompt/;

          $in = &quot;some stimulus&quot;;
          $out = &apos;&apos;;
          $t-&gt;time( 5 )
          pump $h until $out =~ /expected response/;

       You do need to check timers:

          ## Give @cmd 10 seconds to get started, then 5 seconds to respond
          my $t = timer( 10 );
          $h = start(
             \@cmd, \$in, \$out,
             $t,
          );
          pump $h until $t-&gt;is_expired || $out =~ /prompt/;

          $in = &quot;some stimulus&quot;;
          $out = &apos;&apos;;
          $t-&gt;time( 5 )
          pump $h until $out =~ /expected response/ || $t-&gt;is_expired;

       Timers and timeouts that are reset get started by start() and pump().
       Timers change state only in pump().  Since run() and finish() both call
       pump(), they act like pump() with repect to timers.

       Timers and timeouts have three states: reset, running, and expired.
       Setting the timeout value resets the timer, as does calling the reset()
       method.  The start() method starts (or restarts) a timer with the most
       recently set time value, no matter what state it&apos;s in.
&#12;   Time values
       All time values are in seconds.  Times may be specified as integer or
       floating point seconds, optionally preceded by puncuation-separated days,
       hours, and minutes.\

       Examples:

          1           1 second
          1.1         1.1 seconds
          60          60 seconds
          1:0         1 minute
          1:1         1 minute, 1 second
          1:90        2 minutes, 30 seconds
          1:2:3:4.5   1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, 4.5 seconds

       Absolute date/time strings are *not* accepted: year, month and day-of-
       month parsing is not available (patches welcome :-).

   Interval fudging
       When calculating an end time from a start time and an interval,
       IPC::Run::Timer instances add a little fudge factor.  This is to ensure
       that no time will expire before the interval is up.

       First a little background.  Time is sampled in discrete increments.
       We&apos;ll call the exact moment that the reported time increments from one
       interval to the next a tick, and the interval between ticks as the time
       period.  Here&apos;s a diagram of three ticks and the periods between them:

           -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2-...
           ^                   ^                   ^
           |&lt;--- period 0 ----&gt;|&lt;--- period 1 ----&gt;|
           |                   |                   |
         tick 0              tick 1              tick 2

       To see why the fudge factor is necessary, consider what would happen when
       a timer with an interval of 1 second is started right at the end of
       period 0:

           -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2-...
           ^                ^  ^                   ^
           |                |  |                   |
           |                |  |                   |
         tick 0             |tick 1              tick 2
                            |
                        start $t

       Assuming that check() is called many times per period, then the timer is
       likely to expire just after tick 1, since the time reported will have
       lept from the value &apos;0&apos; to the value &apos;1&apos;:

           -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2-...
           ^                ^  ^   ^               ^
           |                |  |   |               |
           |                |  |   |               |
         tick 0             |tick 1|             tick 2
                            |      |
                        start $t   |
                                   |
                               check $t

       Adding a fudge of &apos;1&apos; in this example means that the timer is guaranteed
       not to expire before tick 2.

       The fudge is not added to an interval of &apos;0&apos;.

       This means that intervals guarantee a minimum interval.  Given that the
       process running perl may be suspended for some period of time, or that it
       gets busy doing something time-consuming, there are no other guarantees
       on how long it will take a timer to expire.

SUBCLASSING
       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Due to the awkwardness introduced by ripping
       pseudohashes out of Perl, this class no longer uses the fields pragma.

FUNCTIONS &amp; METHODS
       timer
           A constructor function (not method) of IPC::Run::Timer instances:

              $t = timer( 5 );
              $t = timer( 5, name =&gt; &apos;stall timer&apos;, debug =&gt; 1 );

              $t = timer;
              $t-&gt;interval( 5 );

              run ..., $t;
              run ..., $t = timer( 5 );

           This convenience function is a shortened spelling of

              IPC::Run::Timer-&gt;new( ... );

           .  It returns a timer in the reset state with a given interval.

           If an exception is provided, it will be thrown when the timer notices
           that it has expired (in check()).  The name is for debugging usage,
           if you plan on having multiple timers around.  If no name is
           provided, a name like &quot;timer #1&quot; will be provided.

       timeout
           A constructor function (not method) of IPC::Run::Timer instances:

              $t = timeout( 5 );
              $t = timeout( 5, exception =&gt; &quot;kablooey&quot; );
              $t = timeout( 5, name =&gt; &quot;stall&quot;, exception =&gt; &quot;kablooey&quot; );

              $t = timeout;
              $t-&gt;interval( 5 );

              run ..., $t;
              run ..., $t = timeout( 5 );

           A This convenience function is a shortened spelling of

              IPC::Run::Timer-&gt;new( exception =&gt; &quot;IPC::Run: timeout ...&quot;, ... );

           .  It returns a timer in the reset state that will throw an exception
           when it expires.

           Takes the same parameters as &quot;timer&quot;, any exception passed in
           overrides the default exception.

       new
              IPC::Run::Timer-&gt;new()  ;
              IPC::Run::Timer-&gt;new( 5 )  ;
              IPC::Run::Timer-&gt;new( 5, exception =&gt; &apos;kablooey&apos; )  ;

           Constructor.  See &quot;timer&quot; for details.

       check
              check $t;
              check $t, $now;
              $t-&gt;check;
&#12;           Checks to see if a timer has expired since the last check.  Has no
           effect on non-running timers.  This will throw an exception if one is
           defined.

           IPC::Run::pump() calls this routine for any timers in the harness.

           You may pass in a version of now, which is useful in case you have it
           lying around or you want to check several timers with a consistent
           concept of the current time.

           Returns the time left before end_time or 0 if end_time is no longer
           in the future or the timer is not running (unless, of course, check()
           expire()s the timer and this results in an exception being thrown).

           Returns undef if the timer is not running on entry, 0 if check()
           expires it, and the time left if it&apos;s left running.

       debug
           Sets/gets the current setting of the debugging flag for this timer.
           This has no effect if debugging is not enabled for the current
           harness.

       end_time
              $et = $t-&gt;end_time;
              $et = end_time $t;

              $t-&gt;end_time( time + 10 );

           Returns the time when this timer will or did expire.  Even if this
           time is in the past, the timer may not be expired, since check() may
           not have been called yet.

           Note that this end_time is not start_time($t) + interval($t), since
           some small extra amount of time is added to make sure that the timer
           does not expire before interval() elapses.  If this were not so, then

           Changing end_time() while a timer is running will set the expiration
           time.  Changing it while it is expired has no affect, since
           reset()ing a timer always clears the end_time().

       exception
              $x = $t-&gt;exception;
              $t-&gt;exception( $x );
              $t-&gt;exception( undef );

           Sets/gets the exception to throw, if any.  &apos;undef&apos; means that no
           exception will be thrown.  Exception does not need to be a scalar:
           you may ask that references be thrown.

       interval
              $i = interval $t;
              $i = $t-&gt;interval;
              $t-&gt;interval( $i );

           Sets the interval.  Sets the end time based on the start_time() and
           the interval (and a little fudge) if the timer is running.

       expire
              expire $t;
              $t-&gt;expire;

           Sets the state to expired (undef).  Will throw an exception if one is
           defined and the timer was not already expired.  You can expire a
           reset timer without starting it.

       is_running
       is_reset
       is_expired
       name
           Sets/gets this timer&apos;s name.  The name is only used for debugging
           purposes so you can tell which freakin&apos; timer is doing what.

       reset
              reset $t;
              $t-&gt;reset;

           Resets the timer to the non-running, non-expired state and clears the
           end_time().

       start
              start $t;
              $t-&gt;start;
              start $t, $interval;
              start $t, $interval, $now;

           Starts or restarts a timer.  This always sets the start_time.  It
           sets the end_time based on the interval if the timer is running or if
           no end time has been set.

           You may pass an optional interval or current time value.

           Not passing a defined interval causes the previous interval setting
           to be re-used unless the timer is reset and an end_time has been set
           (an exception is thrown if no interval has been set).

           Not passing a defined current time value causes the current time to
           be used.

           Passing a current time value is useful if you happen to have a time
           value lying around or if you want to make sure that several timers
           are started with the same concept of start time.  You might even need
           to lie to an IPC::Run::Timer, occasionally.

       start_time
           Sets/gets the start time, in seconds since the epoch.  Setting this
           manually is a bad idea, it&apos;s better to call &quot;start&quot;() at the correct
           time.

       state
              $s = state $t;
              $t-&gt;state( $s );

           Get/Set the current state.  Only use this if you really need to
           transfer the state to/from some variable.  Use &quot;expire&quot;, &quot;start&quot;,
           &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;is_expired&quot;, &quot;is_running&quot;, &quot;is_reset&quot;.

           Note:  Setting the state to &apos;undef&apos; to expire a timer will not throw
           an exception.

TODO
       use Time::HiRes; if it&apos;s present.

       Add detection and parsing of [[[HH:]MM:]SS formatted times and intervals.
