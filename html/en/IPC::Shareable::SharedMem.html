NAME
       IPC::Shareable::SharedMem - Object oriented interface to shared memory

SYNOPSIS
        *** No public interface ***

WARNING
       This module is not intended for public consumption.  It is used
       internally by IPC::Shareable to access shared memory.  It will probably
       be replaced soon by IPC::ShareLite or IPC::SharedMem (when someone writes
       it).

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides and object-oriented framework to access shared
       memory.  Its use is intended to be limited to IPC::Shareable.  Therefore
       I have not documented an interface.
