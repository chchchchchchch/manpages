ImageMagick(1)                                                    ImageMagick(1)



NAME
       ImageMagick - is a free software suite for the creation, modification and
       display of bitmap images.

SYNOPSIS
       convert input-file [options] output-file

OVERVIEW
       ImageMagick&#174;, is a software suite to create,  edit,  and  compose  bitmap
       images.  It  can  read,  convert and write images in a variety of formats
       (about 100) including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD, TIFF,  and
       DPX. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and
       transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects,  or
       draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\[&apos;e]zier curves.

       ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribu&#8208;
       tion or as source code that you can freely use, copy,  modify,  and  dis&#8208;
       tribute.  Its  license  is  compatible with the GPL. It runs on all major
       operating systems.

       The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from  the  command
       line  or  you can use the features from programs written in your favorite
       programming language. Choose from these interfaces: MagickCore (C),  Mag&#8208;
       ickWand  (C),  ChMagick  (Ch),  Magick++  (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick
       (Lisp), PascalMagick (Pascal),  PerlMagick  (Perl),  MagickWand  for  PHP
       (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK). With
       a language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images automag&#8208;
       ically and dynamically.

       ImageMagick  includes a number of command-line utilities for manipulating
       images. Most of you are probably accustom to editing images one at a time
       with  a graphical user interface (GUI) with such programs as gimp or Pho&#8208;
       toshop. However, a GUI is not always  convenient.  Suppose  you  want  to
       process  an  image dynamically from a web script or you want to apply the
       same operations to many images or repeat a specific operation at  differ&#8208;
       ent  times to the same or different image. For these types of operations,
       the command-line image processing utility is appropriate.

       In the paragraphs below, find a short description for  each  command-line
       tool.Cl ick on the program name to get details on the program usage and a
       list of comman d-line options that alters how the  program  performs.  If
       you  are  just  getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the top of
       the list, the convert program, and
        work your way down. Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen&apos;s tutorial on
       how to
        use  ImageMagick  utilities to convert, compose, or edit images from the
       command- line.

       convert

              convert between image formats as well as resize  an  image,  blur,
              crop,  despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much
              more.

       identify

              describes the format and characteristics  of  one  or  more  image
              files.

       mogrify

              resize  an  image,  blur,  crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip,
              join, re-sample, and much more. Mogrify  overwrites  the  original
              image file, whereas, convert writes to a different image file.

       composite

              overlaps one image over another.

       montage

              create a composite image by combining several separate images. The
              images are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned with  a
              border, frame, image name, and more.

       compare

              mathematically  and  visually  annotate  the difference between an
              image and its reconstruction..


       stream

              is a lightweight tool to stream one or more  pixel  components  of
              the  image  or portion of the image to your choice of storage for&#8208;
              mats. It writes the pixel components as they  are  read  from  the
              input  image  a row at a time making stream desirable when working
              with large images or when you require raw pixel components.


       display

              displays an image or image sequence on any X server.

       animate

              animates an image sequence on any X server.

       import

              saves any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image
              file.  You  can capture a single window, the entire screen, or any
              rectangular portion of the screen.

       conjure

              interprets and executes scripts written in  the  Magick  Scripting
              Language (MSL).
