NAME
       LWP::MemberMixin - Member access mixin class

SYNOPSIS
        package Foo;
        require LWP::MemberMixin;
        @ISA=qw(LWP::MemberMixin);

DESCRIPTION
       A mixin class to get methods that provide easy access to member variables
       in the %$self.  Ideally there should be better Perl language support for
       this.

       There is only one method provided:

       _elem($elem [, $val])
           Internal method to get/set the value of member variable $elem. If
           $val is present it is used as the new value for the member variable.
           If it is not present the current value is not touched. In both cases
           the previous value of the member variable is returned.
