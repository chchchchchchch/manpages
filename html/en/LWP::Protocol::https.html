NAME
       LWP::Protocol::https - Provide https support for LWP::UserAgent

SYNOPSIS
         use LWP::UserAgent;

         $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(ssl_opts =&gt; { verify_hostname =&gt; 1 });
         $res = $ua-&gt;get(&quot;https://www.example.com&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using https schemed
       URLs with LWP.  This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
       you don&apos;t use it directly.  Once the module is installed LWP is able to
       access sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

       If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent&apos;s &quot;ssl_opts&quot;, and
       neither &quot;SSL_ca_file&quot; nor &quot;SSL_ca_path&quot; is set, then &quot;SSL_ca_file&quot; is
       implied to be the one provided by Mozilla::CA.  If the Mozilla::CA module
       isn&apos;t available SSL requests will fail.  Either install this module, set
       up an alternative &quot;SSL_ca_file&quot; or disable hostname verification.

       This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled
       in v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the
       CPAN tool-chain.  Applications that need https support can just declare
       their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know
       what underlying modules to install.
