CIL(Linker)                                                          CIL(Linker)



NAME
       Mono CIL Linker

SYNOPSIS
       monolinker  [-o  output_directory][-l  i18n_assemblies][-c  skip | copy |
       link] -x descriptor | -a assembly | -i info_file ...

DESCRIPTION
       monolinker is a CIL Linker.  The linker is a tool one  can  use  to  only
       ship  the  minimal possible set of functions that a set of programs might
       require to run as opposed to the full libraries.

       The linker analyses the intermediate code (CIL) produced  by  every  com&#8208;
       piler  targeting  the Mono platform like mcs, gmcs, vbnc, booc or others.
       It will walk through all the code that it is given to it, and remove  all
       the  unused  methods  and  classes.   This is done using a mark and sweep
       operation on all the code that it is referenced.

       The generated output from the monolinker can be later  processed  by  the
       mkbundle tool to generate small native self-contained executables.

       Do  not  confuse  this with the Assembly Linker (al) which creates assem&#8208;
       blies from manifests, modules and resource files.

OPTIONS
       -d search_directory
              Specify a directory to the linker where to look for assemblies.

       -o output_directory
              Specify the output directory, default is &apos;output&apos;.

              If you specify the directory `.&apos;, please  ensure  that  you  won&apos;t
              write over important assemblies of yours.

       -b true | false
              Specify  whether  to  generate  debug  symbols  or not, default is
              false.

       -g true | false
              Specify whether to generate a new guid for each linked  module  or
              reuse the existing one, default is true.

       -l i18n_assemblies
              Specify what to do with the region specific assemblies

              Mono  have  a few assemblies which contains everything region spe&#8208;
              cific:
                   I18N.CJK.dll
                   I18N.MidEast.dll
                   I18N.Other.dll
                   I18N.Rare.dll
                   I18N.West.dll

              By default, they will all be copied to the output  directory,  but
              you  can specify which one you want using this command. The choice
              can either be: none, all, cjk, mideast, other, rare or  west.  You
              can combine the values with a comma.

       -c action
              Specify the action to apply to the core assemblies.

              Core  assemblies are the assemblies that belongs to the base class
              library,   like   mscorlib.dll,    System.dll    or    System.Win&#8208;
              dows.Forms.dll.

              The  linker supports three operations on these assemblies, you can
              specify one of the following actions:

              skip   This instructs the linker to skip them and do nothing  with
                     them.

              copy   This instructs the linker to copy them to the output direc&#8208;
                     tory,

              link   This instructs the linker to apply the linking process  and
                     reduce their size.


       -p action assembly
              Specify per assembly which action to apply.

       -x descriptor
              Use an XML descriptor as a source for the linker.

              Here  is  an example that shows all the possibilities of this for&#8208;
              mat:

              &lt;linker&gt;
                   &lt;assembly fullname=&quot;Library&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;type fullname=&quot;Foo&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;type fullname=&quot;Bar&quot; preserve=&quot;nothing&quot; required=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;type fullname=&quot;Baz&quot; preserve=&quot;fields&quot; required=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;type fullname=&quot;Gazonk&quot;&gt;
                             &lt;method signature=&quot;System.Void .ctor(System.String)&quot; /&gt;
                             &lt;field signature=&quot;System.String _blah&quot; /&gt;
                             &lt;field name=&quot;someFieldName&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;/type&gt;
                   &lt;/assembly&gt;
              &lt;/linker&gt;

              In this example, the linker will link the types Foo, Bar, Baz  and
              Gazonk.

              The preserve attribute ensures that all the fields of the type Baz
              will be always be linked, not matter if they are used or not,  but
              that  neither  the  fields or the methods of Bar will be linked if
              they are not used. Not specifying  a  preserve  attribute  implies
              that we are preserving everything in the specified type.

              The  required  attribute specifies that if the type is not marked,
              during the mark operation, it will not be linked.

              The type Gazonk will be linked, as well as its constructor  taking
              a string as a parameter, and it&apos;s _blah field.

              You can have multiple assembly nodes.

       -a assemblies
              use an assembly as a source for the linker.

              The  linker  will  walk through all the methods of the assembly to
              generate only what is necessary for this assembly to run.

       -i info_file
              use a .info xml file as a source for the linker.

              An info file is a file produced by  the  tool  mono-api-info.  The
              linker will use it to generate an assembly that contains only what
              the public API defined in the info file needs.

       -s [StepBefore:]StepFullName,StepAssembly[:StepAfter]

              You can ask the linker to execute custom steps  by  using  the  -s
              command.  This  command  takes  the standard TypeFullName,Assembly
              format to locate the step. You can customize its position  in  the
              pipeline by either adding it before a step, or after.

              Example:

              using System;

              using Mono.Linker;
              using Mono.Linker.Steps;

              namespace Foo {

                   public class FooStep : IStep {

                        public void Process (LinkContext context)
                        {
                             foreach (IStep step in context.Pipeline.GetSteps ()) {
                                  Console.WriteLine (step.GetType ().Name);
                             }
                        }
                   }
              }

              If  you compile this custom against monolinker to a Foo.dll assem&#8208;
              bly, you can use the -s switch as follows.   To add the FooStep at
              the end of the pipeline:

                   monolinker -s Foo.FooStep,Foo -a program.exe

              This commanand will add the FooStep after the MarkStep:

                   monolinker -s MarkStep:Foo.FooStep,Foo -a program.exe

              This command will add the FooStep before the MarkStep:

                   monolinker -s Foo.FooStep,Foo:MarkStep -a program.exe

              This command will add the FooStep before the MarkStep

       -m CustomParam ParamValue
              Specify a parameter for a custom step.
