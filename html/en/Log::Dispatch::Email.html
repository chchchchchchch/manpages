NAME
       Log::Dispatch::Email - Base class for objects that send log messages via
       email

VERSION
       version 2.32

SYNOPSIS
         package Log::Dispatch::Email::MySender;

         use Log::Dispatch::Email;
         use base qw( Log::Dispatch::Email );

         sub send_email {
             my $self = shift;
             my %p    = @_;

             # Send email somehow.  Message is in $p{message}
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module should be used as a base class to implement Log::Dispatch::*
       objects that send their log messages via email.  Implementing a subclass
       simply requires the code shown in the SYNOPSIS with a real implementation
       of the &quot;send_email()&quot; method.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor takes the following parameters in addition to the
       standard parameters documented in Log::Dispatch::Output:

       &#183;   subject ($)

           The subject of the email messages which are sent.  Defaults to &quot;$0:
           log email&quot;

       &#183;   to ($ or \@)

           Either a string or a list reference of strings containing email
           addresses.  Required.

       &#183;   from ($)

           A string containing an email address.  This is optional and may not
           work with all mail sending methods.

       &#183;   buffered (0 or 1)

           This determines whether the object sends one email per message it is
           given or whether it stores them up and sends them all at once.  The
           default is to buffer messages.

METHODS
       &#183;   send_email(%p)

           This is the method that must be subclassed.  For now the only
           parameter in the hash is &apos;message&apos;.

       &#183;   flush

           If the object is buffered, then this method will call the
           &quot;send_email()&quot; method to send the contents of the buffer and then
           clear the buffer.

       &#183;   DESTROY

           On destruction, the object will call &quot;flush()&quot; to send any pending
           email.
