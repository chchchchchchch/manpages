NAME
       Log::Dispatch::File - Object for logging to files

VERSION
       version 2.32

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::Dispatch;

         my $log = Log::Dispatch-&gt;new(
             outputs =&gt; [
                 [
                     &apos;File&apos;,
                     min_level =&gt; &apos;info&apos;,
                     filename  =&gt; &apos;Somefile.log&apos;,
                     mode      =&gt; &apos;&gt;&gt;&apos;,
                     newline   =&gt; 1
                 ]
             ],
         );

         $log-&gt;emerg(&quot;I&apos;ve fallen and I can&apos;t get up&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple object for logging to files under the
       Log::Dispatch::* system.

       Note that a newline will not be added automatically at the end of a
       message by default.  To do that, pass &quot;newline =&gt; 1&quot;.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor takes the following parameters in addition to the
       standard parameters documented in Log::Dispatch::Output:

       &#183;   filename ($)

           The filename to be opened for writing.

       &#183;   mode ($)

           The mode the file should be opened with.  Valid options are &apos;write&apos;,
           &apos;&gt;&apos;, &apos;append&apos;, &apos;&gt;&gt;&apos;, or the relevant constants from Fcntl.  The
           default is &apos;write&apos;.

       &#183;   binmode ($)

           A layer name to be passed to binmode, like &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; or
           &quot;:raw&quot;.

       &#183;   close_after_write ($)

           Whether or not the file should be closed after each write.  This
           defaults to false.

           If this is true, then the mode will aways be append, so that the file
           is not re-written for each new message.

       &#183;   autoflush ($)

           Whether or not the file should be autoflushed.  This defaults to
           true.
&#12;       &#183;   permissions ($)

           If the file does not already exist, the permissions that it should be
           created with.  Optional.  The argument passed must be a valid octal
           value, such as 0600 or the constants available from Fcntl, like
           S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR.

           See &quot;chmod&quot; in perlfunc for more on potential traps when passing
           octal values around.  Most importantly, remember that if you pass a
           string that looks like an octal value, like this:

            my $mode = &apos;0644&apos;;

           Then the resulting file will end up with permissions like this:

            --w----r-T

           which is probably not what you want.
