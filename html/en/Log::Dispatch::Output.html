NAME
       Log::Dispatch::Output - Base class for all Log::Dispatch::* objects

VERSION
       version 2.32

SYNOPSIS
         package Log::Dispatch::MySubclass;

         use Log::Dispatch::Output;
         use base qw( Log::Dispatch::Output );

         sub new {
             my $proto = shift;
             my $class = ref $proto || $proto;

             my %p = @_;

             my $self = bless {}, $class;

             $self-&gt;_basic_init(%p);

             # Do more if you like

             return $self;
         }

         sub log_message {
             my $self = shift;
             my %p    = @_;

             # Do something with message in $p{message}
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the base class from which all Log::Dispatch::* objects
       should be derived.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor, &quot;new&quot;, must be overridden in a subclass. See Output
       Classes for a description of the common parameters accepted by this
       constructor.

METHODS
       &#183;   _basic_init(%p)

           This should be called from a subclass&apos;s constructor.  Make sure to
           pass the arguments in @_ to it.  It sets the object&apos;s name and
           minimum level.  It also sets up two other attributes which are used
           by other Log::Dispatch::Output methods, level_names and
           level_numbers.

       &#183;   name

           Returns the object&apos;s name.

       &#183;   min_level

           Returns the object&apos;s minimum log level.
&#12;       &#183;   max_level

           Returns the object&apos;s maximum log level.

       &#183;   accepted_levels

           Returns a list of the object&apos;s accepted levels (by name) from minimum
           to maximum.

       &#183;   log( level =&gt; $, message =&gt; $ )

           Sends a message if the level is greater than or equal to the object&apos;s
           minimum level.  This method applies any message formatting callbacks
           that the object may have.

       &#183;   _should_log ($)

           This method is called from the &quot;log()&quot; method with the log level of
           the message to be logged as an argument.  It returns a boolean value
           indicating whether or not the message should be logged by this
           particular object.  The &quot;log()&quot; method will not process the message
           if the return value is false.

       &#183;   _level_as_number ($)

           This method will take a log level as a string (or a number) and
           return the number of that log level.  If not given an argument, it
           returns the calling object&apos;s log level instead.  If it cannot
           determine the level then it will croak.

       &#183;   add_callback( $code )

           Adds a callback (like those given during construction). It is added
           to the end of the list of callbacks.

   Subclassing
       This class should be used as the base class for all logging objects you
       create that you would like to work under the Log::Dispatch architecture.
       Subclassing is fairly trivial.  For most subclasses, if you simply copy
       the code in the SYNOPSIS and then put some functionality into the
       &quot;log_message&quot; method then you should be all set.  Please make sure to use
       the &quot;_basic_init&quot; method as directed.

       The actual logging implementation should be done in a &quot;log_message&quot;
       method that you write. Do not override &quot;log&quot;!.
