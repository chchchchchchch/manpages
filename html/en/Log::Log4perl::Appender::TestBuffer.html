NAME
       Log::Log4perl::Appender::TestBuffer - Appender class for testing

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::Log4perl::Appender::TestBuffer;

         my $appender = Log::Log4perl::Appender::TestBuffer-&gt;new(
             name      =&gt; &apos;mybuffer&apos;,
         );

             # Append to the buffer
         $appender-&gt;log(
             level =  &gt; &apos;alert&apos;,
             message =&gt; &quot;I&apos;m searching the city for sci-fi wasabi\n&quot;
         );

             # Retrieve the result
         my $result = $appender-&gt;buffer();

             # Clear the buffer to the empty string
         $appender-&gt;clear();

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used for internal testing of &quot;Log::Log4perl&quot;. It is a
       &quot;Log::Dispatch&quot;-style appender, which writes to a buffer in memory, from
       where actual results can be easily retrieved later to compare with
       expeced results.

       Every buffer created is stored in an internal global array, and can later
       be referenced by name:

           my $app = Log::Log4perl::Appender::TestBuffer-&gt;by_name(&quot;mybuffer&quot;);

       retrieves the appender object of a previously created buffer &quot;mybuffer&quot;.
       To reset this global array and have it forget all of the previously
       created testbuffer appenders (external references to those appenders
       nonwithstanding), use

           Log::Log4perl::Appender::TestBuffer-&gt;reset();
