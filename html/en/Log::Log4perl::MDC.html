MDC(3pm)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              MDC(3pm)



NAME
       Log::Log4perl::MDC - Mapped Diagnostic Context

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Log4perl allows loggers to maintain global thread-specific data,
       called the Nested Diagnostic Context (NDC) and Mapped Diagnostic Context
       (MDC).

       The MDC is a simple thread-specific hash table, in which the application
       can stuff values under certain keys and retrieve them later via the
       &quot;%X{key}&quot; placeholder in &quot;Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout&quot;s.

       Log::Log4perl::MDC-&gt;put($key, $value);
           Store a value $value under key $key in the map.

       my $value = Log::Log4perl::MDC-&gt;get($key);
           Retrieve the content of the map under the specified key.  Typically
           done by %X{key} in &quot;Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout&quot;.  If no
           value exists to the given key, &quot;undef&quot; is returned.

       my $text = Log::Log4perl::MDC-&gt;remove();
           Delete all entries from the map.

       Log::Log4perl::MDC-&gt;get_context();
           Returns a reference to the hash table.

       Please note that all of the methods above are class methods, there&apos;s no
       instances of this class. Since the thread model in perl 5.8.0 is &quot;no
       shared data unless explicetly requested&quot; the data structures used are
       just global (and therefore thread-specific).
