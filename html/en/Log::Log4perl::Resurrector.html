NAME
       Log::Log4perl::Resurrector - Dark Magic to resurrect hidden L4p
       statements

DESCRIPTION
       Loading &quot;use Log::Log4perl::Resurrector&quot; causes subsequently loaded
       modules to have their hidden

           ###l4p DEBUG(...)
           ###l4p INFO(...)
           ...

       statements uncommented and therefore &apos;resurrected&apos;, i.e. activated.

       This allows for a module &quot;Foobar.pm&quot; to be written with Log4perl
       statements commented out and running at full speed in normal mode.  When
       loaded via

           use Foobar;

       all hidden Log4perl statements will be ignored.

       However, if a script loads the module &quot;Foobar&quot; after loading
       &quot;Log::Log4perl::Resurrector&quot;, as in

           use Log::Log4perl::Resurrector;
           use Foobar;

       then &quot;Log::Log4perl::Resurrector&quot; will have put a source filter in place
       that will extract all hidden Log4perl statements in &quot;Foobar&quot; before
       &quot;Foobar&quot; actually gets loaded.

       Therefore, &quot;Foobar&quot; will then behave as if the

           ###l4p DEBUG(...)
           ###l4p INFO(...)
           ...

       statements were actually written like

           DEBUG(...)
           INFO(...)
           ...

       and the module &quot;Foobar&quot; will indeed be Log4perl-enabled. Whether any
       activated Log4perl statement will actually trigger log messages, is up to
       the Log4perl configuration, of course.

       There&apos;s a startup cost to using &quot;Log::Log4perl::Resurrector&quot; (all
       subsequently loaded modules are examined) but once the compilation phase
       has finished, the perl program will run at full speed.

       Some of the techniques used in this module have been stolen from the
       &quot;Acme::Incorporated&quot; CPAN module, written by chromatic. Long live CPAN!
