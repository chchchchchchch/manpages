NAME
       METACITY - minimal GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       metacity  [--display=DISPLAY]  [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID] [--sm-dis&#8208;
       able] [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly metacity.

       metacity is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is
       designed  to  integrate well with the GNOME desktop.  metacity lacks some
       features that may be expected by  traditional  UNIX  or  other  technical
       users;  these  users  may want to investigate other available window man&#8208;
       agers for use with GNOME or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by metacity.   Users
              are  encouraged  to change the GNOME window manager by running the
              new WM with the --replace or  -replace  option,  and  subsequently
              saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       metacity  configuration can be found under Preferences-&gt;Windows and Pref&#8208;
       erences-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts on the menu-panel. Advanced configuration can
       be achieved directly through gsettings.
