NAME
       MIME-tools - modules for parsing (and creating!) MIME entities

SYNOPSIS
       Here&apos;s some pretty basic code for parsing a MIME message, and outputting
       its decoded components to a given directory:

           use MIME::Parser;

           ### Create parser, and set some parsing options:
           my $parser = new MIME::Parser;
           $parser-&gt;output_under(&quot;$ENV{HOME}/mimemail&quot;);

           ### Parse input:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) or die &quot;parse failed\n&quot;;

           ### Take a look at the top-level entity (and any parts it has):
           $entity-&gt;dump_skeleton;

       Here&apos;s some code which composes and sends a MIME message containing three
       parts: a text file, an attached GIF, and some more text:

           use MIME::Entity;

           ### Create the top-level, and set up the mail headers:
           $top = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type    =&gt;&quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                      From    =&gt; &quot;me\@myhost.com&quot;,
                                      To      =&gt; &quot;you\@yourhost.com&quot;,
                                      Subject =&gt; &quot;Hello, nurse!&quot;);

           ### Part #1: a simple text document:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path=&gt;&quot;./testin/short.txt&quot;);

           ### Part #2: a GIF file:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path        =&gt; &quot;./docs/mime-sm.gif&quot;,
                        Type        =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                        Encoding    =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;);

           ### Part #3: some literal text:
           $top-&gt;attach(Data=&gt;$message);

           ### Send it:
           open MAIL, &quot;| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi -oem&quot; or die &quot;open: $!&quot;;
           $top-&gt;print(\*MAIL);
           close MAIL;

       For more examples, look at the scripts in the examples directory of the
       MIME-tools distribution.

DESCRIPTION
       MIME-tools is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing, decoding,
       and generating single- or multipart (even nested multipart) MIME
       messages.  (Yes, kids, that means you can send messages with attached GIF
       files).

REQUIREMENTS
       You will need the following installed on your system:

               File::Path
               File::Spec
               IPC::Open2              (optional)
               MIME::Base64
               MIME::QuotedPrint
               Net::SMTP
               Mail::Internet, ...     from the MailTools distribution.
&#12;       See the Makefile.PL in your distribution for the most-comprehensive list
       of prerequisite modules and their version numbers.

A QUICK TOUR
   Overview of the classes
       Here are the classes you&apos;ll generally be dealing with directly:

           (START HERE)            results() .-----------------.
                 \                 .--------&gt;| MIME::          |

                  | MIME::    |--&apos;           `-----------------&apos;
                  | Parser    |--.           .-----------------.
                  `-----------&apos;   \ filer()  | MIME::          |
                     | parse()     `--------&gt;| Parser::Filer   |
                     | gives you             `-----------------&apos;
                     | a...                                  | output_path()
                     |                                       | determines

                     |    head()       .--------.            |
                     |    returns...   | MIME:: | get()      |
                     V       .--------&gt;| Head   | etc...     |
                  .--------./          `--------&apos;            |
            .---&gt; | MIME:: |                                 |
            `-----| Entity |           .--------.            |
          parts() `--------&apos;\          | MIME:: |           /
          returns            `--------&gt;| Body   |&lt;---------&apos;
          sub-entities    bodyhandle() `--------&apos;
          (if any)        returns...       | open()
                                           | returns...
                                           |
                                           V
                                       .--------. read()
                                       | IO::   | getline()
                                       | Handle | print()
                                       `--------&apos; etc...

       To illustrate, parsing works this way:

       &#183;   The &quot;parser&quot; parses the MIME stream.  A parser is an instance of
           &quot;MIME::Parser&quot;.  You hand it an input stream (like a filehandle) to
           parse a message from: if the parse is successful, the result is an
           &quot;entity&quot;.

       &#183;   A parsed message is represented by an &quot;entity&quot;.  An entity is an
           instance of &quot;MIME::Entity&quot; (a subclass of &quot;Mail::Internet&quot;).  If the
           message had &quot;parts&quot; (e.g., attachments), then those parts are
           &quot;entities&quot; as well, contained inside the top-level entity.  Each
           entity has a &quot;head&quot; and a &quot;body&quot;.

       &#183;   The entity&apos;s &quot;head&quot; contains information about the message.  A &quot;head&quot;
           is an instance of &quot;MIME::Head&quot; (a subclass of &quot;Mail::Header&quot;).  It
           contains information from the message header: content type, sender,
           subject line, etc.

       &#183;   The entity&apos;s &quot;body&quot; knows where the message data is.  You can ask to
           &quot;open&quot; this data source for reading or writing, and you will get back
           an &quot;I/O handle&quot;.

       &#183;   You can open() a &quot;body&quot; and get an &quot;I/O handle&quot; to read/write message
           data.  This handle is an object that is basically like an
           IO::Handle...  it can be any class, so long as it supports a small,
           standard set of methods for reading from or writing to the underlying
           data source.

       A typical multipart message containing two parts -- a textual greeting
       and an &quot;attached&quot; GIF file -- would be a tree of MIME::Entity objects,
       each of which would have its own MIME::Head.  Like this:

           .--------.
           | MIME:: | Content-type: multipart/mixed
           | Entity | Subject: Happy Samhaine!
           `--------&apos;
                |
                `----.
               parts |
                     |   .--------.
                     |---| MIME:: | Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
                     |   | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
                     |   `--------&apos;
                     |   .--------.
                     |---| MIME:: | Content-type: image/gif
                         | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: base64
                         `--------&apos; Content-disposition: inline;
                                      filename=&quot;hs.gif&quot;

   Parsing messages
       You usually start by creating an instance of MIME::Parser and setting up
       certain parsing parameters: what directory to save extracted files to,
       how to name the files, etc.

       You then give that instance a readable filehandle on which waits a MIME
       message.  If all goes well, you will get back a MIME::Entity object (a
       subclass of Mail::Internet), which consists of...

       &#183;   A MIME::Head (a subclass of Mail::Header) which holds the MIME header
           data.

       &#183;   A MIME::Body, which is a object that knows where the body data is.
           You ask this object to &quot;open&quot; itself for reading, and it will hand
           you back an &quot;I/O handle&quot; for reading the data: this could be of any
           class, so long as it conforms to a subset of the IO::Handle
           interface.

       If the original message was a multipart document, the MIME::Entity object
       will have a non-empty list of &quot;parts&quot;, each of which is in turn a
       MIME::Entity (which might also be a multipart entity, etc, etc...).

       Internally, the parser (in MIME::Parser) asks for instances of
       MIME::Decoder whenever it needs to decode an encoded file.  MIME::Decoder
       has a mapping from supported encodings (e.g., &apos;base64&apos;) to classes whose
       instances can decode them.  You can add to this mapping to try out
       new/experiment encodings.  You can also use MIME::Decoder by itself.

   Composing messages
       All message composition is done via the MIME::Entity class.  For single-
       part messages, you can use the MIME::Entity/build constructor to create
       MIME entities very easily.

       For multipart messages, you can start by creating a top-level &quot;multipart&quot;
       entity with MIME::Entity::build(), and then use the similar
       MIME::Entity::attach() method to attach parts to that message.  Please
       note: what most people think of as &quot;a text message with an attached GIF
       file&quot; is really a multipart message with 2 parts: the first being the
       text message, and the second being the GIF file.

       When building MIME a entity, you&apos;ll have to provide two very important
       pieces of information: the content type and the content transfer
       encoding.  The type is usually easy, as it is directly determined by the
       file format; e.g., an HTML file is &quot;text/html&quot;.  The encoding, however,
       is trickier... for example, some HTML files are &quot;7bit&quot;-compliant, but
       others might have very long lines and would need to be sent
       &quot;quoted-printable&quot; for reliability.

       See the section on encoding/decoding for more details, as well as &quot;A MIME
       PRIMER&quot;.

   Sending email
       Since MIME::Entity inherits directly from Mail::Internet, you can use the
       normal Mail::Internet mechanisms to send email.  For example,

           $entity-&gt;smtpsend;

   Encoding/decoding support
       The MIME::Decoder class can be used to encode as well; this is done when
       printing MIME entities.  All the standard encodings are supported (see &quot;A
       MIME PRIMER&quot; for details):

           Encoding:        | Normally used when message contents are:
           -------------------------------------------------------------------
           7bit             | 7-bit data with under 1000 chars/line, or multipart.
           8bit             | 8-bit data with under 1000 chars/line.
           binary           | 8-bit data with some long lines (or no line breaks).
           quoted-printable | Text files with some 8-bit chars (e.g., Latin-1 text).
           base64           | Binary files.

       Which encoding you choose for a given document depends largely on (1)
       what you know about the document&apos;s contents (text vs binary), and (2)
       whether you need the resulting message to have a reliable encoding for
       7-bit Internet email transport.

       In general, only &quot;quoted-printable&quot; and &quot;base64&quot; guarantee reliable
       transport of all data; the other three &quot;no-encoding&quot; encodings simply
       pass the data through, and are only reliable if that data is 7bit ASCII
       with under 1000 characters per line, and has no conflicts with the
       multipart boundaries.

       I&apos;ve considered making it so that the content-type and encoding can be
       automatically inferred from the file&apos;s path, but that seems to be asking
       for trouble... or at least, for Mail::Cap...

   Message-logging
       MIME-tools is a large and complex toolkit which tries to deal with a wide
       variety of external input.  It&apos;s sometimes helpful to see what&apos;s really
       going on behind the scenes.  There are several kinds of messages logged
       by the toolkit itself:

       Debug messages
           These are printed directly to the STDERR, with a prefix of
           &quot;MIME-tools: debug&quot;.

           Debug message are only logged if you have turned &quot;debugging&quot; on in
           the MIME::Tools configuration.

       Warning messages
           These are logged by the standard Perl warn() mechanism to indicate an
           unusual situation.  They all have a prefix of &quot;MIME-tools: warning&quot;.

           Warning messages are only logged if $^W is set true and MIME::Tools
           is not configured to be &quot;quiet&quot;.

       Error messages
           These are logged by the standard Perl warn() mechanism to indicate
           that something actually failed.  They all have a prefix of
           &quot;MIME-tools: error&quot;.

           Error messages are only logged if $^W is set true and MIME::Tools is
           not configured to be &quot;quiet&quot;.

       Usage messages
           Unlike &quot;typical&quot; warnings above, which warn about problems processing
           data, usage-warnings are for alerting developers of deprecated
           methods and suspicious invocations.

           Usage messages are currently only logged if $^W is set true and
           MIME::Tools is not configured to be &quot;quiet&quot;.

       When a MIME::Parser (or one of its internal helper classes) wants to
       report a message, it generally does so by recording the message to the
       MIME::Parser::Results object immediately before invoking the appropriate
       function above.  That means each parsing run has its own trace-log which
       can be examined for problems.

   Configuring the toolkit
       If you want to tweak the way this toolkit works (for example, to turn on
       debugging), use the routines in the MIME::Tools module.

       debugging
           Turn debugging on or off.  Default is false (off).

                MIME::Tools-&gt;debugging(1);

       quiet
           Turn the reporting of warning/error messages on or off.  Default is
           true, meaning that these message are silenced.

                MIME::Tools-&gt;quiet(1);

       version
           Return the toolkit version.

                print MIME::Tools-&gt;version, &quot;\n&quot;;

THINGS YOU SHOULD DO
   Take a look at the examples
       The MIME-Tools distribution comes with an &quot;examples&quot; directory.  The
       scripts in there are basically just tossed-together, but they&apos;ll give you
       some ideas of how to use the parser.

   Run with warnings enabled
       Always run your Perl script with &quot;-w&quot;.  If you see a warning about a
       deprecated method, change your code ASAP.  This will ease upgrades
       tremendously.

   Avoid non-standard encodings
       Don&apos;t try to MIME-encode using the non-standard MIME encodings.  It&apos;s
       just not a good practice if you want people to be able to read your
       messages.

   Plan for thrown exceptions
       For example, if your mail-handling code absolutely must not die, then
       perform mail parsing like this:

           $entity = eval { $parser-&gt;parse(\*INPUT) };

       Parsing is a complex process, and some components may throw exceptions if
       seriously-bad things happen.  Since &quot;seriously-bad&quot; is in the eye of the
       beholder, you&apos;re better off catching possible exceptions instead of
       asking me to propagate &quot;undef&quot; up the stack.  Use of exceptions in
       reusable modules is one of those religious issues we&apos;re never all going
       to agree upon; thankfully, that&apos;s what &quot;eval{}&quot; is good for.

   Check the parser results for warnings/errors
       As of 5.3xx, the parser tries extremely hard to give you a MIME::Entity.
       If there were any problems, it logs warnings/errors to the underlying
       &quot;results&quot; object (see MIME::Parser::Results).  Look at that object after
       each parse.  Print out the warnings and errors, especially if messages
       don&apos;t parse the way you thought they would.

   Don&apos;t plan on printing exactly what you parsed!
       Parsing is a (slightly) lossy operation.  Because of things like
       ambiguities in base64-encoding, the following is not going to spit out
       its input unchanged in all cases:

           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN);
           $entity-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);

       If you&apos;re using MIME::Tools to process email, remember to save the data
       you parse if you want to send it on unchanged.  This is vital for things
       like PGP-signed email.

   Understand how international characters are represented
       The MIME standard allows for text strings in headers to contain
       characters from any character set, by using special sequences which look
       like this:

           =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=

       To be consistent with the existing Mail::Field classes, MIME::Tools does
       not automatically unencode these strings, since doing so would lose the
       character-set information and interfere with the parsing of fields (see
       &quot;decode_headers&quot; in MIME::Parser for a full explanation).  That means you
       should be prepared to deal with these encoded strings.

       The most common question then is, how do I decode these encoded strings?
       The answer depends on what you want to decode them to: ASCII, Latin1,
       UTF-8, etc.  Be aware that your &quot;target&quot; representation may not support
       all possible character sets you might encounter; for example, Latin1
       (ISO-8859-1) has no way of representing Big5 (Chinese) characters.  A
       common practice is to represent &quot;untranslateable&quot; characters as &quot;?&quot;s, or
       to ignore them completely.

       To unencode the strings into some of the more-popular Western byte
       representations (e.g., Latin1, Latin2, etc.), you can use the decoders in
       MIME::WordDecoder (see MIME::WordDecoder).  The simplest way is by using
       &quot;unmime()&quot;, a function wrapped around your &quot;default&quot; decoder, as follows:

           use MIME::WordDecoder;
           ...
           $subject = unmime $entity-&gt;head-&gt;get(&apos;subject&apos;);

       One place this is done automatically is in extracting the recommended
       filename for a part while parsing.  That&apos;s why you should start by
       setting up the best &quot;default&quot; decoder if the default target of Latin1
       isn&apos;t to your liking.

THINGS I DO THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
   Fuzzing of CRLF and newline on input
       RFC 2045 dictates that MIME streams have lines terminated by CRLF
       (&quot;\r\n&quot;).  However, it is extremely likely that folks will want to parse
       MIME streams where each line ends in the local newline character &quot;\n&quot;
       instead.

       An attempt has been made to allow the parser to handle both CRLF and
       newline-terminated input.

   Fuzzing of CRLF and newline when decoding
       The &quot;7bit&quot; and &quot;8bit&quot; decoders will decode both a &quot;\n&quot; and a &quot;\r\n&quot; end-
       of-line sequence into a &quot;\n&quot;.

       The &quot;binary&quot; decoder (default if no encoding specified) still outputs
       stuff verbatim... so a MIME message with CRLFs and no explicit encoding
       will be output as a text file that, on many systems, will have an
       annoying ^M at the end of each line... but this is as it should be.

   Fuzzing of CRLF and newline when encoding/composing
       TODO FIXME All encoders currently output the end-of-line sequence as a
       &quot;\n&quot;, with the assumption that the local mail agent will perform the
       conversion from newline to CRLF when sending the mail.  However, there
       probably should be an option to output CRLF as per RFC 2045

   Inability to handle multipart boundaries with embedded newlines
       Let&apos;s get something straight: this is an evil, EVIL practice.  If your
       mailer creates multipart boundary strings that contain newlines, give it
       two weeks notice and find another one.  If your mail robot receives MIME
       mail like this, regard it as syntactically incorrect, which it is.

   Ignoring non-header headers
       People like to hand the parser raw messages straight from POP3 or from a
       mailbox.  There is often predictable non-header information in front of
       the real headers; e.g., the initial &quot;From&quot; line in the following message:

           From - Wed Mar 22 02:13:18 2000
           Return-Path: &lt;eryq@zeegee.com&gt;
           Subject: Hello

       The parser simply ignores such stuff quietly.  Perhaps it shouldn&apos;t, but
       most people seem to want that behavior.

   Fuzzing of empty multipart preambles
       Please note that there is currently an ambiguity in the way preambles are
       parsed in.  The following message fragments both are regarded as having
       an empty preamble (where &quot;\n&quot; indicates a newline character):

            Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;xyz&quot;\n
            Subject: This message (#1) has an empty preamble\n
            \n
            --xyz\n
            ...

            Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;xyz&quot;\n
            Subject: This message (#2) also has an empty preamble\n
            \n
            \n
            --xyz\n
            ...

       In both cases, the first completely-empty line (after the &quot;Subject&quot;)
       marks the end of the header.

       But we should clearly ignore the second empty line in message #2, since
       it fills the role of &quot;the newline which is only there to make sure that
       the boundary is at the beginning of a line&quot;.  Such newlines are never
       part of the content preceding the boundary; thus, there is no preamble
       &quot;content&quot; in message #2.

       However, it seems clear that message #1 also has no preamble &quot;content&quot;,
       and is in fact merely a compact representation of an empty preamble.

   Use of a temp file during parsing
       Why not do everything in core?  Although the amount of core available on
       even a modest home system continues to grow, the size of attachments
       continues to grow with it.  I wanted to make sure that even users with
       small systems could deal with decoding multi-megabyte sounds and movie
       files.  That means not being core-bound.

       As of the released 5.3xx, MIME::Parser gets by with only one temp file
       open per parser.  This temp file provides a sort of infinite scratch
       space for dealing with the current message part.  It&apos;s fast and
       lightweight, but you should know about it anyway.

   Why do I assume that MIME objects are email objects?
       Achim Bohnet once pointed out that MIME headers do nothing more than
       store a collection of attributes, and thus could be represented as
       objects which don&apos;t inherit from Mail::Header.

       I agree in principle, but RFC 2045 says otherwise.  RFC 2045 [MIME]
       headers are a syntactic subset of RFC-822 [email] headers.  Perhaps a
       better name for these modules would have been RFC1521:: instead of
       MIME::, but we&apos;re a little beyond that stage now.

       When I originally wrote these modules for the CPAN, I agonized for a long
       time about whether or not they really should subclass from Mail::Internet
       (then at version 1.17).  Thanks to Graham Barr, who graciously evolved
       MailTools 1.06 to be more MIME-friendly, unification was achieved at
       MIME-tools release 2.0.  The benefits in reuse alone have been
       substantial.

A MIME PRIMER
       So you need to parse (or create) MIME, but you&apos;re not quite up on the
       specifics?  No problem...

   Glossary
       Here are some definitions adapted from RFC 1521 (predecessor of the
       current RFC 204[56789] defining MIME) explaining the terminology we use;
       each is accompanied by the equivalent in MIME:: module terms...

       attachment
           An &quot;attachment&quot; is common slang for any part of a multipart message
           -- except, perhaps, for the first part, which normally carries a user
           message describing the attachments that follow (e.g.: &quot;Hey dude,
           here&apos;s that GIF file I promised you.&quot;).

           In our system, an attachment is just a MIME::Entity under the top-
           level entity, probably one of its parts.

       body
           The &quot;body&quot; of an entity is that portion of the entity which follows
           the header and which contains the real message content.  For example,
           if your MIME message has a GIF file attachment, then the body of that
           attachment is the base64-encoded GIF file itself.

           A body is represented by an instance of MIME::Body.  You get the body
           of an entity by sending it a bodyhandle() message.

       body part
           One of the parts of the body of a multipart /entity.  A body part has
           a /header and a /body, so it makes sense to speak about the body of a
           body part.

           Since a body part is just a kind of entity, it&apos;s represented by an
           instance of MIME::Entity.

       entity
           An &quot;entity&quot; means either a /message or a /body part.  All entities
           have a /header and a /body.

           An entity is represented by an instance of MIME::Entity.  There are
           instance methods for recovering the header (a MIME::Head) and the
           body (a MIME::Body).

       header
           This is the top portion of the MIME message, which contains the
           &quot;Content-type&quot;, &quot;Content-transfer-encoding&quot;, etc.  Every MIME entity
           has a header, represented by an instance of MIME::Head.  You get the
           header of an entity by sending it a head() message.

       message
           A &quot;message&quot; generally means the complete (or &quot;top-level&quot;) message
           being transferred on a network.

           There currently is no explicit package for &quot;messages&quot;; under MIME::,
           messages are streams of data which may be read in from files or
           filehandles.  You can think of the MIME::Entity returned by the
           MIME::Parser as representing the full message.

   Content types
       This indicates what kind of data is in the MIME message, usually as
       majortype/minortype.  The standard major types are shown below.  A more-
       comprehensive listing may be found in RFC-2046.

       application
           Data which does not fit in any of the other categories, particularly
           data to be processed by some type of application program.
           &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;, &quot;application/gzip&quot;,
           &quot;application/postscript&quot;...

       audio
           Audio data.  &quot;audio/basic&quot;...
&#12;       image
           Graphics data.  &quot;image/gif&quot;, &quot;image/jpeg&quot;...

       message
           A message, usually another mail or MIME message.  &quot;message/rfc822&quot;...

       multipart
           A message containing other messages.  &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
           &quot;multipart/alternative&quot;...

       text
           Textual data, meant for humans to read.  &quot;text/plain&quot;, &quot;text/html&quot;...

       video
           Video or video+audio data.  &quot;video/mpeg&quot;...

   Content transfer encodings
       This is how the message body is packaged up for safe transit.  There are
       the 5 major MIME encodings.  A more-comprehensive listing may be found in
       RFC-2045.

       7bit
           No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that no 8-bit
           characters are present, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters
           in length (including the CRLF).

       8bit
           No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the
           message might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines do not exceed
           1000 characters in length (including the CRLF).

       binary
           No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the
           message might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines may exceed
           1000 characters in length.  Such messages are the least likely to get
           through mail gateways.

       base64
           A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary binary data to the 7bit
           domain.  Like &quot;uuencode&quot;, but very well-defined.  This is how you
           should send essentially binary information (tar files, GIFs, JPEGs,
           etc.).

       quoted-printable
           A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary line-oriented data to the
           7bit domain.  Useful for encoding messages which are textual in
           nature, yet which contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., Latin-1,
           Latin-2, or any other 8-bit alphabet).

       The MIME format is documented in RFCs 1521-1522, and more recently in
       RFCs 2045-2049.

       The MIME header format is an outgrowth of the mail header format
