NAME
       MIME::Decoder::Base64 - encode/decode a &quot;base64&quot; stream

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder subclass for the &quot;base64&quot; encoding.  The name was chosen
       to jibe with the pre-existing MIME::Base64 utility package, which this
       class actually uses to translate each chunk.

       &#183;   When decoding, the input is read one line at a time.  The input
           accumulates in an internal buffer, which is decoded in
           multiple-of-4-sized chunks (plus a possible &quot;leftover&quot; input chunk,
           of course).

       &#183;   When encoding, the input is read 45 bytes at a time: this ensures
           that the output lines are not too long.   We chose 45 since it is a
           multiple of 3 and produces lines under 76 characters, as RFC 2045
           specifies:
               The encoded output stream must be represented in lines of no more
               than 76 characters each.
