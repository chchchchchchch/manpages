NAME
       MIME::Decoder::Gzip64 - decode a &quot;base64&quot; gzip stream

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder::Base64 subclass for a nonstandard encoding whereby data
       are gzipped, then the gzipped file is base64-encoded.  Common non-
       standard MIME encodings for this:

           x-gzip64

       Since this class relies on external programs which may not exist on your
       machine, MIME-tools does not &quot;install&quot; it by default.  To use it, you
       need to say in your main program:

           install MIME::Decoder::Gzip64 &apos;x-gzip64&apos;;

       Note: if this class isn&apos;t working for you, you may need to change the
       commands it runs.  In your main program, you can do so by setting up the
       two commands which handle the compression/decompression.

           use MIME::Decoder::Gzip64;

           $MIME::Decoder::Gzip64::GZIP   = &apos;gzip -c&apos;;
           $MIME::Decoder::Gzip64::GUNZIP = &apos;gzip -d -c&apos;;
