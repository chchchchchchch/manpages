NAME
       MIME::Entity - class for parsed-and-decoded MIME message

SYNOPSIS
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Tools to make sure that you
       understand where this module fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go
       on, do it now.  I&apos;ll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

           ### Create an entity:
           $top = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(From    =&gt; &apos;me@myhost.com&apos;,
                                      To      =&gt; &apos;you@yourhost.com&apos;,
                                      Subject =&gt; &quot;Hello, nurse!&quot;,
                                      Data    =&gt; \@my_message);

           ### Attach stuff to it:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path     =&gt; $gif_path,
                        Type     =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                        Encoding =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;);

           ### Sign it:
           $top-&gt;sign;

           ### Output it:
           $top-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);

DESCRIPTION
       A subclass of Mail::Internet.

       This package provides a class for representing MIME message entities, as
       specified in RFCs 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048 and 2049.

EXAMPLES
   Construction examples
       Create a document for an ordinary 7-bit ASCII text file (lots of stuff is
       defaulted for us):

           $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Path=&gt;&quot;english-msg.txt&quot;);

       Create a document for a text file with 8-bit (Latin-1) characters:

           $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Path     =&gt;&quot;french-msg.txt&quot;,
                                      Encoding =&gt;&quot;quoted-printable&quot;,
                                      From     =&gt;&apos;jean.luc@inria.fr&apos;,
                                      Subject  =&gt;&quot;C&apos;est bon!&quot;);

       Create a document for a GIF file (the description is completely optional;
       note that we have to specify content-type and encoding since they&apos;re not
       the default values):

           $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Description =&gt; &quot;A pretty picture&quot;,
                                      Path        =&gt; &quot;./docs/mime-sm.gif&quot;,
                                      Type        =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                                      Encoding    =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;);

       Create a document that you already have the text for, using &quot;Data&quot;:

           $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type        =&gt; &quot;text/plain&quot;,
                                      Encoding    =&gt; &quot;quoted-printable&quot;,
                                      Data        =&gt; [&quot;First line.\n&quot;,
                                                     &quot;Second line.\n&quot;,
                                                     &quot;Last line.\n&quot;]);
&#12;       Create a multipart message, with the entire structure given explicitly:

           ### Create the top-level, and set up the mail headers:
           $top = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type     =&gt; &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                      From     =&gt; &apos;me@myhost.com&apos;,
                                      To       =&gt; &apos;you@yourhost.com&apos;,
                                      Subject  =&gt; &quot;Hello, nurse!&quot;);

           ### Attachment #1: a simple text document:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path=&gt;&quot;./testin/short.txt&quot;);

           ### Attachment #2: a GIF file:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path        =&gt; &quot;./docs/mime-sm.gif&quot;,
                        Type        =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                        Encoding    =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;);

           ### Attachment #3: text we&apos;ll create with text we have on-hand:
           $top-&gt;attach(Data =&gt; $contents);

       Suppose you don&apos;t know ahead of time that you&apos;ll have attachments?  No
       problem: you can &quot;attach&quot; to singleparts as well:

           $top = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(From    =&gt; &apos;me@myhost.com&apos;,
                                      To      =&gt; &apos;you@yourhost.com&apos;,
                                      Subject =&gt; &quot;Hello, nurse!&quot;,
                                      Data    =&gt; \@my_message);
           if ($GIF_path) {
               $top-&gt;attach(Path     =&gt; $GIF_path,
                            Type     =&gt; &apos;image/gif&apos;);
           }

       Copy an entity (headers, parts... everything but external body data):

           my $deepcopy = $top-&gt;dup;

   Access examples
           ### Get the head, a MIME::Head:
           $head = $ent-&gt;head;

           ### Get the body, as a MIME::Body;
           $bodyh = $ent-&gt;bodyhandle;

           ### Get the intended MIME type (as declared in the header):
           $type = $ent-&gt;mime_type;

           ### Get the effective MIME type (in case decoding failed):
           $eff_type = $ent-&gt;effective_type;

           ### Get preamble, parts, and epilogue:
           $preamble   = $ent-&gt;preamble;          ### ref to array of lines
           $num_parts  = $ent-&gt;parts;
           $first_part = $ent-&gt;parts(0);          ### an entity
           $epilogue   = $ent-&gt;epilogue;          ### ref to array of lines

   Manipulation examples
       Muck about with the body data:

           ### Read the (unencoded) body data:
           if ($io = $ent-&gt;open(&quot;r&quot;)) {
               while (defined($_ = $io-&gt;getline)) { print $_ }
               $io-&gt;close;
           }

           ### Write the (unencoded) body data:
           if ($io = $ent-&gt;open(&quot;w&quot;)) {
               foreach (@lines) { $io-&gt;print($_) }
               $io-&gt;close;
           }

           ### Delete the files for any external (on-disk) data:
           $ent-&gt;purge;

       Muck about with the signature:

           ### Sign it (automatically removes any existing signature):
           $top-&gt;sign(File=&gt;&quot;$ENV{HOME}/.signature&quot;);

           ### Remove any signature within 15 lines of the end:
           $top-&gt;remove_sig(15);

       Muck about with the headers:

           ### Compute content-lengths for singleparts based on bodies:
           ###   (Do this right before you print!)
           $entity-&gt;sync_headers(Length=&gt;&apos;COMPUTE&apos;);

       Muck about with the structure:

           ### If a 0- or 1-part multipart, collapse to a singlepart:
           $top-&gt;make_singlepart;

           ### If a singlepart, inflate to a multipart with 1 part:
           $top-&gt;make_multipart;

       Delete parts:

           ### Delete some parts of a multipart message:
           my @keep = grep { keep_part($_) } $msg-&gt;parts;
           $msg-&gt;parts(\@keep);

   Output examples
       Print to filehandles:

           ### Print the entire message:
           $top-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);

           ### Print just the header:
           $top-&gt;print_header(\*STDOUT);

           ### Print just the (encoded) body... includes parts as well!
           $top-&gt;print_body(\*STDOUT);

       Stringify... note that &quot;stringify_xx&quot; can also be written &quot;xx_as_string&quot;;
       the methods are synonymous, and neither form will be deprecated:

           ### Stringify the entire message:
           print $top-&gt;stringify;              ### or $top-&gt;as_string

           ### Stringify just the header:
           print $top-&gt;stringify_header;       ### or $top-&gt;header_as_string

           ### Stringify just the (encoded) body... includes parts as well!
           print $top-&gt;stringify_body;         ### or $top-&gt;body_as_string

       Debug:

           ### Output debugging info:
           $entity-&gt;dump_skeleton(\*STDERR);

PUBLIC INTERFACE
   Construction
       new [SOURCE]
           Class method.  Create a new, empty MIME entity.  Basically, this uses
           the Mail::Internet constructor...

           If SOURCE is an ARRAYREF, it is assumed to be an array of lines that
           will be used to create both the header and an in-core body.

           Else, if SOURCE is defined, it is assumed to be a filehandle from
           which the header and in-core body is to be read.

           Note: in either case, the body will not be parsed: merely read!

       add_part ENTITY, [OFFSET]
           Instance method.  Assuming we are a multipart message, add a body
           part (a MIME::Entity) to the array of body parts.  Returns the part
           that was just added.

           If OFFSET is positive, the new part is added at that offset from the
           beginning of the array of parts.  If it is negative, it counts from
           the end of the array.  (An INDEX of -1 will place the new part at the
           very end of the array, -2 will place it as the penultimate item in
           the array, etc.)  If OFFSET is not given, the new part is added to
           the end of the array.  Thanks to Jason L Tibbitts III for providing
           support for OFFSET.

           Warning: in general, you only want to attach parts to entities with a
           content-type of &quot;multipart/*&quot;).

       attach PARAMHASH
           Instance method.  The real quick-and-easy way to create multipart
           messages.  The PARAMHASH is used to &quot;build&quot; a new entity; this method
           is basically equivalent to:

               $entity-&gt;add_part(ref($entity)-&gt;build(PARAMHASH, Top=&gt;0));

           Note: normally, you attach to multipart entities; however, if you
           attach something to a singlepart (like attaching a GIF to a text
           message), the singlepart will be coerced into a multipart
           automatically.

       build PARAMHASH
           Class/instance method.  A quick-and-easy catch-all way to create an
           entity.  Use it like this to build a &quot;normal&quot; single-part entity:

              $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type     =&gt; &quot;image/gif&quot;,
                                         Encoding =&gt; &quot;base64&quot;,
                                         Path     =&gt; &quot;/path/to/xyz12345.gif&quot;,
                                         Filename =&gt; &quot;saveme.gif&quot;,
                                         Disposition =&gt; &quot;attachment&quot;);

           And like this to build a &quot;multipart&quot; entity:

              $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type     =&gt; &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                         Boundary =&gt; &quot;---1234567&quot;);

           A minimal MIME header will be created.  If you want to add or modify
           any header fields afterwards, you can of course do so via the
           underlying head object... but hey, there&apos;s now a prettier syntax!

              $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type          =&gt;&quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                         From          =&gt; $myaddr,
                                         Subject       =&gt; &quot;Hi!&quot;,
                                         &apos;X-Certified&apos; =&gt; [&apos;SINED&apos;,
                                                           &apos;SEELED&apos;,
                                                           &apos;DELIVERED&apos;]);

           Normally, an &quot;X-Mailer&quot; header field is output which contains this
           toolkit&apos;s name and version (plus this module&apos;s RCS version).  This
           will allow any bad MIME we generate to be traced back to us.  You can
           of course overwrite that header with your own:

              $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type        =&gt; &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                         &apos;X-Mailer&apos;  =&gt; &quot;myprog 1.1&quot;);
&#12;           Or remove it entirely:

              $ent = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type       =&gt; &quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
                                         &apos;X-Mailer&apos; =&gt; undef);

           OK, enough hype.  The parameters are:

           (FIELDNAME)
               Any field you want placed in the message header, taken from the
               standard list of header fields (you don&apos;t need to worry about
               case):

                   Bcc           Encrypted     Received      Sender
                   Cc            From          References    Subject
                   Comments      Keywords      Reply-To      To
                   Content-*     Message-ID    Resent-*      X-*
                   Date          MIME-Version  Return-Path
                                 Organization

               To give experienced users some veto power, these fields will be
               set after the ones I set... so be careful: don&apos;t set any MIME
               fields (like &quot;Content-type&quot;) unless you know what you&apos;re doing!

               To specify a fieldname that&apos;s not in the above list, even one
               that&apos;s identical to an option below, just give it with a trailing
               &quot;:&quot;, like &quot;My-field:&quot;.  When in doubt, that always signals a mail
               field (and it sort of looks like one too).

           Boundary
               Multipart entities only. Optional.  The boundary string.  As per
               RFC-2046, it must consist only of the characters
               &quot;[0-9a-zA-Z&apos;()+_,-./:=?]&quot; and space (you&apos;ll be warned, and your
               boundary will be ignored, if this is not the case).  If you omit
               this, a random string will be chosen... which is probably safer.

           Charset
               Optional.  The character set.

           Data
               Single-part entities only. Optional.  An alternative to Path
               (q.v.): the actual data, either as a scalar or an array reference
               (whose elements are joined together to make the actual scalar).
               The body is opened on the data using MIME::Body::InCore.

           Description
               Optional.  The text of the content-description.  If you don&apos;t
               specify it, the field is not put in the header.

           Disposition
               Optional.  The basic content-disposition (&quot;attachment&quot; or
               &quot;inline&quot;).  If you don&apos;t specify it, it defaults to &quot;inline&quot; for
               backwards compatibility.  Thanks to Kurt Freytag for suggesting
               this feature.

           Encoding
               Optional.  The content-transfer-encoding.  If you don&apos;t specify
               it, a reasonable default is put in.  You can also give the
               special value &apos;-SUGGEST&apos;, to have it chosen for you in a heavy-
               duty fashion which scans the data itself.

           Filename
               Single-part entities only. Optional.  The recommended filename.
               Overrides any name extracted from &quot;Path&quot;.  The information is
               stored both the deprecated (content-type) and preferred (content-
               disposition) locations.  If you explicitly want to avoid a
               recommended filename (even when Path is used), supply this as
               empty or undef.

           Id  Optional.  Set the content-id.
&#12;           Path
               Single-part entities only. Optional.  The path to the file to
               attach.  The body is opened on that file using MIME::Body::File.

           Top Optional.  Is this a top-level entity?  If so, it must sport a
               MIME-Version.  The default is true.  (NB: look at how &quot;attach()&quot;
               uses it.)

           Type
               Optional.  The basic content-type (&quot;text/plain&quot;, etc.).  If you
               don&apos;t specify it, it defaults to &quot;text/plain&quot; as per RFC 2045.
               Do yourself a favor: put it in.

       dup Instance method.  Duplicate the entity.  Does a deep, recursive copy,
           but beware: external data in bodyhandles is not copied to new files!
           Changing the data in one entity&apos;s data file, or purging that entity,
           will affect its duplicate.  Entities with in-core data probably need
           not worry.

   Access
       body [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get the encoded (transport-ready) body, as an array
           of lines.  Returns an array reference.  Each array entry is a
           newline-terminated line.

           This is a read-only data structure: changing its contents will have
           no effect.  Its contents are identical to what is printed by
           print_body().

           Provided for compatibility with Mail::Internet, so that methods like
           &quot;smtpsend()&quot; will work.  Note however that if VALUE is given, a fatal
           exception is thrown, since you cannot use this method to set the
           lines of the encoded message.

           If you want the raw (unencoded) body data, use the bodyhandle()
           method to get and use a MIME::Body.  The content-type of the entity
           will tell you whether that body is best read as text (via getline())
           or raw data (via read()).

       bodyhandle [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get or set an abstract object representing the body
           of the message.  The body holds the decoded message data.

           Note that not all entities have bodies!  An entity will have either a
           body or parts: not both.  This method will only return an object if
           this entity can have a body; otherwise, it will return undefined.
           Whether-or-not a given entity can have a body is determined by (1)
           its content type, and (2) whether-or-not the parser was told to
           extract nested messages:

               Type:        | Extract nested? | bodyhandle() | parts()
               -----------------------------------------------------------------------
               multipart/*  | -               | undef        | 0 or more MIME::Entity
               message/*    | true            | undef        | 0 or 1 MIME::Entity
               message/*    | false           | MIME::Body   | empty list
               (other)      | -               | MIME::Body   | empty list

           If &quot;VALUE&quot; is not given, the current bodyhandle is returned, or undef
           if the entity cannot have a body.

           If &quot;VALUE&quot; is given, the bodyhandle is set to the new value, and the
           previous value is returned.

           See &quot;parts&quot; for more info.

       effective_type [MIMETYPE]
           Instance method.  Set/get the effective MIME type of this entity.
           This is usually identical to the actual (or defaulted) MIME type, but
           in some cases it differs.  For example, from RFC-2045:
&#12;              Any entity with an unrecognized Content-Transfer-Encoding must be
              treated as if it has a Content-Type of &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;,
              regardless of what the Content-Type header field actually says.

           Why? because if we can&apos;t decode the message, then we have to take the
           bytes as-is, in their (unrecognized) encoded form.  So the message
           ceases to be a &quot;text/foobar&quot; and becomes a bunch of undecipherable
           bytes -- in other words, an &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;.

           Such an entity, if parsed, would have its effective_type() set to
           &quot;application/octet_stream&quot;, although the mime_type() and the contents
           of the header would remain the same.

           If there is no effective type, the method just returns what
           mime_type() would.

           Warning: the effective type is &quot;sticky&quot;; once set, that
           effective_type() will always be returned even if the conditions that
           necessitated setting the effective type become no longer true.

       epilogue [LINES]
           Instance method.  Get/set the text of the epilogue, as an array of
           newline-terminated LINES.  Returns a reference to the array of lines,
           or undef if no epilogue exists.

           If there is a epilogue, it is output when printing this entity;
           otherwise, a default epilogue is used.  Setting the epilogue to undef
           (not []!) causes it to fallback to the default.

       head [VALUE]
           Instance method.  Get/set the head.

           If there is no VALUE given, returns the current head.  If none
           exists, an empty instance of MIME::Head is created, set, and
           returned.

           Note: This is a patch over a problem in Mail::Internet, which doesn&apos;t
           provide a method for setting the head to some given object.

       is_multipart
           Instance method.  Does this entity&apos;s effective MIME type indicate
           that it&apos;s a multipart entity?  Returns undef (false) if the answer
           couldn&apos;t be determined, 0 (false) if it was determined to be false,
           and true otherwise.  Note that this says nothing about whether or not
           parts were extracted.

           NOTE: we switched to effective_type so that multiparts with bad or
           missing boundaries could be coerced to an effective type of
           &quot;application/x-unparseable-multipart&quot;.

       mime_type
           Instance method.  A purely-for-convenience method.  This simply
           relays the request to the associated MIME::Head object.  If there is
           no head, returns undef in a scalar context and the empty array in a
           list context.

           Before you use this, consider using effective_type() instead,
           especially if you obtained the entity from a MIME::Parser.

       open READWRITE
           Instance method.  A purely-for-convenience method.  This simply
           relays the request to the associated MIME::Body object (see
           MIME::Body::open()).  READWRITE is either &apos;r&apos; (open for read) or &apos;w&apos;
           (open for write).

           If there is no body, returns false.

       parts
       parts INDEX
       parts ARRAYREF
           Instance method.  Return the MIME::Entity objects which are the sub
           parts of this entity (if any).

           If no argument is given, returns the array of all sub parts,
           returning the empty array if there are none (e.g., if this is a
           single part message, or a degenerate multipart).  In a scalar
           context, this returns you the number of parts.

           If an integer INDEX is given, return the INDEXed part, or undef if it
           doesn&apos;t exist.

           If an ARRAYREF to an array of parts is given, then this method sets
           the parts to a copy of that array, and returns the parts.  This can
           be used to delete parts, as follows:

               ### Delete some parts of a multipart message:
               $msg-&gt;parts([ grep { keep_part($_) } $msg-&gt;parts ]);

           Note: for multipart messages, the preamble and epilogue are not
           considered parts.  If you need them, use the &quot;preamble()&quot; and
           &quot;epilogue()&quot; methods.

           Note: there are ways of parsing with a MIME::Parser which cause
           certain message parts (such as those of type &quot;message/rfc822&quot;) to be
           &quot;reparsed&quot; into pseudo-multipart entities.  You should read the
           documentation for those options carefully: it is possible for a
           diddled entity to not be multipart, but still have parts attached to
           it!

           See &quot;bodyhandle&quot; for a discussion of parts vs. bodies.

       parts_DFS
           Instance method.  Return the list of all MIME::Entity objects
           included in the entity, starting with the entity itself, in depth-
           first-search order.  If the entity has no parts, it alone will be
           returned.

           Thanks to Xavier Armengou for suggesting this method.

       preamble [LINES]
           Instance method.  Get/set the text of the preamble, as an array of
           newline-terminated LINES.  Returns a reference to the array of lines,
           or undef if no preamble exists (e.g., if this is a single-part
           entity).

           If there is a preamble, it is output when printing this entity;
           otherwise, a default preamble is used.  Setting the preamble to undef
           (not []!) causes it to fallback to the default.

   Manipulation
       make_multipart [SUBTYPE], OPTSHASH...
           Instance method.  Force the entity to be a multipart, if it isn&apos;t
           already.  We do this by replacing the original [singlepart] entity
           with a new multipart that has the same non-MIME headers (&quot;From&quot;,
           &quot;Subject&quot;, etc.), but all-new MIME headers (&quot;Content-type&quot;, etc.).
           We then create a copy of the original singlepart, strip out the non-
           MIME headers from that, and make it a part of the new multipart.  So
           this:

               From: me
               To: you
               Content-type: text/plain
               Content-length: 12

               Hello there!

           Becomes something like this:

               From: me
               To: you
               Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;----abc----&quot;

               ------abc----
               Content-type: text/plain
               Content-length: 12

               Hello there!
               ------abc------

           The actual type of the new top-level multipart will be
           &quot;multipart/SUBTYPE&quot; (default SUBTYPE is &quot;mixed&quot;).

           Returns &apos;DONE&apos;    if we really did inflate a singlepart to a
           multipart.  Returns &apos;ALREADY&apos; (and does nothing) if entity is already
           multipart and Force was not chosen.

           If OPTSHASH contains Force=&gt;1, then we always bump the top-level&apos;s
           content and content-headers down to a subpart of this entity, even if
           this entity is already a multipart.  This is apparently of use to
           people who are tweaking messages after parsing them.

       make_singlepart
           Instance method.  If the entity is a multipart message with one part,
           this tries hard to rewrite it as a singlepart, by replacing the
           content (and content headers) of the top level with those of the
           part.  Also crunches 0-part multiparts into singleparts.

           Returns &apos;DONE&apos;    if we really did collapse a multipart to a
           singlepart.  Returns &apos;ALREADY&apos; (and does nothing) if entity is
           already a singlepart.  Returns &apos;0&apos;       (and does nothing) if it
           can&apos;t be made into a singlepart.

       purge
           Instance method.  Recursively purge (e.g., unlink) all external
           (e.g., on-disk) body parts in this message.  See MIME::Body::purge()
           for details.

           Note: this does not delete the directories that those body parts are
           contained in; only the actual message data files are deleted.  This
           is because some parsers may be customized to create intermediate
           directories while others are not, and it&apos;s impossible for this class
           to know what directories are safe to remove.  Only your application
           program truly knows that.

           If you really want to &quot;clean everything up&quot;, one good way is to use
           &quot;MIME::Parser::file_under()&quot;, and then do this before parsing your
           next message:

               $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;purge();

           I wouldn&apos;t attempt to read those body files after you do this, for
           obvious reasons.  As of MIME-tools 4.x, each body&apos;s path is undefined
           after this operation.  I warned you I might do this; truly I did.

           Thanks to Jason L. Tibbitts III for suggesting this method.

       remove_sig [NLINES]
           Instance method, override.  Attempts to remove a user&apos;s signature
           from the body of a message.

           It does this by looking for a line matching &quot;/^-- $/&quot; within the last
           &quot;NLINES&quot; of the message.  If found then that line and all lines after
           it will be removed. If &quot;NLINES&quot; is not given, a default value of 10
           will be used.  This would be of most use in auto-reply scripts.

           For MIME entity, this method is reasonably cautious: it will only
           attempt to un-sign a message with a content-type of &quot;text/*&quot;.

           If you send remove_sig() to a multipart entity, it will relay it to
           the first part (the others usually being the &quot;attachments&quot;).

           Warning: currently slurps the whole message-part into core as an
           array of lines, so you probably don&apos;t want to use this on extremely
           long messages.

           Returns truth on success, false on error.

       sign PARAMHASH
           Instance method, override.  Append a signature to the message.  The
           params are:

           Attach
               Instead of appending the text, add it to the message as an
               attachment.  The disposition will be &quot;inline&quot;, and the
               description will indicate that it is a signature.  The default
               behavior is to append the signature to the text of the message
               (or the text of its first part if multipart).  MIME-specific; new
               in this subclass.

           File
               Use the contents of this file as the signature.  Fatal error if
               it can&apos;t be read.  As per superclass method.

           Force
               Sign it even if the content-type isn&apos;t &quot;text/*&quot;.  Useful for non-
               standard types like &quot;x-foobar&quot;, but be careful!  MIME-specific;
               new in this subclass.

           Remove
               Normally, we attempt to strip out any existing signature.  If
               true, this gives us the NLINES parameter of the remove_sig call.
               If zero but defined, tells us not to remove any existing
               signature.  If undefined, removal is done with the default of 10
               lines.  New in this subclass.

           Signature
               Use this text as the signature.  You can supply it as either a
               scalar, or as a ref to an array of newline-terminated scalars.
               As per superclass method.

           For MIME messages, this method is reasonably cautious: it will only
           attempt to sign a message with a content-type of &quot;text/*&quot;, unless
           &quot;Force&quot; is specified.

           If you send this message to a multipart entity, it will relay it to
           the first part (the others usually being the &quot;attachments&quot;).

           Warning: currently slurps the whole message-part into core as an
           array of lines, so you probably don&apos;t want to use this on extremely
           long messages.

           Returns true on success, false otherwise.

       suggest_encoding
           Instance method.  Based on the effective content type, return a good
           suggested encoding.

           &quot;text&quot; and &quot;message&quot; types have their bodies scanned line-by-line for
           8-bit characters and long lines; lack of either means that the
           message is 7bit-ok.  Other types are chosen independent of their
           body:

               Major type:      7bit ok?    Suggested encoding:
               -----------------------------------------------------------
               text             yes         7bit
               text             no          quoted-printable
               message          yes         7bit
               message          no          binary
               multipart        *           binary (in case some parts are bad)
               image, etc...    *           base64

       sync_headers OPTIONS
           Instance method.  This method does a variety of activities which
           ensure that the MIME headers of an entity &quot;tree&quot; are in-synch with
           the body parts they describe.  It can be as expensive an operation as
           printing if it involves pre-encoding the body parts; however, the aim
           is to produce fairly clean MIME.  You will usually only need to
           invoke this if processing and re-sending MIME from an outside source.

           The OPTIONS is a hash, which describes what is to be done.

           Length
               One of the &quot;official unofficial&quot; MIME fields is &quot;Content-Length&quot;.
               Normally, one doesn&apos;t care a whit about this field; however, if
               you are preparing output destined for HTTP, you may.  The value
               of this option dictates what will be done:

               COMPUTE means to set a &quot;Content-Length&quot; field for every non-
               multipart part in the entity, and to blank that field out for
               every multipart part in the entity.

               ERASE means that &quot;Content-Length&quot; fields will all be blanked out.
               This is fast, painless, and safe.

               Any false value (the default) means to take no action.

           Nonstandard
               Any header field beginning with &quot;Content-&quot; is, according to the
               RFC, a MIME field.  However, some are non-standard, and may cause
               problems with certain MIME readers which interpret them in
               different ways.

               ERASE means that all such fields will be blanked out.  This is
               done before the Length option (q.v.) is examined and acted upon.

               Any false value (the default) means to take no action.

           Returns a true value if everything went okay, a false value
           otherwise.

       tidy_body
           Instance method, override.  Currently unimplemented for MIME
           messages.  Does nothing, returns false.

   Output
       dump_skeleton [FILEHANDLE]
           Instance method.  Dump the skeleton of the entity to the given
           FILEHANDLE, or to the currently-selected one if none given.

           Each entity is output with an appropriate indentation level, the
           following selection of attributes:

               Content-type: multipart/mixed
               Effective-type: multipart/mixed
               Body-file: NONE
               Subject: Hey there!
               Num-parts: 2

           This is really just useful for debugging purposes; I make no
           guarantees about the consistency of the output format over time.

       print [OUTSTREAM]
           Instance method, override.  Print the entity to the given OUTSTREAM,
           or to the currently-selected filehandle if none given.  OUTSTREAM can
           be a filehandle, or any object that reponds to a print() message.

           The entity is output as a valid MIME stream!  This means that the
           header is always output first, and the body data (if any) will be
           encoded if the header says that it should be.  For example, your
           output may look like this:

               Subject: Greetings
               Content-transfer-encoding: base64

               SGkgdGhlcmUhCkJ5ZSB0aGVyZSEK

           If this entity has MIME type &quot;multipart/*&quot;, the preamble, parts, and
           epilogue are all output with appropriate boundaries separating each.
           Any bodyhandle is ignored:
&#12;               Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;*----*&quot;
               Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

               [Preamble]
               --*----*
               [Entity: Part 0]
               --*----*
               [Entity: Part 1]
               --*----*--
               [Epilogue]

           If this entity has a single-part MIME type with no attached parts,
           then we&apos;re looking at a normal singlepart entity: the body is output
           according to the encoding specified by the header.  If no body
           exists, a warning is output and the body is treated as empty:

               Content-type: image/gif
               Content-transfer-encoding: base64

               [Encoded body]

           If this entity has a single-part MIME type but it also has parts,
           then we&apos;re probably looking at a &quot;re-parsed&quot; singlepart, usually one
           of type &quot;message/*&quot; (you can get entities like this if you set the
           &quot;parse_nested_messages(NEST)&quot; option on the parser to true).  In this
           case, the parts are output with single blank lines separating each,
           and any bodyhandle is ignored:

               Content-type: message/rfc822
               Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

               [Entity: Part 0]

               [Entity: Part 1]

           In all cases, when outputting a &quot;part&quot; of the entity, this method is
           invoked recursively.

           Note: the output is very likely not going to be identical to any
           input you parsed to get this entity.  If you&apos;re building some sort of
           email handler, it&apos;s up to you to save this information.

       print_body [OUTSTREAM]
           Instance method, override.  Print the body of the entity to the given
           OUTSTREAM, or to the currently-selected filehandle if none given.
           OUTSTREAM can be a filehandle, or any object that reponds to a
           print() message.

           The body is output for inclusion in a valid MIME stream; this means
           that the body data will be encoded if the header says that it should
           be.

           Note: by &quot;body&quot;, we mean &quot;the stuff following the header&quot;.  A printed
           multipart body includes the printed representations of its subparts.

           Note: The body is stored in an un-encoded form; however, the idea is
           that the transfer encoding is used to determine how it should be
           output.  This means that the &quot;print()&quot; method is always guaranteed to
           get you a sendmail-ready stream whose body is consistent with its
           head.  If you want the raw body data to be output, you can either
           read it from the bodyhandle yourself, or use:

               $ent-&gt;bodyhandle-&gt;print($outstream);

           which uses read() calls to extract the information, and thus will
           work with both text and binary bodies.

           Warning: Please supply an OUTSTREAM.  This override method differs
           from Mail::Internet&apos;s behavior, which outputs to the STDOUT if no
           filehandle is given: this may lead to confusion.

       print_header [OUTSTREAM]
           Instance method, inherited.  Output the header to the given
           OUTSTREAM.  You really should supply the OUTSTREAM.

       stringify
           Instance method.  Return the entity as a string, exactly as &quot;print&quot;
           would print it.  The body will be encoded as necessary, and will
           contain any subparts.  You can also use &quot;as_string()&quot;.

       stringify_body
           Instance method.  Return the encoded message body as a string,
           exactly as &quot;print_body&quot; would print it.  You can also use
           &quot;body_as_string()&quot;.

           If you want the unencoded body, and you are dealing with a singlepart
           message (like a &quot;text/plain&quot;), use &quot;bodyhandle()&quot; instead:

               if ($ent-&gt;bodyhandle) {
                   $unencoded_data = $ent-&gt;bodyhandle-&gt;as_string;
               }
               else {
                   ### this message has no body data (but it might have parts!)
               }

       stringify_header
           Instance method.  Return the header as a string, exactly as
           &quot;print_header&quot; would print it.  You can also use
           &quot;header_as_string()&quot;.

NOTES
   Under the hood
       A MIME::Entity is composed of the following elements:

       &#183;   A head, which is a reference to a MIME::Head object containing the
           header information.

       &#183;   A bodyhandle, which is a reference to a MIME::Body object containing
           the decoded body data.  This is only defined if the message is a
           &quot;singlepart&quot; type:

               application/*
               audio/*
               image/*
               text/*
               video/*

       &#183;   An array of parts, where each part is a MIME::Entity object.  The
           number of parts will only be nonzero if the content-type is not one
           of the &quot;singlepart&quot; types:

               message/*        (should have exactly one part)
               multipart/*      (should have one or more parts)

   The &quot;two-body problem&quot;
       MIME::Entity and Mail::Internet see message bodies differently, and this
       can cause confusion and some inconvenience.  Sadly, I can&apos;t change the
       behavior of MIME::Entity without breaking lots of code already out there.
       But let&apos;s open up the floor for a few questions...

       What is the difference between a &quot;message&quot; and an &quot;entity&quot;?
           A message is the actual data being sent or received; usually this
           means a stream of newline-terminated lines.  An entity is the
           representation of a message as an object.

           This means that you get a &quot;message&quot; when you print an &quot;entity&quot; to a
           filehandle, and you get an &quot;entity&quot; when you parse a message from a
           filehandle.

       What is a message body?
           Mail::Internet: The portion of the printed message after the header.

           MIME::Entity: The portion of the printed message after the header.

       How is a message body stored in an entity?
           Mail::Internet: As an array of lines.

           MIME::Entity: It depends on the content-type of the message.  For
           &quot;container&quot; types (&quot;multipart/*&quot;, &quot;message/*&quot;), we store the
           contained entities as an array of &quot;parts&quot;, accessed via the &quot;parts()&quot;
           method, where each part is a complete MIME::Entity.  For &quot;singlepart&quot;
           types (&quot;text/*&quot;, &quot;image/*&quot;, etc.), the unencoded body data is
           referenced via a MIME::Body object, accessed via the &quot;bodyhandle()&quot;
           method:

                                 bodyhandle()   parts()
               Content-type:     returns:       returns:
               ------------------------------------------------------------
               application/*     MIME::Body     empty
               audio/*           MIME::Body     empty
               image/*           MIME::Body     empty
               message/*         undef          MIME::Entity list (usually 1)
               multipart/*       undef          MIME::Entity list (usually &gt;0)
               text/*            MIME::Body     empty
               video/*           MIME::Body     empty
               x-*/*             MIME::Body     empty

           As a special case, &quot;message/*&quot; is currently ambiguous: depending on
           the parser, a &quot;message/*&quot; might be treated as a singlepart, with a
           MIME::Body and no parts.  Use bodyhandle() as the final arbiter.

       What does the body() method return?
           Mail::Internet: As an array of lines, ready for sending.

           MIME::Entity: As an array of lines, ready for sending.

       What&apos;s the best way to get at the body data?
           Mail::Internet: Use the body() method.

           MIME::Entity: Depends on what you want... the encoded data (as it is
           transported), or the unencoded data?  Keep reading...

       How do I get the &quot;encoded&quot; body data?
           Mail::Internet: Use the body() method.

           MIME::Entity: Use the body() method.  You can also use:

               $entity-&gt;print_body()
               $entity-&gt;stringify_body()   ### a.k.a. $entity-&gt;body_as_string()

       How do I get the &quot;unencoded&quot; body data?
           Mail::Internet: Use the body() method.

           MIME::Entity: Use the bodyhandle() method!  If bodyhandle() method
           returns true, then that value is a MIME::Body which can be used to
           access the data via its open() method.  If bodyhandle() method
           returns an undefined value, then the entity is probably a &quot;container&quot;
           that has no real body data of its own (e.g., a &quot;multipart&quot; message):
           in this case, you should access the components via the parts()
           method.  Like this:

               if ($bh = $entity-&gt;bodyhandle) {
                   $io = $bh-&gt;open;
                   ...access unencoded data via $io-&gt;getline or $io-&gt;read...
                   $io-&gt;close;
               }
               else {
                   foreach my $part (@parts) {
                       ...do something with the part...
                   }
               }

           You can also use:

               if ($bh = $entity-&gt;bodyhandle) {
                   $unencoded_data = $bh-&gt;as_string;
               }
               else {
                   ...do stuff with the parts...
               }

       What does the body() method return?
           Mail::Internet: The transport-encoded message body, as an array of
           lines.

           MIME::Entity: The transport-encoded message body, as an array of
           lines.

       What does print_body() print?
           Mail::Internet: Exactly what body() would return to you.

           MIME::Entity: Exactly what body() would return to you.

       Say I have an entity which might be either singlepart or multipart. How
       do I print out just &quot;the stuff after the header&quot;?
           Mail::Internet: Use print_body().

           MIME::Entity: Use print_body().

       Why is MIME::Entity so different from Mail::Internet?
           Because MIME streams are expected to have non-textual data...
           possibly, quite a lot of it, such as a tar file.

           Because MIME messages can consist of multiple parts, which are most-
           easily manipulated as MIME::Entity objects themselves.

           Because in the simpler world of Mail::Internet, the data of a message
           and its printed representation are identical... and in the MIME
           world, they&apos;re not.

           Because parsing multipart bodies on-the-fly, or formatting multipart
           bodies for output, is a non-trivial task.

       This is confusing.  Can the two classes be made more compatible?
           Not easily; their implementations are necessarily quite different.
           Mail::Internet is a simple, efficient way of dealing with a &quot;black
           box&quot; mail message... one whose internal data you don&apos;t care much
           about.  MIME::Entity, in contrast, cares very much about the message
           contents: that&apos;s its job!

   Design issues
       Some things just can&apos;t be ignored
           In multipart messages, the &quot;preamble&quot; is the portion that precedes
           the first encapsulation boundary, and the &quot;epilogue&quot; is the portion
           that follows the last encapsulation boundary.

           According to RFC 2046:

               There appears to be room for additional information prior
               to the first encapsulation boundary and following the final
               boundary.  These areas should generally be left blank, and
               implementations must ignore anything that appears before the
               first boundary or after the last one.

               NOTE: These &quot;preamble&quot; and &quot;epilogue&quot; areas are generally
               not used because of the lack of proper typing of these parts
               and the lack of clear semantics for handling these areas at
               gateways, particularly X.400 gateways.  However, rather than
               leaving the preamble area blank, many MIME implementations
               have found this to be a convenient place to insert an
               explanatory note for recipients who read the message with
               pre-MIME software, since such notes will be ignored by
               MIME-compliant software.

           In the world of standards-and-practices, that&apos;s the standard.  Now
           for the practice:

           Some &quot;MIME&quot; mailers may incorrectly put a &quot;part&quot; in the preamble.
           Since we have to parse over the stuff anyway, in the future I may
           allow the parser option of creating special MIME::Entity objects for
           the preamble and epilogue, with bogus MIME::Head objects.

           For now, though, we&apos;re MIME-compliant, so I probably won&apos;t change how
           we work.
