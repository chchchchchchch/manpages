NAME
       MIME::Parser::Reader - a line-oriented reader for a MIME::Parser

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used internally by MIME::Parser; you probably don&apos;t need
       to be looking at it at all.  But just in case...

           ### Create a top-level reader, where chunks end at EOF:
           $rdr = MIME::Parser::Reader-&gt;new();

           ### Spawn a child reader, where chunks also end at a boundary:
           $subrdr = $rdr-&gt;spawn-&gt;add_boundary($bound);

           ### Spawn a child reader, where chunks also end at a given string:
           $subrdr = $rdr-&gt;spawn-&gt;add_terminator($string);

           ### Read until boundary or terminator:
           $subrdr-&gt;read_chunk($in, $out);

DESCRIPTION
       A line-oriented reader which can deal with virtual end-of-stream defined
       by a collection of boundaries.

       Warning: this is a private class solely for use by MIME::Parser.  This
       class has no official public interface
