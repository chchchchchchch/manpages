NAME
       MIME::Parser::Results - results of the last entity parsed

SYNOPSIS
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Parser to make sure that you
       understand where this module fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go
       on, do it now.  I&apos;ll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

          ### Do parse, get results:
          my $entity = eval { $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN); };
          my $results  = $parser-&gt;results;

          ### Get all messages logged:
          @msgs = $results-&gt;msgs;

          ### Get messages of specific types (also tests if there were problems):
          $had_errors   = $results-&gt;errors;
          $had_warnings = $results-&gt;warnings;

          ### Get outermost header:
          $top_head  = $results-&gt;top_head;
