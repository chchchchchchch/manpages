NAME
       MP3::Info - Manipulate / fetch info from MP3 audio files

SYNOPSIS
               #!perl -w
               use MP3::Info;
               my $file = &apos;Pearls_Before_Swine.mp3&apos;;
               set_mp3tag($file, &apos;Pearls Before Swine&apos;, q&quot;77&apos;s&quot;,
                       &apos;Sticks and Stones&apos;, &apos;1990&apos;,
                       q&quot;(c) 1990 77&apos;s LTD.&quot;, &apos;rock &amp; roll&apos;);

               my $tag = get_mp3tag($file) or die &quot;No TAG info&quot;;
               $tag-&gt;{GENRE} = &apos;rock&apos;;
               set_mp3tag($file, $tag);

               my $info = get_mp3info($file);
               printf &quot;$file length is %d:%d\n&quot;, $info-&gt;{MM}, $info-&gt;{SS};

               my $mp3 = new MP3::Info $file;
               $mp3-&gt;title(&apos;Perls Before Swine&apos;);
               printf &quot;$file length is %s, title is %s\n&quot;,
                       $mp3-&gt;time, $mp3-&gt;title;

DESCRIPTION
       $mp3 = MP3::Info-&gt;new(FILE)
           OOP interface to the rest of the module.  The same keys available via
           get_mp3info and get_mp3tag are available via the returned object
           (using upper case or lower case; but note that all-caps &quot;VERSION&quot;
           will return the module version, not the MP3 version).

           Passing a value to one of the methods will set the value for that tag
           in the MP3 file, if applicable.

       use_mp3_utf8([STATUS])
           Tells MP3::Info to (or not) return TAG info in UTF-8.  TRUE is 1,
           FALSE is 0.  Default is TRUE, if available.

           Will only be able to turn it on if Encode is available.  ID3v2 tags
           will be converted to UTF-8 according to the encoding specified in
           each tag; ID3v1 tags will be assumed Latin-1 and converted to UTF-8.

           Function returns status (TRUE/FALSE).  If no argument is supplied, or
           an unaccepted argument is supplied, function merely returns status.

           This function is not exported by default, but may be exported with
           the &quot;:utf8&quot; or &quot;:all&quot; export tag.

       use_winamp_genres()
           Puts WinAmp genres into @mp3_genres and %mp3_genres (adds 68
           additional genres to the default list of 80).  This is a separate
           function because these are non-standard genres, but they are included
           because they are widely used.

           You can import the data structures with one of:

                   use MP3::Info qw(:genres);
                   use MP3::Info qw(:DEFAULT :genres);
                   use MP3::Info qw(:all);

       remove_mp3tag (FILE [, VERSION, BUFFER])
           Can remove ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags.  VERSION should be 1 for ID3v1 (the
           default), 2 for ID3v2, and &quot;ALL&quot; for both.

           For ID3v1, removes last 128 bytes from file if those last 128 bytes
           begin with the text &apos;TAG&apos;.  File will be 128 bytes shorter.

           For ID3v2, removes ID3v2 tag.  Because an ID3v2 tag is at the
           beginning of the file, we rewrite the file after removing the tag
           data.  The buffer for rewriting the file is 4MB.  BUFFER (in bytes)
           ca change the buffer size.

           Returns the number of bytes removed, or -1 if no tag removed, or
           undef if there is an error.

       set_mp3tag (FILE, TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE [,
       TRACKNUM])
       set_mp3tag (FILE, $HASHREF)
           Adds/changes tag information in an MP3 audio file.  Will clobber any
           existing information in file.

           Fields are TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE.  All fields
           have a 30-byte limit, except for YEAR, which has a four-byte limit,
           and GENRE, which is one byte in the file.  The GENRE passed in the
           function is a case-insensitive text string representing a genre found
           in @mp3_genres.

           Will accept either a list of values, or a hashref of the type
           returned by &quot;get_mp3tag&quot;.

           If TRACKNUM is present (for ID3v1.1), then the COMMENT field can only
           be 28 bytes.

           ID3v2 support may come eventually.  Note that if you set a tag on a
           file with ID3v2, the set tag will be for ID3v1[.1] only, and if you
           call &quot;get_mp3tag&quot; on the file, it will show you the (unchanged) ID3v2
           tags, unless you specify ID3v1.

       get_mp3tag (FILE [, VERSION, RAW_V2, APE2])
           Returns hash reference containing tag information in MP3 file.  The
           keys returned are the same as those supplied for &quot;set_mp3tag&quot;, except
           in the case of RAW_V2 being set.

           If VERSION is 1, the information is taken from the ID3v1 tag (if
           present).  If VERSION is 2, the information is taken from the ID3v2
           tag (if present).  If VERSION is not supplied, or is false, the ID3v1
           tag is read if present, and then, if present, the ID3v2 tag
           information will override any existing ID3v1 tag info.

           If RAW_V2 is 1, the raw ID3v2 tag data is returned, without any
           manipulation of text encoding.  The key name is the same as the frame
           ID (ID to name mappings are in the global %v2_tag_names).

           If RAW_V2 is 2, the ID3v2 tag data is returned, manipulating for
           Unicode if necessary, etc.  It also takes multiple values for a given
           key (such as comments) and puts them in an arrayref.

           If APE is 1, an APE tag will be located before all other tags.

           If the ID3v2 version is older than ID3v2.2.0 or newer than ID3v2.4.0,
           it will not be read.

           Strings returned will be in Latin-1, unless UTF-8 is specified
           (use_mp3_utf8), (unless RAW_V2 is 1).

           Also returns a TAGVERSION key, containing the ID3 version used for
           the returned data (if TAGVERSION argument is 0, may contain two
           versions).
&#12;       get_mp3info (FILE)
           Returns hash reference containing file information for MP3 file.
           This data cannot be changed.  Returned data:

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If you find a bug, please send me a patch (see the project page in &quot;SEE
       ALSO&quot;).  If you cannot figure out why it does not work for you, please
       put the MP3 file in a place where I can get it (preferably via FTP, or
       HTTP, or .Mac iDisk) and send me mail regarding where I can get the file,
       with a detailed description of the problem.

       If I download the file, after debugging the problem I will not keep the
       MP3 file if it is not legal for me to have it.  Just let me know if it is
       legal for me to keep it or not.

TODO
       ID3v2 Support
           Still need to do more for reading tags, such as using Compress::Zlib
           to decompress compressed tags.  But until I see this in use more, I
           won&apos;t bother.  If something does not work properly with reading,
           follow the instructions above for troubleshooting.

           ID3v2 writing is coming soon.

       Get data from scalar
           Instead of passing a file spec or filehandle, pass the data itself.
           Would take some work, converting the seeks, etc.

       Padding bit ?
           Do something with padding bit.

       Test suite
           Test suite could use a bit of an overhaul and update.  Patches very
           welcome.

           &#183;   Revamp getset.t.  Test all the various get_mp3tag args.

           &#183;   Test Unicode.

           &#183;   Test OOP API.
&#12;           &#183;   Test error handling, check more for missing files, bad MP3s, etc.

       Other VBR
           Right now, only Xing VBR is supported.
