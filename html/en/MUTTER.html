NAME
       MUTTER - Clutter based compositing GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       mutter [--display=DISPLAY] [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID] [--sm-disable]
       [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly mutter.

       mutter is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users  and  is
       designed  to  integrate  well  with the GNOME desktop.  mutter lacks some
       features that may be expected by  traditional  UNIX  or  other  technical
       users;  these  users  may want to investigate other available window man&#8208;
       agers for use with GNOME or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced  by  mutter.   Users
              are  encouraged  to change the GNOME window manager by running the
              new WM with the --replace or  -replace  option,  and  subsequently
              saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       mutter  configuration can be found under Preferences-&gt;Windows and Prefer&#8208;
       ences-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts on the menu-panel. Advanced  configuration  can
       be achieved directly through gsettings.
