Mail::Address(3pm)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    Mail::Address(3pm)



NAME
       Mail::Address - Parse mail addresses

SYNOPSIS
        use Mail::Address;
        my @addrs = Mail::Address-&gt;parse($line);

        foreach $addr (@addrs) {
            print $addr-&gt;format,&quot;\n&quot;;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Mail::Address&quot; extracts and manipulates email addresses from a message
       header.  It cannot be used to extract addresses from some random text.
       You can use this module to create RFC822 compliant fields.

       Although &quot;Mail::Address&quot; is a very popular subject for books, and is used
       in many applications, it does a very poor job on the more complex message
       fields.  It does only handle simple address formats (which covers about
       95% of what can be found). Problems are with

       &#183;   no support for address groups, even not with the semi-colon as
           separator between addresses;

       &#183;   limitted support for escapes in phrases and comments.  There are
           cases where it can get wrong; and

       &#183;   you have to take care of most escaping when you create an address
           yourself: &quot;Mail::Address&quot; does not do that for you.

       Often requests are made to the maintainers of this code improve this
       situation, but this is not a good idea, where it will break zillions of
       existing applications.  If you wish for a fully RFC2822 compliant
       implementation you may take a look at Mail::Message::Field::Full, part of
       MailBox.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Address-&gt;new(PHRASE, ADDRESS, [ COMMENT ])
           Create a new &quot;Mail::Address&quot; object which represents an address with
           the elements given. In a message these 3 elements would be seen like:

            PHRASE &lt;ADDRESS&gt; (COMMENT)
            ADDRESS (COMMENT)

           example:

            Mail::Address-&gt;new(&quot;Perl5 Porters&quot;, &quot;perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com&quot;);

       $obj-&gt;parse(LINE)
           Parse the given line a return a list of extracted &quot;Mail::Address&quot;
           objects.  The line would normally be one taken from a To,Cc or Bcc
           line in a message

           example:

            my @addr = Mail::Address-&gt;parse($line);

   Accessors
       $obj-&gt;address()
           Return the address part of the object.
&#12;       $obj-&gt;comment()
           Return the comment part of the object

       $obj-&gt;format([ADDRESSes])
           Return a string representing the address in a suitable form to be
           placed on a &quot;To&quot;, &quot;Cc&quot;, or &quot;Bcc&quot; line of a message.  This method is
           called on the first ADDRESS to be used; other specified ADDRESSes
           will be appended, separated with commas.

       $obj-&gt;phrase()
           Return the phrase part of the object.

   Smart accessors
       $obj-&gt;host()
           Return the address excluding the user id and &apos;@&apos;

       $obj-&gt;name()
           Using the information contained within the object attempt to identify
           what the person or groups name is.

       $obj-&gt;user()
           Return the address excluding the &apos;@&apos; and the mail domain
