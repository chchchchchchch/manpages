Mail::Field(3pm)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      Mail::Field(3pm)



NAME
       Mail::Field - Base class for manipulation of mail header fields

INHERITANCE
        Mail::Field is extended by
          Mail::Field::AddrList
          Mail::Field::Date
          Mail::Field::Generic

SYNOPSIS
        use Mail::Field;

        my $field = Mail::Field-&gt;new(&apos;Subject&apos;, &apos;some subject text&apos;);
        my $field = Mail::Field-&gt;new(Subject =&gt; &apos;some subject text&apos;);
        print $field-&gt;tag,&quot;: &quot;,$field-&gt;stringify,&quot;\n&quot;;

        my $field = Mail::Field-&gt;subject(&apos;some subject text&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Mail::Field&quot; creates and manipulates fields in MIME headers, collected
       within a Mail::Header object.  Different field types have their own sub-
       class (extension), defining additional useful accessors to the field
       content.

       People are invited to merge their implementation to special fields into
       MailTools, to maintain a consistent set of packages and documentation.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Field (and it&apos;s sub-classes) define several methods which return
       new objects. These can all be categorized as constructor.

       Mail::Field-&gt;combine(FIELDS)
           Take a LIST of &quot;Mail::Field&quot; objects (which should all be of the same
           sub-class) and create a new object in that same class.

       Mail::Field-&gt;extract(TAG, HEAD [, INDEX ])
           Takes as arguments the tag name, a &quot;Mail::Head&quot; object and optionally
           an index.

           If the index argument is given then &quot;extract&quot; will retrieve the given
           tag from the &quot;Mail::Head&quot; object and create a new &quot;Mail::Field&quot; based
           object.  undef will be returned in the field does not exist.

           If the index argument is not given the the result depends on the
           context in which &quot;extract&quot; is called. If called in a scalar context
           the result will be as if &quot;extract&quot; was called with an index value of
           zero. If called in an array context then all tags will be retrieved
           and a list of &quot;Mail::Field&quot; objects will be returned.

       Mail::Field-&gt;new(TAG [, STRING | OPTIONS])
           Create an object in the class which defines the field specified by
           the TAG argument.

   &quot;Fake&quot; constructors
       $obj-&gt;create(OPTIONS)
           This constructor is used internally with preprocessed field
           information.  When called on an existing object, its original content
           will get replaced.

       $obj-&gt;parse()
           Parse a field line.
&#12;   Accessors
       $obj-&gt;set(OPTIONS)
           Change the settings (the content, but then smart) of this field.

       $obj-&gt;stringify()
           Returns the field as a string.

       $obj-&gt;tag()
       Mail::Field-&gt;tag()
           Return the tag (in the correct case) for this item.  Well, actually
           any casing is OK, because the field tags are treated case-
           insentitive; however people have some preferences.

   Smart accessors
       $obj-&gt;text([STRING])
           Without arguments, the field is returned as stringify() does.
           Otherwise, the STRING is parsed with parse() to replace the object&apos;s
           content.

           It is more clear to call either stringify() or parse() directly,
           because this method does not add additional processing.

DETAILS
   SUB-CLASS PACKAGE NAMES
       All sub-classes should be called Mail::Field::name where name is derived
       from the tag using these rules.

       &#183;   Consider a tag as being made up of elements separated by &apos;-&apos;

       &#183;   Convert all characters to lowercase except the first in each element,
           which should be uppercase.

       &#183;   name is then created from these elements by using the first N
           characters from each element.

       &#183;   N is calculated by using the formula :-

               int((7 + #elements) / #elements)

       &#183;   name is then limited to a maximum of 8 characters, keeping the first
           8 characters.

       For an example of this take a look at the definition of the
       &quot;_header_pkg_name()&quot; subroutine in &quot;Mail::Field&quot;

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: Undefined subroutine &lt;method&gt; called
           Mail::Field objects use autoloading to compile new functionality.
           Apparently, the mehod called is not implemented for the specific
           class of the field object.
