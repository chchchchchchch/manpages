NAME
       Mail::Filter - Filter mail through multiple subroutines

SYNOPSIS
        use Mail::Filter;

        my $filter = Mail::Filter-&gt;new( \&amp;filter1, \&amp;filter2 );

        my $mail   = Mail::Internet-&gt;new( [&lt;&gt;] );
        my $mail   = $filter-&gt;filter($mail);

        my $folder = Mail::Folder-&gt;new( .... );
        my $filter-&gt;filter($folder);

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Mail::Filter&quot; provides an interface to filtering Email through multiple
       subroutines.

       &quot;Mail::Filter&quot; filters mail by calling each filter subroutine in turn.
       Each filter subroutine is called with two arguments, the first is the
       filter object and the second is the mail or folder object being filtered.

       The result from each filter sub is passed to the next filter as the mail
       object. If a filter subroutine returns undef, then &quot;Mail::Filter&quot; will
       abort and return immediately.

       The function returns the result from the last subroutine to operate on
       the mail object.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Filter-&gt;new([FILTER [, ... ]])
           Create a new &quot;Mail::Filter&quot; object with the given filter subroutines.
           Each filter may be either a code reference or the name of a method to
           call on the &lt;Mail::Filter&gt; object.

   Accessors
       $obj-&gt;add(FILTER [, FILTER ...])
           Add the given filters to the end of the fliter list.

   Processing
       $obj-&gt;filter(MAIL-OBJECT | MAIL-FOLDER)
           If the first argument is a &quot;Mail::Internet&quot; object, then this object
           will be passed through the filter list. If the first argument is a
           &quot;Mail::Folder&quot; object, then each message in turn will be passed
           through the filter list.

       $obj-&gt;folder()
           While the &quot;filter&quot; method is called with a &quot;Mail::Folder&quot; object,
           these filter subroutines can call this method to obtain the folder
           object that is being processed.

       $obj-&gt;msgnum()
           If the &quot;filter&quot; method is called with a &quot;Mail::Folder&quot; object, then
           the filter subroutines may call this method to obtain the message
           number of the message that is being processed.
