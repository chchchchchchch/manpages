NAME
       Mail::Internet - manipulate email messages

SYNOPSIS
         use Mail::Internet;
         my $msg = Mail::Internet-&gt;new(\*STDIN);

DESCRIPTION
       This package implements reading, creating, manipulating, and writing
       email messages.  Sometimes, the implementation tries to be too smart, but
       in the general case it works as expected.

       If you start writing a new application, you should use the Mail::Box
       distribution, which has more features and handles messages much better
       according to the RFCs.  See &lt;http://perl.overmeer.net/mailbox/&gt;.  You may
       also chose MIME::Entity, to get at least some multipart support in your
       application.

METHODS
   Constructors
       $obj-&gt;dup()
           Duplicate the message as a whole.  Both header and body will be deep-
           copied: a new Mail::Internet object is returned.

       $obj-&gt;extract(ARRAY-of-LINES)
           Extract header and body from an ARRAY of message lines.  Requires an
           object already created with new(), which contents will get
           overwritten.

       $obj-&gt;new([ARG], [OPTIONS])
       Mail::Internet-&gt;new([ARG], [OPTIONS])
           ARG is optional and may be either a file descriptor (reference to a
           GLOB) or a reference to an array. If given the new object will be
           initialized with headers and body either from the array of read from
           the file descriptor.

           The Mail::Header::new() OPTIONS &quot;Modify&quot;, &quot;MailFrom&quot; and &quot;FoldLength&quot;
           may also be given.

            -Option--Default
             Body    []
             Header  undef

           Body =&gt; ARRAY-of-LINES
             The value of this option should be a reference to an array which
             contains the lines for the body of the message. Each line should be
             terminated with &quot;\n&quot; (LF). If Body is given then &quot;Mail::Internet&quot;
             will not attempt to read the body from &quot;ARG&quot; (even if it is
             specified).

           Header =&gt; Mail::Header
             The value of this option should be a Mail::Header object. If given
             then &quot;Mail::Internet&quot; will not attempt to read a mail header from
             &quot;ARG&quot;, if it was specified.

       $obj-&gt;read(FILEHANDLE)
           Read a message from the FILEHANDLE into an already existing message
           object.  Better use new() with the FILEHANDLE as first argument.

   Accessors
       $obj-&gt;body([BODY])
           Returns the body of the message. This is a reference to an array.
           Each entry in the array represents a single line in the message.

           If BODY is given, it can be a reference to an array or an array, then
           the body will be replaced. If a reference is passed, it is used
           directly and not copied, so any subsequent changes to the array will
           change the contents of the body.

       $obj-&gt;head()
           Returns the &quot;Mail::Header&quot; object which holds the headers for the
           current message

   Processing the message as a whole
       $obj-&gt;as_mbox_string([ALREADY_ESCAPED])
           Returns the message as a string in mbox format.  &quot;ALREADY_ESCAPED&quot;,
           if given and true, indicates that escape_from() has already been
           called on this object.

       $obj-&gt;as_string()
           Returns the message as a single string.

       $obj-&gt;print([FILEHANDLE])
           Print the header, body or whole message to file descriptor
           FILEHANDLE.  $fd should be a reference to a GLOB. If FILEHANDLE is
           not given the output will be sent to STDOUT.

           example:

               $mail-&gt;print( \*STDOUT );  # Print message to STDOUT

       $obj-&gt;print_body([FILEHANDLE])
           Print only the body to the FILEHANDLE (default STDOUT).

       $obj-&gt;print_header([FILEHANDLE])
           Print only the header to the FILEHANDLE (default STDOUT).

   Processing the header
       Most of these methods are simply wrappers around methods provided by
       Mail::Header.

       $obj-&gt;add(PAIRS-of-FIELD)
           The PAIRS are field-name and field-content.  For each PAIR,
           Mail::Header::add() is called.  All fields are added after existing
           fields.  The last addition is returned.

       $obj-&gt;combine(TAG, [WITH])
           See Mail::Header::combine().

       $obj-&gt;delete(TAG, [TAGs])
           Delete all fields with the name TAG.  Mail::Header::delete() is doing
           the work.

       $obj-&gt;fold([LENGTH])
           See Mail::Header::fold().

       $obj-&gt;fold_length([TAG], [LENGTH])
           See Mail::Header::fold_length().

       $obj-&gt;get(TAG, [TAGs])
           In LIST context, all fields with the name TAG are returned.  In
           SCALAR context, only the first field which matches the earliest TAG
           is returned.  Mail::Header::get() is called to collect the data.

       $obj-&gt;header([ARRAY-of-LINES])
           See Mail::Header::header().

       $obj-&gt;replace(PAIRS-of-FIELD)
           The PAIRS are field-name and field-content.  For each PAIR,
           Mail::Header::replace() is called with INDEX 0. If a FIELD is already
           in the header, it will be removed first.  Do not specified the same
           field-name twice.

   Processing the body
       $obj-&gt;remove_sig([NLINES])
           Attempts to remove a users signature from the body of a message. It
           does this by looking for a line equal to &apos;-- &apos; within the last
           &quot;NLINES&quot; of the message. If found then that line and all lines after
           it will be removed. If &quot;NLINES&quot; is not given a default value of 10
           will be used. This would be of most use in auto-reply scripts.

       $obj-&gt;sign(OPTIONS)
           Add your signature to the body.  remove_sig() will strip existing
           signatures first.

            -Option   --Default
             File       undef
             Signature  []

           File =&gt; FILEHANDLE
             Take from the FILEHANDLE all lines starting from the first &quot;--&quot;.

           Signature =&gt; STRING|ARRAY-of-LINES
       $obj-&gt;tidy_body()
           Removes all leading and trailing lines from the body that only
           contain white spaces.

   High-level functionality
       $obj-&gt;escape_from()
           It can cause problems with some applications if a message contains a
           line starting with `From &apos;, in particular when attempting to split a
           folder.  This method inserts a leading &quot;`&quot;&apos;&gt; on anyline that matches
           the regular expression &quot;/^&quot;*From/&gt;

       $obj-&gt;nntppost([OPTIONS])
           Post an article via NNTP.  Requires Net::NNTP to be installed.

            -Option--Default
             Debug   &lt;false&gt;
             Host    &lt;required&gt;
             Port    119

           Debug =&gt; BOOLEAN

           Port =&gt; INTEGER
             Port number to connect to on remote host

       $obj-&gt;reply(OPTIONS)
           Create a new object with header initialised for a reply to the
           current object. And the body will be a copy of the current message
           indented.

           The &quot;.mailhdr&quot; file in your home directory (if exists) will be read
           first, to provide defaults.

            -Option  --Default
             Exclude   []
             Indent    &apos;&gt;&apos;
             Keep      []

           Exclude =&gt; ARRAY-of-FIELDS
             Remove the listed FIELDS from the produced message.
&#12;           Indent =&gt; STRING
             Use as indentation string.  The string may contain &quot;%%&quot; to get a
             single &quot;%&quot;, %f to get the first from name, %F is the first
             character of %f, %l is the last name, %L its first character, %n
             the whole from string, and %I the first character of each of the
             names in the from string.

           Keep =&gt; ARRAY-of-FIELDS
             Copy the listed FIELDS from the original message.

           ReplyAll =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Automatically include all To and Cc addresses of the original mail,
             excluding those mentioned in the Bcc list.

       $obj-&gt;send([TYPE, [ARGS...]])
           Send a Mail::Internet message using Mail::Mailer.  TYPE and ARGS are
           passed on to Mail::Mailer::new().

       $obj-&gt;smtpsend([OPTIONS])
           Send a Mail::Internet message using direct SMTP.  to the given
           ADDRESSES, each can be either a string or a reference to a list of
           email addresses. If none of &quot;To&quot;, &lt;Cc&gt; or &quot;Bcc&quot; are given then the
           addresses are extracted from the message being sent.

           The return value will be a list of email addresses that the message
           was sent to. If the message was not sent the list will be empty.

           Requires Net::SMTP and Net::Domain to be installed.

            -Option  --Default
             Bcc       undef

             Hello     localhost.localdomain
             Host      $ENV{SMTPHOSTS}
             MailFrom  Mail::Util::mailaddress()
             Port      25
             To        undef

           Bcc =&gt; ADDRESSES
           Cc =&gt; ADDRESSES
           Debug =&gt; BOOLEAN

             Name of the SMTP server to connect to, or a Net::SMTP object to use

             If &quot;Host&quot; is not given then the SMTP host is found by attempting
             connections first to hosts specified in $ENV{SMTPHOSTS}, a colon
             separated list, then &quot;mailhost&quot; and &quot;localhost&quot;.

           MailFrom =&gt; ADDRESS
             The e-mail address which is used as sender.  By default,
