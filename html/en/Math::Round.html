Round(3pm)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            Round(3pm)



NAME
       Math::Round - Perl extension for rounding numbers

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Round qw(...those desired... or :all);

         $rounded = round($scalar);
         @rounded = round(LIST...);
         $rounded = nearest($target, $scalar);
         @rounded = nearest($target, LIST...);

         # and other functions as described below

DESCRIPTION
       Math::Round supplies functions that will round numbers in different ways.
       The functions round and nearest are exported by default; others are
       available as described below.  &quot;use ... qw(:all)&quot; exports all functions.

FUNCTIONS
       round LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
         returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
         Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded &quot;to infin&#8208;
         ity&quot;; i.e., positive values are rounded up (e.g., 2.5 becomes 3) and
         negative values down (e.g., -2.5 becomes -3).

       round_even LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
         returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
         Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded to the near&#8208;
         est even number; e.g., 2.5 becomes 2, 3.5 becomes 4, and -2.5 becomes
         -2.

       round_odd LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
         returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
         Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded to the near&#8208;
         est odd number; e.g., 3.5 becomes 3, 4.5 becomes 5, and -3.5 becomes
         -3.

       round_rand LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
         returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
         Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded up or down in
         a random fashion.  For example, in a large number of trials, 2.5 will
         become 2 half the time and 3 half the time.

       nearest TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TAR&#8208;
         GET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in
         list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded to infinity.  For
         example:

           nearest(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest(10, 46)            50
           nearest(10, 45)            50
           nearest(25, 328)          325
           nearest(.1, 4.567)          4.6
           nearest(10, -45)          -50

       nearest_ceil TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TAR&#8208;
         GET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in
         list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded to the ceiling,
         i.e. the next algebraically higher multiple.  For example:

           nearest_ceil(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest_ceil(10, 45)            50
           nearest_ceil(10, -45)          -40

       nearest_floor TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TAR&#8208;
         GET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in
         list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded to the floor, i.e.
         the next algebraically lower multiple.  For example:

           nearest_floor(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest_floor(10, 45)            40
           nearest_floor(10, -45)          -50

       nearest_rand TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TAR&#8208;
         GET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in
         list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded up or down in a
         random fashion.  For example, in a large number of trials, &quot;nearest(10,
         45)&quot; will yield 40 half the time and 50 half the time.

       nlowmult TARGET, LIST
         Returns the next lower multiple of the number(s) in LIST.  TARGET must
         be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in list con&#8208;
         text, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between two multiples
         of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of LIST that
         are algebraically lower. For example:

           nlowmult(10, 44)    yields  40
           nlowmult(10, 46)            40
           nlowmult(25, 328)          325
           nlowmult(.1, 4.567)          4.5
           nlowmult(10, -41)          -50

       nhimult TARGET, LIST
         Returns the next higher multiple of the number(s) in LIST.  TARGET must
         be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in list con&#8208;
         text, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between two multiples
         of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of LIST that
         are algebraically higher. For example:

           nhimult(10, 44)    yields  50
           nhimult(10, 46)            50
           nhimult(25, 328)          350
           nhimult(.1, 4.512)          4.6
           nhimult(10, -49)          -40

STANDARD FLOATING-POINT DISCLAIMER
       Floating-point numbers are, of course, a rational subset of the real num&#8208;
       bers, so calculations with them are not always exact.  In order to avoid
       surprises because of this, these routines use a value for one-half that
       is very slightly larger than 0.5.  Nevertheless, if the numbers to be
       rounded are stored as floating-point, they will be subject, as usual, to
       the mercies of your hardware, your C compiler, etc.  Thus, numbers that
       are supposed to be halfway between two others may be stored in a slightly
       different way and thus behave surprisingly.
