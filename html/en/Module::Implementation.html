NAME
       Module::Implementation - Loads one of several alternate underlying
       implementations for a module

VERSION
       version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
         package Foo::Bar;

         use Module::Implementation;

         BEGIN {
             my $loader = Module::Implementation::build_loader_sub(
                 implementations =&gt; [ &apos;XS&apos;,  &apos;PurePerl&apos; ],
                 symbols         =&gt; [ &apos;run&apos;, &apos;check&apos; ],
             );

             $loader-&gt;();
         }

         package Consumer;

         # loads the first viable implementation
         use Foo::Bar;

DESCRIPTION
       This module abstracts out the process of choosing one of several
       underlying implementations for a module. This can be used to provide XS
       and pure Perl implementations of a module, or it could be used to load an
       implementation for a given OS or any other case of needing to provide
       multiple implementations.

       This module is only useful when you know all the implementations ahead of
       time. If you want to load arbitrary implementations then you probably
       want something like a plugin system, not this module.

API
       This module provides two subroutines, neither of which are exported.

   Module::Implementation::&lt;build_loader_sub(...)
       This subroutine takes the following arguments.

       &#183;   implementations

           This should be an array reference of implementation names. Each name
           should correspond to a module in the caller&apos;s namespace.

           In other words, using the example in the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;, this module will
           look for the &quot;Foo::Bar::XS&quot; and &quot;Foo::Bar::PurePerl&quot; modules will be
           installed

           This argument is required.

       &#183;   symbols

           A list of symbols to copy from the implementation package to the
           calling package.

           These can be prefixed with a variable type: &quot;$&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, or
           &quot;*)&quot;. If no prefix is given, the symbol is assumed to be a
           subroutine.

           This argument is optional.

       This subroutine returns the implementation loader as a sub reference.

       It is up to you to call this loader sub in your code.

       I recommend that you do not call this loader in an &quot;import()&quot; sub. If a
       caller explicitly requests no imports, your &quot;import()&quot; sub will not be
       run at all, which can cause weird breakage.

   Module::Implementation::implementation_for($package)
       Given a package name, this subroutine returns the implementation that was
       loaded for the package. This is not a full package name, just the suffix
       that identifies the implementation. For the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; example, this
       subroutine would be called as
       &quot;Module::Implementation::implementation_for(&apos;Foo::Bar&apos;)&quot;, and it would
       return &quot;XS&quot; or &quot;PurePerl&quot;.

HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION LOADER WORKS
       The implementation loader works like this ...

       First, it checks for an %ENV var specifying the implementation to load.
       The env var is based on the package name which loads the implementations.
       The &quot;::&quot; package separator is replaced with &quot;_&quot;, and made entirely upper-
       case. Finally, we append &quot;_IMPLEMENTATION&quot; to this name.

       So in our &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; example, the corresponding %ENV key would be
       &quot;FOO_BAR_IMPLEMENTATION&quot;.

       If this is set, then the loader will only try to load this one
       implementation.

       If the env var requests an implementation which doesn&apos;t match one of the
       implementations specified when the loader was created, an error is
       thrown.

       If this one implementation fails to load then loader throws an error.
       This is useful for testing. You can request a specific implementation in
       a test file by writing something like this:

         BEGIN { $ENV{FOO_BAR_IMPLEMENTATION} = &apos;XS&apos; }
         use Foo::Bar;

       If the environment variable is not set, then the loader simply tries the
       implementations originally passed to &quot;Module::Implementation&quot;. The
       implementations are tried in the order in which they were originally
       passed.

       The loader will use the first implementation that loads without an error.
       It will copy any requested symbols from this implementation.

       If none of the implementations can be loaded, then the loader throws an
       exception.

       The loader returns the name of the package it loaded.
