               if(is_module_spec(&quot;Standard::Prefix&quot;, $spec)) { ...
               check_module_spec(&quot;Standard::Prefix&quot;, $spec);

               $module_name =
                       compose_module_name(&quot;Standard::Prefix&quot;, $spec);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl
       modules, which are normally handled at compile time.  This module avoids
       using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
       infrastructure.

       The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same
       syntax that is used for barewords in Perl source.  In principle this
       syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and this module applies the
       syntax of the Perl on which it is running.  In practice the usable syntax
       hasn&apos;t changed yet, but there&apos;s a good chance of it changing in Perl
       5.18.

       The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include
       workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding &quot;require&quot;.  These
       workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except
       for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in
       pure Perl.

   Module name syntax
       The usable module name syntax has not changed from Perl 5.000 up to Perl
       5.15.7.  The syntax is composed entirely of ASCII characters.  From Perl
       5.6 onwards there has been some attempt to allow the use of non-ASCII
       Unicode characters in Perl source, but it was fundamentally broken (like
       the entirety of Perl 5.6&apos;s Unicode handling) and remained pretty much
       entirely unusable until it got some attention in the Perl 5.15 series.
       Although Unicode is now consistently accepted by the parser in some
       places, it remains broken for module names.  Furthermore, there has not
       yet been any work on how to map Unicode module names into filenames, so
       in that respect also Unicode module names are unusable.  This may finally
       be addressed in the Perl 5.17 series.

       The module name syntax is, precisely: the string must consist of one or
       more segments separated by &quot;::&quot;; each segment must consist of one or more
       identifier characters (ASCII alphanumerics plus &quot;_&quot;); the first character
       of the string must not be a digit.  Thus &quot;&quot;IO::File&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;warnings&quot;&quot;, and
       &quot;&quot;foo::123::x_0&quot;&quot; are all valid module names, whereas &quot;&quot;IO::&quot;&quot; and
       &quot;&quot;1foo::bar&quot;&quot; are not.  &quot;&apos;&quot; separators are not permitted by this module,
       though they remain usable in Perl source, being translated to &quot;::&quot; in the
       parser.

   Core bugs worked around
       The first bug worked around is core bug [perl #68590], which causes
       lexical state in one file to leak into another that is &quot;require&quot;d/&quot;use&quot;d
       from it.  This bug is present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, and is fixed
       in Perl 5.11.0.  From Perl 5.9.4 up to Perl 5.10.0 no satisfactory
       workaround is possible in pure Perl.  The workaround means that modules
       loaded via this module don&apos;t suffer this pollution of their lexical
       state.  Modules loaded in other ways, or via this module on the Perl
       versions where the pure Perl workaround is impossible, remain vulnerable.
       The module Lexical::SealRequireHints provides a complete workaround for
       this bug.

       The second bug worked around causes some kinds of failure in module
       loading, principally compilation errors in the loaded module, to be
       recorded in %INC as if they were successful, so later attempts to load
       the same module immediately indicate success.  This bug is present up to
       Perl 5.8.9, and is fixed in Perl 5.9.0.  The workaround means that a
       compilation error in a module loaded via this module won&apos;t be cached as a
       success.  Modules loaded in other ways remain liable to produce bogus
       %INC entries, and if a bogus entry exists then it will mislead this
       module if it is used to re-attempt loading.

       The third bug worked around causes the wrong context to be seen at file
       scope of a loaded module, if &quot;require&quot; is invoked in a location that
       inherits context from a higher scope.  This bug is present up to Perl
       5.11.2, and is fixed in Perl 5.11.3.  The workaround means that a module
       loaded via this module will always see the correct context.  Modules
       loaded in other ways remain vulnerable.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       These regular expressions do not include any anchors, so to check whether
       an entire string matches a syntax item you must supply the anchors
       yourself.

       $module_name_rx
           Matches a valid Perl module name in bareword syntax.

       $top_module_spec_rx
           Matches a module specification for use with &quot;compose_module_name&quot;,
           where no prefix is being used.

       $sub_module_spec_rx
           Matches a module specification for use with &quot;compose_module_name&quot;,
           where a prefix is being used.

FUNCTIONS
   Basic module handling
       is_module_name(ARG)
           Returns a truth value indicating whether ARG is a plain string
           satisfying Perl module name syntax as described for
           &quot;$module_name_rx&quot;.
&#12;       is_valid_module_name(ARG)
           Deprecated alias for &quot;is_module_name&quot;.

       check_module_name(ARG)
           Check whether ARG is a plain string satisfying Perl module name
           syntax as described for &quot;$module_name_rx&quot;.  Return normally if it is,
           or &quot;die&quot; if it is not.

       module_notional_filename(NAME)
           Generates a notional relative filename for a module, which is used in
           some Perl core interfaces.  The NAME is a string, which should be a
           valid module name (one or more &quot;::&quot;-separated segments).  If it is
           not a valid name, the function &quot;die&quot;s.

           The notional filename for the named module is generated and returned.
           This filename is always in Unix style, with &quot;/&quot; directory separators
           and a &quot;.pm&quot; suffix.  This kind of filename can be used as an argument
           to &quot;require&quot;, and is the key that appears in %INC to identify a
           module, regardless of actual local filename syntax.

       require_module(NAME)
           This is essentially the bareword form of &quot;require&quot;, in runtime form.
           The NAME is a string, which should be a valid module name (one or
           more &quot;::&quot;-separated segments).  If it is not a valid name, the
           function &quot;die&quot;s.

           The module specified by NAME is loaded, if it hasn&apos;t been already, in
           the manner of the bareword form of &quot;require&quot;.  That means that a
           search through @INC is performed, and a byte-compiled form of the
           module will be used if available.

           The return value is as for &quot;require&quot;.  That is, it is the value
           returned by the module itself if the module is loaded anew, or 1 if
           the module was already loaded.

   Structured module use
       use_module(NAME[, VERSION])
           This is essentially &quot;use&quot; in runtime form, but without the importing
           feature (which is fundamentally a compile-time thing).  The NAME is
           handled just like in &quot;require_module&quot; above: it must be a module
           name, and the named module is loaded as if by the bareword form of
           &quot;require&quot;.

           If a VERSION is specified, the &quot;VERSION&quot; method of the loaded module
           is called with the specified VERSION as an argument.  This normally
           serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the version
           required.  This is the same functionality provided by the VERSION
           parameter of &quot;use&quot;.

           On success, the name of the module is returned.  This is unlike
           &quot;require_module&quot;, and is done so that the entire call to &quot;use_module&quot;
           can be used as a class name to call a constructor, as in the example
           in the synopsis.

       use_package_optimistically(NAME[, VERSION])
           This is an analogue of &quot;use_module&quot; for the situation where there is
           uncertainty as to whether a package/class is defined in its own
           module or by some other means.  It attempts to arrange for the named
           package to be available, either by loading a module or by doing
           nothing and hoping.

           An attempt is made to load the named module (as if by the bareword
           form of &quot;require&quot;).  If the module cannot be found then it is assumed
           that the package was actually already loaded by other means, and no
           error is signalled.  That&apos;s the optimistic bit.
&#12;           This is mostly the same operation that is performed by the base
           pragma to ensure that the specified base classes are available.  The
           behaviour of base was simplified in version 2.18, and this function
           changed to match.

           If a VERSION is specified, the &quot;VERSION&quot; method of the loaded package
           is called with the specified VERSION as an argument.  This normally
           serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the version
           required.  On success, the name of the package is returned.  These
           aspects of the function work just like &quot;use_module&quot;.

   Module name composition
       is_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
           Returns a truth value indicating whether SPEC is valid input for
           &quot;compose_module_name&quot;.  See below for what that entails.  Whether a
           PREFIX is supplied affects the validity of SPEC, but the exact value
           of the prefix is unimportant, so this function treats PREFIX as a
           truth value.

       is_valid_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
           Deprecated alias for &quot;is_module_spec&quot;.

       check_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
           Check whether SPEC is valid input for &quot;compose_module_name&quot;.  Return
           normally if it is, or &quot;die&quot; if it is not.

       compose_module_name(PREFIX, SPEC)
           This function is intended to make it more convenient for a user to
           specify a Perl module name at runtime.  Users have greater need for
           abbreviations and context-sensitivity than programmers, and Perl
           module names get a little unwieldy.  SPEC is what the user specifies,
           and this function translates it into a module name in standard form,
           which it returns.

           SPEC has syntax approximately that of a standard module name: it
           should consist of one or more name segments, each of which consists
           of one or more identifier characters.  However, &quot;/&quot; is permitted as a
           separator, in addition to the standard &quot;::&quot;.  The two separators are
           entirely interchangeable.

           Additionally, if PREFIX is not &quot;undef&quot; then it must be a module name
           in standard form, and it is prefixed to the user-specified name.  The
           user can inhibit the prefix addition by starting SPEC with a
           separator (either &quot;/&quot; or &quot;::&quot;).
