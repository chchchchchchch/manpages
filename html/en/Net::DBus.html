NAME
       Net::DBus - Perl extension for the DBus message system

SYNOPSIS
         ####### Attaching to the bus ###########

         use Net::DBus;

         # Find the most appropriate bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;

         # ... or explicitly go for the session bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;session;

         # .... or explicitly go for the system bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;system


         ######## Accessing remote services #########

         # Get a handle to the HAL service
         my $hal = $bus-&gt;get_service(&quot;org.freedesktop.Hal&quot;);

         # Get the device manager
         my $manager = $hal-&gt;get_object(&quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager&quot;,
                                        &quot;org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager&quot;);

         # List devices
         foreach my $dev (@{$manager-&gt;GetAllDevices}) {
             print $dev, &quot;\n&quot;;
         }


         ######### Providing services ##############

         # Register a service known as &apos;org.example.Jukebox&apos;
         my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service(&quot;org.example.Jukebox&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       Net::DBus provides a Perl API for the DBus message system.  The DBus Perl
       interface is currently operating against the 0.32 development version of
       DBus, but should work with later versions too, providing the API changes
       have not been too drastic.

       Users of this package are either typically, service providers in which
       case the Net::DBus::Service and Net::DBus::Object modules are of most
       relevance, or are client consumers, in which case
       Net::DBus::RemoteService and Net::DBus::RemoteObject are of most
       relevance.

METHODS
       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find(%params);
           Search for the most appropriate bus to connect to and return a
           connection to it. The heuristic used for the search is

             - If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to &apos;session&apos; attach
               to the session bus

             - Else If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to &apos;system&apos; attach
               to the system bus

             - Else If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set attach to the
               session bus

             - Else attach to the system bus

           The optional &quot;params&quot; hash can contain be used to specify connection
           options. The only support option at this time is &quot;nomainloop&quot; which
           prevents the bus from being automatically attached to the main
           Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;system(%params);
           Return a handle for the system message bus. Note that the system
           message bus is locked down by default, so unless appropriate access
           control rules are added in /etc/dbus/system.d/, an application may
           access services, but won&apos;t be able to export services.  The optional
           &quot;params&quot; hash can contain be used to specify connection options. The
           only support option at this time is &quot;nomainloop&quot; which prevents the
           bus from being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor
           event loop.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;session(%params);
           Return a handle for the session message bus.  The optional &quot;params&quot;
           hash can contain be used to specify connection options. The only
           support option at this time is &quot;nomainloop&quot; which prevents the bus
           from being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor
           event loop.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;test(%params);
           Returns a handle for a virtual bus for use in unit tests. This bus
           does not make any network connections, but rather has an in-memory
           message pipeline. Consult Net::DBus::Test::MockConnection for further
           details of how to use this special bus.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;new($address, %params);
           Return a connection to a specific message bus.  The $address
           parameter must contain the address of the message bus to connect to.
           An example address for a session bus might look like
           &quot;unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-PBFyyuUiVb,guid=191e0a43c3efc222e0818be556d67500&quot;,
           while one for a system bus would look like
           &quot;unix:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket&quot;.  The optional &quot;params&quot; hash
           can contain be used to specify connection options. The only support
           option at this time is &quot;nomainloop&quot; which prevents the bus from being
           automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

       my $connection = $bus-&gt;get_connection;
           Return a handle to the underlying, low level connection object
           associated with this bus. The returned object will be an instance of
           the Net::DBus::Binding::Bus class. This method is not intended for
           use by (most!) application developers, so if you don&apos;t understand
           what this is for, then you don&apos;t need to be calling it!

       my $service = $bus-&gt;get_service($name);
           Retrieves a handle for the remote service identified by the service
           name $name. The returned object will be an instance of the
           Net::DBus::RemoteService class.

       my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service($name);
           Registers a service with the bus, returning a handle to the service.
           The returned object is an instance of the Net::DBus::Service class.

       my $object = $bus-&gt;get_bus_object;
           Retrieves a handle to the bus object, &quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus&quot;,
           provided by the service &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;. The returned object
           is an instance of Net::DBus::RemoteObject

       my $name = $bus-&gt;get_unique_name;
           Retrieves the unique name of this client&apos;s connection to the bus.
&#12;       my $name = $bus-&gt;get_service_owner($service);
           Retrieves the unique name of the client on the bus owning the service
           named by the $service parameter.

DATA TYPING METHODS
       These methods are not usually used, since most services provide
       introspection data to inform clients of their data typing requirements.
       If introspection data is incomplete, however, it may be necessary for a
       client to mark values with specific data types. In such a case, the
       following methods can be used. They are not, however, exported by default
       so must be requested at import time by specifying &apos;use Net::DBus
       qw(:typing)&apos;

       $typed_value = dbus_int16($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint16($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int32($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint32($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_double($value);
           Mark a value as being a double precision IEEE floating point.

       $typed_value = dbus_byte($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, byte.

       $typed_value = dbus_string($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string. This is not usually required
           since &apos;string&apos; is the default data type for any Perl scalar value.

       $typed_value = dbus_signature($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid type
           signature

       $typed_value = dbus_object_path($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid
           object path.

       $typed_value = dbus_boolean($value);
           Mark a value as being an boolean

       $typed_value = dbus_array($value);
           Mark a value as being an array

       $typed_value = dbus_struct($value);
           Mark a value as being a structure

       $typed_value = dbus_dict($value);
           Mark a value as being a dictionary

       $typed_value = dbus_variant($value);
           Mark a value as being a variant
