NAME
       Net::DBus::ASyncReply - asynchronous method reply handler

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Annotation qw(:call);

         my $object = $service-&gt;get_object(&quot;/org/example/systemMonitor&quot;);

         # List processes &amp; get on with other work until
         # the list is returned.
         my $asyncreply = $object-&gt;list_processes(dbus_call_async, &quot;someuser&quot;);

         while (!$asyncreply-&gt;is_ready) {
           ... do some background work..
         }

         my $processes = $asyncreply-&gt;get_result;

DESCRIPTION
       This object provides a handler for receiving asynchronous method replies.
       An asynchronous reply object is generated when making remote method call
       with the &quot;dbus_call_async&quot; annotation set.

METHODS
       $asyncreply-&gt;discard_result;
           Indicates that the caller is no longer interested in recieving the
           reply &amp; that it should be discarded. After calling this method, this
           object should not be used again.

       $asyncreply-&gt;wait_for_result;
           Blocks the caller waiting for completion of the of the asynchronous
           reply. Upon returning from this method, the result can be obtained
           with the &quot;get_result&quot; method.

       my $boolean = $asyncreply-&gt;is_ready;
           Returns a true value if the asynchronous reply is now complete (or a
           timeout has occurred). When this method returns true, the result can
           be obtained with the &quot;get_result&quot; method.

       $asyncreply-&gt;set_notify($coderef);
           Sets a notify function which will be invoked when the asynchronous
           reply finally completes. The callback will be invoked with a single
           parameter which is this object.

       my @data = $asyncreply-&gt;get_result;
           Retrieves the data associated with the asynchronous reply.  If a
           timeout occurred, then this method will throw an exception. This
           method can only be called once the reply is complete, as indicated by
           the &quot;is_ready&quot; method returning a true value. After calling this
           method, this object should no longer be used.
