NAME
       Net::DBus::Annotation - annotations for changing behaviour of APIs

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Annotation qw(:call);

         my $object = $service-&gt;get_object(&quot;/org/example/systemMonitor&quot;);

         # Block until processes are listed
         my $processes = $object-&gt;list_processes(&quot;someuser&quot;);

         # Just throw away list of processes, pretty pointless
         # in this example, but useful if the method doesn&apos;t have
         # a return value
         $object-&gt;list_processes(dbus_call_noreply, &quot;someuser&quot;);

         # List processes &amp; get on with other work until
         # the list is returned.
         my $asyncreply = $object-&gt;list_processes(dbus_call_async, &quot;someuser&quot;);

         ... some time later...
         my $processes = $asyncreply-&gt;get_data;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a number of annotations which will be useful when
       dealing with the DBus APIs. There are annotations for switching remote
       calls between sync, async and no-reply mode. More annotations may be
       added over time.

METHODS
       dbus_call_sync
           Requests that a method call be performed synchronously, waiting for
           the reply or error return to be received before continuing.

       dbus_call_async
           Requests that a method call be performed a-synchronously, returning a
           pending call object, which will collect the reply when it eventually
           arrives.

       dbus_call_noreply
           Requests that a method call be performed a-synchronously, discarding
           any possible reply or error message.
