NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Bus - Handle to a well-known message bus instance

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Binding::Bus;

         # Get a handle to the system bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus::Binding::Bus-&gt;new(type =&gt; &amp;Net::DBus::Binding::Bus::SYSTEM);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a specialization of the Net::DBus::Binding::Connection module
       providing convenience constructor for connecting to one of the well-known
       bus types. There is no reason to use this module directly, instead get a
       handle to the bus with the &quot;session&quot; or &quot;system&quot; methods in Net::DBus.

METHODS
       my $bus = Net::DBus::Binding::Bus-&gt;new(type =&gt; $type);
       my $bus = Net::DBus::Binding::Bus-&gt;new(address =&gt; $addr);
           Open a connection to a message bus, either a well known bus type
           specified using the &quot;type&quot; parameter, or an arbitrary bus specified
           using the &quot;address&quot; parameter. If the &quot;private&quot; parameter is set to a
           true value, then a private connection to the bus is obtained.  The
           caller must explicitly disconnect this bus instance before releasing
           the last instance of the object.

       $bus-&gt;request_name($service_name)
           Send a request to the bus registering the well known name specified
           in the $service_name parameter. If another client already owns the
           name, registration will be queued up, pending the exit of the other
           client.

       my $name = $bus-&gt;get_unique_name
           Returns the unique name by which this processes&apos; connection to the
           bus is known. Unique names are never re-used for the entire lifetime
           of the bus daemon.

       $bus-&gt;add_match($rule)
           Register a signal match rule with the bus controller, allowing
           matching broadcast signals to routed to this client.

       $bus-&gt;remove_match($rule)
           Unregister a signal match rule with the bus controller, preventing
           further broadcast signals being routed to this client
