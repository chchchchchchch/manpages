NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Connection - A connection between client and server

SYNOPSIS
       Creating a connection to a server and sending a message

         use Net::DBus::Binding::Connection;

         my $con = Net::DBus::Binding::Connection-&gt;new(address =&gt; &quot;unix:path=/path/to/socket&quot;);

         $con-&gt;send($message);

       Registering message handlers

         sub handle_something {
             my $con = shift;
             my $msg = shift;

             ... do something with the message...
         }

         $con-&gt;register_message_handler(
           &quot;/some/object/path&quot;,
           \&amp;handle_something);

       Hooking up to an event loop:

         my $reactor = Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor-&gt;new();

         $reactor-&gt;manage($con);

         $reactor-&gt;run();

DESCRIPTION
       An outgoing connection to a server, or an incoming connection from a
       client. The methods defined on this module have a close correspondance to
       the dbus_connection_XXX methods in the C API, so for further details on
       their behaviour, the C API documentation may be of use.

METHODS
       my $con = Net::DBus::Binding::Connection-&gt;new(address =&gt;
       &quot;unix:path=/path/to/socket&quot;);
           Creates a new connection to the remove server specified by the
           parameter &quot;address&quot;. If the &quot;private&quot; parameter is supplied, and set
           to a True value the connection opened is private; otherwise a shared
           connection is opened. A private connection must be explicitly
           shutdown with the &quot;disconnect&quot; method before the last reference to
           the object is released.  A shared connection must never be explicitly
           disconnected.

       $status = $con-&gt;is_connected();
           Returns zero if the connection has been disconnected, otherwise a
           positive value is returned.

       $status = $con-&gt;is_authenticated();
           Returns zero if the connection has not yet successfully completed
           authentication, otherwise a positive value is returned.

       $con-&gt;disconnect()
           Closes this connection to the remote host. This method is called
           automatically during garbage collection (ie in the DESTROY method) if
           the programmer forgets to explicitly disconnect.

       $con-&gt;flush()
           Blocks execution until all data in the outgoing data stream has been
           sent. This method will not re-enter the application event loop.

       $con-&gt;send($message)
           Queues a message up for sending to the remote host.  The data will be
           sent asynchronously as the applications event loop determines there
           is space in the outgoing socket send buffer. To force immediate
           sending of the data, follow this method will a call to &quot;flush&quot;. This
           method will return the serial number of the message, which can be
           used to identify a subsequent reply (if any).

       my $reply = $con-&gt;send_with_reply_and_block($msg, $timeout);
           Queues a message up for sending to the remote host and blocks until
           it has been sent, and a corresponding reply received. The return
           value of this method will be a
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodReturn&quot; or
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Error&quot; object.

       my $pending_call = $con-&gt;send_with_reply($msg, $timeout);
           Queues a message up for sending to the remote host and returns
           immediately providing a reference to a
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall&quot; object. This object can be used to
           wait / watch for a reply. This allows methods to be processed
           asynchronously.

       $con-&gt;dispatch;
           Dispatches any pending messages in the incoming queue to their
           message handlers. This method is typically called on each iteration
           of the main application event loop where data has been read from the
           incoming socket.

       $message = $con-&gt;borrow_message
           Temporarily removes the first message from the incoming message
           queue. No other thread may access the message while it is &apos;borrowed&apos;,
           so it should be replaced in the queue with the &quot;return_message&quot;
           method, or removed permanently with th &quot;steal_message&quot; method as soon
           as is practical.

       $con-&gt;return_message($msg)
           Replaces a previously borrowed message in the incoming message queue
           for subsequent dispatch to registered message handlers.

       $con-&gt;steal_message($msg)
           Permanently remove a borrowed message from the incoming message
           queue. No registered message handlers will now be run for this
           message.

       $msg = $con-&gt;pop_message();
           Permanently removes the first message on the incoming message queue,
           without running any registered message handlers. If you have hooked
           the connection up to an event loop (&quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor&quot; for
           example), you probably don&apos;t want to be calling this method.

       $con-&gt;set_watch_callbacks(\&amp;add_watch, \&amp;remove_watch, \&amp;toggle_watch);
           Register a set of callbacks for adding, removing &amp; updating watches
           in the application&apos;s event loop. Each parameter should be a code
           reference, which on each invocation, will be supplied with two
           parameters, the connection object and the watch object. If you are
           using a &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor&quot; object as the application event
           loop, then the &apos;manage&apos; method on that object will call this on your
           behalf.

       $con-&gt;set_timeout_callbacks(\&amp;add_timeout, \&amp;remove_timeout,
       \&amp;toggle_timeout);
           Register a set of callbacks for adding, removing &amp; updating timeouts
           in the application&apos;s event loop. Each parameter should be a code
           reference, which on each invocation, will be supplied with two
           parameters, the connection object and the timeout object. If you are
           using a &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor&quot; object as the application event
           loop, then the &apos;manage&apos; method on that object will call this on your
           behalf.

       $con-&gt;register_object_path($path, \&amp;handler)
           Registers a handler for messages whose path matches that specified in
           the $path parameter. The supplied code reference will be invoked with
           two parameters, the connection object on which the message was
           received, and the message to be processed (an instance of the
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message&quot; class).

       $con-&gt;unregister_object_path($path)
           Unregisters the handler associated with the object path $path. The
           handler would previously have been registered with the
           &quot;register_object_path&quot; or &quot;register_fallback&quot; methods.

       $con-&gt;register_fallback($path, \&amp;handler)
           Registers a handler for messages whose path starts with the prefix
           specified in the $path parameter. The supplied code reference will be
           invoked with two parameters, the connection object on which the
           message was received, and the message to be processed (an instance of
           the &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message&quot; class).

       $con-&gt;set_max_message_size($bytes)
           Sets the maximum allowable size of a single incoming message.
           Messages over this size will be rejected prior to exceeding this
           threshold. The message size is specified in bytes.

       $bytes = $con-&gt;get_max_message_size();
           Retrieves the maximum allowable incoming message size. The returned
           size is measured in bytes.

       $con-&gt;set_max_received_size($bytes)
           Sets the maximum size of the incoming message queue.  Once this
           threashold is exceeded, no more messages will be read from wire
           before one or more of the existing messages are dispatched to their
           registered handlers.  The implication is that the message queue can
           exceed this threshold by at most the size of a single message.

       $bytes $con-&gt;get_max_received_size()
           Retrieves the maximum incoming message queue size.  The returned size
           is measured in bytes.

       $con-&gt;add_filter($coderef);
           Adds a filter to the connection which will be invoked whenever a
           message is received. The $coderef should be a reference to a
           subroutine, which returns a true value if the message should be
           filtered out, or a false value if the normal message dispatch should
           be performed.

       my $msg = $con-&gt;make_raw_message($rawmsg)
           Creates a new message, initializing it from the low level C message
           object provided by the $rawmsg parameter. The returned object will be
           cast to the appropriate subclass of Net::DBus::Binding::Message.

       my $msg = $con-&gt;make_error_message( replyto =&gt; $method_call, name =&gt;
       $name, description =&gt; $description);
           Creates a new message, representing an error which occurred during
           the handling of the method call object passed in as the &quot;replyto&quot;
           parameter. The &quot;name&quot; parameter is the formal name of the error
           condition, while the &quot;description&quot; is a short piece of text giving
           more specific information on the error.

       my $call = $con-&gt;make_method_call_message( $service_name, $object_path,
       $interface, $method_name);
           Create a message representing a call on the object located at the
           path $object_path within the client owning the well-known name given
           by $service_name. The method to be invoked has the name $method_name
           within the interface specified by the $interface parameter.

       my $msg = $con-&gt;make_method_return_message( replyto =&gt; $method_call);
           Create a message representing a reply to the method call passed in
           the &quot;replyto&quot; parameter.

       my $signal = $con-&gt;make_signal_message( object_path =&gt; $path, interface
       =&gt; $interface, signal_name =&gt; $name);
           Creates a new message, representing a signal [to be] emitted by the
           object located under the path given by the &quot;object_path&quot; parameter.
           The name of the signal is given by the &quot;signal_name&quot; parameter, and
           is scoped to the interface given by the &quot;interface&quot; parameter.
