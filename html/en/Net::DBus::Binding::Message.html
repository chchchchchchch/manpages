NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message - Base class for messages

SYNOPSIS
       Sending a message

         my $msg = new Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal;
         my $iterator = $msg-&gt;iterator;

         $iterator-&gt;append_byte(132);
         $iterator-&gt;append_int32(14241);

         $connection-&gt;send($msg);

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a base class for the different kinds of message that can be
       sent/received. Instances of this class are never instantiated directly,
       rather one of the four sub-types Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal,
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall,
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodReturn,
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Error should be used.

           path data type.

       TYPE_UINT64
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the
           unsigned 64 bit integer data type.

           data type.

METHODS
       my $msg = Net::DBus::Binding::Message-&gt;new(message =&gt; $rawmessage);
           Creates a new message object, initializing it with the underlying C
           message object given by the &quot;message&quot; object. This constructor is
           intended for internal use only, instead refer to one of the four sub-
           types for this class for specific message types

       my $type = $msg-&gt;get_type
           Retrieves the type code for this message. The returned value
           corresponds to one of the four
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MESSAGE_TYPE_*&quot; constants.

       my $interface = $msg-&gt;get_interface
           Retrieves the name of the interface targetted by this message,
           possibly an empty string if there is no applicable interface for this
           message.

       my $path = $msg-&gt;get_path
           Retrieves the object path associated with the message, possibly an
           empty string if there is no applicable object for this message.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_destination
           Retrieves the uniqe or well-known bus name for client intended to be
           the recipient of the message. Possibly returns an empty string if the
           message is being broadcast to all clients.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_sender
           Retireves the unique name of the client sending the message

       my $serial = $msg-&gt;get_serial
           Retrieves the unique serial number of this message. The number is
           guarenteed unique for as long as the connection over which the
           message was sent remains open. May return zero, if the message is yet
           to be sent.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_member
           For method calls, retrieves the name of the method to be invoked,
           while for signals, retrieves the name of the signal.

       my $sig = $msg-&gt;get_signature
           Retrieves a string representing the type signature of the values
           packed into the body of the message.

       $msg-&gt;set_sender($name)
           Set the name of the client sending the message. The name must be the
           unique name of the client.

       $msg-&gt;set_destination($name)
           Set the name of the intended recipient of the message. This is
           typically used for signals to switch them from broadcast to unicast.

       my $iterator = $msg-&gt;iterator;
           Retrieves an iterator which can be used for reading or writing fields
           of the message. The returned object is an instance of the
           &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Iterator&quot; class.

       $boolean = $msg-&gt;get_no_reply()
           Gets the flag indicating whether the message is expecting a reply to
           be sent.

       $msg-&gt;set_no_reply($boolean)
           Toggles the flag indicating whether the message is expecting a reply
           to be sent. All method call messages expect a reply by default. By
           toggling this flag the communication latency is reduced by removing
           the need for the client to wait

       my @values = $msg-&gt;get_args_list
           De-marshall all the values in the body of the message, using the
           message signature to identify data types. The values are returned as
           a list.

       $msg-&gt;append_args_list(@values)
           Append a set of values to the body of the message. Values will be
           encoded as either a string, list or dictionary as appropriate to
           their Perl data type. For more specific data typing needs, the
           Net::DBus::Binding::Iterator object should be used instead.
