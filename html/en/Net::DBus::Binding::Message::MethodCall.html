NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall - a message encoding a method
       call

DESCRIPTION
       This module is part of the low-level DBus binding APIs, and should not be
       used by application code. No guarentees are made about APIs under the
       &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::&quot; namespace being stable across releases.

       This module provides a convenience constructor for creating a message
       representing a method call.

METHODS
       my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall-&gt;new( service_name =&gt;
       $service, object_path =&gt; $object, interface =&gt; $interface, method_name =&gt;
       $name);
           Create a message representing a call on the object located at the
           path &quot;object_path&quot; within the client owning the well-known name given
           by &quot;service_name&quot;. The method to be invoked has the name
           &quot;method_name&quot; within the interface specified by the &quot;interface&quot;
           parameter.
