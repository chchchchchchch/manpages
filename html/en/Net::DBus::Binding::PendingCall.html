NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall - A handler for pending method replies

SYNOPSIS
         my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall-&gt;new(method_call =&gt; $call,
                                                         pending_call =&gt; $reply);

         # Wait for completion
         $call-&gt;block;

         # And get the reply message
         my $msg = $call-&gt;get_reply;

DESCRIPTION
       This object is used when it is necessary to make asynchronous method
       calls. It provides the means to be notified when the reply is finally
       received.

METHODS
       my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall-&gt;new(method_call =&gt;
       $method_call, pending_call =&gt; $pending_call);
           Creates a new pending call object, with the &quot;method_call&quot; parameter
           being a reference to the &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall&quot;
           object whose reply is being waiting for. The &quot;pending_call&quot; parameter
           is a reference to the raw C pending call object.

       $call-&gt;cancel
           Cancel the pending call, causing any reply that is later received to
           be discarded.

       my $boolean = $call-&gt;get_completed
           Returns a true value if the pending call has received its reply, or a
           timeout has occurred.

       $call-&gt;block
           Block the caller until the reply is received or a timeout occurrs.

       my $msg = $call-&gt;get_reply;
           Retrieves the &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Message&quot; object associated with
           the complete call.

       $call-&gt;set_notify($coderef);
           Sets a notification function to be invoked when the pending call
           completes. The callback will be passed a single argument which is
           this pending call object.
