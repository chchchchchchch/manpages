NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Server - A server to accept incoming connections

SYNOPSIS
       Creating a new server and accepting client connections

         use Net::DBus::Binding::Server;

         my $server = Net::DBus::Binding::Server-&gt;new(address =&gt; &quot;unix:path=/path/to/socket&quot;);

         $server-&gt;connection_callback(\&amp;new_connection);

         sub new_connection {
             my $connection = shift;

             .. work with new connection...
         }

       Managing the server and new connections in an event loop

         my $reactor = Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor-&gt;new();

         $reactor-&gt;manage($server);
         $reactor-&gt;run();

         sub new_connection {
             my $connection = shift;

             $reactor-&gt;manage($connection);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       A server for receiving connection from client programs.  The methods
       defined on this module have a close correspondance to the dbus_server_XXX
       methods in the C API, so for further details on their behaviour, the C
       API documentation may be of use.

METHODS
       my $server = Net::DBus::Binding::Server-&gt;new(address =&gt;
       &quot;unix:path=/path/to/socket&quot;);
           Creates a new server binding it to the socket specified by the
           &quot;address&quot; parameter.

       $status = $server-&gt;is_connected();
           Returns zero if the server has been disconnected, otherwise a
           positive value is returned.

       $server-&gt;disconnect()
           Closes this server to the remote host. This method is called
           automatically during garbage collection (ie in the DESTROY method) if
           the programmer forgets to explicitly disconnect.

       $server-&gt;set_watch_callbacks(\&amp;add_watch, \&amp;remove_watch,
       \&amp;toggle_watch);
           Register a set of callbacks for adding, removing &amp; updating watches
           in the application&apos;s event loop. Each parameter should be a code
           reference, which on each invocation, will be supplied with two
           parameters, the server object and the watch object. If you are using
           a &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor&quot; object as the application event loop,
           then the &apos;manage&apos; method on that object will call this on your
           behalf.
&#12;       $server-&gt;set_timeout_callbacks(\&amp;add_timeout, \&amp;remove_timeout,
       \&amp;toggle_timeout);
           Register a set of callbacks for adding, removing &amp; updating timeouts
           in the application&apos;s event loop. Each parameter should be a code
           reference, which on each invocation, will be supplied with two
           parameters, the server object and the timeout object. If you are
           using a &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Reactor&quot; object as the application event
           loop, then the &apos;manage&apos; method on that object will call this on your
           behalf.

       $server-&gt;set_connection_callback(\&amp;handler)
           Registers the handler to use for dealing with new incoming
           connections from clients. The code reference will be invoked each
           time a new client connects and supplied with a single parameter which
           is the &quot;Net::DBus::Binding::Connection&quot; object representing the
           client.
