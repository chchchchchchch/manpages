NAME
       Net::DBus::Callback - a callback for receiving reactor events

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Callback;

         # Assume we have a &apos;terminal&apos; object and its got a method
         # to be invoked everytime there is input on its terminal.
         #
         # To create a callback to invoke this method one might use
         my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback-&gt;new(object =&gt; $terminal,
                                           method =&gt; &quot;handle_stdio&quot;);


         # Whatever is monitoring the stdio channel, would then
         # invoke the callback, perhaps passing in a parameter with
         # some &apos;interesting&apos; data, such as number of bytes available
         $cb-&gt;invoke($nbytes)

         #... which results in a call to
         #  $terminal-&gt;handle_stdio($nbytes)

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple container for storing details about a
       callback to be invoked at a later date. It is used when registering to
       receive events from the Net::DBus::Reactor class. NB use of this module
       in application code is no longer neccessary and it remains purely for
       backwards compatability.  Instead you can simply pass a subroutine code
       reference in any place where a callback is desired.

METHODS
       my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback-&gt;new(method =&gt; $name, [args =&gt; \@args])
           Creates a new callback object, for invoking a plain old function. The
           &quot;method&quot; parameter should be the fully qualified function name to
           invoke, including the package name. The optional &quot;args&quot; parameter is
           an array reference of parameters to be pass to the callback, in
           addition to those passed into the &quot;invoke&quot; method.

       my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback-&gt;new(object =&gt; $object, method =&gt; $name,
       [args =&gt; \@args])
           Creates a new callback object, for invoking a method on an object.
           The &quot;method&quot; parameter should be the name of the method to invoke,
           while the &quot;object&quot; parameter should be a blessed object on which the
           method will be invoked. The optional &quot;args&quot; parameter is an array
           reference of parameters to be pass to the callback, in addition to
           those passed into the &quot;invoke&quot; method.

       $cb-&gt;invoke(@args)
           Invokes the callback. The argument list passed to the callback is a
           combination of the arguments supplied in the callback constructor,
           followed by the arguments supplied in the &quot;invoke&quot; method.
