NAME
       Net::DBus::Exporter - Export object methods and signals to the bus

SYNOPSIS
         # Define a new package for the object we&apos;re going
         # to export
         package Demo::HelloWorld;

         # Specify the main interface provided by our object
         use Net::DBus::Exporter qw(org.example.demo.Greeter);

         # We&apos;re going to be a DBus object
         use base qw(Net::DBus::Object);

         # Ensure only explicitly exported methods can be invoked
         dbus_strict_exports;

         # Export a &apos;Greeting&apos; signal taking a stringl string parameter
         dbus_signal(&quot;Greeting&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;]);

         # Export &apos;Hello&apos; as a method accepting a single string
         # parameter, and returning a single string value
         dbus_method(&quot;Hello&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [&quot;string&quot;]);

         # Export &apos;Goodbye&apos; as a method accepting a single string
         # parameter, and returning a single string, but put it
         # in the &apos;org.exaple.demo.Farewell&apos; interface
         dbus_method(&quot;Goodbye&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [&quot;string&quot;], &quot;org.example.demo.Farewell&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;Net::DBus::Exporter&quot; module is used to export methods and signals
       defined in an object to the message bus. Since Perl is a loosely typed
       language it is not possible to automatically determine correct type
       information for methods to be exported.  Thus when sub-classing
       Net::DBus::Object, this package will provide the type information for
       methods and signals.

       When importing this package, an optional argument can be supplied to
       specify the default interface name to associate with methods and signals,
       for which an explicit interface is not specified.  Thus in the common
       case of objects only providing a single interface, this removes the need
       to repeat the interface name against each method exported.

SCALAR TYPES
       When specifying scalar data types for parameters and return values, the
       following string constants must be used to denote the data type. When
       values corresponding to these types are (un)marshalled they are
       represented as the Perl SCALAR data type (see perldata).

       &quot;string&quot;
           A UTF-8 string of characters

       &quot;int16&quot;
           A 16-bit signed integer

       &quot;uint16&quot;
           A 16-bit unsigned integer

       &quot;int32&quot;
           A 32-bit signed integer

       &quot;uint32&quot;
           A 32-bit unsigned integer
&#12;       &quot;int64&quot;
           A 64-bit signed integer. NB, this type is not supported by many
           builds of Perl on 32-bit platforms, so if used, your data is liable
           to be truncated at 32-bits.

       &quot;uint64&quot;
           A 64-bit unsigned integer. NB, this type is not supported by many
           builds of Perl on 32-bit platforms, so if used, your data is liable
           to be truncated at 32-bits.

       &quot;byte&quot;
           A single 8-bit byte

       &quot;bool&quot;
           A boolean value

       &quot;double&quot;
           An IEEE double-precision floating point

COMPOUND TYPES
       When specifying compound data types for parameters and return values, an
       array reference must be used, with the first element being the name of
       the compound type.

       [&quot;array&quot;, ARRAY-TYPE]
           An array of values, whose type os &quot;ARRAY-TYPE&quot;. The &quot;ARRAY-TYPE&quot; can
           be either a scalar type name, or a nested compound type. When values
           corresponding to the array type are (un)marshalled, they are
           represented as the Perl ARRAY data type (see perldata). If, for
           example, a method was declared to have a single parameter with the
           type, [&quot;array&quot;, &quot;string&quot;], then when calling the method one would
           provide a array reference of strings:

               $object-&gt;hello([&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Doe&quot;])

       [&quot;dict&quot;, KEY-TYPE, VALUE-TYPE]
           A dictionary of values, more commonly known as a hash table. The
           &quot;KEY-TYPE&quot; is the name of the scalar data type used for the
           dictionary keys. The &quot;VALUE-TYPE&quot; is the name of the scalar, or
           compound data type used for the dictionary values. When values
           corresponding to the dict type are (un)marshalled, they are
           represented as the Perl HASH data type (see perldata). If, for
           example, a method was declared to have a single parameter with the
           type [&quot;dict&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;string&quot;], then when calling the method one
           would provide a hash reference of strings,

              $object-&gt;hello({forename =&gt; &quot;John&quot;, surname =&gt; &quot;Doe&quot;});

       [&quot;struct&quot;, VALUE-TYPE-1, VALUE-TYPE-2]
           A structure of values, best thought of as a variation on the array
           type where the elements can vary. Many languages have an explicit
           name associated with each value, but since Perl does not have a
           native representation of structures, they are represented by the LIST
           data type. If, for exaple, a method was declared to have a single
           parameter with the type [&quot;struct&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;string&quot;], corresponding
           to the C structure

               struct {
                 char *forename;
                 char *surname;
               } name;

           then, when calling the method one would provide an array refernce
           with the values orded to match the structure

              $object-&gt;hello([&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Doe&quot;]);

MAGIC TYPES
       When specifying introspection data for an exported service, there are a
       couple of so called &quot;magic&quot; types. Parameters declared as magic types are
       not visible to clients, but instead their values are provided
       automatically by the server side bindings. One use of magic types is to
       get an extra parameter passed with the unique name of the caller invoking
       the method.

       &quot;caller&quot;
           The value passed in is the unique name of the caller of the method.
           Unique names are strings automatically assigned to client connections
           by the bus daemon, for example &apos;:1.15&apos;

       &quot;serial&quot;
           The value passed in is an integer within the scope of a caller, which
           increments on every method call.

ANNOTATIONS
       When exporting methods, signals &amp; properties, in addition to the core
       data typing information, a number of metadata annotations are possible.
       These are specified by passing a hash reference with the desired keys as
       the last parameter when defining the export. The following annotations
       are currently supported

       no_return
           Indicate that this method does not return any value, and thus no
           reply message should be sent over the wire, likewise informing the
           clients not to expect / wait for a reply message

       deprecated
           Indicate that use of this method/signal/property is discouraged, and
           it may disappear altogether in a future release. Clients will
           typically print out a warning message when a deprecated
           method/signal/property is used.

       param_names
           An array of strings specifying names for the input parameters of the
           method or signal. If omitted, no names will be assigned.

       return_names
           An array of strings specifying names for the return parameters of the
           method. If omitted, no names will be assigned.

METHODS
       dbus_method($name, $params, $returns, [\%annotations]);
       dbus_method($name, $params, $returns, $interface, [\%annotations]);
           Exports a method called $name, having parameters whose types are
           defined by $params, and returning values whose types are defined by
           $returns. If the $interface parameter is provided, then the method is
           associated with that interface, otherwise the default interface for
           the calling package is used. The value for the $params parameter
           should be an array reference with each element defining the data type
           of a parameter to the method. Likewise, the $returns parameter should
           be an array reference with each element defining the data type of a
           return value. If it not possible to export a method which accepts a
           variable number of parameters, or returns a variable number of
           values.

       dbus_no_strict_exports();
           If a object is using the Exporter to generate DBus introspection
           data, the default behaviour is to only allow invocation of methods
           which have been explicitly exported.

           To allow clients to access methods which have not been explicitly
           exported, call &quot;dbus_no_strict_exports&quot;. NB, doing this may be a
           security risk if you have methods considered to be &quot;private&quot; for
           internal use only. As such this method should not normally be used.
           It is here only to allow switching export behaviour to match earlier
           releases.

       dbus_property($name, $type, $access, [\%attributes]);
       dbus_property($name, $type, $access, $interface, [\%attributes]);
           Exports a property called $name, whose data type is $type.  If the
           $interface parameter is provided, then the property is associated
           with that interface, otherwise the default interface for the calling
           package is used.

       dbus_signal($name, $params, [\%attributes]);
       dbus_signal($name, $params, $interface, [\%attributes]);
           Exports a signal called $name, having parameters whose types are
           defined by $params. If the $interface parameter is provided, then the
           signal is associated with that interface, otherwise the default
           interface for the calling package is used. The value for the $params
           parameter should be an array reference with each element defining the
           data type of a parameter to the signal. Signals do not have return
           values. It not possible to export a signal which has a variable
           number of parameters.

EXAMPLES
       No paramters, no return values
           A method which simply prints &quot;Hello World&quot; each time its called

              sub Hello {
                  my $self = shift;
                  print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;
              }

              dbus_method(&quot;Hello&quot;, [], []);

       One string parameter, returning an boolean value
           A method which accepts a process name, issues the killall command on
           it, and returns a boolean value to indicate whether it was
           successful.

              sub KillAll {
                  my $self = shift;
                  my $processname = shift;
                  my $ret  = system(&quot;killall $processname&quot;);
                  return $ret == 0 ? 1 : 0;
              }

              dbus_method(&quot;KillAll&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [&quot;bool&quot;]);

       One list of strings parameter, returning a dictionary
           A method which accepts a list of files names, stats them, and returns
           a dictionary containing the last modification times.

               sub LastModified {
                  my $self = shift;
                  my $files = shift;

                  my %mods;
                  foreach my $file (@{$files}) {
                     $mods{$file} = (stat $file)[9];
                  }
                  return \%mods;
               }

               dbus_method(&quot;LastModified&quot;, [&quot;array&quot;, &quot;string&quot;], [&quot;dict&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;int32&quot;]);

       Annotating methods with metdata
           A method which is targetted for removal, and also does not return any
           value

               sub PlayMP3 {
                   my $self = shift;
                   my $track = shift;

                   system &quot;mpg123 $track &amp;&quot;;
               }

               dbus_method(&quot;PlayMP3&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [], { deprecated =&gt; 1, no_return =&gt; 1 });

           Or giving names to input parameters:
&#12;               sub PlayMP3 {
                   my $self = shift;
                   my $track = shift;

                   system &quot;mpg123 $track &amp;&quot;;
               }

               dbus_method(&quot;PlayMP3&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [], { param_names =&gt; [&quot;track&quot;] });
