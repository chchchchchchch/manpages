NAME
       Net::DBus::RemoteObject - Access objects provided on the bus

SYNOPSIS
         my $service = $bus-&gt;get_service(&quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;);
         my $object = $service-&gt;get_object(&quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus&quot;);

         print &quot;Names on the bus {\n&quot;;
         foreach my $name (sort @{$object-&gt;ListNames}) {
             print &quot;  &quot;, $name, &quot;\n&quot;;
         }
         print &quot;}\n&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the API for accessing remote objects available on
       the bus. It uses the autoloader to fake the presence of methods based on
       the API of the remote object. There is also support for setting callbacks
       against signals, and accessing properties of the object.

METHODS
       my $object = Net::DBus::RemoteObject-&gt;new($service, $object_path[,
       $interface]);
           Creates a new handle to a remote object. The $service parameter is an
           instance of the Net::DBus::RemoteService method, and $object_path is
           the identifier of an object exported by this service, for example
           &quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus&quot;. For remote objects which implement more than
           one interface it is possible to specify an optional name of an
           interface as the third parameter. This is only really required,
           however, if two interfaces in the object provide methods with the
           same name, since introspection data can be used to automatically
           resolve the correct interface to call cases where method names are
           unique. Rather than using this constructor directly, it is
           preferrable to use the &quot;get_object&quot; method on
           Net::DBus::RemoteService, since this caches handles to remote
           objects, eliminating unneccessary introspection data lookups.

       my $object = $object-&gt;as_interface($interface);
           Casts the object to a specific interface, returning a new instance of
           the Net::DBus::RemoteObject specialized to the desired interface. It
           is only neccessary to cast objects to a specific interface, if two
           interfaces export methods or signals with the same name, or the
           remote object does not support introspection.

       my $service = $object-&gt;get_service
           Retrieves a handle for the remote service on which this object is
           attached. The returned object is an instance of
           Net::DBus::RemoteService

       my $path = $object-&gt;get_object_path
           Retrieves the unique path identifier for this object within the
           service.

       my $object = $object-&gt;get_child_object($subpath, [$interface])
           Retrieves a handle to a child of this object, identified by the
           relative path $subpath. The returned object is an instance of
           &quot;Net::DBus::RemoteObject&quot;. The optional $interface parameter can be
           used to immediately cast the object to a specific type.

       my $sigid = $object-&gt;connect_to_signal($name, $coderef);
           Connects a callback to a signal emitted by the object. The $name
           parameter is the name of the signal within the object, and $coderef
           is a reference to an anonymous subroutine. When the signal $name is
           emitted by the remote object, the subroutine $coderef will be
           invoked, and passed the parameters from the signal. A unique $sigid
           will be returned, which can be later passed to
           &quot;disconnect_from_signal&quot; to remove the handler

       $object-&gt;disconnect_from_signal($name, $sigid);
           Disconnects from a signal emitted by the object. The $name parameter
           is the name of the signal within the object. The $sigid must be the
           unique signal handler ID returned by a previous &quot;connect_to_signal&quot;
           method call.
