NAME
       Net::DBus::RemoteService - Access services provided on the bus

SYNOPSIS
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;
         my $service = $bus-&gt;get_service(&quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;);

         my $object = $service-&gt;get_object(&quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus&quot;);
         foreach (@{$object-&gt;ListNames}) {
           print &quot;$_\n&quot;;
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This object provides a handle to a remote service on the bus. From this
       handle it is possible to access objects associated with the service. If a
       service is not running, an attempt will be made to activate it the first
       time a method is called against one of its objects.

METHODS
       my $service = Net::DBus::RemoteService-&gt;new($bus, $owner, $service_name);
           Creates a new handle for a remote service. The $bus parameter is an
           instance of Net::DBus, $owner is the name of the client providing the
           service, while $service_name is the well known name of the  service
           on the bus. Service names consist of two or more tokens, separated by
           periods, while the tokens comprise the letters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _,
           for example &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus&quot;. There is generally no need to
           call this constructor, instead the &quot;get_service&quot; method on Net::DBus
           should be used. This caches handles to remote services, eliminating
           repeated retrieval of introspection data.

       my $bus = $service-&gt;get_bus;
           Retrieves a handle for the bus to which this service is attached.
           The returned object will be an instance of Net::DBus.

       my $service_name = $service-&gt;get_service_name
           Retrieves the name of the remote service as known to the bus.

       my $owner_name = $service-&gt;get_owner_name;
           Retrieves the name of the client owning the service at the time it
           was connected to.

       my $object = $service-&gt;get_object($object_path[, $interface]);
           Retrieves a handle to the remote object provided by the service  with
           the name of $object_path. If the optional $interface parameter is
           provided, the object will immediately be cast to the designated
           interface. NB, it is only neccessary to cast an object to a specific
           interface if there are multiple interfaces on the object providing
           methods with the same name, or the remote object does support
           introspection. The returned object will be an instance of
           Net::DBus::RemoteObject.
