NAME
       Net::DBus::Service - Provide a service to the bus for clients to use

SYNOPSIS
         package main;

         use Net::DBus;

         # Attach to the bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;

         # Acquire a service &apos;org.demo.Hello&apos;
         my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service(&quot;org.demo.Hello&quot;);

         # Export our object within the service
         my $object = Demo::HelloWorld-&gt;new($service);

         ....rest of program...

DESCRIPTION
       This module represents a service which is exported to the message bus.
       Once a service has been exported, it is possible to create and export
       objects to the bus.

METHODS
       my $service = Net::DBus::Service-&gt;new($bus, $name);
           Create a new service, attaching to the bus provided in the $bus
           parameter, which should be an instance of the Net::DBus object. The
           $name parameter is the qualified service name. It is not usually
           neccessary to use this constructor, since services can be created via
           the &quot;export_service&quot; method on the Net::DBus object.

       my $bus = $service-&gt;get_bus;
           Retrieves the Net::DBus object to which this service is attached.

       my $name = $service-&gt;get_service_name
           Retrieves the qualified name by which this service is known on the
           bus.
