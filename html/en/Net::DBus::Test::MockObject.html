NAME
       Net::DBus::Test::MockObject - Fake an object from the bus for unit
       testing

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus;
         use Net::DBus::Test::MockObject;

         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;test

         # Lets fake presence of HAL...

         # First we need to define the service
         my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service(&quot;org.freedesktop.Hal&quot;);

         # Then create a mock object
         my $object = Net::DBus::Test::MockObject-&gt;new($service,
                                                       &quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager&quot;);

         # Fake the &apos;GetAllDevices&apos; method
         $object-&gt;seed_action(&quot;org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager&quot;,
                              &quot;GetAllDevices&quot;,
                              reply =&gt; {
                                return =&gt; [ &quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_i8042_Aux_Port&quot;,
                                            &quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_i8042_Aux_Port_logicaldev_input&quot;,
                                            &quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_i8042_Kbd_Port&quot;,
                                            &quot;/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_i8042_Kbd_Port_logicaldev_input&quot;
                                ],
                              });


         # Now can test any class which calls out to &apos;GetAllDevices&apos; in HAL
         ....test stuff....

DESCRIPTION
       This provides an alternate for Net::DBus::Object to enable bus objects to
       be quickly mocked up, thus facilitating creation of unit tests for
       services which may need to call out to objects provided by 3rd party
       services on the bus. It is typically used as a companion to the
       Net::DBus::MockBus object, to enable complex services to be tested
       without actually starting a real bus.

       !!!!! WARNING !!!

       This object &amp; its APIs should be considered very experimental at this
       point in time, and no guarentees about future API compatability are
       provided what-so-ever. Comments &amp; suggestions on how to evolve this
       framework are, however, welcome &amp; encouraged.

METHODS
       my $object = Net::DBus::Test::MockObject-&gt;new($service, $path,
       $interface);
           Create a new mock object, attaching to the service defined by the
           $service parameter. This would be an instance of the
           Net::DBus::Service object. The $path parameter defines the object
           path at which to attach this mock object, and $interface defines the
           interface it will support.

       my $service = $object-&gt;get_service
           Retrieves the Net::DBus::Service object within which this object is
           exported.
&#12;       my $path = $object-&gt;get_object_path
           Retrieves the path under which this object is exported

       my $msg = $object-&gt;get_last_message
           Retrieves the last message processed by this object. The returned
           object is an instance of Net::DBus::Binding::Message

       my $sig = $object-&gt;get_last_message_signature
           Retrieves the type signature of the last processed message.

       my $value = $object-&gt;get_last_message_param
           Returns the first value supplied as an argument to the last processed
           message.

       my @values = $object-&gt;get_last_message_param_list
           Returns a list of all the values supplied as arguments to the last
           processed message.

       $object-&gt;seed_action($interface, $method, %action);
           Registers an action to be performed when a message corresponding to
           the method $method within the interface $interface is received. The
           %action parameter can have a number of possible keys set:

           signals
               Causes a signal to be emitted when the method is invoked. The
               value associated with this key should be an instance of the
               Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal class.

           error
               Causes an error to be generated when the method is invoked. The
               value associated with this key should be a hash reference, with
               two elements. The first, &quot;name&quot;, giving the error name, and the
               second, &quot;description&quot;, providing the descriptive text.

           reply
               Causes a normal method return to be generated. The value
               associated with this key should be an array reference, whose
               elements are the values to be returned by the method.

BUGS
       It doesn&apos;t completely replicate the API of Net::DBus::Binding::Object,
       merely enough to make the high level bindings work in a test scenario.
