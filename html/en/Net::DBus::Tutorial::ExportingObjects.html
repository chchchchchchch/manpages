NAME
       Net::DBus::Tutorial::ExportingObjects - tutorials on providing a DBus
       service

DESCRIPTION
       This document provides a tutorial on providing a DBus service using the
       Perl Net::DBus application bindings. This examples in this document will
       be based on the code from the Music::Player distribution, which is a
       simple DBus service providing a music track player.

CREATING AN OBJECT
       The first step in creating an object is to create a new package which
       inherits from Net::DBus::Object. The Music::Player::Manager object
       provides an API for managing the collection of music player backends for
       different track types. To start with, lets create the skeleton of the
       package &amp; its constructor. The constructor of the super type,
       Net::DBus::Object expects to be given to parameters, a handle to the
       Net::DBus::Service owning the object, and a path under which the object
       shall be exported. Since the manager class is intended to be a singleton
       object, we can hard code the path to it within the constructor:

         package Music::Player::Manager;

         use base qw(Net::DBus);

         sub new {
             my $class = shift;
             my $service = shift;
             my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($service, &quot;/music/player/manager&quot;);

             bless $self, $class;

             return $self;
         }

         1;

       Now, as mentioned, the manager with handle a number of different player
       backends. So we need to provide methods for registering new backends, and
       querying for backends capable of playing a particular file type. So
       modifying the above code we add a hash table in the constructor, to store
       the backends:

         sub new {
             my $class = shift;
             my $service = shift;
             my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($service, &quot;/music/player/manager&quot;);

             $self-&gt;{backends} = {};

             bless $self, $class;

             return $self;
         }

       And now a method to register a new backend. This takes a Perl module name
       and uses it to instantiate a backend. Since the backends are also going
       to be DBus objects, we need to pass in a reference to the service we are
       attached to, along with a path under which to register the backend. We
       use the &quot;get_service&quot; method to retreieve a reference to the service the
       manager is attached to, and attach the player backend to this same
       service: When a method on DBus object is invoked, the first parameter is
       the object reference ($self), and the remainder are the parameters
       provided to the method call. Thus writing a method implementation on a
       DBUs is really no different to normal object oriented Perl (cf perltoot):

         sub register_backend {
             my $self = shift;
             my $name = shift;
             my $module = shift;

             eval &quot;use $module&quot;;
             if ($@) {
                 die &quot;cannot load backend $module: $@&quot; ;
             }

             $self-&gt;{backends} = $module-&gt;new($self-&gt;get_service,
                                              &quot;/music/player/backend/$name&quot;);
         }

       Looking at this one might wonder what happens if the &quot;die&quot; method is
       triggered. In such a scenario, rather than terminating the service
       process, the error will be caught and propagated back to the remote
       caller to deal with.

       The player backends provide a method &quot;get_track_types&quot; which returns an
       array reference of the music track types they support. We can use this
       method to provide an API to allow easy retrieval of a backend for a
       particular track type. This method will return a path with which the
       backend object can be accessed

         sub find_backend {
             my $self = shift;
             my $extension = shift;

             foreach my $name (keys %{$self-&gt;{backends}}) {
                my $backend = $self-&gt;{backends}-&gt;{$name};
                foreach my $type (@{$backend-&gt;get_track_types}) {
                   if ($type eq $extension) {
                       return $backend-&gt;get_object_path;
                   }
                }
             }

             die &quot;no backend for type $extension&quot;;
         }

       Lets take a quick moment to consider how this method would be used to
       play a music track. If you&apos;ve not already done so, refresh your memory
       from Net::DBus::Tutorial::UsingObjects. Now, we have an MP3 file which we
       wish to play, so we search for the path to a backend, then retrieve the
       object for it, and play the track:

         ...get the music player service...
         # Ask for a path to a player for mp3 files
         my $path = $service-&gt;find_backend(&quot;mp3&quot;);
         # $path now contains &apos;/music/player/backend/mpg123&apos;
         # and we can get the backend object
         my $backend = $service-&gt;get_object($path);
         # and finally play the track
         $backend-&gt;play(&quot;/vol/music/beck/guero/09-scarecrow.mp3&quot;);

PROVIDING INTROSPECTION DATA
       The code above is a complete working object, ready to be registered with
       a service, and since the parameters and return values for the two methods
       are both simple strings we could stop there. In some cases, however, one
       might want to be more specific about data types expected for parameters,
       for example signed vs unsigned integers. Adding explicit data typing also
       makes interaction with other programming languages more reliable.
       Providing explicit data type defintions for exported method is known in
       the DBus world as &quot;Introspection&quot;, and it makes life much more reliable
       for users of one&apos;s service whom may be using a strongly typed language
       such as C.

       The first step in providing introspection data for a DBus object in Perl,
       is to specify the name of the interface provided by the object. This is
       typically a period separated string, by convention containing the domain
       name of the application as its first component. Since most Perl modules
       end up living on CPAN, one might use &quot;org.cpan&quot; as the first component,
       followed by the package name of the module (replacing :: with .), eg
       &quot;org.cpan.music.player.manager&quot;. If it is not planned to host the module
       on CPAN, a personal/project domain might be used eg
       &quot;com.berrange.music.player.manager&quot;. The interface for an object is
       defined by loading the Net::DBus::Exporter module, providing the
       interface as its first parameter. So the earlier code example would be
       modified to look like:

         package Music::Player::Manager;

         use base qw(Net::DBus);
         use Net::DBus::Exporter qw(com.berrange.music.player.manager)

       Next up, it is neccessary to provide data types for the parameters and
       return values of the methods. The Net::DBus::Exporter module provides a
       method &quot;dbus_method&quot; for this purpose, which takes three parameter, the
       name of the method being exported, an array reference of parameter types,
       and an array reference of return types (the latter can be omitted if
       there are no return values). This can be called at any point in the
       module&apos;s code, but by convention it is preferrable to associate calls to
       &quot;dbus_method&quot; with the actual method implementation, thus:

         dbus_method(&quot;register_backend&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;, &quot;string&quot;]);
         sub register_backend {
             my $self = shift;
             my $name = shift;
             my $module = shift;

             .. snipped rest of method body ...
         }

       And, thus:

         dbus_method(&quot;find_backend&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;], [&quot;string&quot;])
         sub find_backend {
             my $self = shift;
             my $extension = shift;
             ... snip method body...
         }

DEFINING A SERVICE
       Now that the objects have been written, it is time to define a service. A
       service is nothing more than a well known name for a given API contract.
       A contract can be thought of as a definition of a list of object paths,
       and the corresponding interfaces they provide. So, someone else could
       come along a provide an alternate music player implementation using the
       Python or QT bindings for DBus, and if they provided the same set of
       object paths &amp; interfaces, they could justifiably register the same
       service on the bus.

       The Net::DBus::Service module provides the means to register a service.
       Its constructor expects a reference to the bus object (an instance of
       Net::DBus), along with the name of the service.  As with interface names,
       the first component of a service name is usually derived from a domain
       name, and then suffixed with the name of the application, in our example
       forming &quot;org.cpan.Music.Player&quot;.  While some objects will be created on
       the fly during execution of the application, others are created upon
       initial startup. The music player manager object created earlier in this
       tutorial is an example of the latter. It is typical to instantiate and
       register these objects in the constructor for the service. Thus a service
       object for the music player application would look like:

           package Music::Player;

           use base qw(Net::DBus::Service);

           sub new {
               my $class = shift;
               my $bus = shift;
               my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($bus, &quot;org.cpan.music.player&quot;);

               bless $self, $class;

               $self-&gt;{manager} = Music::Player::Manager-&gt;new($self);

               return $self;
           }

       The Net::DBus::Service automatically provides one special object to all
       services, under the path &quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus/Exporter&quot;.  This object
       implements the &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus.Exporter&quot; interface which has a
       method &quot;ListObject&quot;. This enables clients to determine a list of all
       objects exported within a service. While not functionally neccessary for
       most applications, it is none-the-less a useful tool for developers
       debugging applications, or wondering what a service provides.

CONNECTING TO THE BUS
       The final step in getting our service up and running is to connect it to
       the bus. This brings up an interesting conundrum, does one export the
       service on the system bus (shared by all users &amp; processes on the
       machine), or the session bus (one per user logged into a machine). In
       some cases the answer, with only one of the two buses conceptually making
       sense. In other cases, however, both the session &amp; system bus are valid.
       In the former one would use the &quot;session&quot; or &lt;system&gt; methods on
       Net::DBus to get a handle to the desired bus, while in the latter case,
       the &quot;find&quot; method would be used. This applies a heuristic to determine
       the correct bus based on execution environment. In the case of the music
       player, either bus is relevant, so the code to connect the service to the
       bus would look like:

          use Net::DBus;

          my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;
          my $player = Music::Player-&gt;new($bus);

       With the service attached to the bus, it is merely neccessary to run the
       main event processing loop to listen out for &amp; handle incoming DBus
       messages. So the above code is modified to start a simple reactor:

          use Net::DBus;
          use Net::DBus::Reactor;

          my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;
          my $player = Music::Player-&gt;new($bus);

          Net::DBus::Reactor-&gt;main-&gt;run;

          exit 0;

       Saving this code into a script &quot;/usr/bin/music-player.pl&quot;, coding is
       complete and the service ready for use by clients on the bus.

SERVICE ACTIVATION
       One might now wonder how best to start the service, particularly if it is
       a service capable of running on both the system and session buses. DBus
       has the answer in the concept of &quot;activation&quot;. What happens is that when
       a client on the bus attempts to call a method, or register a signal
       handler against, a service not currently running, it will first try and
       start the service. Service&apos;s which wish to participate in this process
       merely need stick a simple service definition file into the directoy
       &quot;/usr/share/dbus-1/services&quot;. The file should be named to match the
       service name, with the file extension &quot;.service&quot; appended. eg,
       &quot;/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.cpan.music.player.service&quot; The file
       contains two keys, first the name of the service, and second the name of
       the executable used to run the service, or in this case the Perl script.
       So, for our simple service the data file would contain:

         [D-BUS Service]
         Name=org.cpan.music.player
         Exec=/usr/bin/music-player.pl
