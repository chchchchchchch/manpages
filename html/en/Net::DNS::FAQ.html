NAME
       Net::DNS::FAQ - Frequently Asked Net::DNS Questions

SYNOPSIS
        perldoc Net::DNS::FAQ

DESCRIPTION
       This document serves to answer the most frequently asked questions on
       both the Net::DNS Mailing List and those sent to the author.

       The latest version of this FAQ can be found at
            http://www.net-dns.org/docs/FAQ.html

GENERAL
   What is Net::DNS?
       Net::DNS is a perl implementation of a DNS resolver.

INSTALLATION
   Where can I find Test::More?
       Test::More is part of the Test-Simple package, by Michael G Schwern.  You
       should be able to find the distrubution here:

               http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/

USAGE
   Why does Net::DNS::Resolver::query() return undef when the ANSWER section is
       empty?
       The short answer is, don&apos;t use query().  Net::DNS::Resolver::send() will
       always return the answer packet, as long as an answer was received.

       The longer answer is that query() is modeled after the res_query()
       function from the libresolv C library, which has similar behaviors.
