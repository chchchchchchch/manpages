NAME
       Net::DNS::Question - DNS question class

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::Question&quot;

DESCRIPTION
       A &quot;Net::DNS::Question&quot; object represents a record in the question section
       of a DNS packet.

METHODS
   new
           $question = Net::DNS::Question-&gt;new(&quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;MX&quot;, &quot;IN&quot;);

       Creates a question object from the domain, type, and class passed as
       arguments.

       RFC4291 and RFC4632 IP address/prefix notation is supported for queries
       in in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa subdomains.

   parse
           ($question, $offset) = Net::DNS::Question-&gt;parse(\$data, $offset);

       Parses a question section record at the specified location within a DNS
       packet.  The first argument is a reference to the packet data.  The
       second argument is the offset within the packet where the question record
       begins.

       Returns a Net::DNS::Question object and the offset of the next location
       in the packet.

       Parsing is aborted if the question object cannot be created (e.g.,
       corrupt or insufficient data).

   qname, zname
           print &quot;qname = &quot;, $question-&gt;qname, &quot;\n&quot;;
           print &quot;zname = &quot;, $question-&gt;zname, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the domain name.  In dynamic update packets, this field is known
       as &quot;zname&quot; and refers to the zone name.

   qtype, ztype
           print &quot;qtype = &quot;, $question-&gt;qtype, &quot;\n&quot;;
           print &quot;ztype = &quot;, $question-&gt;ztype, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the record type.  In dymamic update packets, this field is known
       as &quot;ztype&quot; and refers to the zone type (must be SOA).

   qclass, zclass
           print &quot;qclass = &quot;, $question-&gt;qclass, &quot;\n&quot;;
           print &quot;zclass = &quot;, $question-&gt;zclass, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the record class.  In dynamic update packets, this field is known
       as &quot;zclass&quot; and refers to the zone&apos;s class.

   print
           $question-&gt;print;

       Prints the question record on the standard output.

   string
           print $qr-&gt;string, &quot;\n&quot;;
&#12;       Returns a string representation of the question record.

   data
           $qdata = $question-&gt;data($packet, $offset);

       Returns the question record in binary format suitable for inclusion in a
       DNS packet.

       Arguments are a &quot;Net::DNS::Packet&quot; object and the offset within that
       packet&apos;s data where the &quot;Net::DNS::Question&quot; record is to be stored.
       This information is necessary for using compressed domain names.
