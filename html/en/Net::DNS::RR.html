NAME
       Net::DNS::RR - DNS Resource Record class

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Net::DNS::RR&quot; is the base class for DNS Resource Record (RR) objects.
       See also the manual pages for each RR type.

METHODS
       WARNING!!!  Don&apos;t assume the RR objects you receive from a query are of a
       particular type -- always check an object&apos;s type before calling any of
       its methods.  If you call an unknown method, you&apos;ll get a nasty warning
       message and &quot;Net::DNS::RR&quot; will return &quot;undef&quot; to the caller.

   new (from string)
        $a     = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(&quot;foo.example.com. 86400 A 10.1.2.3&quot;);
        $mx    = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(&quot;example.com. 7200 MX 10 mailhost.example.com.&quot;);
        $cname = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(&quot;www.example.com 300 IN CNAME www1.example.com&quot;);
        $txt   = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(&apos;baz.example.com 3600 HS TXT &quot;text record&quot;&apos;);

       Returns a &quot;Net::DNS::RR&quot; object of the appropriate type and initialized
       from the string passed by the user.  The format of the string is that
       used in zone files, and is compatible with the string returned by
       &quot;Net::DNS::RR-&gt;string&quot;.

       The name and RR type are required; all other information is optional.  If
       omitted, the TTL defaults to 0 and the RR class defaults to IN.  Omitting
       the optional fields is useful for creating the empty RDATA sections
       required for certain dynamic update operations.  See the
       &quot;Net::DNS::Update&quot; manual page for additional examples.

       All names must be fully qualified.  The trailing dot (.) is optional.

   new (from hash)
        $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(
                name    =&gt; &quot;foo.example.com&quot;,
                ttl     =&gt; 86400,
                class   =&gt; &quot;IN&quot;,
                type    =&gt; &quot;A&quot;,
                address =&gt; &quot;10.1.2.3&quot;,
        );

        $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(
                name =&gt; &quot;foo.example.com&quot;,
                type =&gt; &quot;A&quot;,
        );

       Returns an RR object of the appropriate type, or a &quot;Net::DNS::RR&quot; object
       if the type isn&apos;t implemented.  See the manual pages for each RR type to
       see what fields the type requires.

       The &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Type&quot; fields are required; all others are optional.  If
       omitted, &quot;TTL&quot; defaults to 0 and &quot;Class&quot; defaults to IN.  Omitting the
       optional fields is useful for creating the empty RDATA sections required
       for certain dynamic update operations.

       The fields are case-insensitive, but starting each with uppercase is
       recommended.

   parse
           ($rrobj, $offset) = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;parse(\$data, $offset);
&#12;       Parses a DNS resource record at the specified location within a DNS
       packet.  The first argument is a reference to the packet data.  The
       second argument is the offset within the packet where the resource record
       begins.

       Returns a Net::DNS::RR object and the offset of the next location in the
       packet.

       Parsing is aborted if the object could not be created (e.g., corrupt or
       insufficient data).

   print
           $rr-&gt;print;

       Prints the record to the standard output.  Calls the string method to get
       the RR&apos;s string representation.

   string
           print $rr-&gt;string, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns a string representation of the RR.  Calls the rdatastr method to
       get the RR-specific data. Domain names arereturned in RFC1035 format,
       i.e. all non letter, digit, hyphen characters are represented as \DDD.
       Besides, all domain names are expanded to fully qualified domain names,
       with trailing dot.  This is in contrast to accessor methods of individual
       data elements in RR objects, like name, which will not return the
       trailing dot.

   rdatastr
           $s = $rr-&gt;rdatastr;

       Returns a string containing RR-specific data.  Subclasses will need to
       implement this method.

   name
           $name = $rr-&gt;name;

       Returns the record&apos;s domain name.

   type
           $type = $rr-&gt;type;

       Returns the record&apos;s type.

   class
           $class = $rr-&gt;class;

       Returns the record&apos;s class.

   ttl
           $ttl = $rr-&gt;ttl;

       Returns the record&apos;s time-to-live (TTL).

   rdlength
           $rdlength = $rr-&gt;rdlength;

       Returns the length of the record&apos;s data section.

   rdata
           $rdata = $rr-&gt;rdata

       Returns the record&apos;s data section as binary data.

Sorting of RR arrays
       As of version 0.55 there is functionality to help you sort RR arrays. The
       sorting is done by Net::DNS::rrsort(), see the Net::DNS documentation.
       This package provides class methods to set the sorting functions used for
       a particular RR based on a particular attribute.

   set_rrsort_func
       Net::DNS::RR::SRV-&gt;set_rrsort_func(&quot;priority&quot;,                       sub
       {                        my ($a,$b)=($Net::DNS::a,$Net::DNS::b);
                              $a-&gt;priority &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;priority
       ||                        $b-&gt;weight &lt;=&gt; $a-&gt;weight
                            }

       Net::DNS::RR::SRV-&gt;set_rrsort_func(&quot;default_sort&quot;,
       sub {                        my ($a,$b)=($Net::DNS::a,$Net::DNS::b);
                              $a-&gt;priority &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;priority
       ||                        $b-&gt;weight &lt;=&gt; $a-&gt;weight
                            }

       set_rrsort_func needs to be called as a class method. The first argument
       is the attribute name on which the sorting will need to take place. If
       you specify &quot;default_sort&quot; than that is the sort algorithm that will be
       used in the case that rrsort() is called without an RR attribute as
       argument.

       The second argument is a reference to a function that uses the variables
       $a and $b global to the &quot;from Net::DNS&quot;(!!)package for the sorting.
       During the sorting $a and $b will contain references to objects from the
       class you called the set_prop_sort from. In other words, you can rest
       assured that the above sorting function will only get Net::DNS::RR::SRV
       objects.

       The above example is the sorting function that actually is implemented in
       SRV.

BUGS
       This version of &quot;Net::DNS::RR&quot; does little sanity checking on user-
       created RR objects.
