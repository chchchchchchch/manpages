NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::HIP - DNS HIP resource record

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements the HIP RR (RFC5205)

METHODS
   pkalgorithm
       Returns or sets the public key algorithm field

   hit
       Returns or sets the hit in base16 representation.

   hitbin
       Returns or sets the binary representation of the the hit.

       Using hit or hitbin to set the one of these attributes will update both
       attributes.

   pubkey
       Returns or sets the publick key in base64 representation.

   pubkey
       Returns or sets the binary representation of the the public key.

       Using pubkey or pubkeybin to set the one of these attributes will update
       both attributes.

   rendezvousservers
             my $rendezvousservers=$hip-&gt;rendezvousservers();

       Returns a reference to an array of rendezvous servers. The representation
       is in Perl&apos;s internal storage format i.e. without trailing dot.

            $hip-&gt;rendezvousservers( [ qw|example.com  example.net| ] )

       With a reference to an array as the argument this method will set the
       rendezvousservers.

NOTES
       Since (multiline) base64 encoded publik keys may contain spaces string
       parsing of the HIP RR depends on rendevous server names containing at
       least one . (dot) in their domain name. Failure of string parsing will
       return an &apos;undef&apos;.

       The rdatastr method (and hence the string and print methods) return the
       rendezvousservers as fully qualified domain names.
