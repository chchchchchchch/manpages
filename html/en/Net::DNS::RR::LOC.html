NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::LOC - DNS LOC resource record

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       Class for DNS Location (LOC) resource records.  See RFC 1876 for details.

METHODS
   version
           print &quot;version = &quot;, $rr-&gt;version, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the version number of the representation; programs should always
       check this.  &quot;Net::DNS&quot; currently supports only version 0.

   size
           print &quot;size = &quot;, $rr-&gt;size, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the diameter of a sphere enclosing the described entity, in
       centimeters.

   horiz_pre
           print &quot;horiz_pre = &quot;, $rr-&gt;horiz_pre, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the horizontal precision of the data, in centimeters.

   vert_pre
           print &quot;vert_pre = &quot;, $rr-&gt;vert_pre, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the vertical precision of the data, in centimeters.

   latitude
           print &quot;latitude = &quot;, $rr-&gt;latitude, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the latitude of the center of the sphere described by the &quot;size&quot;
       method, in thousandths of a second of arc.  2**31 represents the equator;
       numbers above that are north latitude.

   longitude
           print &quot;longitude = &quot;, $rr-&gt;longitude, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the longitude of the center of the sphere described by the &quot;size&quot;
       method, in thousandths of a second of arc.  2**31 represents the prime
       meridian; numbers above that are east longitude.

   latlon
           ($lat, $lon) = $rr-&gt;latlon;
           system(&quot;xearth&quot;, &quot;-pos&quot;, &quot;fixed $lat $lon&quot;);

       Returns the latitude and longitude as floating-point degrees.  Positive
       numbers represent north latitude or east longitude; negative numbers
       represent south latitude or west longitude.

   altitude
           print &quot;altitude = &quot;, $rr-&gt;altitude, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the altitude of the center of the sphere described by the &quot;size&quot;
       method, in centimeters, from a base of 100,000m below the WGS 84
       reference spheroid used by GPS.
