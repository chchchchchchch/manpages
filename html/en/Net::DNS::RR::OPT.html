NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::OPT - DNS OPT

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       Class for EDNS pseudo resource record OPT.

METHODS
       This object should only be used inside the Net::DNS classes itself.

   new
       Since &quot;OPT&quot; is a pseudo record and should not be stored in masterfiles;
       Therefore we have not implemented a method to create this RR from string.

       One may create the object from a hash. See RFC 2671 for details for the
       meaning of the hash keys.

        $rr= Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new (
           name =&gt; &quot;&quot;,                # Ignored and set to &quot;&quot;
           type =&gt; &quot;OPT&quot;,
           class =&gt; 1024,             # sets UDP payload size
           extendedrcode =&gt;  0x00,    # sets the extended RCODE 1 octets
           ednsflags     =&gt;  0x0000,  # sets the ednsflags (2octets)
           optioncode   =&gt;   0x0,     # 2 octets
           optiondata   =&gt;   0x0      # optionlength octets
        );

       The ednsversion is set to 0 for now. The ttl value is determined from the
       extendedrcode, the ednsversion and the ednsflag.  The rdata is
       constructed from the optioncode and optiondata see section 4.4 of RFC
       2671

       If optioncode is left undefined then we do not expect any RDATA.

       The defaults are no rdata.

   do, set_do, clear_do
           $opt-&gt;set_do;

       Reads, sets and clears the do flag. (first bit in the ednssflags);

   size
           $opt-&gt;size(1498);
           print &quot;Packet size:&quot;. $opt-&gt;size() ;

       Sets or gets the packet size.

TODO
       - This class is tailored to use with dnssec.

       - Do some range checking on the input.

       - This class probably needs subclasses once OPTION codes start to be
       defined.

       - look at use of extended labels
