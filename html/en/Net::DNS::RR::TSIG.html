NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::TSIG - DNS TSIG resource record

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       Class for DNS Transaction Signature (TSIG) resource records.

METHODS
   algorithm
           $rr-&gt;algorithm($algorithm_name);
           print &quot;algorithm = &quot;, $rr-&gt;algorithm, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Gets or sets the domain name that specifies the name of the algorithm.
       The only algorithm currently supported is HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT.

   time_signed
           $rr-&gt;time_signed(time);
           print &quot;time signed = &quot;, $rr-&gt;time_signed, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Gets or sets the signing time as the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970
       00:00:00 UTC.

       The default signing time is the current time.

   fudge
           $rr-&gt;fudge(60);
           print &quot;fudge = &quot;, $rr-&gt;fudge, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Gets or sets the &quot;fudge&quot;, i.e., the seconds of error permitted in the
       signing time.

       The default fudge is 300 seconds.

   mac_size
           print &quot;MAC size = &quot;, $rr-&gt;mac_size, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the number of octets in the message authentication code (MAC).
       The programmer must call a Net::DNS::Packet object&apos;s data method before
       this will return anything meaningful.

   mac
           print &quot;MAC = &quot;, $rr-&gt;mac, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the message authentication code (MAC) as a string of hex
       characters.  The programmer must call a Net::DNS::Packet object&apos;s data
       method before this will return anything meaningful.

   original_id
           $rr-&gt;original_id(12345);
           print &quot;original ID = &quot;, $rr-&gt;original_id, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Gets or sets the original message ID.

   error
           print &quot;error = &quot;, $rr-&gt;error, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the RCODE covering TSIG processing.  Common values are NOERROR,
       BADSIG, BADKEY, and BADTIME.  See RFC 2845 for details.

   other_len
           print &quot;other len = &quot;, $rr-&gt;other_len, &quot;\n&quot;;
&#12;       Returns the length of the Other Data.  Should be zero unless the error is
       BADTIME.

   other_data
           print &quot;other data = &quot;, $rr-&gt;other_data, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the Other Data.  This field should be empty unless the error is
       BADTIME, in which case it will contain the server&apos;s time as the number of
       seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

   sig_data
            my $sigdata = $tsig-&gt;sig_data($packet);

       Returns the packet packed according to RFC2845 in a form for signing.
       This is only needed if you want to supply an external signing function,
       such as is needed for TSIG-GSS.

   sign_func
            sub my_sign_fn($$) {
                    my ($key, $data) = @_;

                    return some_digest_algorithm($key, $data);
            }

            $tsig-&gt;sign_func(\&amp;my_sign_fn);

       This sets the signing function to be used for this TSIG record.

       The default signing function is HMAC-MD5.

BUGS
       This code is still under development.  Use with caution on production
       systems.

       The time_signed and other_data fields should be 48-bit unsigned integers
       (RFC 2845, Sections 2.3 and 4.5.2).  The current implementation ignores
       the upper 16 bits; this will cause problems for times later than 19 Jan
       2038 03:14:07 UTC.

       The only builtin algorithm currently supported is
       HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT. You can use other algorithms by supplying an
       appropriate sign_func.
