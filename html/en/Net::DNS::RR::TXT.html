NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::TXT - DNS TXT resource record

SYNOPSIS
       &quot;use Net::DNS::RR&quot;;

DESCRIPTION
       Class for DNS Text (TXT) resource records.

METHODS
   txtdata
           print &quot;txtdata = &quot;, $rr-&gt;txtdata, &quot;\n&quot;;

       Returns the descriptive text as a single string, regardless of actual
       number of &lt;character-string&gt; elements.  Of questionable value.  Should be
       deprecated.

       Use &quot;$txt-&gt;rdatastr()&quot; or &quot;$txt-&gt;char_str_list()&quot; instead.

   char_str_list
        print &quot;Individual &lt;character-string&gt; list: \n\t&quot;,
              join(&quot;\n\t&quot;, $rr-&gt;char_str_list());

       Returns a list of the individual &lt;character-string&gt; elements, as unquoted
       strings.  Used by TXT-&gt;rdatastr and TXT-&gt;rr_rdata.

       NB: rdatastr will return quoted strings.

FEATURES
       The RR.pm module accepts semi-colons as a start of a comment. This is to
       allow the RR.pm to deal with RFC1035 specified zonefile format.

       For some applications of the TXT RR the semicolon is relevant, you will
       need to escape it on input.

       Also note that you should specify the several character strings
       separately. The easiest way to do so is to include the whole argument in
       single quotes and the several character strings in double quotes. Double
       quotes inside the character strings will need to be escaped.

       my $TXTrr=Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new(&apos;txt2.t.net-dns.org.  60   IN      TXT
       &quot;Test1 \&quot; \; more stuff&quot;  &quot;Test2&quot;&apos;);

       would result in $TXTrr-&gt;char_str_list())[0] containing &apos;Test1 &quot; ; more
       stuff&apos; and $TXTrr-&gt;char_str_list())[1] containing &apos;Test2&apos;

       Note that the rdatastr method (and therefore the print, and string
       method) returns the escaped format.
