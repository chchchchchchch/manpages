NAME
       Net::HTTPS - Low-level HTTP over SSL/TLS connection (client)

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;Net::HTTPS&quot; is a low-level HTTP over SSL/TLS client.  The interface
       is the same as the interface for &quot;Net::HTTP&quot;, but the constructor method
       take additional parameters as accepted by IO::Socket::SSL.  The
       &quot;Net::HTTPS&quot; object isa &quot;IO::Socket::SSL&quot; too, which make it inherit
       additional methods from that base class.

       For historical reasons this module also supports using &quot;Net::SSL&quot; (from
       the Crypt-SSLeay distribution) as its SSL driver and base class.  This
       base is automatically selected if available and &quot;IO::Socket::SSL&quot; isn&apos;t.
       You might also force which implementation to use by setting
       $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS before loading this module.  If not set
       this variable is initialized from the &quot;PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS&quot;
       environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
       You might set the &quot;PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS&quot; environment variable
       to the name of the base SSL implementation (and Net::HTTPS base class) to
       use.  The default is &quot;IO::Socket::SSL&quot;.  Currently the only other
       supported value is &quot;Net::SSL&quot;.
