NAME
       Net::SSL - support for Secure Sockets Layer

METHODS
       new Creates a new &quot;Net::SSL&quot; object.

       configure
           Configures a &quot;Net::SSL&quot; socket for operation.

       configure_certs
           Sets up a certificate file to use for communicating with on the
           socket.

       connect
       die_with_error
       get_cipher
       get_lwp_object
           Walks up the caller stack and looks for something blessed into the
           &quot;LWP::UserAgent&quot; namespace and returns it. Vaguely deprecated.

       get_peer_certificate
           Gets the peer certificate from the underlying &quot;Crypt::SSLeay::Conn&quot;
           object.

       get_peer_verify
       get_shared_ciphers
       getchunk
           Attempts to read up to 32KiB of data from the socket. Returns &quot;undef&quot;
           if nothing was read, otherwise returns the data as a scalar.

       getline
           Reads one character at a time until a newline is encountered, and
           returns the line, including the newline. Grossly inefficient.

       print
           Concatenates the input parameters and writes them to the socket.
           Does not honour $, nor $/. Returns the number of bytes written.

       printf
           Performs a &quot;sprintf&quot; of the input parameters (thus, the first
           parameter must be the format), and writes the result to the socket.
           Returns the number of bytes written.

       proxy
           Returns the hostname of an https proxy server, as specified by the
           &quot;HTTPS_PROXY&quot; environment variable.

       proxy_connect_helper
           Helps set up a connection through a proxy.

       read
           Performs a read on the socket and returns the result.

       ssl_context
       sysread
           Is an alias of &quot;read&quot;.

       timeout
           Returns the timeout value of the socket as defined by the
           implementing class or 60 seconds by default.

       blocking
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the underlying socket is in
           blocking mode. By default, Net::SSL sockets are in blocking mode.

               $sock-&gt;blocking(0); # set to non-blocking mode

           This method simply calls the underlying &quot;blocking&quot; method of the
           IO::Socket object.

       write
           Writes the parameters passed in (thus, a list) to the socket. Returns
           the number of bytes written.

       syswrite
           Is an alias of &quot;write&quot;.

       accept
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       getc
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       getlines
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       ungetc
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       send_useragent_to_proxy
           By default (as of version 2.80 of &quot;Net::SSL&quot; in the 0.54 distribution
           of Crypt::SSLeay), the user agent string is no longer sent to the
           proxy (but will continue to be sent to the remote host).

           The previous behaviour was of marginal benefit, and could cause fatal
           errors in certain scenarios (see CPAN bug #4759) and so no longer
           happens by default.

           To reinstate the old behaviour, call
           &quot;Net::SSL::send_useragent_to_proxy&quot; with a true value (usually 1).

DIAGNOSTICS
         &quot;no port given for proxy server &lt;proxy&gt;&quot;

       A proxy was specified for configuring a socket, but no port number was
       given. Ensure that the proxy is specified as a host:port pair, such as
       &quot;proxy.example.com:8086&quot;.

         &quot;configure certs failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;&quot;

         &quot;proxy connect failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;&quot;

         &quot;Connect failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;&quot;

       During connect().

   SEE ALSO
       IO::Socket::INET
           &quot;Net::SSL&quot; is implemented by subclassing &quot;IO::Socket::INET&quot;, hence
           methods not specifically overridden are defined by that package.

       Net::SSLeay
           A package that provides a Perl-level interface to the &quot;openssl&quot;
           secure sockets layer library.
