NAME
       Net::SSLeay::Handle - Perl module that lets SSL (HTTPS) sockets be
       handled as standard file handles.

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::SSLeay::Handle qw/shutdown/;
         my ($host, $port) = (&quot;localhost&quot;, 443);

         tie(*SSL, &quot;Net::SSLeay::Handle&quot;, $host, $port);

         print SSL &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n&quot;;
         shutdown(\*SSL, 1);
         print while (&lt;SSL&gt;);
         close SSL;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::SSLeay::Handle allows you to request and receive HTTPS web pages
       using &quot;old-fashion&quot; file handles as in:

           print SSL &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n&quot;;

       and

           print while (&lt;SSL&gt;);

       If you export the shutdown routine, then the only extra code that you
       need to add to your program is the tie function as in:

           my $socket;
           if ($scheme eq &quot;https&quot;) {
               tie(*S2, &quot;Net::SSLeay::Handle&quot;, $host, $port);
               $socket = \*S2;
           else {
               $socket = Net::SSLeay::Handle-&gt;make_socket($host, $port);
           }
           print $socket $request_headers;
           ...

FUNCTIONS
       shutdown
             shutdown(\*SOCKET, $mode)

           Calls to the main shutdown() don&apos;t work with tied sockets created
           with this module.  This shutdown should be able to distinquish
           between tied and untied sockets and do the right thing.

       debug
             my $debug = Net::SSLeay::Handle-&gt;debug()
             Net::SSLeay::Handle-&gt;debug(1)

           Get/set debuging mode. Always returns the debug value before the
           function call.  if an additional argument is given the debug option
           will be set to this value.

       make_socket
             my $sock = Net::SSLeay::Handle-&gt;make_socket($host, $port);

           Creates a socket that is connected to $post using $port. It uses
           $Net::SSLeay::proxyhost and proxyport if set and authentificates
           itself against this proxy depending on $Net::SSLeay::proxyauth. It
           also turns autoflush on for the created socket.
&#12;   USING EXISTING SOCKETS
       One of the motivations for writing this module was to avoid duplicating
       socket creation code (which is mostly error handling).  The calls to
       tie() above where it is passed a $host and $port is provided for
       convenience testing.  If you already have a socket connected to the right
       host and port, S1, then you can do something like:

           my $socket \*S1;
           if ($scheme eq &quot;https&quot;) {
               tie(*S2, &quot;Net::SSLeay::Handle&quot;, $socket);
               $socket = \*S2;
           }
           my $last_sel = select($socket); $| = 1; select($last_sel);
           print $socket $request_headers;
           ...

       Note: As far as I know you must be careful with the globs in the tie()
       function.  The first parameter must be a glob (*SOMETHING) and the last
       parameter must be a reference to a glob (\*SOMETHING_ELSE) or a scaler
       that was assigned to a reference to a glob (as in the example above)

       Also, the two globs must be different.  When I tried to use the same
       glob, I got a core dump.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

       You can export the shutdown() function.

       It is suggested that you do export shutdown() or use the fully qualified
       Net::SSLeay::Handle::shutdown() function to shutdown SSL sockets.  It
       should be smart enough to distinguish between SSL and non-SSL sockets and
       do the right thing.

EXAMPLES
         use Net::SSLeay::Handle qw/shutdown/;
         my ($host, $port) = (&quot;localhost&quot;, 443);

         tie(*SSL, &quot;Net::SSLeay::Handle&quot;, $host, $port);

         print SSL &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n&quot;;
         shutdown(\*SSL, 1);
         print while (&lt;SSL&gt;);
         close SSL;

TODO
       Better error handling.  Callback routine?

CAVEATS
       Tying to a file handle is a little tricky (for me at least).

       The first parameter to tie() must be a glob (*SOMETHING) and the last
       parameter must be a reference to a glob (\*SOMETHING_ELSE) or a scaler
       that was assigned to a reference to a glob ($s = \*SOMETHING_ELSE).
       Also, the two globs must be different.  When I tried to use the same
       glob, I got a core dump.

       I was able to associate attributes to globs created by this module (like
       *SSL above) by making a hash of hashes keyed by the file head1.

       Support for old perls may not be 100%. If in trouble try 5.6.0 or newer.

CHANGES
       Please see Net-SSLeay-Handle-0.50/Changes file.

KNOWN BUGS
       If you let this module construct sockets for you with Perl versions below
       v.5.6 then there is a slight memory leak.  Other upgrade your Perl, or
       create the sockets yourself.  The leak was created to let these older
       versions of Perl access more than one Handle at a time.
