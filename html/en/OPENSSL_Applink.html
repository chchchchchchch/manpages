OPENSSL_Applink(3SSL)                OpenSSL               OPENSSL_Applink(3SSL)



NAME
       OPENSSL_Applink - glue between OpenSSL BIO and Win32 compiler run-time

SYNOPSIS
        __declspec(dllexport) void **OPENSSL_Applink();

DESCRIPTION
       OPENSSL_Applink is application-side interface which provides a glue
       between OpenSSL BIO layer and Win32 compiler run-time environment.  Even
       though it appears at application side, it&apos;s essentially OpenSSL private
       interface. For this reason application developers are not expected to
       implement it, but to compile provided module with compiler of their
       choice and link it into the target application.  The referred module is
       available as &lt;openssl&gt;/ms/applink.c.
