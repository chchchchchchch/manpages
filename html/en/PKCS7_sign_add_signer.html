NAME
       PKCS7_sign_add_signer - add a signer PKCS7 signed data structure.

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/pkcs7.h&gt;

        PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *PKCS7_sign_add_signer(PKCS7 *p7, X509 *signcert, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *md, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       PKCS7_sign_add_signer() adds a signer with certificate signcert and
       private key pkey using message digest md to a PKCS7 signed data structure
       p7.

       The PKCS7 structure should be obtained from an initial call to
       PKCS7_sign() with the flag PKCS7_PARTIAL set or in the case or re-signing
       a valid PKCS7 signed data structure.

       If the md parameter is NULL then the default digest for the public key
       algorithm will be used.

       Unless the PKCS7_REUSE_DIGEST flag is set the returned PKCS7 structure is
       not complete and must be finalized either by streaming (if applicable) or
       a call to PKCS7_final().

NOTES
       The main purpose of this function is to provide finer control over a
       PKCS#7 signed data structure where the simpler PKCS7_sign() function
       defaults are not appropriate. For example if multiple signers or non
       default digest algorithms are needed.

       Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the flags
       parameter.

       If PKCS7_REUSE_DIGEST is set then an attempt is made to copy the content
       digest value from the PKCS7 struture: to add a signer to an existing
       structure.  An error occurs if a matching digest value cannot be found to
       copy. The returned PKCS7 structure will be valid and finalized when this
       flag is set.

       If PKCS7_PARTIAL is set in addition to PKCS7_REUSE_DIGEST then the
       PKCS7_SIGNER_INO structure will not be finalized so additional attributes
       can be added. In this case an explicit call to PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_sign()
       is needed to finalize it.

       If PKCS7_NOCERTS is set the signer&apos;s certificate will not be included in
       the PKCS7 structure, the signer&apos;s certificate must still be supplied in
       the signcert parameter though. This can reduce the size of the signature
       if the signers certificate can be obtained by other means: for example a
       previously signed message.

       The signedData structure includes several PKCS#7 autenticatedAttributes
       including the signing time, the PKCS#7 content type and the supported
       list of ciphers in an SMIMECapabilities attribute. If PKCS7_NOATTR is set
       then no authenticatedAttributes will be used. If PKCS7_NOSMIMECAP is set
       then just the SMIMECapabilities are omitted.

       If present the SMIMECapabilities attribute indicates support for the
       following algorithms: triple DES, 128 bit RC2, 64 bit RC2, DES and 40 bit
       RC2. If any of these algorithms is disabled then it will not be included.

       PKCS7_sign_add_signers() returns an internal pointer to the
       PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO structure just added, this can be used to set
       additional attributes before it is finalized.

RETURN VALUES
       PKCS7_sign_add_signers() returns an internal pointer to the
       PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO structure just added or NULL if an error occurs.
