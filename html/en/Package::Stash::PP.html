NAME
       Package::Stash::PP - pure perl implementation of the Package::Stash API

VERSION
       version 0.33

SYNOPSIS
         use Package::Stash;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a backend for Package::Stash implemented in pure perl, for those
       without a compiler or who would like to use this inline in scripts.

BUGS
       &#183;   remove_symbol also replaces the associated typeglob

           This can cause unexpected behavior when doing manipulation at compile
           time - removing subroutines will still allow them to be called from
           within the package as subroutines (although they will not be
           available as methods). This can be considered a feature in some cases
           (this is how namespace::clean works, for instance), but should not be
           relied upon - use &quot;remove_glob&quot; directly if you want this behavior.

       &#183;   Some minor memory leaks

           The pure perl implementation has a couple minor memory leaks (see the
           TODO tests in t/20-leaks.t) that I&apos;m having a hard time tracking down
           - these may be core perl bugs, it&apos;s hard to tell.

       rt.cpan.org&quot;, or browse to
