       Package::Stash API

VERSION
       version 0.24

SYNOPSIS
         use Package::Stash;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a backend for Package::Stash, which provides the functionality in
       a way that&apos;s less buggy and much faster. It will be used by default if
       it&apos;s installed, and should be preferred in all environments with a
       compiler.
