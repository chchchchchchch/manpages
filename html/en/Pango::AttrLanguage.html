NAME
       Pango::AttrLanguage - used to represent attributes that are languages

HIERARCHY
         Glib::Boxed
         +----Pango::AttrLanguage

METHODS
   attribute = Pango::AttrLanguage-&gt;new ($language, ...)
       &#183;   $language (Pango::Language)

       &#183;   ... (list)

       &quot;Pango::AttrLanguage&quot; doesn&apos;t take a reference and doesn&apos;t copy the
       &quot;Pango::Language&quot; object, but demands its validity nonetheless.  So make
       sure the language object stays alive at least as long as the attribute.

   language = $attr-&gt;value (...)
       &#183;   ... (list)
