NAME
       Parse::DebianChangelog::Util - utility functions for parsing Debian
       changelogs

DESCRIPTION
       This is currently only used internally by Parse::DebianChangelog.  There
       may be still API changes until this module is finalized.

   Functions
       find_closes

       Takes one string as argument and finds &quot;Closes: #123456, #654321&quot;
       statements as supported by the Debian Archive software in it. Returns all
       closed bug numbers in an array reference.

       data2rfc822

       Takes two hash references as arguments. The first should contain the data
       to output in RFC822 format. The second can contain a sorting order for
       the fields. The higher the numerical value of the hash value, the earlier
       the field is printed if it exists.

       Return the data in RFC822 format as string.

       data2rfc822_mult

       The first argument should be an array ref to an array of hash references.
       The second argument is a hash reference and has the same meaning as the
       second argument of data2rfc822.

       Calls data2rfc822 for each element of the array given as first argument
       and returns the concatenated results.

       get_dpkg_changes

       Takes a Parse::DebianChangelog::Entry object as first argument.

       Returns a string that is suitable for using it in a &quot;Changes&quot; field in
       the output format of &quot;dpkg-parsechangelog&quot;.
