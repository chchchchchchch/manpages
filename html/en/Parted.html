PARTED(8)                       GNU Parted Manual                      PARTED(8)



NAME
       GNU Parted - a partition manipulation program

SYNOPSIS
       parted [options] [device [command [options...]...]]

DESCRIPTION
       parted  is a disk partitioning and partition resizing program.  It allows
       you to create, destroy, resize, move  and  copy  ext2,  linux-swap,  FAT,
       FAT32,  and  reiserfs partitions.  It can create, resize, and move Macin&#8208;
       tosh HFS partitions, as well as detect jfs, ntfs,  ufs,  and  xfs  parti&#8208;
       tions.   It is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reor&#8208;
       ganising disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks.

       This manual page documents parted  briefly.   Complete  documentation  is
       distributed with the package in GNU Info format; see near the bottom.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              displays a help message

       -l, --list
              lists partition layout on all block devices

       -m, --machine
              displays machine parseable output

       -s, --script
              never prompts for user intervention

       -v, --version
              displays the version

       -a alignment-type, --align alignment-type
              Set  alignment for newly created partitions, valid alignment types
              are:

              none   Use the minimum alignment allowed by the disk type.

              cylinder
                     Align partitions to cylinders.

              minimal
                     Use minimum alignment as given by the disk topology  infor&#8208;
                     mation.  This and the opt value will use layout information
                     provided by the disk to align the logical  partition  table
                     addresses  to actual physical blocks on the disks.  The min
                     value is the minimum aligment needed to align the partition
                     properly  to  physical  blocks,  which  avoids  performance
                     degradation.

              optimal
                     Use optimum alignment as given by the disk topology  infor&#8208;
                     mation.  This  aligns  to  a multiple of the physical block
                     size in a way that guarantees optimal performance.


COMMANDS
       [device]
              The block device to be used.  When none is given, parted will  use
              the first block device it finds.
&#12;       [command [options]]
              Specifies  the  command  to  be executed.  If no command is given,
              parted will present a command prompt.  Possible commands are:

              check partition
                     Do a simple check on partition.

              cp [source-device] source dest
                     Copy the source partition&apos;s filesystem on source-device (or
                     the current device if no other device was specified) to the
                     dest partition on the current device.

              help [command]
                     Print general help, or help on command if specified.

              mkfs partition fs-type
                     Make a filesystem fs-type on partition. fs-type can be  one
                     of &quot;fat16&quot;, &quot;fat32&quot;, &quot;ext2&quot;, &quot;linux-swap&quot;, or &quot;reiserfs&quot;.

              mklabel label-type
                     Create  a  new  disklabel  (partition table) of label-type.
                     label-type should be one of &quot;bsd&quot;,  &quot;dvh&quot;,  &quot;gpt&quot;,  &quot;loop&quot;,
                     &quot;mac&quot;, &quot;msdos&quot;, &quot;pc98&quot;, or &quot;sun&quot;.

              mkpart part-type [fs-type] start end
                     Make  a  part-type  partition  with  filesystem fs-type (if
                     specified), beginning  at  start  and  ending  at  end  (by
                     default  in  megabytes).   fs-type  can  be one of &quot;fat16&quot;,
                     &quot;fat32&quot;, &quot;ext2&quot;, &quot;HFS&quot;, &quot;linux-swap&quot;,  &quot;NTFS&quot;,  &quot;reiserfs&quot;,
                     or &quot;ufs&quot;.  part-type should be one of &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;,
                     or &quot;extended&quot;.

              mkpartfs part-type fs-type start end
                     Make a part-type partition with filesystem  fs-type  begin&#8208;
                     ning  at start and ending at end (by default in megabytes).
                     Using this command is discouraged.  Instead use  mkpart  to
                     create an empty partition, and then use external tools like
                     mke2fs(8) to create the filesystem.

              move partition start end
                     Move partition so that it begins at start and ends at  end.
                     Note: move never changes the minor number.

              name partition name
                     Set  the  name of partition to name. This option works only
                     on Mac, PC98, and GPT disklabels. The name can be placed in
                     quotes, if necessary.

              print  Display the partition table.

              quit   Exit from parted.

              rescue start end
                     Rescue  a lost partition that was located somewhere between
                     start and end.  If a partition is found, parted will ask if
                     you want to create an entry for it in the partition table.

              resize partition start end
                     Resize  the  filesystem  on  partition so that it begins at
                     start and ends at end (by default in megabytes).

              rm partition
                     Delete partition.

              select device
                     Choose device as the current device to edit. device  should
                     usually be a Linux hard disk device, but it can be a parti&#8208;
                     tion, software raid device, or an  LVM  logical  volume  if
                     necessary.

              set partition flag state
                     Change  the  state of the flag on partition to state.  Sup&#8208;
                     ported flags are: &quot;boot&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;swap&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot;, &quot;raid&quot;,
                     &quot;lvm&quot;,  &quot;lba&quot;,  &quot;legacy_boot&quot;  and &quot;palo&quot;.  state should be
                     either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;.

              unit unit
                     Set unit as the unit to use when displaying  locations  and
                     sizes,  and  for  interpreting those given by the user when
                     not suffixed with an explicit unit.  unit can be one of &quot;s&quot;
                     (sectors),  &quot;B&quot;  (bytes), &quot;kB&quot;, &quot;MB&quot;, &quot;GB&quot;, &quot;TB&quot;, &quot;%&quot; (per&#8208;
                     centage of device size), &quot;cyl&quot; (cylinders),  &quot;chs&quot;  (cylin&#8208;
                     ders,  heads,  sectors), or &quot;compact&quot; (megabytes for input,
                     and a human-friendly form for output).

              version
                     Display version information and a copyright message.

KNOWN ISSUES
       ext3 filesystem functionality does not currently work.   To  manage  ext3
       type filesystems use tools like resize2fs(8) or mke2fs(8).  Note that the
       currently supported ext2 filesystem will be deprecated once ext3  support
       is finalized.  Further note that ext3 support will have limited function&#8208;
       ality that is yet  to  be  defined.   Use  tools  like  resize2fs(8)  and
       mke2fs(8) to manage these types of filesystems.

       To   manually   resize   an   ext3  filesystem  and/or  a  partition  use
       resize2fs(8), fdisk(8) or similar tools.  For LVM  situations,  you  will
       need to use the LVM commands to resize the LVM elements.
