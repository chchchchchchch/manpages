NAME
       Pidgin - Perl extension for the Pidgin instant messenger.

SYNOPSIS
           use Pidgin;

ABSTRACT
           This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins in
           Pidgin, with access to the Pidgin Gtk interface functions.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins in
       Pidgin, with access to the Pidgin Gtk interface functions. With this,
       developers can write perl scripts that can be loaded in Pidgin as
       plugins. The script can interact with IMs, chats, accounts, the buddy
       list, pidgin signals, and more.

       The API for the perl interface is very similar to that of the Pidgin C
       API, which can be viewed at http://developer.pidgin.im/doxygen/ or in the
       header files in the Pidgin source tree.
