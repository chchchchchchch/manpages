Pod::Coverage(3pm)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    Pod::Coverage(3pm)



NAME
       Pod::Coverage - Checks if the documentation of a module is comprehensive

SYNOPSIS
         # in the beginnning...
         perl -MPod::Coverage=Pod::Coverage -e666

         # all in one invocation
         use Pod::Coverage package =&gt; &apos;Fishy&apos;;

         # straight OO
         use Pod::Coverage;
         my $pc = Pod::Coverage-&gt;new(package =&gt; &apos;Pod::Coverage&apos;);
         print &quot;We rock!&quot; if $pc-&gt;coverage == 1;

DESCRIPTION
       Developers hate writing documentation.  They&apos;d hate it even more if their
       computer tattled on them, but maybe they&apos;ll be even more thankful in the
       long run.  Even if not, perlmodstyle tells you to, so you must obey.

       This module provides a mechanism for determining if the pod for a given
       module is comprehensive.

       It expects to find either a &quot;=head(n&gt;1)&quot; or an &quot;=item&quot; block documenting
       a subroutine.

       Consider:
        # an imaginary Foo.pm
        package Foo;

        =item foo

        The foo sub

        = cut

        sub foo {}
        sub bar {}

        1;
        __END__

       In this example &quot;Foo::foo&quot; is covered, but &quot;Foo::bar&quot; is not, so the
       &quot;Foo&quot; package is only 50% (0.5) covered

   Methods
       Pod::Coverage-&gt;new(package =&gt; $package)
           Creates a new Pod::Coverage object.

           &quot;package&quot; the name of the package to analyse

           &quot;private&quot; an array of regexen which define what symbols are regarded
           as private (and so need not be documented) defaults to [ qr/^_/,
           qr/^(un)?import$/, qr/^DESTROY$/, qr/^AUTOLOAD$/, qr/^bootstrap$/,
                   qr/^(TIE( SCALAR | ARRAY | HASH | HANDLE ) |
                        FETCH | STORE | UNTIE | FETCHSIZE | STORESIZE |
                        POP | PUSH | SHIFT | UNSHIFT | SPLICE | DELETE |
                        EXISTS | EXTEND | CLEAR | FIRSTKEY | NEXTKEY | PRINT |
           PRINTF |
                        WRITE | READLINE | GETC | READ | CLOSE | BINMODE | OPEN
           |
                        EOF | FILENO | SEEK | TELL | SCALAR )$/x,
                   qr/^( MODIFY | FETCH )_( REF | SCALAR | ARRAY | HASH | CODE |
                                            GLOB | FORMAT | IO )_ATTRIBUTES$/x,
                   qr/^CLONE(_SKIP)?$/, ]

           This should cover all the usual magical methods for tie()d objects,
           attributes, generally all the methods that are typically not called
           by a user, but instead being used internally by perl.

           &quot;also_private&quot; items are appended to the private list

           &quot;trustme&quot; an array of regexen which define what symbols you just want
           us to assume are properly documented even if we can&apos;t find any docs
           for them

           If &quot;pod_from&quot; is supplied, that file is parsed for the documentation,
           rather than using Pod::Find

           If &quot;nonwhitespace&quot; is supplied, then only POD sections which have
           non-whitespace characters will count towards being documented.

       $object-&gt;coverage
           Gives the coverage as a value in the range 0 to 1

       $object-&gt;why_unrated
           &quot;$object-&gt;coverage&quot; may return &quot;undef&quot;, to indicate that it was
           unable to deduce coverage for a package.  If this happens you should
           be able to check &quot;why_unrated&quot; to get a useful excuse.

       $object-&gt;naked/$object-&gt;uncovered
           Returns a list of uncovered routines, will implicitly call coverage
           if it&apos;s not already been called.

           Note, private and &apos;trustme&apos; identifiers will be skipped.

       $object-&gt;covered
           Returns a list of covered routines, will implicitly call coverage if
           it&apos;s not previously been called.

           As with &quot;naked&quot;, private and &apos;trustme&apos; identifiers will be skipped.

   Debugging support
       In order to allow internals debugging, while allowing the optimiser to do
       its thang, &quot;Pod::Coverage&quot; uses constant subs to define how it traces.

       Use them like so

        sub Pod::Coverage::TRACE_ALL () { 1 }
        use Pod::Coverage;

       Supported constants are:

       TRACE_ALL
           Trace everything.

           Well that&apos;s all there is so far, are you glad you came?

   Inheritance interface
       These abstract methods while functional in &quot;Pod::Coverage&quot; may make your
       life easier if you want to extend &quot;Pod::Coverage&quot; to fit your house style
       more closely.

       NOTE Please consider this interface as in a state of flux until this
       comment goes away.

       $object-&gt;_CvGV($symbol)
           Return the GV for the coderef supplied.  Used by &quot;_get_syms&quot; to
           identify locally defined code.

           You probably won&apos;t need to override this one.

       $object-&gt;_get_syms($package)
           return a list of symbols to check for from the specified packahe

       _get_pods
           Extract pod markers from the currently active package.

           Return an arrayref or undef on fail.

       _private_check($symbol)
           return true if the symbol should be considered private

       _trustme_check($symbol)
           return true if the symbol is a &apos;trustme&apos; symbol

BUGS
       Due to the method used to identify documented subroutines &quot;Pod::Coverage&quot;
       may completely miss your house style and declare your code undocumented.
       Patches and/or failing tests welcome.

TODO
       Widen the rules for identifying documentation
       Improve the code coverage of the test suite.  &quot;Devel::Cover&quot; rocks so
       hard.
