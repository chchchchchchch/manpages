NAME
       RPC::XML::Parser - Interface for parsers created by
       RPC::XML::ParserFactory

SYNOPSIS
       This class is not instantiated directly; see RPC::XML::ParserFactory.

DESCRIPTION
       The RPC::XML::Parser class encapsulates the interface for the parsing
       process. It is an empty class that is used in conjuntion with the
       RPC::XML::ParserFactory class.

       All parser implementations that are intended to be returned by calls to
       RPC::XML::ParserFactory::new() should declare this as their parent class.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
       This class provides empty implementations for the following methods. A
       parser implementation must provide definitions for both of these methods.
       If the versions from this class are triggered they will throw exceptions
       (&quot;die&quot;).

       The descriptions below define the interface that implementations must
       adhere to.

       new([ARGS])
           Create a new instance of the class. Any extra data passed to the
           constructor is taken as key/value pairs (not a hash reference) and
           attached to the object.

           The following parameters are currently recognized:

           base64_to_fh
                   If passed with a true value, this tells the parser that
                   incoming Base64 data is to be spooled to a filehandle opened
                   onto an anonymous temporary file. The file itself is unlinked
                   after opening, though the resulting RPC::XML::base64 object
                   can use its &quot;to_file&quot; method to save the data to a specific
                   file at a later point. No checks on size are made; if this
                   option is set, all Base64 data goes to filehandles.

           base64_temp_dir
                   If this argument is passed, the value is taken as the
                   directory under which the temporary files are created. This
                   is so that the application is not locked in to the list of
                   directories that File::Spec defaults to with its &quot;tmpdir&quot;
                   method. If this is not passed, the previously-mentioned
                   method is used to derive the directory in which to create the
                   temporary files. Only relevant if base64_to_fh is set.

           The &quot;base64*&quot; parameters do not have to be implemented if the user
           has no plans to use the &quot;to_file&quot; method of the RPC::XML::base64
           data-class.

           As a special-case, to preserve backwards compatibility with pre-0.69
           versions of this package, new() has special behavior when
           specifically called for the package RPC::XML::Parser. When called for
           this package, the constructor quietly loads RPC::XML::ParserFactory
           and uses it to construct and return an instance of a parser based on
           XML::Parser.

       parse [ STRING | STREAM ]
           Parse the XML document specified in either a string or a stream. The
           stream may be any file descriptor, derivative of IO::Handle, etc.

           The value returned must be one of the following:

           RPC::XML::request instance
               When passed a valid XML-RPC request message, the return value
               should be an instance of the RPC::XML::request class.

           RPC::XML::response instance
               Likewise, when passed a valid XML-RPC response, the return value
               should be an instance of the RPC::XML::response class.

           string containing an error message
               If the message does not conform to either a request or a
               response, or does not properly parse, the return value must be a
               string containing the error message.

           A non-blocking (push) parser instance
               If no arguments are passed in, the return value must be a parser
               object that implements push-parsing (non-blocking). It does not
               have to be of the same class as the original object, but it must
               support the remaining two methods

       The next two methods are only called on push-parser instances, and as
       such do not have to be implemented by the actual factory-compatible
       parser. It is enough if the non-blocking parser instance it returns from
       the no-argument call to parse() implements these:

       parse_more STRING
           Send a chunk of the current XML document to the parser for
           processing.

       parse_done
           Signal the end of parsing. The return value from this should be one
           of the same three possibilities that the direct use of parse()
           (above) returns:

           RPC::XML::request instance
           RPC::XML::response instance
           string containing an error message

           parse_done() may also signal an error by throwing an exception.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Unless otherwises specified, routines return the object reference itself
       upon a successful operation, and an error string (which is not a blessed
       reference) upon error.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to &quot;bug-rpc-xml at
       rt.cpan.org&quot;, or through the web interface at
       http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=RPC-XML
       &lt;http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=RPC-XML&gt;. I will be
