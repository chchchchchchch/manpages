RSA_generate_key(3SSL)               OpenSSL              RSA_generate_key(3SSL)



NAME
       RSA_generate_key - generate RSA key pair

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/rsa.h&gt;

        RSA *RSA_generate_key(int num, unsigned long e,
           void (*callback)(int,int,void *), void *cb_arg);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA_generate_key() generates a key pair and returns it in a newly
       allocated RSA structure. The pseudo-random number generator must be
       seeded prior to calling RSA_generate_key().

       The modulus size will be num bits, and the public exponent will be e. Key
       sizes with num &lt; 1024 should be considered insecure.  The exponent is an
       odd number, typically 3, 17 or 65537.

       A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress of
       the key generation. If callback is not NULL, it will be called as
       follows:

       &#183;   While a random prime number is generated, it is called as described
           in BN_generate_prime(3).

       &#183;   When the n-th randomly generated prime is rejected as not suitable
           for the key, callback(2, n, cb_arg) is called.

       &#183;   When a random p has been found with p-1 relatively prime to e, it is
           called as callback(3, 0, cb_arg).

       The process is then repeated for prime q with callback(3, 1, cb_arg).

RETURN VALUE
       If key generation fails, RSA_generate_key() returns NULL; the error codes
       can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

BUGS
       callback(2, x, cb_arg) is used with two different meanings.

       RSA_generate_key() goes into an infinite loop for illegal input values.

HISTORY
       The cb_arg argument was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.
