XS(3pm)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               XS(3pm)



NAME
       Readonly::XS - Companion module for Readonly.pm, to speed up read-only
       scalar variables.

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.04 of Readonly::XS, December 6, 2005.

SYNOPSIS
         Install this module, but do not use it.

DESCRIPTION
       The Readonly module (q.v.) is an effective way to create non-modifiable
       variables.  However, it&apos;s relatively slow.

       The reason it&apos;s slow is that is implements the read-only-ness of
       variables via tied objects.  This mechanism is inherently slow.  Perl
       simply has to do a lot of work under the hood to make tied variables
       work.

       This module corrects the speed problem, at least with respect to scalar
       variables.  When Readonly::XS is installed, Readonly uses it to access
       the internals of scalar variables.  Instead of creating a scalar variable
       object and tying it, Readonly simply flips the SvREADONLY bit in the
       scalar&apos;s FLAGS structure.

       Readonly arrays and hashes are not sped up by this, since the SvREADONLY
       flag only works for scalars.  Arrays and hashes always use the tie
       interface.

       Why implement this as a separate module?  Because not everyone can use
       XS.  Not everyone has a C compiler.  Also, installations with a
       statically-linked perl may not want to recompile their perl binary just
       for this module.  Rather than render Readonly.pm useless for
        these people, the XS portion was put into a separate module.

       Programs that you write do not need to know whether Readonly::XS is
       installed or not.  They should just &quot;use Readonly&quot; and let Readonly worry
       about whether or not it can use XS.  If the Readonly::XS is present,
       Readonly will be faster.  If not, it won&apos;t.  Either way, it will still
       work, and your code will not have to change.

       Your program can check whether Readonly.pm is using XS or not by
       examining the $Readonly::XSokay variable.  It will be true if the XS
       module was found and is being used.  Please do not change this variable.

   EXPORTS
       None.
