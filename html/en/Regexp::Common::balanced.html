NAME
       Regexp::Common::balanced -- provide regexes for strings with balanced
       parenthesized delimiters or arbitrary delimiters.

SYNOPSIS
           use Regexp::Common qw /balanced/;

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /$RE{balanced}{-parens=&gt;&apos;()&apos;}/
                                          and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of
       the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{balanced}{-parens}
       Returns a pattern that matches a string that starts with the nominated
       opening parenthesis or bracket, contains characters and properly nested
       parenthesized subsequences, and ends in the matching parenthesis.

       More than one type of parenthesis can be specified:

               $RE{balanced}{-parens=&gt;&apos;(){}&apos;}

       in which case all specified parenthesis types must be correctly balanced
       within the string.

       If we are using C{-keep} (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire expression

   $RE{balanced}{-begin =&gt; &quot;begin&quot;}{-end =&gt; &quot;end&quot;}
       Returns a pattern that matches a string that is properly balanced using
       the begin and end strings as start and end delimiters.  Multiple sets of
       begin and end strings can be given by separating them by &quot;|&quot;s (which can
       be escaped with a backslash).

           qr/$RE{balanced}{-begin =&gt; &quot;do|if|case&quot;}{-end =&gt; &quot;done|fi|esac&quot;}/

       will match properly balanced strings that either start with do and end
       with done, start with if and end with fi, or start with case and end with
       esac.

       If -end contains less cases than -begin, the last case of -end is
       repeated. If it contains more cases than -begin, the extra cases are
       ignored. If either of -begin or -end isn&apos;t given, or is empty, -begin =&gt;
       &apos;(&apos; and -end =&gt; &apos;)&apos; are assumed.

       If we are using C{-keep} (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire expression
