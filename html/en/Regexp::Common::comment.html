DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of
       the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for comments in various
       languages.

   THE LANGUAGES
       Below, the comments of each of the languages are described.  The patterns
       are available as $RE{comment}{LANG}, foreach language LANG. Some
       languages have variants; it&apos;s described at the individual languages how
       to get the patterns for the variants.  Unless mentioned otherwise,
       &quot;{-keep}&quot; sets $1, $2, $3 and $4 to the entire comment, the opening
       marker, the content of the comment, and the closing marker (for many
       languages, the latter is a newline) respectively.

       ABC Comments in ABC start with a backslash (&quot;\&quot;), and last till the end
           of the line.  See &lt;http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/&gt;.

       Ada Comments in Ada start with &quot;--&quot;, and last till the end of the line.

       Advisor
           Advisor is a language used by the HP product glance. Comments for
           this language start with either &quot;#&quot; or &quot;//&quot;, and last till the end of
           the line.

       Advsys
           Comments for the Advsys language start with &quot;;&quot; and last till the end
           of the line. See also &lt;http://www.wurb.com/if/devsys/12&gt;.

       Alan

       Algol 60
           Comments in the Algol 60 language start with the keyword &quot;comment&quot;,
           and end with a &quot;;&quot;. See &lt;http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm&gt;.

       Algol 68
           In Algol 68, comments are either delimited by &quot;#&quot;, or by one of the
           keywords &quot;co&quot; or &quot;comment&quot;. The keywords should not be part of
           another word. See
           http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt
           &lt;http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt&gt;.  With
           &quot;{-keep}&quot;, only $1 will be set, returning the entire comment.

       ALPACA
           The ALPACA language has comments starting with &quot;/*&quot; and ending with
           &quot;*/&quot;.

       awk The awk programming language uses comments that start with &quot;#&quot; and
           end at the end of the line.

       B   The B language has comments starting with &quot;/*&quot; and ending with &quot;*/&quot;.

       BASIC
           There are various forms of BASIC around. Currently, we only support
           the variant supported by mvEnterprise, whose pattern is available as
           $RE{comment}{BASIC}{mvEnterprise}. Comments in this language start
           with a &quot;!&quot;, a &quot;*&quot; or the keyword &quot;REM&quot;, and end till the end of the
           line. See
           &lt;http://www.rainingdata.com/products/beta/docs/mve/50/ReferenceManual/Basic.pdf&gt;.

       Beatnik
           The esotoric language Beatnik only uses words consisting of letters.
           Words are scored according to the rules of Scrabble. Words scoring
           less than 5 points, or 18 points or more are considered comments
           (although the compiler might mock at you if you score less than 5
           points).  Regardless whether &quot;{-keep}&quot;, $1 will be set, and set to
           the entire comment. This pattern requires perl 5.8.0 or newer.

           &lt;http://developer.nvidia.com/attach/3722&gt;.

       CLU In &quot;CLU&quot;, a comment starts with a procent sign (&quot;%&quot;), and ends with
           the next newline. See ftp://ftp.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/pclu/CLU-syntax.ps
           &lt;ftp://ftp.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/pclu/CLU-syntax.ps&gt; and
           &lt;http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/CLU.html&gt;.

       COBOL
           Traditionally, comments in COBOL are indicated by an asteriks in the
           seventh column. This is what the pattern matches. Modern compiler may
           more lenient though. See
           &lt;http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/Course/COBOLIntro.htm&gt;, and
           &lt;http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/default.htm&gt;. Due to a bug in the regexp
           engine of perl 5.6.x, this regexp is only available in version 5.8.0
           and up.

       CQL Comments in the chess query language (CQL) start with a semi colon
           (&quot;;&quot;) and last till the end of the line. See

           There are two types of comments in Dylan. They either start with
           &quot;//&quot;, or are nested comments, delimited with &quot;/*&quot; and &quot;*/&quot;.  Under
           &quot;{-keep}&quot;, only $1 will be set, returning the entire comment.  This
           pattern requires perl 5.6.0 or newer.

       ECMAScript
           The ECMAScript language has two forms of comments. Comments that
           start with &quot;//&quot; and last till the end of the line, and comments that
           start with &quot;/*&quot;, and end with &quot;*/&quot;. If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, only $1
           will be set, and set to the entire comment. JavaScript is Netscapes
           implementation of ECMAScript. See

       FPL The FPL language has two forms of comments. Comments that start with
           &quot;//&quot; and last till the end of the line, and comments that start with
           &quot;/*&quot;, and end with &quot;*/&quot;. If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, only $1 will be set,
           and set to the entire comment.

       Fortran
           There are two forms of Fortran. There&apos;s free form Fortran, which has
           comments that start with &quot;!&quot;, and end at the end of the line.  The
           pattern for this is given by $RE{Fortran}. Fixed form Fortran, which
           has been obsoleted, has comments that start with &quot;C&quot;, &quot;c&quot; or &quot;*&quot; in
           the first column, or with &quot;!&quot; anywhere, but the sixth column.  The
           pattern for this are given by $RE{Fortran}{fixed}.

       Funge-98
           The esotoric language Funge-98 uses comments that start and end with
           a &quot;;&quot;.

       fvwm2
           Configuration files for fvwm2 have comments starting with a &quot;#&quot; and
           lasting the rest of the line.

       Haifu
           Haifu, an esotoric language using haikus, has comments starting and
           ending with a &quot;,&quot;.  See
           &lt;http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/haifu.html&gt;.

       Haskell
           There are two types of comments in Haskell. They either start with at
           least two dashes, or are nested comments, delimited with &quot;{-&quot; and
           &quot;-}&quot;.  Under &quot;{-keep}&quot;, only $1 will be set, returning the entire
           comment.  This pattern requires perl 5.6.0 or newer.

       HTML
           In HTML, comments only appear inside a comment declaration.  A
           comment declaration starts with a &quot;&lt;!&quot;, and ends with a &quot;&gt;&quot;. Inside
           this declaration, we have zero or more comments.  Comments starts
           with &quot;--&quot; and end with &quot;--&quot;, and are optionally followed by
           whitespace. The pattern $RE{comment}{HTML} recognizes those comment
           declarations (and hence more than a comment).  Note that this is not
           the same as something that starts with &quot;&lt;!--&quot; and ends with &quot;--&gt;&quot;,
           because the following will be matched completely:

               &lt;!--  First  Comment   --
                 --&gt; Second Comment &lt;!--
                 --  Third  Comment   --&gt;

           Do not be fooled by what your favourite browser thinks is an HTML
           comment.

           If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, the following are returned:

           $1  captures the entire comment declaration.

           $2  captures the MDO (markup declaration open), &quot;&lt;!&quot;.

           $3  captures the content between the MDO and the MDC.
&#12;           $4  captures the (last) comment, without the surrounding dashes.

           $5  captures the MDC (markup declaration close), &quot;&gt;&quot;.

       Hugo
           There are two types of comments in Hugo. They either start with &quot;!&quot;
           (which cannot be followed by a &quot;\&quot;), or are nested comments,
           delimited with &quot;!\&quot; and &quot;\!&quot;.  Under &quot;{-keep}&quot;, only $1 will be set,
           returning the entire comment.  This pattern requires perl 5.6.0 or
           newer.

       Icon
           Icon has comments that start with &quot;#&quot; and end at the next new line.
           See &lt;http://www.toolsofcomputing.com/IconHandbook/IconHandbook.pdf&gt;,
           &lt;http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/index.htm&gt;, and

       ILLGOL
           The esotoric language ILLGOL uses comments starting with NB and
           lasting till the end of the line.  See
           &lt;http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/illgol/index.html&gt;.

       INTERCAL
           Comments in INTERCAL are single line comments. They start with one of
           the keywords &quot;NOT&quot; or &quot;N&apos;T&quot;, and can optionally be preceded by the
           keywords &quot;DO&quot; and &quot;PLEASE&quot;. If both keywords are used, &quot;PLEASE&quot;
           precedes &quot;DO&quot;. Keywords are separated by whitespace.

       J   The language J uses comments that start with &quot;NB.&quot;, and that last
           till the end of the line. See
           &lt;http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm&gt;, and
           &lt;http://www.jsoftware.com/&gt;.

       Java
           The Java language has two forms of comments. Comments that start with
           &quot;//&quot; and last till the end of the line, and comments that start with
           &quot;/*&quot;, and end with &quot;*/&quot;. If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, only $1 will be set,
           and set to the entire comment.

       JavaDoc
           The Javadoc documentation syntax is demarked with a subset of
           ordinary Java comments to separate it from code.  Comments start with
           &quot;/**&quot; end with &quot;*/&quot;.  If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, only $1 will be set, and
           set to the entire comment. See
           http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format
           &lt;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format&gt;.

       JavaScript
           The JavaScript language has two forms of comments. Comments that
           start with &quot;//&quot; and last till the end of the line, and comments that
           start with &quot;/*&quot;, and end with &quot;*/&quot;. If &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used, only $1
           will be set, and set to the entire comment. JavaScript is Netscapes
           implementation of ECMAScript.  See

           of the line.

       lua Comments for the lua language start with &quot;--&quot;, and last till the end
           of the line. See also &lt;http://www.lua.org/manual/manual.html&gt;.

       M, MUMPS
           In &quot;M&quot; (aka &quot;MUMPS&quot;), comments start with a semi-colon, and last till
           the end of a line. The language specification requires the semi-colon
           to be preceded by one or more linestart characters.  Those characters
           default to a space, but that&apos;s configurable. This requirement, of
           preceding the comment with linestart characters is not tested for.
           See &lt;ftp://ftp.intersys.com/pub/openm/ism/ism64docs.zip&gt;,
           &lt;http://mtechnology.intersys.com/mproducts/openm/index.html&gt;, and
           &lt;http://mcenter.com/mtrc/index.html&gt;.

       m4  By default, the preprocessor language m4 uses single line comments,
           that start with a &quot;#&quot; and continue to the end of the line, including
           the newline. The pattern &quot;$RE {comment} {m4}&quot; matches such comments.
           In m4, it is possible to change the starting token though.  See
           &lt;http://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/m4/m4.pdf&gt;,

       Pascal
           There are many implementations of Pascal. This modules provides
           pattern for comments of several implementations.

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}
               This is the pattern that recognizes comments according to the
               Pascal ISO standard. This standard says that comments start with
               either &quot;{&quot;, or &quot;(*&quot;, and end with &quot;}&quot; or &quot;*)&quot;. This means that
               &quot;{*)&quot; and &quot;(*}&quot; are considered to be comments. Many Pascal
               applications don&apos;t allow this.  See
               http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt
               &lt;http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt&gt;

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Alice}
               The Alice Pascal compiler accepts comments that start with &quot;{&quot;
               and end with &quot;}&quot;. Comments are not allowed to contain newlines.
               See &lt;http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/&gt;.

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}, $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and
           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
               The Delphi Pascal, Free Pascal and the Gnu Pascal Compiler
               implementations of Pascal all have comments that either start
               with &quot;//&quot; and last till the end of the line, are delimited with
               &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; or are delimited with &quot;(*&quot; and &quot;*)&quot;. Patterns for
               those comments are given by $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi},
               $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
               respectively. These patterns only set $1 when &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used,
               which will then include the entire comment.

           $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Workshop}
               The Workshop Pascal compiler, from SUN Microsystems, allows
               comments that are delimited with either &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot;, delimited
               with &quot;(*)&quot; and &quot;*&quot;), delimited with &quot;/*&quot;, and &quot;*/&quot;, or starting
               and ending with a double quote (&quot;&quot;&quot;). When &quot;{-keep}&quot; is used,
               only $1 is set, and returns the entire comment.

               See http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-5762
