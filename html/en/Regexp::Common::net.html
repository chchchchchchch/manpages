NAME
       Regexp::Common::net -- provide regexes for IPv4 addresses.

SYNOPSIS
           use Regexp::Common qw /net/;

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}/       and print &quot;Dotted decimal IP address&quot;;
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}/  and print &quot;Dotted hexadecimal IP address&quot;;
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep =&gt; &apos;:&apos;}/ and
                                      print &quot;Colon separated octal IP address&quot;;
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}/  and print &quot;Dotted binary IP address&quot;;
               /$RE{net}{MAC}/        and print &quot;MAC address&quot;;
               /$RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep =&gt; &quot; &quot;}/ and
                                      print &quot;Space separated octal MAC address&quot;;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of
       the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for various style IPv4 and MAC
       (or ethernet) addresses.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in &quot;dotted decimal&quot;.
       Note that while 318.99.183.11 is not a valid IP address, it does match
       &quot;/$RE{net}{IPv4}/&quot;, but this is because 318.99.183.11 contains a valid IP
       address, namely 18.99.183.11. To prevent the unwanted matching, one needs
       to anchor the regexp: &quot;/^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/&quot;.

       For this pattern and the next four, under &quot;-keep&quot; (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the final component of the address

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{dec}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in &quot;dotted decimal&quot;

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in &quot;dotted
       hexadecimal&quot;, with the letters &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F&quot; capitalized.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;. &quot;-sep=&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;-sep=&quot; &quot;&quot; are useful alternatives.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in &quot;dotted octal&quot;

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in &quot;dotted binary&quot;

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{MAC}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC or ethernet address as colon
       separated hexadecimals.

       For this pattern, and the next four, under &quot;-keep&quot; (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the fourth component of the address

       $6  captures the fifth component of the address

       $7  captures the sixth and final component of the address

       This pattern, and the next four, have a &quot;subs&quot; method as well, which will
       transform a matching MAC address into so called canonical format.
       Canonical format means that every component of the address will be
       exactly two hexadecimals (with a leading zero if necessary), and the
       components will be separated by a colon.

       The &quot;subs&quot; method will not work for binary MAC addresses if the Perl
       version predates 5.6.0.

   $RE{net}{MAC}{dec}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       decimals.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/:/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{MAC}{hex}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       hexadecimals, with the letters &quot;a&quot; to &quot;f&quot; in lower case.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/:/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       octals.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/:/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{MAC}{bin}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       binary numbers.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is &quot;qr/:/&quot;.

   $RE{net}{domain}
       Returns a pattern to match domains (and hosts) as defined in RFC 1035.
       Under I{-keep} only the entire domain name is returned.

       RFC 1035 says that a single space can be a domainname too. So, the
       pattern returned by $RE{net}{domain} recognizes a single space as well.
       This is not always what people want. If you want to recognize
       domainnames, but not a space, you can do one of two things, either use

           /(?! )$RE{net}{domain}/

       or use the &quot;{-nospace}&quot; option (without an argument).
