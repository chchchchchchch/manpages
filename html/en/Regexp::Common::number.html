NAME
       Regexp::Common::number -- provide regexes for numbers

SYNOPSIS
           use Regexp::Common qw /number/;

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /^$RE{num}{int}$/                and  print &quot;Integer\n&quot;;
               /^$RE{num}{real}$/               and  print &quot;Real\n&quot;;
               /^$RE{num}{real}{-base =&gt; 16}$/  and  print &quot;Hexadecimal real\n&quot;;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of
       the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{num}{int}{-base}{-sep}{-group}{-places}
       Returns a pattern that matches an integer.

       If &quot;-base =&gt; B&quot; is specified, the integer is in base B, with &quot;2 &lt;= B &lt;=
       36&quot;. For bases larger than 10, upper case letters are used. The default
       base is 10.

       If &quot;-sep =&gt; P&quot; is specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping
       marker within the number. If this option is not given, no grouping marker
       is used.

       If &quot;-group =&gt; N&quot; is specified, digits between grouping markers must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N digits. The default value of N is 3.
       If &quot;-group =&gt; N,M&quot; is specified, digits between grouping markers must be
       grouped in sequences of at least N digits, and at most M digits. This
       option is ignored unless the &quot;-sep&quot; option is used.

       If &quot;-places =&gt; N&quot; is specified, the integer recognized must be exactly N
       digits wide. If &quot;-places =&gt; N,M&quot; is specified, the integer must be at
       least N wide, and at most M characters. There is no default, which means
       that integers are unlimited in size. This option is ignored if the &quot;-sep&quot;
       option is used.

       For example:

        $RE{num}{int}                          # match 1234567
        $RE{num}{int}{-sep=&gt;&apos;,&apos;}               # match 1,234,567
        $RE{num}{int}{-sep=&gt;&apos;,?&apos;}              # match 1234567 or 1,234,567
        $RE{num}{int}{-sep=&gt;&apos;.&apos;}{-group=&gt;4}    # match 1.2345.6789

       Under &quot;-keep&quot; (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire number

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete set of digits

   $RE{num}{real}{-base}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       Returns a pattern that matches a floating-point number.

       If &quot;-base=N&quot; is specified, the number is assumed to be in that base (with
       A..Z representing the digits for 11..36). By default, the base is 10.
&#12;       If &quot;-radix=P&quot; is specified, the pattern P is used as the radix point for
       the number (i.e. the &quot;decimal point&quot; in base 10). The default is
       &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;.

       If &quot;-places=N&quot; is specified, the number is assumed to have exactly N
       places after the radix point.  If &quot;-places=M,N&quot; is specified, the number
       is assumed to have between M and N places after the radix point.  By
       default, the number of places is unrestricted.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping marker
       within the pre-radix section of the number. By default, no separator is
       allowed.

       If &quot;-group=N&quot; is specified, digits between grouping separators must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N characters. The default value of N is
       3.

       If &quot;-expon=P&quot; is specified, the pattern P is used as the exponential
       marker.  The default value of P is &quot;qr/[Ee]/&quot;.

       For example:

        $RE{num}{real}                  # matches 123.456 or -0.1234567
        $RE{num}{real}{-places=&gt;2}      # matches 123.45 or -0.12
        $RE{num}{real}{-places=&gt;&apos;0,3&apos;}  # matches 123.456 or 0 or 9.8
        $RE{num}{real}{-sep=&gt;&apos;[,.]?&apos;}   # matches 123,456 or 123.456
        $RE{num}{real}{-base=&gt;3&apos;}       # matches 121.102

       Under &quot;-keep&quot;:

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete mantissa

       $4  captures the whole number portion of the mantissa

       $5  captures the radix point

       $6  captures the fractional portion of the mantissa

       $7  captures the optional exponent marker

       $8  captures the entire exponent value

       $9  captures the optional sign of the exponent

       $10 captures the digits of the exponent

   $RE{num}{dec}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=&gt;10}{...}

   $RE{num}{oct}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=&gt;8}{...}

   $RE{num}{bin}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=&gt;2}{...}

   $RE{num}{hex}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=&gt;16}{...}

   $RE{num}{decimal}{-base}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}
       The same as $RE{num}{real}, except that an exponent isn&apos;t allowed.
       Hence, this returns a pattern matching decimal numbers.
&#12;       If &quot;-base=N&quot; is specified, the number is assumed to be in that base (with
       A..Z representing the digits for 11..36). By default, the base is 10.

       If &quot;-radix=P&quot; is specified, the pattern P is used as the radix point for
       the number (i.e. the &quot;decimal point&quot; in base 10). The default is
       &quot;qr/[.]/&quot;.

       If &quot;-places=N&quot; is specified, the number is assumed to have exactly N
       places after the radix point.  If &quot;-places=M,N&quot; is specified, the number
       is assumed to have between M and N places after the radix point.  By
       default, the number of places is unrestricted.

       If &quot;-sep=P&quot; specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping marker
       within the pre-radix section of the number. By default, no separator is
       allowed.

       If &quot;-group=N&quot; is specified, digits between grouping separators must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N characters. The default value of N is
       3.

       For example:

        $RE{num}{decimal}                  # matches 123.456 or -0.1234567
        $RE{num}{decimal}{-places=&gt;2}      # matches 123.45 or -0.12
        $RE{num}{decimal}{-places=&gt;&apos;0,3&apos;}  # matches 123.456 or 0 or 9.8
        $RE{num}{decimal}{-sep=&gt;&apos;[,.]?&apos;}   # matches 123,456 or 123.456
        $RE{num}{decimal}{-base=&gt;3&apos;}       # matches 121.102

       Under &quot;-keep&quot;:

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete mantissa

       $4  captures the whole number portion of the mantissa

       $5  captures the radix point

       $6  captures the fractional portion of the mantissa

   $RE{num}{square}
       Returns a pattern that matches a (decimal) square. Because Perl&apos;s
       arithmetic is lossy when using integers over about 53 bits, this pattern
       only recognizes numbers less than 9000000000000000, if one uses a Perl
       that is configured to use 64 bit integers. Otherwise, the limit is
       2147483647. These restrictions were introduced in versions 2.116 and
       2.117 of Regexp::Common. Regardless whether &quot;-keep&quot; was set, the matched
       number will be returned in $1.

       This pattern is available for version 5.008 and up.

   $RE{num}{roman}
       Returns a pattern that matches an integer written in Roman numbers.  Case
       doesn&apos;t matter. Only the more modern style, that is, no more than three
       repetitions of a letter, is recognized. The largest number matched is
       MMMCMXCIX, or 3999. Larger numbers cannot be expressed using ASCII
       characters. A future version will be able to deal with the Unicode
       symbols to match larger Roman numbers.

       Under &quot;-keep&quot;, the number will be captured in $1.
