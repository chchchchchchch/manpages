DESCRIPTION
       The  Simple  Authentication  and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for
       providing authentication and authorization  to  comunications  protocols.
       The  SASL framework is structured to permit negotiation among a number of
       authentication mechanisms. SASL may  be  used  in  SMTP,  IMAP  and  HTTP
       authentication.  It is also in use in XMPP, LDAP and BEEP. See MECHANISMS
       for the set of available SASL mechanisms provided with tcllib.

       The SASL framework operates using a simple multi-step challenge  response
       mechanism.  All  the  mechanisms work the same way although the number of
       steps may vary. In this implementation a callback procedure must be  pro&#8208;
       vided  from which the SASL framework will obtain users details. See CALL&#8208;
       BACK PROCEDURE for details of this procedure.

COMMANDS
       ::SASL::new option value ?...?
              Contruct a new SASL context. See OPTIONS for details of the possi&#8208;
              ble  options to this command. A context token is required for most
              of the SASL procedures.

       ::SASL::configure option value ?...?
              Modify and inspect the SASL context option. See OPTIONS  for  fur&#8208;
              ther details.

       ::SASL::step context challenge ?...?
              This  is the core procedure for using the SASL framework. The step
              procedure should be called until it returns 0. Each step  takes  a
              server  challenge string and the response is calculated and stored
              in the context. Each mechanism may require one or more steps.  For
              some steps there may be no server challenge required in which case
              an empty string should be provided for this parameter. All  mecha&#8208;
              nisms should accept an initial empty challenge.

       ::SASL::response context
              Returns  the  next  response  string  that  should  be sent to the
              server.

       ::SASL::reset context
              Re-initialize the SASL context. Discards any  internal  state  and
              permits the token to be reused.

       ::SASL::cleanup context
              Release  all  resources associated with the SASL context. The con&#8208;
              text token may not be used again after  this  procedure  has  been
              called.

       ::SASL::mechanisms ?type? ?minimum?
              Returns  a  list of all the available SASL mechanisms. The list is
              sorted by the mechanism preference value (see register)  with  the
              preferred  mechanisms and the head of the list. Any mechanism with
              a preference value less than theminimum (which defaults to  0)  is
              removed  from the returned list. This permits a security threshold
              to be set. Mechanisms with a  preference  less  that  25  transmit
              authentication  are  particularly susceptible to eavesdropping and
              should not be provided unless a secure  channel  is  in  use  (eg:
              tls).

              The  type parameter may be one of client or server and defaults to
              client.  Only mechanisms that have an implementation matching  the
              type  are returned (this permits servers to correctly declare sup&#8208;
              port only for mechanisms that actually provide a server  implemen&#8208;
              tation).

       ::SASL::register mechanism preference clientproc ?serverproc?
              New  mechanisms  can  be  added  to the package by registering the
              mechanism name and the implementing procedures. The server  proce&#8208;
              dure  is optional. The preference value is an integer that is used
              to order the list returned by the mechanisms command. Higher  val&#8208;
              ues  indicate  a  preferred mechanism. If the mechanism is already
              registered then the recorded values are updated.

OPTIONS
       -callback
              Specify a command to be evaluated when the SASL mechanism requires
              information about the user. The command is called with the current
              SASL context and a name specifying the  information  desired.  See
              EXAMPLES.

       -mechanism
              Set  the  SASL  mechanism to be used. See mechanisms for a list of
              supported authentication mechanisms.

       -service
              Set the service type for this context. Some  mechanisms  may  make
              use of this parameter (eg DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI and Kerberos). If not
              set it defaults to an  empty  string.  If  the  -type  is  set  to
              &apos;server&apos;  then  this option should be set to a valid service iden&#8208;
              tity. Some examples of valid service names are  smtp,  ldap,  beep
              and xmpp.

       -server
              This option is used to set the server name used in SASL challenges
              when operating as a SASL server.

       -type  The context type may be one of &apos;client&apos; or &apos;server&apos;.  The  default
              is  to operate as a client application and respond to server chal&#8208;
              lenges. Mechanisms may be written to support server-side SASL  and
              setting  this  option will cause each step to issue the next chal&#8208;
              lenge. A new context must be created for each incoming client con&#8208;
              nection when in server mode.

CALLBACK PROCEDURE
       When the SASL framework requires any user details it will call the proce&#8208;
       dure provided when the context was created with an argument that specfies
       the item of information required.

       In all cases a single response string should be returned.

       login  The callback procedure should return the users authorization iden&#8208;
              tity.  Return an empty string unless this is to  be  different  to
              the  authentication  identity. Read [1] for a discussion about the
              specific meaning of authorization  and  authentication  identities
              within SASL.

       username
              The  callback  procedure  should  return  the users authentication
              identity.  Read [1] for a discussion about the specific meaning of
              authorization and authentication identities within SASL.

       password
              The callback procedure should return the password that matches the
              authentication identity as used within the current realm.

              For server mechanisms  the  password  callback  should  always  be
              called with the authentication identity and the realm as the first
              two parameters.

       realm  Some SASL mechanisms use realms to partition authentication  iden&#8208;
              tities.   The  realm string is protocol dependent and is often the
              current DNS domain or in the case of the NTLM mechanism it is  the
              Windows NT domain name.

       hostname
              Returns the client host name - typically [info host].

MECHANISMS
       ANONYMOUS
              As  used  in  FTP  this mechanism only passes an email address for
              authentication. The ANONYMOUS mechanism is specified in [2].

       PLAIN  This is the simplest mechanism. The users  authentication  details
              are  transmitted  in plain text. This mechanism should not be pro&#8208;
              vided unless an encrypted link is in use - typically after SSL  or
              TLS has been negotiated.

       LOGIN  The  LOGIN  [1]  mechanism transmits the users details with base64
              encoding. This is no more secure than PLAIN  and  likewise  should
              not be used without a secure link.

       CRAM-MD5
              This  mechanism avoids sending the users password over the network
              in plain text by hashing the password with a server provided  ran&#8208;
              dom  value (known as a nonce). A disadvantage of this mechanism is
              that the server must maintain a database  of  plaintext  passwords
              for comparison. CRAM-MD5 was defined in [4].

       DIGEST-MD5
              This  mechanism  improves  upon the CRAM-MD5 mechanism by avoiding
              the need for the server to store plaintext passwords. With  digest
              authentication  the  server  needs  to store the MD5 digest of the
              users password which helps to make the system more secure.  As  in
              CRAM-MD5 the password is hashed with a server nonce and other data
              before being transmitted across the network. Specified in [3].

       OTP    OTP is the One-Time Password system described  in  RFC  2289  [6].
              This  mechanism  is  secure against replay attacks and also avoids
              storing password or password equivalents on  the  server.  Only  a
              digest  of  a seed and a passphrase is ever transmitted across the
              network. Requires the otp package from tcllib and one or  more  of
              the  cryptographic digest packages (md5 or sha-1 are the most com&#8208;
              monly used).
&#12;       NTLM   This is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft [5]  and  is
              in  common use for authenticating users in a Windows network envi&#8208;
              ronment. NTLM uses DES encryption and MD4  digests  of  the  users
              password  to  authenticate  a  connection. Certain weaknesses have
              been found in NTLM and thus there are a number of versions of  the
              protocol.   As  this  mechanism  has additional dependencies it is
              made available as a separate sub-package. To enable this mechanism
              your application must load the SASL::NTLM package.

       X-GOOGLE-TOKEN
              This  is  a  proprietary protocol developed by Google and used for
              authenticating users for the Google Talk service.  This  mechanism
              makes  a  pair  of  HTTP  requests over an SSL channel and so this
              mechanism depends upon the availability of the tls and http  pack&#8208;
              ages.  To  enable  this  mechanism  your application must load the
              SASL::XGoogleToken package.  In addition you  are  recommended  to
              make  use  of the autoproxy package to handle HTTP proxies reason&#8208;
              ably transparently.

EXAMPLES
       See the examples subdirectory for more complete samples using  SASL  with
       network  protocols.  The  following should give an idea how the SASL com&#8208;
       mands are to be used. In reality this should be event driven.  Each  time
       the  step  command is called, the last server response should be provided
       as the command argument so that the SASL mechanism can  take  appropriate
       action.


              proc ClientCallback {context command args} {
                  switch -exact -- $command {
                      login    { return &quot;&quot; }
                      username { return $::tcl_platform(user) }
                      password { return &quot;SecRet&quot; }
                      realm    { return &quot;&quot; }
                      hostname { return [info host] }
                      default  { return -code error unxpected }
                  }
              }

              proc Demo {{mech PLAIN}} {
                  set ctx [SASL::new -mechanism $mech -callback ClientCallback]
                  set challenge &quot;&quot;
                  while {1} {
                      set more_steps [SASL::step $ctx challenge]
                      puts &quot;Send &apos;[SASL::response $ctx]&apos;&quot;
                      puts &quot;Read server response into challenge var&quot;
                      if {!$more_steps} {break}
                  }
                  SASL::cleanup $ctx
              }
