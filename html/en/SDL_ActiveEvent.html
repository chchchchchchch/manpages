SDL_ActiveEvent(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_ActiveEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_ActiveEvent - Application visibility event structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         Uint8 gain;
         Uint8 state;
       } SDL_ActiveEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_ACTIVEEVENT.

       gain                0 if the event is a loss or 1 if it is a gain.

       state               SDL_APPMOUSEFOCUS  if mouse focus was gained or lost,
                           SDL_APPINPUTFOCUS if input focus was gained or  lost,
                           or  SDL_APPACTIVE  if  the  application was iconified
                           (gain=0) or restored(gain=1).

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_ActiveEvent is a member of the SDL_Event union and is  used  when  an
       event of type SDL_ACTIVEEVENT is reported.

       When  the mouse leaves or enters the window area a SDL_APPMOUSEFOCUS type
       activation event occurs, if the mouse entered the window then  gain  will
       be 1, otherwise gain will be 0. A SDL_APPINPUTFOCUS type activation event
       occurs when the application loses or gains keyboard focus.  This  usually
       occurs  when another application is made active. Finally, a SDL_APPACTIVE
       type event occurs when  the  application  is  either  minimised/iconified
       (gain=0) or restored.

              Note:

              This event does not occur when an application window is first cre&#8208;
              ated.
