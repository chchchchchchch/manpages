SDL_AddTimer(3)                 SDL API Reference                SDL_AddTimer(3)



NAME
       SDL_AddTimer - Add a timer which will call a callback after the specified
       number of milliseconds has elapsed.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       SDL_TimerID SDL_AddTimer(Uint32 interval, SDL_NewTimerCallback  callback,
       void *param);

CALLBACK
       /* type definition for the &quot;new&quot; timer callback function */
       typedef Uint32 (*SDL_NewTimerCallback)(Uint32 interval, void *param);

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  callback  function  to be run after the specified number of mil&#8208;
       liseconds has elapsed. The callback function is passed the current  timer
       interval  and  the user supplied parameter from the SDL_AddTimer call and
       returns the next timer interval. If the returned value from the  callback
       is the same as the one passed in, the periodic alarm continues, otherwise
       a new alarm is scheduled.

       To cancel a currently running timer call SDL_RemoveTimer with  the  timer
       ID returned from SDL_AddTimer.

       The  timer callback function may run in a different thread than your main
       program, and so shouldn&apos;t call any functions from within itself. You  may
       always call SDL_PushEvent, however.

       The  granularity of the timer is platform-dependent, but you should count
       on it being at least 10 ms as this is the most common number. This  means
       that  if  you request a 16 ms timer, your callback will run approximately
       20 ms later on an unloaded system. If you wanted to set a flag  signaling
       a  frame  update  at  30 frames per second (every 33 ms), you might set a
       timer for 30 ms (see example below). If you use this function,  you  need
       to pass SDL_INIT_TIMER to SDL_Init.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an ID value for the added timer or NULL if there was an error.

EXAMPLES
       my_timer_id = SDL_AddTimer((33/10)*10, my_callbackfunc, my_callback_param);
