SDL_AudioSpec(3)                SDL API Reference               SDL_AudioSpec(3)



NAME
       SDL_AudioSpec - Audio Specification Structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         int freq;
         Uint16 format;
         Uint8 channels;
         Uint8 silence;
         Uint16 samples;
         Uint32 size;
         void (*callback)(void *userdata, Uint8 *stream, int len);
         void *userdata;
       } SDL_AudioSpec;

STRUCTURE DATA
       freq                Audio frequency in samples per second

       format              Audio data format

       channels            Number of channels: 1 mono, 2 stereo

       silence             Audio buffer silence value (calculated)

       samples             Audio buffer size in samples

       size                Audio buffer size in bytes (calculated)

       callback(..)        Callback function for filling the audio buffer

       userdata            Pointer the user data which is passed to the callback
                           function

DESCRIPTION
       The SDL_AudioSpec structure is used to describe the format of some  audio
       data.  This structure is used by SDL_OpenAudio and SDL_LoadWAV. While all
       fields are used by SDL_OpenAudio only freq, format, samples and  channels
       are used by SDL_LoadWAV. We will detail these common members here.

       freq                The  number of samples sent to the sound device every
                           second. Common values are 11025, 22050 and 44100. The
                           higher the better.

       format              Specifies the size and type of each sample element

       AUDIO_U8

       AUDIO_S8

       AUDIO_U16 or AUDIO_U16LSB

       AUDIO_S16 or AUDIO_S16LSB

       AUDIO_U16MSB

       AUDIO_S16MSB

       AUDIO_U16SYS

       AUDIO_S16SYS

       channels            The  number  of  seperate  sound  channels. 1 is mono
                           (single channel), 2 is stereo (dual channel).

       samples             When used with SDL_OpenAudio this refers to the  size
                           of  the  audio buffer in samples. A sample a chunk of
                           audio data of the size specified in format mulitplied
                           by  the number of channels. When the SDL_AudioSpec is
                           used with SDL_LoadWAV samples is set to 4096.
