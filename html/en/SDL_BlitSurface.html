SDL_BlitSurface(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_BlitSurface(3)



NAME
       SDL_BlitSurface  -  This  performs a fast blit from the source surface to
       the destination surface.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int  SDL_BlitSurface(SDL_Surface  *src,  SDL_Rect  *srcrect,  SDL_Surface
       *dst, SDL_Rect *dstrect);

DESCRIPTION
       This performs a fast blit from the source surface to the destination sur&#8208;
       face.

       Only the position is used in  the  dstrect  (the  width  and  height  are
       ignored).

       If either srcrect or dstrect are NULL, the entire surface (src or dst) is
       copied.

       The final blit rectangle is saved in dstrect after all clipping  is  per&#8208;
       formed (srcrect is not modified).

       The blit function should not be called on a locked surface.

       The  results  of  blitting  operations  vary greatly depending on whether
       SDL_SRCAPLHA is set or not. See SDL_SetAlpha for an explaination  of  how
       this affects your results. Colorkeying and alpha attributes also interact
       with surface blitting, as  the  following  pseudo-code  should  hopefully
       explain.

       if (source surface has SDL_SRCALPHA set) {
           if (source surface has alpha channel (that is, format-&gt;Amask != 0))
               blit using per-pixel alpha, ignoring any colour key
           else {
               if (source surface has SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set)
                   blit using the colour key AND the per-surface alpha value
               else
                   blit using the per-surface alpha value
           }
       } else {
           if (source surface has SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set)
               blit using the colour key
           else
               ordinary opaque rectangular blit
       }

RETURN VALUE
       If the blit is successful, it returns 0, otherwise it returns -1.

       If  either of the surfaces were in video memory, and the blit returns -2,
       the video memory was lost, so it should be reloaded with artwork and  re-
       blitted:

               while ( SDL_BlitSurface(image, imgrect, screen, dstrect) == -2 ) {
                       while ( SDL_LockSurface(image)) &lt; 0 )
                               Sleep(10);
                       -- Write image pixels to image-&gt;pixels --
                       SDL_UnlockSurface(image);
               }

        This  happens  under DirectX 5.0 when the system switches away from your
       fullscreen application. Locking the surface will also fail until you have
       access to the video memory again.
