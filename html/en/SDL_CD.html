SDL_CD(3)                       SDL API Reference                      SDL_CD(3)



NAME
       SDL_CD - CDROM Drive Information

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         int id;
         CDstatus status;
         int numtracks;
         int cur_track;
         int cur_frame;
         SDL_CDtrack track[SDL_MAX_TRACKS+1];
       } SDL_CD;

STRUCTURE DATA
       id                  Private drive identifier

       status              Drive status

       numtracks           Number of tracks on the CD

       cur_track           Current track

       cur_frame           Current frame offset within the track

       track[SDL_MAX_TRACKS+1]
                           Array of track descriptions. (see SDL_CDtrack)

DESCRIPTION
       An  SDL_CD  structure  is returned by SDL_CDOpen. It represents an opened
       CDROM device and stores information on the layout of the  tracks  on  the
       disc.

       A frame is the base data unit of a CD. CD_FPS frames is equal to 1 second
       of music. SDL provides two macros for converting between time and frames:
       FRAMES_TO_MSF(f, M,S,F) and MSF_TO_FRAMES.

EXAMPLES
       int min, sec, frame;
       int frame_offset;

       FRAMES_TO_MSF(cdrom-&gt;cur_frame, &amp;min, &amp;sec, &amp;frame);
       printf(&quot;Current Position: %d minutes, %d seconds, %d frames
       &quot;, min, sec, frame);

       frame_offset=MSF_TO_FRAMES(min, sec, frame);
