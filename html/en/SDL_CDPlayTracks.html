NAME
       SDL_CDPlayTracks - Play the given CD track(s)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_CDPlayTracks(SDL_CD *cdrom, int start_track, int start_frame, int
       ntracks, int nframes));

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_CDPlayTracks plays the given CD starting at  track  start_track,  for
       ntracks tracks.

       start_frame  is  the frame offset, from the beginning of the start_track,
       at which to start. nframes is the frame offset, from the beginning of the
       last track (start_track+ntracks), at which to end playing.

       SDL_CDPlayTracks  should only be called after calling SDL_CDStatus to get
       track information about the CD.

              Note:

              Data tracks are ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0, or -1 if there was an error.

EXAMPLES
       /* assuming cdrom is a previously opened device */
       /* Play the entire CD */
       if(CD_INDRIVE(SDL_CDStatus(cdrom)))
         SDL_CDPlayTracks(cdrom, 0, 0, 0, 0);

       /* Play the first track */
       if(CD_INDRIVE(SDL_CDStatus(cdrom)))
         SDL_CDPlayTracks(cdrom, 0, 0, 1, 0);

       /* Play first 15 seconds of the 2nd track */
       if(CD_INDRIVE(SDL_CDStatus(cdrom)))
         SDL_CDPlayTracks(cdrom, 1, 0, 0, CD_FPS*15);
