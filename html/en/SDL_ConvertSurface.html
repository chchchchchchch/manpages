NAME
       SDL_ConvertSurface  -  Converts  a  surface to the same format as another
       surface.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL/SDL.h&quot;

       SDL_Surface *SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface *src,  SDL_PixelFormat  *fmt,
       Uint32 flags);

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new surface of the specified format, and then copies and maps
       the given surface to it. If this function fails, it returns NULL.

       The flags parameter is  passed  to  SDL_CreateRGBSurface  and  has  those
       semantics.

       This function is used internally by SDL_DisplayFormat.

       This function can only be called after SDL_Init.

RETURN VALUE
