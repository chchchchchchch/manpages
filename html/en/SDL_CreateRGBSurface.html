SDL_CreateRGBSurface(3)         SDL API Reference        SDL_CreateRGBSurface(3)



NAME
       SDL_CreateRGBSurface - Create an empty SDL_Surface

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       SDL_Surface  *SDL_CreateRGBSurface(Uint32  flags,  int width, int height,
       int depth, Uint32 Rmask, Uint32 Gmask, Uint32 Bmask, Uint32 Amask);

DESCRIPTION
       Allocate an empty surface (must be called after SDL_SetVideoMode)

       If depth is 8 bits an empty palette is allocated for the surface,  other&#8208;
       wise  a  &apos;packed-pixel&apos; SDL_PixelFormat is created using the [RGBA]mask&apos;s
       provided (see SDL_PixelFormat). The flags specifies the type  of  surface
       that should be created, it is an OR&apos;d combination of the following possi&#8208;
       ble values.

       SDL_SWSURFACE       SDL will create the surface in  system  memory.  This
                           improves  the performance of pixel level access, how&#8208;
                           ever you may not be able to take  advantage  of  some
                           types of hardware blitting.

       SDL_HWSURFACE       SDL  will attempt to create the surface in video mem&#8208;
                           ory.  This  will  allow  SDL  to  take  advantage  of
                           Video-&gt;Video blits (which are often accelerated).

       SDL_SRCCOLORKEY     This  flag  turns on colourkeying for blits from this
                           surface.  If  SDL_HWSURFACE  is  also  specified  and
                           colourkeyed  blits are hardware-accelerated, then SDL
                           will attempt to place the surface  in  video  memory.
                           Use  SDL_SetColorKey  to set or clear this flag after
                           surface creation.

       SDL_SRCALPHA        This flag turns on alpha-blending for blits from this
                           surface.  If  SDL_HWSURFACE  is  also  specified  and
                           alpha-blending blits are  hardware-accelerated,  then
                           the  surface will be placed in video memory if possi&#8208;
                           ble. Use SDL_SetAlpha to set or clear this flag after
                           surface creation.

              Note:

              If  an  alpha-channel is specified (that is, if Amask is nonzero),
              then the SDL_SRCALPHA flag is automatically set.  You  may  remove
              this flag by calling SDL_SetAlpha after surface creation.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the created surface, or NULL upon error.

EXAMPLE
           /* Create a 32-bit surface with the bytes of each pixel in R,G,B,A order,
              as expected by OpenGL for textures */
           SDL_Surface *surface;
           Uint32 rmask, gmask, bmask, amask;

           /* SDL interprets each pixel as a 32-bit number, so our masks must depend
              on the endianness (byte order) of the machine */
       #if SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN
           rmask = 0xff000000;
           gmask = 0x00ff0000;
           bmask = 0x0000ff00;
           amask = 0x000000ff;
       #else
           rmask = 0x000000ff;
           gmask = 0x0000ff00;
           bmask = 0x00ff0000;
           amask = 0xff000000;
       #endif

           surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(SDL_SWSURFACE, width, height, 32,
                                          rmask, gmask, bmask, amask);
           if(surface == NULL) {
               fprintf(stderr, &quot;CreateRGBSurface failed: %s
       &quot;, SDL_GetError());
               exit(1);
           }
