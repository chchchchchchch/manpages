NAME
       SDL_DestroySemaphore  - Destroys a semaphore that was created by SDL_Cre&#8208;
       ateSemaphore.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include &quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_DestroySemaphore destroys the semaphore pointed to by  sem  that  was
       created  by SDL_CreateSemaphore. It is not safe to destroy a semaphore if
       there are threads currently blocked waiting on it.

EXAMPLES
       if (my_sem != NULL) {
               SDL_DestroySemaphore(my_sem);
               my_sem = NULL;
       }
