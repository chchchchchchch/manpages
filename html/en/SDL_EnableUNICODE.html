SDL_EnableUNICODE(3)            SDL API Reference           SDL_EnableUNICODE(3)



NAME
       SDL_EnableUNICODE - Enable UNICODE translation

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_EnableUNICODE(int enable);

DESCRIPTION
       Enables/Disables Unicode keyboard translation.

       To  obtain the character codes corresponding to received keyboard events,
       Unicode translation must first be turned  on  using  this  function.  The
       translation  incurs  a  slight  overhead  for  each keyboard event and is
       therefore disabled by default. For each subsequently  received  key  down
       event,  the  unicode member of the SDL_keysym structure will then contain
       the corresponding character code, or zero for keysyms that do not  corre&#8208;
       spond to any character code.

       A  value  of 1 for enable enables Unicode translation; 0 disables it, and
       -1 leaves it unchanged  (useful  for  querying  the  current  translation
       mode).

       Note that only key press events will be translated, not release events.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the previous translation mode (0 or 1).
