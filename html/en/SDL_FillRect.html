SDL_FillRect(3)                 SDL API Reference                SDL_FillRect(3)



NAME
       SDL_FillRect  - This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle
       with some color

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_FillRect(SDL_Surface *dst, SDL_Rect *dstrect, Uint32 color);

DESCRIPTION
       This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with color.  If
       dstrect is NULL, the whole surface will be filled with color.

       The color should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be
       generated by the SDL_MapRGB or SDL_MapRGBA functions. If the color  value
       contains an alpha value then the destination is simply &quot;filled&quot; with that
       alpha information, no blending takes place.

       If there is a clip rectangle set on the  destination  (set  via  SDL_Set&#8208;
       ClipRect)  then  this function will clip based on the intersection of the
       clip rectangle and the dstrect rectangle and the dstrect  rectangle  will
       be modified to represent the area actually filled.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.
