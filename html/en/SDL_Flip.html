SDL_Flip(3)                     SDL API Reference                    SDL_Flip(3)



NAME
       SDL_Flip - Swaps screen buffers

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_Flip(SDL_Surface *screen);

DESCRIPTION
       On  hardware that supports double-buffering, this function sets up a flip
       and returns. The hardware will wait for vertical retrace, and  then  swap
       video  buffers before the next video surface blit or lock will return. On
       hardware that doesn&apos;t support double-buffering,  this  is  equivalent  to
       calling SDL_UpdateRect(screen, 0, 0, 0, 0)

       The  SDL_DOUBLEBUF  flag  must have been passed to SDL_SetVideoMode, when
       setting the video mode for this function to perform hardware flipping.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns 0 if successful, or -1 if there was an error.

SEE ALSO
       SDL_SetVideoMode, SDL_UpdateRect, SDL_Surface
