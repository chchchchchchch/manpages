SDL_GetKeyState(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_GetKeyState(3)



NAME
       SDL_GetKeyState - Get a snapshot of the current keyboard state

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       Uint8 *SDL_GetKeyState(int *numkeys);

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  snapshot  of  the  current  keyboard state. The current state is
       return as a pointer to an array, the size of  this  array  is  stored  in
       numkeys.  The  array is indexed by the SDLK_* symbols. A value of 1 means
       the key is pressed and a value of 0 means its not. The  pointer  returned
       is  a  pointer  to  an  internal SDL array and should not be freed by the
       caller.

              Note:

              Use SDL_PumpEvents to update the state array.

EXAMPLE
       Uint8 *keystate = SDL_GetKeyState(NULL);
       if ( keystate[SDLK_RETURN] ) printf(&quot;Return Key Pressed.
       &quot;);
