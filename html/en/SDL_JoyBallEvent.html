SDL_JoyBallEvent(3)             SDL API Reference            SDL_JoyBallEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_JoyBallEvent - Joystick trackball motion event structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         Uint8 which;
         Uint8 ball;
         Sint16 xrel, yrel;
       } SDL_JoyBallEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_JOYBALLMOTION

       which               Joystick device index

       ball                Joystick trackball index

       xrel, yrel          The relative motion in the X/Y direction

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_JoyBallEvent  is  a member of the SDL_Event union and is used when an
       event of type SDL_JOYBALLMOTION is reported.

       A SDL_JOYBALLMOTION event occurs when a user moves  a  trackball  on  the
       joystick.  The field which is the index of the joystick that reported the
       event and ball is the  index  of  the  trackball  (for  a  more  detailed
       explaination  see  the Joystick section). Trackballs only return relative
       motion, this is the change in position on the  ball  since  it  was  last
       polled (last cycle of the event loop) and it is stored in xrel and yrel.
