SDL_JoystickGetAxis(3)          SDL API Reference         SDL_JoystickGetAxis(3)



NAME
       SDL_JoystickGetAxis - Get the current state of an axis

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       Sint16 SDL_JoystickGetAxis(SDL_Joystick *joystick, int axis);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_JoystickGetAxis  returns  the  current state of the given axis on the
       given joystick.

       On most modern joysticks the X axis is usually represented by axis 0  and
       the  Y  axis  by  axis  1. The value returned by SDL_JoystickGetAxis is a
       signed integer (-32768 to 32768) representing the current position of the
       axis,  it maybe necessary to impose certain tolerances on these values to
       account for jitter. It is worth noting that some joysticks use axes 2 and
       3 for extra buttons.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns  a 16-bit signed integer representing the current position of the
       axis.

EXAMPLES
       Sint16 x_move, y_move;
       SDL_Joystick *joy1;
       .
       .
       x_move=SDL_JoystickGetAxis(joy1, 0);
       y_move=SDL_JoystickGetAxis(joy1, 1);
