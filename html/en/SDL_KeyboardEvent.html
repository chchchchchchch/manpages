SDL_KeyboardEvent(3)            SDL API Reference           SDL_KeyboardEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_KeyboardEvent - Keyboard event structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         Uint8 state;
         SDL_keysym keysym;
       } SDL_KeyboardEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP

       state               SDL_PRESSED or SDL_RELEASED

       keysym              Contains key press information

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_KeyboardEvent  is a member of the SDL_Event union and is used when an
       event of type SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP is reported.

       The type and state actually report the same information,  they  just  use
       different values to do it! A keyboard event occurs when a key is released
       (type=SDK_KEYUP  or  state=SDL_RELEASED)  and  when  a  key  is   pressed
       (type=SDL_KEYDOWN  or state=SDL_PRESSED). The information on what key was
       pressed or released is in the keysym structure.

              Note:

              Repeating SDL_KEYDOWN events will occur if key repeat  is  enabled
              (see SDL_EnableKeyRepeat).
