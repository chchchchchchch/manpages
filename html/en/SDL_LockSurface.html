SDL_LockSurface(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_LockSurface(3)



NAME
       SDL_LockSurface - Lock a surface for directly access.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_LockSurface(SDL_Surface *surface);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_LockSurface  sets  up  a  surface  for directly accessing the pixels.
       Between calls to SDL_LockSurface and SDL_UnlockSurface, you can write  to
       and  read  from  surface-&gt;pixels,  using  the pixel format stored in sur&#8208;
       face-&gt;format. Once you are done accessing the  surface,  you  should  use
       SDL_UnlockSurface to release it.

       Not  all  surfaces require locking. If SDL_MUSTLOCK(surface) evaluates to
       0, then you can read and write to the surface at any time, and the  pixel
       format of the surface will not change.

       No  operating  system or library calls should be made between lock/unlock
       pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this time.

       It should be noted, that since SDL 1.1.8  surface  locks  are  recursive.
       This means that you can lock a surface multiple times, but each lock must
       have a match unlock.

           .
           .
           SDL_LockSurface( surface );
           .
           /* Surface is locked */
           /* Direct pixel access on surface here */
           .
           SDL_LockSurface( surface );
           .
           /* More direct pixel access on surface */
           .
           SDL_UnlockSurface( surface );
           /* Surface is still locked */
           /* Note: Is versions &lt; 1.1.8, the surface would have been */
           /* no longer locked at this stage                         */
           .
           SDL_UnlockSurface( surface );
           /* Surface is now unlocked */
           .
           .

RETURN VALUE
       SDL_LockSurface returns 0, or -1 if the surface couldn&apos;t be locked.
