SDL_MixAudio(3)                 SDL API Reference                SDL_MixAudio(3)



NAME
       SDL_MixAudio - Mix audio data

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_MixAudio(Uint8 *dst, Uint8 *src, Uint32 len, int volume);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  takes  two audio buffers of len bytes each of the playing
       audio format and mixes them, performing addition, volume adjustment,  and
       overflow  clipping.  The  volume  ranges  from 0 to SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME and
       should be set to the maximum value for full audio volume. Note this  does
       not  change  hardware volume. This is provided for convenience -- you can
       mix your own audio data.

              Note:

              Do not use this function for mixing together more than two streams
              of sample data. The output from repeated application of this func&#8208;
              tion may be distorted by clipping, because there is no accumulator
              with  greater  range  than the input (not to mention this being an
              inefficient way of doing it). Use mixing functions from SDL_mixer,
              OpenAL, or write your own mixer instead.
