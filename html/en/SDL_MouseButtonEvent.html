SDL_MouseButtonEvent(3)         SDL API Reference        SDL_MouseButtonEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_MouseButtonEvent - Mouse button event structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         Uint8 button;
         Uint8 state;
         Uint16 x, y;
       } SDL_MouseButtonEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP

       button              The  mouse  button  index  (SDL_BUTTON_LEFT, SDL_BUT&#8208;
                           TON_MIDDLE, SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT)

       state               SDL_PRESSED or SDL_RELEASED

       x, y                The X/Y coordinates of  the  mouse  at  press/release
                           time

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_MouseButtonEvent  is a member of the SDL_Event union and is used when
       an event of type SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP is reported.

       When a mouse button press or release is detected then number of the  but&#8208;
       ton  pressed  (from  1 to 255, with 1 usually being the left button and 2
       the right) is placed into button, the position of  the  mouse  when  this
       event  occured  is  stored in the x and the y fields. Like SDL_KeyboardE&#8208;
       vent, information on whether the event was a press or a release event  is
       stored in both the type and state fields, but this should be obvious.
