SDL_MouseMotionEvent(3)         SDL API Reference        SDL_MouseMotionEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_MouseMotionEvent - Mouse motion event structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         Uint8 state;
         Uint16 x, y;
         Sint16 xrel, yrel;
       } SDL_MouseMotionEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_MOUSEMOTION

       state               The current button state

       x, y                The X/Y coordinates of the mouse

       xrel, yrel          Relative motion in the X/Y direction

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_MouseMotionEvent  is a member of the SDL_Event union and is used when
       an event of type SDL_MOUSEMOTION is reported.

       Simply put, a SDL_MOUSEMOTION type event occurs when  a  user  moves  the
       mouse within the application window or when SDL_WarpMouse is called. Both
       the absolute (x and y) and  relative  (xrel  and  yrel)  coordinates  are
       reported  along  with the current button states (state). The button state
       can be interpreted using the SDL_BUTTON macro (see SDL_GetMouseState).

       If the cursor is hidden (SDL_ShowCursor(0))  and  the  input  is  grabbed
       (SDL_WM_GrabInput(SDL_GRAB_ON)), then the mouse will give relative motion
       events even when the cursor reaches the edge fo the screen. This is  cur&#8208;
       rently only implemented on Windows and Linux/Unix-a-likes.
