SDL_OpenAudio(3)                SDL API Reference               SDL_OpenAudio(3)



NAME
       SDL_OpenAudio - Opens the audio device with the desired parameters.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_OpenAudio(SDL_AudioSpec *desired, SDL_AudioSpec *obtained);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  opens  the  audio device with the desired parameters, and
       returns 0 if successful, placing the actual hardware  parameters  in  the
       structure  pointed  to  by  obtained. If obtained is NULL, the audio data
       passed to the callback function will be guaranteed to be in the requested
       format,  and will be automatically converted to the hardware audio format
       if necessary. This function returns -1 if it failed  to  open  the  audio
       device, or couldn&apos;t set up the audio thread.

       To open the audio device a desired SDL_AudioSpec must be created.

       SDL_AudioSpec *desired;
       .
       .
       desired=(SDL_AudioSpec *)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));

        You  must  then  fill  this structure with your desired audio specifica&#8208;
       tions.

       desired-&gt;freq

       desired-&gt;format

       desired-&gt;samples

       desired-&gt;callback

       void callback(void *userdata, Uint8 *stream, int len);

        userdata is the pointer stored in userdata field of  the  SDL_AudioSpec.
       stream is a pointer to the audio buffer you want to fill with information
       and len is the length of the audio buffer in bytes.

       desired-&gt;userdata

       SDL_OpenAudio reads these fields from the desired SDL_AudioSpec structure
       pass to the function and attempts to find an audio configuration matching
       your desired. As mentioned above, if the obtained parameter is NULL  then
       SDL  with  convert  from your desired audio settings to the hardware set&#8208;
       tings as it plays.

       If obtained is NULL then the desired SDL_AudioSpec is your working speci&#8208;
       fication, otherwise the obtained SDL_AudioSpec becomes the working speci&#8208;
       fication and the desirec specification can be deleted. The  data  in  the
       working specification is used when building SDL_AudioCVT&apos;s for converting
       loaded data to the hardware format.

       SDL_OpenAudio calculates the size and silence fields for both the desired
       and  obtained specifications. The size field stores the total size of the
       audio buffer in bytes, while the silence stores the value used to  repre&#8208;
       sent silence in the audio buffer

       The  audio device starts out playing silence when it&apos;s opened, and should
       be enabled for playing by calling SDL_PauseAudio(0) when  you  are  ready
       for your audio callback function to be called. Since the audio driver may
       modify the requested size of the audio buffer, you  should  allocate  any
       local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.

EXAMPLES
       /* Prototype of our callback function */
       void my_audio_callback(void *userdata, Uint8 *stream, int len);

       /* Open the audio device */
       SDL_AudioSpec *desired, *obtained;
       SDL_AudioSpec *hardware_spec;

       /* Allocate a desired SDL_AudioSpec */
       desired=(SDL_AudioSpec *)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));

       /* Allocate space for the obtained SDL_AudioSpec */
       obtained=(SDL_AudioSpec *)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));

       /* 22050Hz - FM Radio quality */
       desired-&gt;freq=22050;

       /* 16-bit signed audio */
       desired-&gt;format=AUDIO_S16LSB;

       /* Mono */
       desired-&gt;channels=0;

       /* Large audio buffer reduces risk of dropouts but increases response time */
       desired-&gt;samples=8192;

       /* Our callback function */
       desired-&gt;callback=my_audio_callback;

       desired-&gt;userdata=NULL;

       /* Open the audio device */
       if ( SDL_OpenAudio(desired, obtained) &lt; 0 ){
         fprintf(stderr, &quot;Couldn&apos;t open audio: %s
       &quot;, SDL_GetError());
         exit(-1);
       }
       /* desired spec is no longer needed */
       free(desired);
       hardware_spec=obtained;
       .
       .
       /* Prepare callback for playing */
       .
       .
       .
       /* Start playing */
       SDL_PauseAudio(0);
