SDL_PumpEvents(3)               SDL API Reference              SDL_PumpEvents(3)



NAME
       SDL_PumpEvents  -  Pumps  the event loop, gathering events from the input
       devices.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_PumpEvents(void);

DESCRIPTION
       Pumps the event loop, gathering events from the input devices.

       SDL_PumpEvents gathers all the pending input information from devices and
       places  it  on the event queue. Without calls to SDL_PumpEvents no events
       would  ever  be  placed  on  the  queue.  Often  calls   the   need   for
       SDL_PumpEvents  is hidden from the user since SDL_PollEvent and SDL_Wait&#8208;
       Event implicitly call SDL_PumpEvents. However, if you are not polling  or
       waiting  for  events  (e.g.  your  filtering  them),  then  you must call
       SDL_PumpEvents to force an event queue update.

              Note:

              You can only call this function in the thread that set  the  video
              mode.
