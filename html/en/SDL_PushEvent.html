SDL_PushEvent(3)                SDL API Reference               SDL_PushEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_PushEvent - Pushes an event onto the event queue

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_PushEvent(SDL_Event *event);

DESCRIPTION
       The  event queue can actually be used as a two way communication channel.
       Not only can events be read from the queue, but the user  can  also  push
       their  own  events onto it. event is a pointer to the event structure you
       wish to push onto the queue.

              Note:

              Pushing device input events onto  the  queue  doesn&apos;t  modify  the
              state of the device within SDL.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success or -1 if the event couldn&apos;t be pushed.

EXAMPLES
       See SDL_Event.

SEE ALSO
       SDL_PollEvent, SDL_PeepEvents, SDL_Event
