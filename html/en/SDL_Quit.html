SDL_Quit(3)                     SDL API Reference                    SDL_Quit(3)



NAME
       SDL_Quit - Shut down SDL

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_Quit(void);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_Quit  shuts down all SDL subsystems and frees the resources allocated
       to them. This should always be called before you exit. For  the  sake  of
       simplicity you can set SDL_Quit as your atexit call, like:

       SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO|SDL_INIT_AUDIO);
       atexit(SDL_Quit);
       .
       .

              Note:

              While using atexit maybe be fine for small programs, more advanced
              users should shut down SDL in their own cleanup code. Plus,  using
              atexit in a library is a sure way to crash dynamically loaded code
