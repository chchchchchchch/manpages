SDL_QuitEvent(3)                SDL API Reference               SDL_QuitEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_QuitEvent - Quit requested event

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type
       } SDL_QuitEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_QUIT

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_QuitEvent  is  a  member  of  the SDL_Event union and is used whan an
       event of type SDL_QUIT is reported.

       As can be seen, the SDL_QuitEvent structure serves no useful purpose. The
       event  itself, on the other hand, is very important. If you filter out or
       ignore a quit event then it is impossible for the user to close the  win&#8208;
       dow.  On  the other hand, if you do accept a quit event then the applica&#8208;
       tion window will be closed, and screen updates will still report  success
       event though the application will no longer be visible.

              Note:

              The  macro  SDL_QuitRequested will return non-zero if a quit event
              is pending
