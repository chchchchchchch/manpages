SDL_SemTryWait(3)               SDL API Reference              SDL_SemTryWait(3)



NAME
       SDL_SemTryWait  -  Attempt  to  lock  a  semaphore  but don&apos;t suspend the
       thread.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include &quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;

       int SDL_SemTryWait(SDL_sem *sem);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_SemTryWait is a non-blocking varient of SDL_SemWait. If the value  of
       the  semaphore pointed to by sem is positive it will atomically decrement
       the  semaphore  value  and   return   0,   otherwise   it   will   return
       SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT instead of suspending the thread.

       After SDL_SemTryWait is successful, the semaphore can be released and its
       count atomically incremented by a successful call to SDL_SemPost.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns  0  if  the  semaphore  was   successfully   locked   or   either
       SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT  or  -1 if the thread would have suspended or there was
       an error, respectivly.

       If the semaphore was not  successfully  locked,  the  semaphore  will  be
       unchanged.

EXAMPLES
       res = SDL_SemTryWait(my_sem);

       if (res == SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT) {
               return TRY_AGAIN;
       }
       if (res == -1) {
               return WAIT_ERROR;
       }

       ...

       SDL_SemPost(my_sem);
