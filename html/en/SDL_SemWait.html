SDL_SemWait(3)                  SDL API Reference                 SDL_SemWait(3)



NAME
       SDL_SemWait  -  Lock  a semaphore and suspend the thread if the semaphore
       value is zero.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include &quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;

       int SDL_SemWait(SDL_sem *sem);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_SemWait() suspends the calling  thread  until  either  the  semaphore
       pointed to by sem has a positive value, the call is interrupted by a sig&#8208;
       nal or error. If the call is successful it will atomically decrement  the
       semaphore value.

       After  SDL_SemWait() is successful, the semaphore can be released and its
       count atomically incremented by a successful call to SDL_SemPost.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 if successful or -1 if there was an error  (leaving  the  sema&#8208;
       phore unchanged).

EXAMPLES
       if (SDL_SemWait(my_sem) == -1) {
               return WAIT_FAILED;
       }

       ...

       SDL_SemPost(my_sem);
