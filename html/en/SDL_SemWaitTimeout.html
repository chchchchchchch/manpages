SDL_SemWaitTimeout(3)           SDL API Reference          SDL_SemWaitTimeout(3)



NAME
       SDL_SemWaitTimeout  -  Lock  a semaphore, but only wait up to a specified
       maximum time.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include &quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;

       int SDL_SemWaitTimeout(SDL_sem *sem, Uint32 timeout);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_SemWaitTimeout() is a varient of SDL_SemWait with a  maximum  timeout
       value.  If  the  value  of  the  semaphore  pointed to by sem is positive
       (greater than zero) it will atomically decrement the semaphore value  and
       return  0,  otherwise  it  will wait up to timeout milliseconds trying to
       lock the semaphore. This function is to be avoided if possible  since  on
       some platforms it is implemented by polling the semaphore every millisec&#8208;
       ond in a busy loop.

       After SDL_SemWaitTimeout() is successful, the semaphore can  be  released
       and its count atomically incremented by a successful call to SDL_SemPost.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns   0   if   the   semaphore  was  successfully  locked  or  either
       SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT or -1 if the timeout period was exceeded or  there  was
       an error, respectivly.

       If  the  semaphore  was  not  successfully  locked, the semaphore will be
       unchanged.

EXAMPLES
       res = SDL_SemWaitTimeout(my_sem, WAIT_TIMEOUT_MILLISEC);

       if (res == SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT) {
               return TRY_AGAIN;
       }
       if (res == -1) {
               return WAIT_ERROR;
       }

       ...

       SDL_SemPost(my_sem);
