SDL_SetAlpha(3)                 SDL API Reference                SDL_SetAlpha(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetAlpha - Adjust the alpha properties of a surface

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_SetAlpha(SDL_Surface *surface, Uint32 flag, Uint8 alpha);

DESCRIPTION
              Note:

              This function and the semantics of SDL alpha blending have changed
              since version 1.1.4. Up until version 1.1.5, an alpha value  of  0
              was  considered opaque and a value of 255 was considered transpar&#8208;
              ent. This has now been inverted: 0 (SDL_ALPHA_TRANSPARENT) is  now
              considered  transparent  and 255 (SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE) is now consid&#8208;
              ered opaque.

       SDL_SetAlpha is used for  setting  the  per-surface  alpha  value  and/or
       enabling and disabling alpha blending.

       Thesurface  parameter  specifies which surface whose alpha attributes you
       wish to adjust. flags is used to specify whether alpha blending should be
       used  (SDL_SRCALPHA)  and whether the surface should use RLE acceleration
       for blitting (SDL_RLEACCEL). flags can be an OR&apos;d  combination  of  these
       two  options, one of these options or 0. If SDL_SRCALPHA is not passed as
       a flag then all alpha information is ignored when blitting  the  surface.
       The  alpha  parameter  is the per-surface alpha value; a surface need not
       have an alpha channel to use per-surface alpha and blitting can still  be
       accelerated with SDL_RLEACCEL.

              Note:

              The  per-surface  alpha  value of 128 is considered a special case
              and is optimised, so it&apos;s much faster than other per-surface  val&#8208;
              ues.

       Alpha effects surface blitting in the following ways:

       RGBA-&gt;RGB with SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  source  is  alpha-blended  with the destination,
                           using the alpha channel. SDL_SRCCOLORKEY and the per-
                           surface alpha are ignored.

       RGBA-&gt;RGB without SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  RGB  data  is copied from the source. The source
                           alpha channel and the  per-surface  alpha  value  are
                           ignored.

       RGB-&gt;RGBA with SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  source  is  alpha-blended  with  the destination
                           using the per-surface alpha value. If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY
                           is  set,  only  the  pixels not matching the colorkey
                           value are copied. The alpha  channel  of  the  copied
                           pixels is set to opaque.

       RGB-&gt;RGBA without SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  RGB data is copied from the source and the alpha
                           value of the copied  pixels  is  set  to  opaque.  If
                           SDL_SRCCOLORKEY  is set, only the pixels not matching
                           the colorkey value are copied.
&#12;       RGBA-&gt;RGBA with SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The source  is  alpha-blended  with  the  destination
                           using  the source alpha channel. The alpha channel in
                           the destination surface is left  untouched.  SDL_SRC&#8208;
                           COLORKEY is ignored.

       RGBA-&gt;RGBA without SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  RGBA  data is copied to the destination surface.
                           If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY is set, only the pixels not match&#8208;
                           ing the colorkey value are copied.

       RGB-&gt;RGB with SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The  source  is  alpha-blended  with  the destination
                           using the per-surface alpha value. If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY
                           is  set,  only  the  pixels not matching the colorkey
                           value are copied.

       RGB-&gt;RGB without SDL_SRCALPHA
                           The RGB data is copied from the source.  If  SDL_SRC&#8208;
                           COLORKEY  is  set,  only  the pixels not matching the
                           colorkey value are copied.

              Note:

               Note that RGBA-&gt;RGBA blits (with SDL_SRCALPHA set) keep the alpha
              of the destination surface. This means that you cannot compose two
              arbitrary RGBA surfaces this way and  get  the  result  you  would
              expect  from &quot;overlaying&quot; them; the destination alpha will work as
              a mask.

              Also note that per-pixel and per-surface alpha cannot be combined;
              the per-pixel alpha is always used if available

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns 0, or -1 if there was an error.
