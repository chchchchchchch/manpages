SDL_SetClipRect(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_SetClipRect(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetClipRect - Sets the clipping rectangle for a surface.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_SetClipRect(SDL_Surface *surface, SDL_Rect *rect);

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the clipping rectangle for a surface. When this surface is the des&#8208;
       tination of a blit, only the area within the clip rectangle will be drawn
       into.

       The rectangle pointed to by rect will be clipped to the edges of the sur&#8208;
       face so that the clip rectangle for a surface can never fall outside  the
       edges of the surface.

       If  rect  is  NULL the clipping rectangle will be set to the full size of
       the surface.
