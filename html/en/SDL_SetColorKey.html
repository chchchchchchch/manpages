SDL_SetColorKey(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_SetColorKey(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetColorKey  -  Sets the color key (transparent pixel) in a blittable
       surface and RLE acceleration.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_SetColorKey(SDL_Surface *surface, Uint32 flag, Uint32 key);

DESCRIPTION
        Sets the color key  (transparent  pixel)  in  a  blittable  surface  and
       enables or disables RLE blit acceleration.

       RLE acceleration can substantially speed up blitting of images with large
       horizontal runs of transparent pixels (i.e., pixels that  match  the  key
       value).  The  key  must  be  of  the  same  pixel  format as the surface,
       SDL_MapRGB is often useful for obtaining an acceptable value.

       If flag is SDL_SRCCOLORKEY then key is the transparent pixel value in the
       source image of a blit.

       If flag is OR&apos;d with SDL_RLEACCEL then the surface will be draw using RLE
       acceleration when drawn with SDL_BlitSurface. The surface  will  actually
       be  encoded  for  RLE  acceleration  the  first  time  SDL_BlitSurface or
       SDL_DisplayFormat is called on the surface.

       If flag is 0, this function clears any current color key.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns 0, or -1 if there was an error.
