SDL_SetEventFilter(3)           SDL API Reference          SDL_SetEventFilter(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetEventFilter  -  Sets up a filter to process all events before they
       are posted to the event queue.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_SetEventFilter(SDL_EventFilter filter);

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets up a filter to process  all  events  before  they  are
       posted  to the event queue. This is a very powerful and flexible feature.
       The filter is prototyped as:

       typedef int (*SDL_EventFilter)(const SDL_Event *event);

        If the filter returns 1, then the event will be added  to  the  internal
       queue.  If  it  returns 0, then the event will be dropped from the queue.
       This allows selective filtering of dynamically.

       There is one caveat when dealing with the SDL_QUITEVENT event  type.  The
       event  filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the
       application window. If the event filter returns 1, then the  window  will
       be closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible. If the quit
       event is generated by an interrupt signal, it will  bypass  the  internal
       queue and be delivered to the application at the next event poll.

              Note:

              Events  pushed onto the queue with SDL_PushEvent or SDL_PeepEvents
              do not get passed through the event filter.

              Note:

              Be Careful! The event filter  function  may  run  in  a  different
              thread so be careful what you do within it.
