SDL_SetGammaRamp(3)             SDL API Reference            SDL_SetGammaRamp(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetGammaRamp - Sets the color gamma lookup tables for the display

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int   SDL_SetGammaRamp(Uint16   *redtable,   Uint16  *greentable,  Uint16
       *bluetable);

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the gamma lookup tables for the display for  each  color  component.
       Each  table  is  an  array  of  256 Uint16 values, representing a mapping
       between the input and output for that channel. The  input  is  the  index
       into  the  array, and the output is the 16-bit gamma value at that index,
       scaled to the output color precision. You may pass NULL  to  any  of  the
       channels to leave them unchanged.

       This function adjusts the gamma based on lookup tables, you can also have
       the  gamma  calculated  based  on  a  &quot;gamma  function&quot;  parameter   with
       SDL_SetGamma.

       Not all display hardware is able to change gamma.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns -1 on error (or if gamma adjustment is not supported).
