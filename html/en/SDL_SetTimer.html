SDL_SetTimer(3)                 SDL API Reference                SDL_SetTimer(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetTimer  -  Set a callback to run after the specified number of mil&#8208;
       liseconds has elapsed.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_SetTimer(Uint32 interval, SDL_TimerCallback callback);

CALLBACK
       /* Function prototype for the timer callback function */  typedef  Uint32
       (*SDL_TimerCallback)(Uint32 interval);

DESCRIPTION
       Set  a  callback  to  run  after the specified number of milliseconds has
       elapsed. The callback function is passed the current timer  interval  and
       returns the next timer interval. If the returned value is the same as the
       one passed in, the periodic alarm continues, otherwise  a  new  alarm  is
       scheduled.

       To cancel a currently running timer, call SDL_SetTimer(0, NULL);

       The  timer callback function may run in a different thread than your main
       constant, and so shouldn&apos;t call any functions from within itself.

       The maximum resolution of this timer is 10 ms, which means  that  if  you
       request  a  16 ms timer, your callback will run approximately 20 ms later
       on an unloaded system. If you wanted to set  a  flag  signaling  a  frame
       update  at  30 frames per second (every 33 ms), you might set a timer for
       30 ms (see example below).

       If you use this function, you need to pass SDL_INIT_TIMER to SDL_Init().

              Note:

              This function is kept for compatibility but has been superseded by
              the  new  timer  functions  SDL_AddTimer and SDL_RemoveTimer which
              support multiple timers.

EXAMPLES
       SDL_SetTimer((33/10)*10, my_callback);
