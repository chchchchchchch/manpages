SDL_SetVideoMode(3)             SDL API Reference            SDL_SetVideoMode(3)



NAME
       SDL_SetVideoMode  -  Set up a video mode with the specified width, height
       and bits-per-pixel.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       SDL_Surface *SDL_SetVideoMode(int width,  int  height,  int  bpp,  Uint32
       flags);

DESCRIPTION
       Set up a video mode with the specified width, height and bits-per-pixel.

       If bpp is 0, it is treated as the current display bits per pixel.

       The  flags  parameter  is  the same as the flags field of the SDL_Surface
       structure. OR&apos;d combinations of the following values are valid.

       SDL_SWSURFACE       Create the video surface in system memory

       SDL_HWSURFACE       Create the video surface in video memory

       SDL_ASYNCBLIT       Enables the use of asynchronous updates of  the  dis&#8208;
                           play surface. This will usually slow down blitting on
                           single CPU machines, but may provide a speed increase
                           on SMP systems.

       SDL_ANYFORMAT       Normally,  if  a video surface of the requested bits-
                           per-pixel (bpp) is not available,  SDL  will  emulate
                           one with a shadow surface. Passing SDL_ANYFORMAT pre&#8208;
                           vents this and causes SDL to use the  video  surface,
                           regardless of its pixel depth.

       SDL_HWPALETTE       Give  SDL exclusive palette access. Without this flag
                           you may not always get the  the  colors  you  request
                           with SDL_SetColors or SDL_SetPalette.

       SDL_DOUBLEBUF       Enable  hardware  double  buffering;  only valid with
                           SDL_HWSURFACE. Calling SDL_Flip will flip the buffers
                           and update the screen. All drawing will take place on
                           the surface that is not displayed at the  moment.  If
                           double  buffering  could not be enabled then SDL_Flip
                           will just perform  a  SDL_UpdateRect  on  the  entire
                           screen.

       SDL_FULLSCREEN      SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen mode. If a hard&#8208;
                           ware resolution change is not possible (for  whatever
                           reason),  the next higher resolution will be used and
                           the display window centered on a black background.

       SDL_OPENGL          Create an OpenGL rendering context. You  should  have
                           previously   set   OpenGL   video   attributes   with
                           SDL_GL_SetAttribute.

       SDL_OPENGLBLIT      Create an OpenGL rendering context, like  above,  but
                           allow  normal  blitting  operations.  The screen (2D)
                           surface   may   have   an    alpha    channel,    and
                           SDL_UpdateRects  must be used for updating changes to
                           the screen surface.

       SDL_RESIZABLE       Create a resizable window. When the window is resized
                           by  the user a SDL_VIDEORESIZE event is generated and
                           SDL_SetVideoMode can be called  again  with  the  new
                           size.

       SDL_NOFRAME         If  possible, SDL_NOFRAME causes SDL to create a win&#8208;
                           dow with no title bar or frame decoration. Fullscreen
                           modes automatically have this flag set.

              Note:

              Whatever flags SDL_SetVideoMode could satisfy are set in the flags
              member of the returned surface.

              Note:

              The bpp parameter is the number of bits per pixel, so a bpp of  24
              uses the packed representation of 3 bytes/pixel. For the more com&#8208;
              mon 4 bytes/pixel mode, use a bpp of 32. Somewhat oddly,  both  15
              and 16 will request a 2 bytes/pixel mode, but different pixel for&#8208;
              mats.

RETURN VALUE
       The framebuffer surface, or NULL if it fails.  The  surface  returned  is
       freed by SDL_Quit() and should nt be freed by the caller.
