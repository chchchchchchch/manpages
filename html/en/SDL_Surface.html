NAME
       SDL_Surface - Graphical Surface Structure

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct SDL_Surface {
               Uint32 flags;                           /* Read-only */

               int w, h;                               /* Read-only */
               Uint16 pitch;                           /* Read-only */
               void *pixels;                           /* Read-write */

               /* clipping information */

               int refcount;                           /* Read-mostly */

            /* This structure also contains private fields not shown here */
       } SDL_Surface;

STRUCTURE DATA
       flags               Surface flags

       format              Pixel format

       w, h                Width and height of the surface

       pitch               Length of a surface scanline in bytes

       pixels              Pointer to the actual pixel data

       clip_rect           surface clip rectangle

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_Surface&apos;s  represent  areas of &quot;graphical&quot; memory, memory that can be
       drawn  to.  The  video  framebuffer  is  returned  as  a  SDL_Surface  by
       SDL_SetVideoMode  and  SDL_GetVideoSurface.  Most of the fields should be
       pretty obvious. w and h are the width and height of the surface  in  pix&#8208;
       els.  pixels is a pointer to the actual pixel data, the surface should be
       locked before accessing this field. The clip_rect field is  the  clipping
       rectangle as set by SDL_SetClipRect.

       The following are supported in the flags field.

       SDL_SWSURFACE       Surface is stored in system memory

       SDL_HWSURFACE       Surface is stored in video memory

       SDL_ASYNCBLIT       Surface uses asynchronous blits if possible

       SDL_ANYFORMAT       Allows any pixel-format (Display surface)

       SDL_HWPALETTE       Surface has exclusive palette

       SDL_DOUBLEBUF       Surface is double buffered (Display surface)

       SDL_FULLSCREEN      Surface is full screen (Display Surface)

       SDL_OPENGL          Surface has an OpenGL context (Display Surface)

       SDL_OPENGLBLIT      Surface supports OpenGL blitting (Display Surface)
&#12;       SDL_RESIZABLE       Surface is resizable (Display Surface)

       SDL_HWACCEL         Surface blit uses hardware acceleration

       SDL_SRCCOLORKEY     Surface use colorkey blitting

       SDL_RLEACCEL        Colorkey blitting is accelerated with RLE

       SDL_SRCALPHA        Surface blit uses alpha blending

       SDL_PREALLOC        Surface uses preallocated memory
