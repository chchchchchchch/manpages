SDL_SysWMEvent(3)               SDL API Reference              SDL_SysWMEvent(3)



NAME
       SDL_SysWMEvent - Platform-dependent window manager event.

DESCRIPTION
       The  system  window  manager  event contains a pointer to system-specific
       information about unknown window manager events. If you enable this event
       using  SDL_EventState(),  it  will be generated whenever unhandled events
       are received from the window manager. This can be used, for  example,  to
       implement cut-and-paste in your application.

       typedef struct {
                Uint8 type;   /* Always SDL_SysWM */
        } SDL_SysWMEvent;

        If  you want to obtain system-specific information about the window man&#8208;
       ager, you can fill  the  version  member  of  a  SDL_SysWMinfo  structure
       (details  can  be found in SDL_syswm.h, which must be included) using the
       SDL_VERSION() macro found in SDL_version.h, and pass it to the function:

       int SDL_GetWMInfo(SDL_SysWMinfo *info);
