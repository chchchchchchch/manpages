SDL_UpdateRects(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_UpdateRects(3)



NAME
       SDL_UpdateRects  -  Makes sure the given list of rectangles is updated on
       the given screen.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       void SDL_UpdateRects(SDL_Surface *screen, int numrects, SDL_Rect *rects);

DESCRIPTION
       Makes sure the given list of rectangles is updated on the  given  screen.
       The  rectangles  must  all  be  confined within the screen boundaries (no
       clipping is done).

       This function should not be called while screen is locked.

              Note:

              It is adviced to call this function only  once  per  frame,  since
              each  call  has  some  processing overhead. This is no restriction
              since you can pass any number of rectangles each time.

              The rectangles are not automatically merged or checked  for  over&#8208;
              lap.  In  general,  the programmer can use his knowledge about his
              particular rectangles to merge them in an efficient way, to  avoid
              overdraw.
