NAME
       SDL_UserEvent - A user-defined event type

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint8 type;
         int code;
         void *data1;
         void *data2;
       } SDL_UserEvent;

STRUCTURE DATA
       type                SDL_USEREVENT through to SDL_NUMEVENTS-1

       code                User defined event code

       data1               User defined data pointer

       data2               User defined data pointer

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_UserEvent  is  in  the  user  member of the structure SDL_Event. This
       event is unique, it is never created by SDL but only  by  the  user.  The
       event  can  be  pushed onto the event queue using SDL_PushEvent. The con&#8208;
       tents of the structure members or completely up to  the  programmer,  the
       only   requirement  is  that  type  is  a  value  from  SDL_USEREVENT  to
       SDL_NUMEVENTS-1 (inclusive).

EXAMPLES
       SDL_Event event;

       event.type = SDL_USEREVENT;
       event.user.code = my_event_code;
       event.user.data1 = significant_data;
       event.user.data2 = 0;
       SDL_PushEvent(&amp;event);
