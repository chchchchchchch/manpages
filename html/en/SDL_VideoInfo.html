NAME
       SDL_VideoInfo - Video Target information

STRUCTURE DEFINITION
       typedef struct{
         Uint32 hw_available:1;
         Uint32 wm_available:1;
         Uint32 blit_hw:1;
         Uint32 blit_hw_CC:1;
         Uint32 blit_hw_A:1;
         Uint32 blit_sw:1;
         Uint32 blit_sw_CC:1;
         Uint32 blit_sw_A:1;
         Uint32 blit_fill;
         Uint32 video_mem;
         SDL_PixelFormat *vfmt;
       } SDL_VideoInfo;

STRUCTURE DATA
       hw_available        Is it possible to create hardware surfaces?

       wm_available        Is there a window manager available

       blit_hw             Are hardware to hardware blits accelerated?

       blit_hw_CC          Are hardware to hardware colorkey blits accelerated?

       blit_hw_A           Are hardware to hardware alpha blits accelerated?

       blit_sw             Are software to hardware blits accelerated?

       blit_sw_CC          Are software to hardware colorkey blits accelerated?

       blit_sw_A           Are software to hardware alpha blits accelerated?

       blit_fill           Are color fills accelerated?

       video_mem           Total amount of video memory in Kilobytes

       vfmt                Pixel format of the video device

DESCRIPTION
       This  (read-only)  structure is returned by SDL_GetVideoInfo. It contains
