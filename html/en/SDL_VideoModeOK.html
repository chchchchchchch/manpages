SDL_VideoModeOK(3)              SDL API Reference             SDL_VideoModeOK(3)



NAME
       SDL_VideoModeOK - Check to see if a particular video mode is supported.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

       int SDL_VideoModeOK(int width, int height, int bpp, Uint32 flags);

DESCRIPTION
       SDL_VideoModeOK  returns  0  if the requested mode is not supported under
       any bit depth, or returns the bits-per-pixel  of  the  closest  available
       mode  with  the  given  width,  height  and  requested surface flags (see
       SDL_SetVideoMode).

       The bits-per-pixel value returned is only a suggested mode. You can  usu&#8208;
       ally  request  and  bpp you want when setting the video mode and SDL will
       emulate that color depth with a shadow video surface.

       The arguments to SDL_VideoModeOK are the same  ones  you  would  pass  to
       SDL_SetVideoMode

EXAMPLE
       SDL_Surface *screen;
       Uint32 bpp;
       .
       .
       .
       printf(&quot;Checking mode 640x480@16bpp.
       &quot;);
       bpp=SDL_VideoModeOK(640, 480, 16, SDL_HWSURFACE);

       if(!bpp){
         printf(&quot;Mode not available.
       &quot;);
         exit(-1);
       }

       printf(&quot;SDL Recommends 640x480@%dbpp.
       &quot;, bpp);
       screen=SDL_SetVideoMode(640, 480, bpp, SDL_HWSURFACE);
       .
       .
