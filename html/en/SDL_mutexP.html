SDL_mutexP(3)                   SDL API Reference                  SDL_mutexP(3)



NAME
       SDL_mutexP - Lock a mutex

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;SDL.h&quot; #include &quot;SDL_thread.h&quot;

       int SDL_mutexP(SDL_mutex *mutex);

DESCRIPTION
       Locks  the  mutex,  which was previously created with SDL_CreateMutex. If
       the mutex is already locked then SDL_mutexP will not return until  it  is
       unlocked. Returns 0 on success, or -1 on an error.

       SDL also defines a macro #define SDL_LockMutex(m) SDL_mutexP(m).
