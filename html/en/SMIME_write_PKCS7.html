NAME
       SMIME_write_PKCS7 - convert PKCS#7 structure to S/MIME format.

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/pkcs7.h&gt;

        int SMIME_write_PKCS7(BIO *out, PKCS7 *p7, BIO *data, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       SMIME_write_PKCS7() adds the appropriate MIME headers to a PKCS#7
       structure to produce an S/MIME message.

       out is the BIO to write the data to. p7 is the appropriate PKCS7
       structure. If streaming is enabled then the content must be supplied in
       the data argument. flags is an optional set of flags.

NOTES
       The following flags can be passed in the flags parameter.

       If PKCS7_DETACHED is set then cleartext signing will be used, this option
       only makes sense for signedData where PKCS7_DETACHED is also set when
       PKCS7_sign() is also called.

       If the PKCS7_TEXT flag is set MIME headers for type text/plain are added
       to the content, this only makes sense if PKCS7_DETACHED is also set.

       If the PKCS7_STREAM flag is set streaming is performed. This flag should
       only be set if PKCS7_STREAM was also set in the previous call to
       PKCS7_sign() or PKCS7_encrypt().

       If cleartext signing is being used and PKCS7_STREAM not set then the data
       must be read twice: once to compute the signature in PKCS7_sign() and
       once to output the S/MIME message.

       If streaming is performed the content is output in BER format using
       indefinite length constructuted encoding except in the case of signed
       data with detached content where the content is absent and DER format is
       used.

BUGS
       SMIME_write_PKCS7() always base64 encodes PKCS#7 structures, there should
       be an option to disable this.

RETURN VALUES
       SMIME_write_PKCS7() returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
