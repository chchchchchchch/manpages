NAME
       SOAP::Client - exists purely as a superclass for client classes declared
       by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules.

DESCRIPTION
       The SOAP::Client class exists purely as a superclass for client classes
       declared by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules. The methods it
       provides are all simple accessors; they return the current value when
       called with no arguments or set the attribute value and return the object
       reference when called with an argument. These attributes include:

METHODS
       code, message, status
           Stores the response code, message, and status from the most-recent
           send attempt. For some protocols, such as FTP, the same value is used
           for all three because of the lack of finer-grained detail (the
           default is to ensure that all three attributes contain data, even if
           redundant). Other protocols (such as HTTP) have distinct values in
           each.

       endpoint
           Identifies the current endpoint to which messages are being sent.
           This should match the value of the transport method from the
           SOAP::Transport class, but setting this doesn&apos;t propagate to the
           transport object. It is better to use the transport object (or the
           shortcut via the SOAP::Lite object itself) when setting this.

       is_success
           The success or failure of the most-recent transmission is noted here
           as a boolean value.

       options
           The options attribute keeps a hash-table reference of additional
           options and their values. At present, only one option is used by any
           of the transport modules:

           compress_threshold
               The value of this option should be a numerical value. If set, and
               if the Compress::Zlib library is available, messages whose size
               in bytes exceeds this value will be compressed before sending.
               Both ends of the conversation must have it enabled.

           Other options may be defined using this mechanism. Note that setting
           the options using this accessor requires a full hash reference be
           passed. To set just one or a few values, consider retrieving the
           current reference value and using it to set the key(s).
