NAME
       SOAP::Deserializer - the means by which the toolkit manages the
       conversion of XML into an object manageable by a developer

DESCRIPTION
       SOAP::Deserializer provides the means by which incoming XML is decoded
       into a Perl data structure.

METHODS
       context
           This provides access to the calling context of &quot;SOAP::Deserializer&quot;.
           In a client side context the often means a reference to an instance
           of SOAP::Lite. In a server side context this means a reference to a
           SOAP::Server instance.

EXAMPLES
   DESERIALIZING RAW XML INTO A SOAP::SOM OBJECT
       A useful utility for SOAP::Deserializer is for parsing raw XML documents
       or fragments into a SOAP::SOM object. SOAP::Lite developers use this
       technique to write unit tests for the SOAP::Lite module itself. It is a
       lot more efficient for testing aspects of the toolkit than generating
       client calls over the network. This is a perfect way for developers to
       write unit tests for their custom data types for example.

       Here is an example of how raw XML content can be parsed into a SOAP::SOM
       object by using SOAP::Deserializer:

           $xml = &lt;&lt;END_XML;
           &lt;foo&gt;
             &lt;person&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;123&lt;/foo&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;456&lt;/foo&gt;
             &lt;/person&gt;
             &lt;person&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;789&lt;/foo&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;012&lt;/foo&gt;
             &lt;/person&gt;
           &lt;/foo&gt;
           END_XML

           my $som = SOAP::Deserializer-&gt;deserialize($xml);
