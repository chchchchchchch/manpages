NAME
       SOAP::Fault - encapsulates SOAP faults prior to their serialization or
       after their deserialization

DESCRIPTION
       This class encapsulates SOAP faults prior to their serialization or after
       their deserialization. The methods available are a constructor and four
       accessors. Each accessor creates an object on demand, just as the other
       classes do, when called as a static method. Like other accessors in the
       SOAP::Lite package, they return the object itself when setting the
       attribute.

GENERATING A SOAP FAULT
       To generate a SOAP Fault simply issue a Perl die command on the server
       side as you might normally. The SOAP processor will intercept the die
       command and return a SOAP Fault, using the string passed to the die
       command as the faultstring, to the client making the call. If you require
       having more control over the SOAP Fault returned to the client, then
       simply pass a SOAP::Fault object to the die command and the SOAP
       processor will behave accordingly. For example:

         die SOAP::Fault-&gt;faultcode(&apos;Server.Custom&apos;) # will be qualified
                        -&gt;faultstring(&apos;Died in server method&apos;)
                        -&gt;faultdetail(bless {code =&gt; 1} =&gt; &apos;BadError&apos;)
                        -&gt;faultactor(&apos;http://www.soaplite.com/custom&apos;);

METHODS
       new(optional data)
               $fault = SOAP::Fault-&gt;new(faultcode =&gt; &apos;Server&apos;);

           Explicitly creates a new SOAP::Fault object. Any of the four
           attributes represented next by accessor methods may be passed in the
           argument list with values immediately following their attribute name.

       faultcode(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode(&apos;MethodUnknown&apos;);

           Returns the current fault code or sets it if a value is given.

       faultstring(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultstring(&quot;There is no $method here&quot;);

           Returns or sets the fault string.

       faultactor(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode($header-&gt;actor);

           Returns or sets the fault-actor element. Note that the actor isn&apos;t
           always required in a SOAP fault.

       faultdetail(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode(bless { proxy =&gt; $ip }, &apos;Err&apos;);

           Returns or sets the fault&apos;s detail element. Like the actor, this
           isn&apos;t always a required element. Note that fault detail content in a
           message is represented as tag blocks. Thus, the values passed to this
           accessor when setting the value are either SOAP::Data objects, or
           more general blessed hash references.

       In addition to these methods, the SOAP::Fault package also provides
       detail as an alias for faultdetail. The former is the actual name of the
       element with SOAP faults, but the latter name is less ambiguous when
       regarded with the rest of the SOAP::Lite package. Objects of this class
       also have a special stringification enabled. If an object is printed or
       otherwise stringified, the value produced is faultcode: faultstring, with
       the attribute values of the object.
