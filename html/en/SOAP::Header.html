SOAP::Header(3pm)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     SOAP::Header(3pm)



NAME
       SOAP::Header - similar to SOAP::Data elements, a SOAP::Header object
       simply is encoded in the SOAP Header block

DESCRIPTION
       Objects instantiated from the SOAP::Header class are functionally the
       same as SOAP::Data objects, and as such share all the methods from that
       class. The distinction may be cosmetic, but it is present so that
       applications may more easily distinguish header blocks from more generic
       data elements.

SEE ALSO
       SOAP::Data
