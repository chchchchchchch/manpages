NAME
       SOAP::Schema - provides an umbrella for the way in which SOAP::Lite
       manages service description schemas

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides an umbrella for the way in which SOAP::Lite manages
       service description schemas. Currently, the only support present is for
       the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). This is another of the
       classes not generally designed to be directly instantiated by an
       application, though it can be if so desired.

METHODS
       new(optional key/value pairs)
               $schema = SOAP::Schema-&gt;new(parse =&gt; $schema_uri);

           This is the class constructor. With no arguments, it creates a blank
           object of the class. Any arguments that are passed are treated as
           key/value pairs in which the key represents one of the methods
           described here, and the value is what gets passed when the method
           itself gets invoked.

       parse(service description URI)
               $schema-&gt;parse(&apos;http://schemas.w3.org/soap.wsdl&apos;);

           Parses the internal representation of the service description prior
           to the generation of stub routines to provide method-like access to
           the remote services.

       access(service description URI)
               $schema-&gt;access(&apos;http://soap.org/service.wsdl&apos;);

           Loads the specified service description from the given URL, using the
           current value of the schema accessor if none is provided. The full
           content of the URL is returned on success, or an exception is thrown
           (via &quot;die&quot;) on error.

       load
               $schema-&gt;load;

           Takes the internal representation of the service and generates code
           stubs for the remote methods, allowing them to be called as local
           object methods. Stubs are generated for all the functions declared in
           the WSDL description with this call because it&apos;s enough of a class
           framework to allow for basic object creation for use as handles.

       schema
               $current_schema = $schema-&gt;schema;

           Gets (or sets) the current schema representation to be used by this
           object. The value to be passed when setting this is just the URI of
           the schema. This gets passed to other methods such as access for
           loading the actual content.

       services
               $hashref = $schema-&gt;services;

           Gets or sets the services currently stored on the object. The
           services are kept as a hash reference, whose keys and values are the
           list of returned values from the WSDL parser. Keys represent the
           names of the services themselves (names have been normalized into
           Perl-compatible identifiers), with values that are also hash
           references to the internal representation of the service itself.

       stub
           Returns the autogenerated Perl code as a string. This code is
           generated from the WSDL provided by the &quot;service&quot; method call. The
           code contains a package definition for the service being called.

               my $client = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new;
               my $code = $client-&gt;service($WSDL_URL)-&gt;stub;
               open FILE,&quot;&gt;ServicePackage.pm&quot;;
               print FILE $code;
               close FILE;

       cache_dir
           Sets/retrieves the value of the directory where generated stubs will
           be cached. If &quot;cache_dir&quot; is null, then no caching will be performed.

               my $client = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new;
               my $code = $client-&gt;cache_dir(&quot;/tmp&quot;)-&gt;service($WSDL_URL)-&gt;stub;

           If &quot;cache_dir&quot; is undefined, no caching will take place.

       cache_ttl
           Sets/retrieves the value of the time to live (in seconds) for cached
           files. This is only relevant when used in conjunction with
           &quot;cache_dir&quot;.

           If &quot;cache_ttl&quot; is set to 0, the cache will never expire. Files will
           have to be removed manually in order for the cache to be refreshed.

               my $client = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new;
               my $code = $client-&gt;cache_ttl(3600)-&gt;cache_dir(&quot;/tmp&quot;)-&gt;service($WSDL_URL)-&gt;stub;

           The default time to live is 0.

       useragent(LWP::UserAgent)
               my $client = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new;
               $ua = $client-&gt;schema-&gt;useragent;
               $ua-&gt;agent(&quot;Fubar! 0.1&quot;);
               my $response = $client-&gt;service(&quot;http://localhost/some.wsdl&quot;)
                                     -&gt;someMethod(&quot;Foo&quot;);

           Gets or sets the classes UserAgent used for retrieving schemas over
           the web.  This allows users to have direct access to the UserAgent so
           that they may control the credentials passed to a remote server, or
           the specific configuration of their HTTP agent.

SOAP::Schema::WSDL
       At present, the SOAP::Lite toolkit supports only loading of service
       descriptions in the WSDL syntax. This class manages the parsing and
       storing of these service specifications. As a general rule, this class
       should be even less likely to be used directly by an application because
       its presence should be completely abstracted by the previous class
       (SOAP::Schema). None of the methods are defined here; the class is only
       mentioned for sake of reference.
