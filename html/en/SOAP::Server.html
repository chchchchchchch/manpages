NAME
       SOAP::Server - provides the basic framework for the transport-specific
       server classes to build upon

DESCRIPTION
       The SOAP::Server class provides the basic framework for the transport-
       specific server classes to build upon. Note that in none of the code
       examples provided with SOAP::Lite is this class used directly. Instead,
       it is designed to be a superclass within more specific implementation
       classes. The methods provided by SOAP::Server itself are:

METHODS
       new(optional key/value pairs)
               $server = SOAP::Server-&gt;new(%options);

           Creates a new object of the class. Various default instance values
           are set up, and like many of the constructors in this module, most of
           the class methods described here may be passed in the construction
           call by giving the name followed by the parameter (or an array
           reference if there are multiple parameters).

       action(optional new value)
               $action = $server-&gt;action

           Retrieves or sets the value of the action attribute on the server
           object. This attribute is used when mapping the request to an
           appropriate namespace or routine. For example, the HTTP library sets
           the attribute to the value of the SOAPAction header when processing
           of the request begins, so that the find_target method described later
           may retrieve the value to match it against the server&apos;s
           configuration. Returns the object itself when setting the attribute.

       myuri(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;myuri(&quot;http://localhost:9000/SOAP&quot;);

           Gets or sets the myuri attribute. This specifies the specific URI
           that the server is answering requests to (which may be different from
           the value specified in action or in the SOAPAction header).

       serializer(optional new value)
       deserializer(optional new value)
               $serializer = $server-&gt;serializer;
               $server-&gt;deserializer($new_deser_obj);

           As with the client objects, these methods provide direct access to
           the serialization and deserialization objects the server object uses
           to transform input and output from and to XML. There is generally
           little or no need to explicitly set these to new values.

       options(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;options({compress_threshold =&gt; 10000});

           Sets (or retrieves) the current server options as a hash-table
           reference. At present, only one option is used within the SOAP::Lite
           libraries themselves:

           compress_threshold
               The value of this option is expected to be a numerical value. If
               set, and if the Compress::Zlib library is available to use,
               messages whose size in bytes exceeds this value are compressed
               for transmission. Both ends of the conversation have to support
               this and have it enabled.

           Other options may be defined and passed around using this mechanism.
           Note that setting the options using this accessor requires a full
           hash reference be passed. To set just one or a few values, retrieve
           the current reference value and use it to set the key(s).

       dispatch_with(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;dispatch_with($new_table);

           Represents one of two ways in which a SOAP::Server (or derived)
           object may specify mappings of incoming requests to server-side
           subroutines or namespaces. The value of the attribute is a hash-table
           reference. To set the attribute, you must pass a new hash reference.
           The hash table&apos;s keys are URI strings (literal URIs or the potential
           values of the SOAPAction header), and the corresponding values are
           one of a class name or an object reference. Requests that come in for
           a URI found in the table are routed to the specified class or through
           the specified object.

       dispatch_to(optional list of new values)
               $server-&gt;dispatch_to($dir, &apos;Module&apos;, &apos;Mod::meth&apos;);

           This is the more traditional way to specify modules and packages for
           routing requests. This is also an accessor, but it returns a list of
           values when called with no arguments (rather than a single one). Each
           item in the list of values passed to this method is expected to be
           one of four things:

           Directory path
               If the value is a directory path, all modules located in that
               path are available for remote use.

           Package name
               When the value is a package name (without including a specific
               method name), all routines within the package are available
               remotely.

           Fully qualified method name
               Alternately, when the value is a package-qualified name of a
               subroutine or method, that specific routine is made available.
               This allows the server to make selected methods available without
               opening the entire package.

           Object reference
               If the value is an object reference, the object itself routes the
               request.

               The list of values held by the dispatch_to table are compared
               only after the URI mapping table from the dispatch_with attribute
               has been consulted. If the request&apos;s URI or SOAPAction header
               don&apos;t map to a specific configuration, the path specified by the
               action header (or in absence, the URI) is converted to a package
               name and compared against this set of values.

       objects_by_reference(optional list of new values)
               $server-&gt;objects_by_reference(qw(My:: Class));

           This also returns a list of values when retrieving the current
           attribute value, as opposed to a single value.

           This method doesn&apos;t directly specify classes for request routing so
           much as it modifies the behavior of the routing for the specified
           classes. The classes that are given as arguments to this method are
           marked to be treated as producing persistent objects. The client is
           given an object representation that contains just a handle on a local
           object with a default persistence of 600 idle seconds.  Each
           operation on the object resets the idle timer to zero. This facility
           is considered experimental in the current version of SOAP::Lite.

           A global variable/&quot;constant&quot; allows developers to specify the amount
           of time an object will be persisted. The default value is 600 idle
           seconds. This value can be changed using the following code:

             $SOAP::Constants::OBJS_BY_REF_KEEPALIVE = 1000;

       on_action(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;on_action(sub { ...new code });

           Gets or sets the reference to a subroutine that is used for executing
           the on_action hook. Where the client code uses this hook to construct
           the action-request data (such as for a SOAPAction header), the server
           uses the on_action hook to do any last-minute tests on the request
           itself, before it gets routed to a final destination. When called,
           the hook routine is passed three arguments:

           action
               The action URI itself, retrieved from the action method described
               earlier.

           method_uri
               The URI of the XML namespace the method name is labeled with.

           method_name
               The name of the method being called by the request.

       on_dispatch(optional new value)
               ($uri, $name) = $server-&gt;on_dispatch-&gt;($request);

           Gets or sets the subroutine reference used for the on_dispatch hook.
           This hook is called at the start of the request-routing phase and is
           given a single argument when called:

           request
               An object of the SOAP::SOM class, containing the deserialized
               request from the client.

       find_target
               ($class, $uri, $name) = $server-&gt;find_target($req)

           Taking as its argument an object of the SOAP::SOM class that contains
           the deserialized request, this method returns a three-element list
           describing the method that is to be called. The elements are:

           class
               The class into which the method call should be made. This may
               come back as either a string or an objectreference, if the
               dispatching is configured using an object instance.

           uri The URN associated with the request method. This is the value
               that was used when configuring the method routing on the server
               object.

           name
               The name of the method to call.

       handle
               $server-&gt;handle($request_text);

           Implements the main functionality of the serving process, in which
           the server takes an incoming request and dispatches it to the correct
           server-side subroutine. The parameter taken as input is either plain
           XML or MIME-encoded content (if MIME-encoding support is enabled).

       make_fault
               return $server-&gt;makefault($code, $message);

           Creates a SOAP::Fault object from the data passed in. The order of
           arguments is: code, message, detail, actor. The first two are
           required (because they must be present in all faults), but the last
           two may be omitted unless needed.

   SOAP::Server::Parameters
       This class provides two methods, but the primary purpose from the
       developer&apos;s point of view is to allow classes that a SOAP server exposes
       to inherit from it. When a class inherits from the
       SOAP::Server::Parameters class, the list of parameters passed to a called
       method includes the deserialized request in the form of a SOAP::SOM
       object. This parameter is passed at the end of the arguments list, giving
       methods the option of ignoring it unless it is needed.

       The class provides two subroutines (not methods), for retrieving
       parameters from the SOAP::SOM object. These are designed to be called
       without an object reference in the parameter list, but with an array
       reference instead (as the first parameter). The remainder of the
       arguments list is expected to be the list from the method-call itself,
       including the SOAP::SOM object at the end of the list. The routines may
       be useful to understand if an application wishes to subclass
       SOAP::Server::Parameters and inherit from the new class instead.

       byNameOrOrder(order, parameter list, envelope)
               @args = SOAP::Server::Parameters::byNameOrOrder ([qw(a b)], @_);

           Using the list of argument names passed in the initial argument as an
           array reference, this routine returns a list of the parameter values
           for the parameters matching those names, in that order. If none of
           the names given in the initial array-reference exist in the parameter
           list, the values are returned in the order in which they already
           appear within the list of parameters. In this case, the number of
           returned values may differ from the length of the requested-
           parameters list.

       byName(order, parameter list, envelope)
               @args = SOAP::Server::Parameters::byName ([qw(a b c)], @_);

           Acts in a similar manner to the previous, with the difference that it
           always returns as many values as requested, even if some (or all)
           don&apos;t exist. Parameters that don&apos;t exist in the parameter list are
           returned as undef values.

       EXAMPLE

       The following is an example CGI based Web Service that utilizes a Perl
       module that inherits from the &quot;SOAP::Server::Parameters&quot; class. This
       allows the methods of that class to access its input by name.

           #!/usr/bin/perl
           use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;
           SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI
             -&gt;dispatch_to(&apos;C2FService&apos;)
             -&gt;handle;
           BEGIN {
             package C2FService;
             use vars qw(@ISA);
             @ISA = qw(Exporter SOAP::Server::Parameters);
             use SOAP::Lite;
             sub c2f {
               my $self = shift;
               my $envelope = pop;
               my $temp = $envelope-&gt;dataof(&quot;//c2f/temperature&quot;);
               return SOAP::Data-&gt;name(&apos;convertedTemp&apos; =&gt; (((9/5)*($temp-&gt;value)) + 32));
             }
           }
