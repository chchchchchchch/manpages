NAME
       SOAP::Trace - used only to manage and manipulate the runtime tracing of
       execution within the toolkit

DESCRIPTION
       This class has no methods or objects. It is used only to manage and
       manipulate the runtime tracing of execution within the toolkit. In
       absence of methods, this section reviews the events that may be
       configured and the ways of configuring them.

SYNOPSIS
       Tracing is enabled by the SOAP::Lite import method. This is usually done
       at compile-time, though it may be done explicitly by calling import
       directly. The commands for setting up tracing start with the keyword
       +trace. Alternately, +debug may be used; the two are interchangeable.
       After the initial keyword, one or more of the signals detailed here may
       be specified, optionally with a callback to handle them. When specifying
       multiple signals to be handled by a single callback, it is sufficient to
       list all of them first, followed finally by the callback, as in:

          use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt;
            method =&gt; fault =&gt; \&amp;message_level,
            trace =&gt; objects =&gt; \&amp;lower_level;

       In the fragment, the reference to message_level is installed as the
       callback for both method and fault signals, while lower_level is
       installed for trace and object events. If callbacks aren&apos;t explicitly
       provided, the default tracing action is to log a message to Perl&apos;s STDOUT
       file descriptor. Callbacks should expect a one or more arguments passed
       in, though the nature of the arguments varies based on the signal.

       Any signal can be disabled by prefacing the name with a hyphen, such as
       -result. This is useful with the pseudosignal &quot;all,&quot; which is shorthand
       for the full list of signals. The following fragment disables only the
       two signals, while still enabling the rest:

           SOAP::Lite-&gt;import(+trace =&gt; all =&gt; -result =&gt; -parameters);

       If the keyword +trace (or +debug) is used without any signals specified,
       it enables all signals (as if all were implied).

       The signals and their meaning follow. Each also bears a note as to
       whether the signal is relevant to a server application, client
       application, or both.

TRACE SIGNALS
       transport Client only
           Triggered in the transport layer just before a request is sent and
           immediately after a response is received. Each time the signal is
           sent, the sole argument to the callback is the relevant object. On
           requests, this is a HTTP::Request object; for responses, it&apos;s a
           HTTP::Response object.

       dispatch Server only
           Triggered with the full name of the method being dispatched, just
           before execution is passed to it. It is currently disabled in
           SOAP::Lite 0.55.

       result Server only
           Triggered after the method has been dispatched and is passed the
           results returned from the method as a list. The result values have
           not yet been serialized when this signal is sent.

       parameters Server only
           Triggered before a method call is actually dispatched, with the data
           that is intended for the call itself. The parameters for the method
           call are passed in as a list, after having been deserialized into
           Perl data.

       headers Server only
           This signal should be for triggering on the headers of an incoming
           message, but it isn&apos;t implemented as of SOAP::Lite 0.55.

       objects Client or server
           Highlights when an object is instantiated or destroyed. It is
           triggered in the new and DESTROY methods of the various SOAP::Lite
           classes.

       method Client or server
           Triggered with the list of arguments whenever the envelope method of
           SOAP::Serializer is invoked with an initial argument of method. The
           initial string itself isn&apos;t passed to the callback.

       fault Client or server
           As with the method signal earlier, except that this signal is
           triggered when SOAP::Serializer::envelope is called with an initial
           argument of fault.

       freeform Client or server
           Like the two previous, this signal is triggered when the method
           SOAP::Serializer::envelope is called with an initial parameter of
           freeform. This syntax is used when the method is creating SOAP::Data
           objects from free-form input data.

       trace Client or server
           Triggered at the entry-point of many of the more-significant
           functions. Not all the functions within the SOAP::Lite classes
           trigger this signal. Those that do are primarily the highly visible
           functions described in the interface descriptions for the various
           classes.

       debug Client or server
           Used in the various transport modules to track the contents of
           requests and responses (as ordinary strings, not as objects) at
           different points along the way.

EXAMPLES
   SELECTING SIGNALS TO TRACE
       The following code snippet will enable tracing for all signals:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; &apos;all&apos;;

       Or, the following will also do the trick:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace;

       You can disable tracing for a set of signals by prefixing the signal name
       with a hyphen. Therefore, if you wish to enable tracing for every signal
       EXCEPT transport signals, then you would use the code below:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ qw(all -transport) ];

   LOGGING SIGNALS TO A FILE
       You can optionally provide a subroutine or callback to each signal trace
       you declare. Each time a signal is received, it is passed to the
       corresponding subroutine. For example, the following code effectively
       logs all fault signals to a file called fault.log:
&#12;         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ fault =&gt; \&amp;log_faults ];

         sub log_faults {
           open LOGFILE,&quot;&gt;fault.log&quot;;
           print LOGFILE, $_[0] . &quot;\n&quot;;
           close LOGFILE;
         }

       You can also use a single callback for multiple signals using the code
       below:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ method, fault =&gt; \&amp;log ];

   LOGGING MESSAGE CONTENTS
       The transport signal is unique in the that the signal is not a text
       string, but the actually HTTP::Request being sent (just prior to be
       sent), or HTTP::Response object (immediately after it was received). The
       following code sample shows how to make use of this:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ transport =&gt; &amp;log_message ];

         sub log_message {
           my ($in) = @_;
           if (class($in) eq &quot;HTTP::Request&quot;) {
             # do something...
             print $in-&gt;contents; # ...for example
           } elsif (class($in) eq &quot;HTTP::Response&quot;) {
             # do something
           }
         }

   ON_DEBUG
       The &quot;on_debug&quot; method is available, as in:

         use SOAP::Lite;
         my $client = SOAP::Lite
           -&gt;uri($NS)
           -&gt;proxy($HOST)
           -&gt;on_debug( sub { print @_; } );
