NAME
       SOAP::Transport::LOOPBACK - Test loopback transport backend (Client only)

DESCRIPTION
       SOAP::Transport::LOOPBACK is a test transport backend for SOAP::Lite.

       It just returns the XML request as response, thus allowing to test the
       complete application stack of client applications from the front end down
       to the transport layer without actually sending data over the wire.

       Using this transport backend is triggered by setting a loopback:// URL.

       Sending requests through this transport backend alway succeeds with the
       following states:

        status: 200 OK
        code: 200
        message: OK
