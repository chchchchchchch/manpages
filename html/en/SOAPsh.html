NAME
       SOAPsh - Interactive shell for SOAP calls

SYNOPSIS
         perl SOAPsh http://services.soaplite.com/examples.cgi http://www.soaplite.com/My/Examples
         &gt; getStateName(2)
         &gt; getStateNames(1,2,3,7)
         &gt; getStateList([1,9])
         &gt; getStateStruct({a=&gt;1, b=&gt;24})
         &gt; Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

       or

         # all parameters after uri will be executed as methods
         perl SOAPsh http://soap.4s4c.com/ssss4c/soap.asp http://simon.fell.com/calc doubler([10,20,30])
         &gt; Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

DESCRIPTION
       SOAPsh is a shell for making SOAP calls. It takes two parameters:
       mandatory endpoint and optional uri (actually it will tell you about it
       if you try to run it). Additional commands can follow.

       After that you&apos;ll be able to run any methods of SOAP::Lite, like
       autotype, readable, encoding, etc. You can run it the same way as you do
       it in your Perl script. You&apos;ll see output from method, result of SOAP
       call, detailed info on SOAP faulure or transport error.

       For full list of available methods see documentation for SOAP::Lite.

       Along with methods of SOAP::Lite you&apos;ll be able (and that&apos;s much more
       interesting) run any SOAP methods you know about on remote server and see
       processed results. You can even switch on debugging (with call something
       like: &quot;on_debug(sub{print@_})&quot;) and see SOAP code with headers sent and
       received.
