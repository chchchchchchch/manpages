SSL_clear(3SSL)                      OpenSSL                     SSL_clear(3SSL)



NAME
       SSL_clear - reset SSL object to allow another connection

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_clear(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       Reset ssl to allow another connection. All settings (method, ciphers,
       BIOs) are kept.

NOTES
       SSL_clear is used to prepare an SSL object for a new connection. While
       all settings are kept, a side effect is the handling of the current SSL
       session.  If a session is still open, it is considered bad and will be
       removed from the session cache, as required by RFC2246. A session is
       considered open, if SSL_shutdown(3) was not called for the connection or
       at least SSL_set_shutdown(3) was used to set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state.

       If a session was closed cleanly, the session object will be kept and all
       settings corresponding. This explicitly means, that e.g. the special
       method used during the session will be kept for the next handshake. So if
       the session was a TLSv1 session, a SSL client object will use a TLSv1
       client method for the next handshake and a SSL server object will use a
       TLSv1 server method, even if SSLv23_*_methods were chosen on startup.
       This will might lead to connection failures (see SSL_new(3)) for a
       description of the method&apos;s properties.

WARNINGS
       SSL_clear() resets the SSL object to allow for another connection. The
       reset operation however keeps several settings of the last sessions (some
       of these settings were made automatically during the last handshake). It
       only makes sense for a new connection with the exact same peer that
       shares these settings, and may fail if that peer changes its settings
       between connections. Use the sequence SSL_get_session(3); SSL_new(3);
       SSL_set_session(3); SSL_free(3) instead to avoid such failures (or simply
       SSL_free(3); SSL_new(3) if session reuse is not desired).

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       0   The SSL_clear() operation could not be performed. Check the error
           stack to find out the reason.

       1   The SSL_clear() operation was successful.
