NAME
       SSL_get_peer_cert_chain - get the X509 certificate chain of the peer

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        STACKOF(X509) *SSL_get_peer_cert_chain(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_peer_cert_chain() returns a pointer to STACKOF(X509) certificates
       forming the certificate chain of the peer. If called on the client side,
       the stack also contains the peer&apos;s certificate; if called on the server
       side, the peer&apos;s certificate must be obtained separately using
       SSL_get_peer_certificate(3).  If the peer did not present a certificate,
       NULL is returned.

NOTES
       The peer certificate chain is not necessarily available after reusing a
       session, in which case a NULL pointer is returned.

       The reference count of the STACKOF(X509) object is not incremented.  If
       the corresponding session is freed, the pointer must not be used any
       longer.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was
           established or the certificate chain is no longer available when a
           session is reused.

       Pointer to a STACKOF(X509)
           The return value points to the certificate chain presented by the
           peer.
