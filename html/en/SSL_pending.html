SSL_pending(3SSL)                    OpenSSL                   SSL_pending(3SSL)



NAME
       SSL_pending - obtain number of readable bytes buffered in an SSL object

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_pending(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_pending() returns the number of bytes which are available inside ssl
       for immediate read.

NOTES
       Data are received in blocks from the peer. Therefore data can be buffered
       inside ssl and are ready for immediate retrieval with SSL_read(3).

RETURN VALUES
       The number of bytes pending is returned.

BUGS
       SSL_pending() takes into account only bytes from the TLS/SSL record that
       is currently being processed (if any).  If the SSL object&apos;s read_ahead
       flag is set, additional protocol bytes may have been read containing more
       TLS/SSL records; these are ignored by SSL_pending().

       Up to OpenSSL 0.9.6, SSL_pending() does not check if the record type of
       pending data is application data.
