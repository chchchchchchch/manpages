SSL_rstate_string(3SSL)              OpenSSL             SSL_rstate_string(3SSL)



NAME
       SSL_rstate_string, SSL_rstate_string_long - get textual description of
       state of an SSL object during read operation

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        const char *SSL_rstate_string(SSL *ssl);
        const char *SSL_rstate_string_long(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_rstate_string() returns a 2 letter string indicating the current read
       state of the SSL object ssl.

       SSL_rstate_string_long() returns a string indicating the current read
       state of the SSL object ssl.

NOTES
       When performing a read operation, the SSL/TLS engine must parse the
       record, consisting of header and body. When working in a blocking
       environment, SSL_rstate_string[_long]() should always return &quot;RD&quot;/&quot;read
       done&quot;.

       This function should only seldom be needed in applications.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_rstate_string() and SSL_rstate_string_long() can return the following
       values:

       &quot;RH&quot;/&quot;read header&quot;
           The header of the record is being evaluated.

       &quot;RB&quot;/&quot;read body&quot;
           The body of the record is being evaluated.

       &quot;RD&quot;/&quot;read done&quot;
           The record has been completely processed.

       &quot;unknown&quot;/&quot;unknown&quot;
           The read state is unknown. This should never happen.
