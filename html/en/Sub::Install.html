NAME
       Sub::Install - install subroutines into packages easily

VERSION
       version 0.926

SYNOPSIS
         use Sub::Install;

         Sub::Install::install_sub({
           code =&gt; sub { ... },
           into =&gt; $package,
           as   =&gt; $subname
         });

DESCRIPTION
       This module makes it easy to install subroutines into packages without
       the unslightly mess of &quot;no strict&quot; or typeglobs lying about where just
       anyone can see them.

FUNCTIONS
   install_sub
         Sub::Install::install_sub({
          code =&gt; \&amp;subroutine,
          into =&gt; &quot;Finance::Shady&quot;,
          as   =&gt; &apos;launder&apos;,
         });

       This routine installs a given code reference into a package as a normal
       subroutine.  The above is equivalent to:

         no strict &apos;refs&apos;;
         *{&quot;Finance::Shady&quot; . &apos;::&apos; . &quot;launder&quot;} = \&amp;subroutine;

       If &quot;into&quot; is not given, the sub is installed into the calling package.

       If &quot;code&quot; is not a code reference, it is looked for as an existing sub in
       the package named in the &quot;from&quot; parameter.  If &quot;from&quot; is not given, it
       will look in the calling package.

       If &quot;as&quot; is not given, and if &quot;code&quot; is a name, &quot;as&quot; will default to
       &quot;code&quot;.  If &quot;as&quot; is not given, but if &quot;code&quot; is a code ref, Sub::Install
       will try to find the name of the given code ref and use that as &quot;as&quot;.

       That means that this code:

         Sub::Install::install_sub({
           code =&gt; &apos;twitch&apos;,
           from =&gt; &apos;Person::InPain&apos;,
           into =&gt; &apos;Person::Teenager&apos;,
           as   =&gt; &apos;dance&apos;,
         });

       is the same as:

         package Person::Teenager;

         Sub::Install::install_sub({
           code =&gt; Person::InPain-&gt;can(&apos;twitch&apos;),
           as   =&gt; &apos;dance&apos;,
         });
&#12;   reinstall_sub
       This routine behaves exactly like &quot;install_sub&quot;, but does not emit a
       warning if warnings are on and the destination is already defined.

   install_installers
       This routine is provided to allow Sub::Install compatibility with
       Sub::Installer.  It installs &quot;install_sub&quot; and &quot;reinstall_sub&quot; methods
       into the package named by its argument.

        Sub::Install::install_installers(&apos;Code::Builder&apos;); # just for us, please
        Code::Builder-&gt;install_sub({ name =&gt; $code_ref });

        Sub::Install::install_installers(&apos;UNIVERSAL&apos;); # feeling lucky, punk?
        Anything::At::All-&gt;install_sub({ name =&gt; $code_ref });

       The installed installers are similar, but not identical, to those
       provided by Sub::Installer.  They accept a single hash as an argument.
       The key/value pairs are used as the &quot;as&quot; and &quot;code&quot; parameters to the
       &quot;install_sub&quot; routine detailed above.  The package name on which the
       method is called is used as the &quot;into&quot; parameter.

       Unlike Sub::Installer&apos;s &quot;install_sub&quot; will not eval strings into code,
       but will look for named code in the calling package.

EXPORTS
       Sub::Install exports &quot;install_sub&quot; and &quot;reinstall_sub&quot; only if they are
       requested.

   exporter
       Sub::Install has a never-exported subroutine called &quot;exporter&quot;, which is
       used to implement its &quot;import&quot; routine.  It takes a hashref of named
       arguments, only one of which is currently recognize: &quot;exports&quot;.  This
       must be an arrayref of subroutines to offer for export.

       This routine is mainly for Sub::Install&apos;s own consumption.  Instead,
       consider Sub::Exporter.

SEE ALSO
       Sub::Installer
           This module is (obviously) a reaction to Damian Conway&apos;s
           Sub::Installer, which does the same thing, but does it by getting its
           greasy fingers all over UNIVERSAL.  I was really happy about the idea
           of making the installation of coderefs less ugly, but I couldn&apos;t
           bring myself to replace the ugliness of typeglobs and loosened
           strictures with the ugliness of UNIVERSAL methods.

       Sub::Exporter
           This is a complete Exporter.pm replacement, built atop Sub::Install.
