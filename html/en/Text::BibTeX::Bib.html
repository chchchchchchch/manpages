NAME
       Text::BibTeX::Bib - defines the &quot;Bib&quot; database structure

SYNOPSIS
          $bibfile = new Text::BibTeX::File $filename;
          $bibfile-&gt;set_structure (&apos;Bib&apos;,
                                   # Default option values:
                                   sortby =&gt; &apos;name&apos;,
                                   namestyle =&gt; &apos;full&apos;
                                   nameorder =&gt; &apos;first&apos;,
                                   atitle =&gt; 1,
                                   labels =&gt; &apos;numeric&apos;);

          # Alternate option values:
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (sortby =&gt; &apos;year&apos;);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (namestyle =&gt; &apos;nopunct&apos;);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (namestyle =&gt; &apos;nospace&apos;);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (nameorder =&gt; &apos;last&apos;);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (atitle =&gt; 0);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (labels =&gt; &apos;alpha&apos;);   # not implemented yet!

          # parse entry from $bibfile and automatically make it a BibEntry
          $entry = new Text::BibTeX::Entry $bibfile;

          # or get an entry from somewhere else which is hard-coded to be
          # a BibEntry
          $entry = new Text::BibTeX::BibEntry ...;

          $sortkey = $entry-&gt;sort_key;
          @blocks = $entry-&gt;format;

DESCRIPTION
       (NOTE! Do not believe everything you read in this document.  The classes
       described here are unfinished and only lightly tested.  The current
       implementation is a proof-of-principle, to convince myself (and anyone
       who might be interested) that it really is possible to reimplement BibTeX
       0.99 in Perl using the core &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; classes; this principle is
       vaguely demonstrated by the current &quot;Bib*&quot; modules, but not really
       proved.  Many important features needed to reimplement the standard
       styles of BibTeX 0.99 are missing, even though this document may brashly
       assert otherwise.  If you are interested in using these classes, you
       should start by reading and grokking the code, and contributing the
       missing bits and pieces that you need.)

       &quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot; implements the database structure for bibliographies
       as defined by the standard styles of BibTeX 0.99.  It does this by
       providing two classes, &quot;BibStructure&quot; and &quot;BibEntry&quot; (the leading
       &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; is implied, and will be omitted for the rest of this
       document).  These two classes, being specific to bibliographic data, are
       outside of the core &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; class hierarchy, but are distributed
       along with it as they provide a canonical example of a specific database
       structure using classes derived from the core hierarchy.

       &quot;BibStructure&quot;, which derives from the &quot;Structure&quot; class, deals with the
       structure as a whole: it handles structure options and describes all the
       types and fields that make up the database structure.  If you&apos;re
       interested in writing your own database structure modules, the standard
       interface for both of these is described in Text::BibTeX::Structure; if
       you&apos;re just interested in finding out the exact database structure or the
       options supported by the &quot;Bib&quot; structure, you&apos;ve come to the right place.
       (However, you may have to wade through a bit of excess verbiage due to
       this module&apos;s dual purpose: first, to reimplement the standard styles of
       BibTeX 0.99, and second, to provide an example for other programmers
       wishing to implement new or derived database structure modules.)

       &quot;BibEntry&quot; derives from the &quot;StructuredEntry&quot; class and provides methods
       that operate on individual entries presumed to come from a database
       conforming to the structure defined by the &quot;BibStructure&quot; class.
       (Actually, to be completely accurate, &quot;BibEntry&quot; inherits from two
       intermediate classes, &quot;BibSort&quot; and &quot;BibFormat&quot;.  These two classes just
       exist to reduce the amount of code in the &quot;Bib&quot; module, and thanks to the
       magic of inheritance, their existence is usually irrelevant.  But you
       might want to consult those two classes if you&apos;re interested in the gory
       details of sorting and formatting entries from BibTeX 0.99-style
       bibliography databases.)

STRUCTURE OPTIONS
       &quot;BibStructure&quot; handles several user-supplied &quot;structure options&quot; and
       methods for dealing with them.  The options currently supported by the
       &quot;Bib&quot; database structure, and the values allowed for them, are:

       &quot;sortby&quot;
           How to sort entries.  Valid values: &quot;name&quot; (sort on author names,
           year, and title), &quot;year&quot; (sort on year, author names, and title).
           Sorting on &quot;author names&quot; is a bit more complicated than just using
           the &quot;author&quot; field; see Text::BibTeX::BibSort for details.  Default
           value: &quot;name&quot;.

       &quot;namestyle&quot;
           How to print author (and editor) names: &quot;full&quot; for unabbreviated
           first names, &quot;abbrev&quot; for first names abbreviated with periods,
           &quot;nopunct&quot; for first names abbreviated with space but no periods, and
           &quot;nospace&quot; to abbreviate without space or periods.  Default value:
           &quot;full&quot;.

       &quot;nameorder&quot;
           The order in which to print names: &quot;first&quot; for &quot;first von last jr&quot;
           order, and &quot;last&quot; for &quot;von last jr first&quot; order.  Default value:
           &quot;first&quot;.

       &quot;atitle_lower&quot;
           A boolean option: if true, non-book titles will be changed to
           &quot;sentence capitalization:&quot; words following colons and sentence-ending
           punctuation will be capitalized, and everything else at brace-depth
           zero will be changed to lowercase.  Default value: true.

       &quot;labels&quot;
           The type of bibliographic labels to generate: &quot;numeric&quot; or &quot;alpha&quot;.
           (Alphabetic labels are not yet implemented, so this option is
           currently ignored.)  Default value: &quot;numeric&quot;.

       Also, several &quot;markup options&quot; are supported.  Markup options are
       distinct because they don&apos;t change how text is extracted from the
       database entries and subsequently mangled; rather, they supply bits of
       markup that go around the database-derived text.  Markup options are
       always two-element lists: the first to &quot;turn on&quot; some feature of the
       markup language, and the second to turn it off.  For example, if your
       target language is LaTeX2e and you want journal names emphasized, you
       would supply a list reference &quot;[&apos;\emph{&apos;,&apos;}&apos;]&quot; for the &quot;journal_mkup&quot;
       option.  If you were instead generating HTML, you might supply
       &quot;[&apos;&lt;emph&gt;&apos;,&apos;&lt;/emph&gt;&apos;]&quot;.  To keep the structure module general with
       respect to markup languages, all markup options are empty by default.
       (Or, rather, they are all references to lists consisting of two empty
       strings.)

       &quot;name_mkup&quot;
           Markup to add around the list of author names.
&#12;       &quot;atitle_mkup&quot;
           Markup to add around non-book (article) titles.

       &quot;btitle_mkup&quot;
           Markup to add around book titles.

       &quot;journal_mkup&quot;
           Markup to add around journal names.

   Option methods
       As required by the &quot;Text::BibTeX::Structure&quot; module, &quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot;
       provides two methods for handling options: &quot;known_option&quot; and
       &quot;default_option&quot;.  (The other two option methods, &quot;set_options&quot; and
       &quot;get_options&quot;, are just inherited from &quot;Text::BibTeX::Structure&quot;.)

       known_option (OPTION)
           Returns true if OPTION is one of the options on the above list.

       default_option (OPTION)
           Returns the default value of OPTION, or &quot;croak&quot;s if OPTION is not a
           supported option.

DATABASE STRUCTURE
       The other purpose of a structure class is to provide a method,
       &quot;describe_entry&quot;, that lists the allowed entry types and the known fields
       for the structure.  Programmers wishing to write their own database
       structure module should consult Text::BibTeX::Structure for the
       conventions and requirements of this method; the purpose of the present
       document is to describe the &quot;Bib&quot; database structure.

       The allowed entry types, and the fields recognized for them, are:

       &quot;article&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;journal&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional
           fields: &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;pages&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

       &quot;inproceedings&quot;
       &quot;conference&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;booktitle&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional
           fields: &quot;editor&quot;, &quot;series&quot;, &quot;pages&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;month&quot;,
           &quot;organization&quot;, &quot;publisher&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.  Constrained fields: at most one
           of &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;number&quot;.

       &quot;manual&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;title&quot;.  Optional fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;organization&quot;,
           &quot;address&quot;, &quot;edition&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

       &quot;mastersthesis&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional
           fields: &quot;type&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

       &quot;misc&quot;
           Required fields: none.  Optional fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;,
           &quot;howpublished&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

       &quot;phdthesis&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional
           fields: &quot;type&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

       &quot;proceedings&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;title&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional fields: &quot;editor&quot;,
           &quot;series&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;organization&quot;, &quot;publisher&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.
           Constrained fields: at most one of &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;number&quot;.

       &quot;techreport&quot;
           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;institution&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.  Optional
           fields: &quot;type&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.

           Required fields: &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;note&quot;.  Optional fields:
           &quot;month&quot;, &quot;year&quot;.

STRUCTURED ENTRY CLASS
       The second class provided by the &quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot; module is &quot;BibEntry&quot;
       (again, a leading &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; is implied).  This being a structured
       entry class, it derives from &quot;StructuredEntry&quot;.  The conventions and
       requirements for such a class are documented in Text::BibTeX::Structure
       for the benefit of programmers implementing their own structure modules.

       If you wish to write utilities making use of the &quot;Bib&quot; database
       structure, then you should call one of the &quot;officially supported&quot; methods
       provided by the &quot;BibEntry&quot; class.  Currently, there are only two of
       these: &quot;sort_key&quot; and &quot;format&quot;.  These are actually implemented in the
       &quot;BibSort&quot; and &quot;BibFormat&quot; classes, respectively, which are base classes
       of &quot;BibEntry&quot;.  Thus, see Text::BibTeX::BibSort and
       Text::BibTeX::BibFormat for details on these two methods.
