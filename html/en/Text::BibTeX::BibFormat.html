NAME
       Text::BibTeX::BibFormat - formats bibliography entries

SYNOPSIS
          # Assuming $entry comes from a database of the &apos;Bib&apos; structure
          # (i.e., that it&apos;s blessed into the BibEntry class, which inherits
          # the format method from BibFormat):
          @blocks = $entry-&gt;format;

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;Text::BibTeX::BibFormat&quot; class is a base class of
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::BibEntry&quot; for formatting bibliography entries.  It thus
       performs the main job of any program that would hope to supplant BibTeX
       itself; the other important job (sorting) is handled by its companion
       class, &quot;Text::BibTeX::BibSort&quot;.

       &quot;BibFormat&quot; (the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; prefix will be dropped for brevity) pays
       attention to almost all of the structure options described in
       Text::BibTeX::Bib; it only ignores those that cover sorting, currently
       just &quot;sortby&quot;.  In particular, all of the &quot;markup&quot; options control what
       language is generated by &quot;BibFormat&quot;; if none of those options are set,
       then it will generate plain, unmarked text.

       The only method in &quot;BibFormat&quot;&apos;s documented interface (so far) is
       &quot;format&quot;.  (The class defines many other methods, but these should not be
       necessary to outsiders, so they are undocumented and subject to change.)

METHODS
       format ()
           Formats a single entry for inclusion in the bibliography of some
           document.  The exact processing performed is highly dependent on the
           entry type and the fields present; in general, you should be able to
           join &quot;format&quot;&apos;s outputs together to create a single paragraph for
           inclusion in a document of whatever markup language you&apos;re working
           with.

           Returns a list of &quot;blocks,&quot; which can either be jammed together like
           sentences (for a traditional &quot;tight&quot; bibliography) or printed on
           separate lines (for an &quot;open&quot; bibliography format).  Each block is a
           reference to a list of sentences; sentences should be joined together
           with an intervening period.  Each sentence is either a single string
           or a list of clauses; clauses should be joined together with an
           intervening comma.  Each clause is just a simple string.

           See the source code for &quot;btformat&quot; for an example of how to use the
           output of &quot;format&quot;.
