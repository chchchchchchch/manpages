NAME
       Text::BibTeX::BibSort - generate sort keys for bibliographic entries

SYNOPSIS
          # Assuming $entry comes from a database of the &apos;Bib&apos; structure
          # (i.e., that it&apos;s blessed into the BibEntry class, which inherits
          # the sort_key method from BibSort):
          $sort_key = $entry-&gt;sort_key;

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::BibSort&quot; is a base class of &quot;Text::BibTeX::BibEntry&quot; for
       generating sort keys from bibliography entries.  It could in principle
       (and, someday, might) offer a wide range of highly customizable sort-key
       generators.  Currently, though, it provides only a single method
       (&quot;sort_key&quot;) for public use, and that method only pays attention to one
       structure option, &quot;sortby&quot;.

METHODS
       sort_key ()
           Generates a sort key for a single bibliographic entry.  Assumes this
           entry conforms to the &quot;Bib&quot; database structure.  The nature of this
           sort key is controlled by the &quot;sortby&quot; option, which can be either
           &quot;name&quot; or &quot;year&quot;.  (The &quot;namestyle&quot; also has a role, in determining
           how author/editor names are formatted for inclusion in the sort key.)

           For by-name sorting (which is how BibTeX&apos;s standard styles work), the
           sort key consists of one of the &quot;author&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;, &quot;organization&quot;,
           or &quot;key&quot; fields (depending on the entry type and which fields are
           actually present), followed by the year and the title.  All fields
           are drastically simplified to produce the sort key: non-English
           letters are mercilessly anglicized, non-alphabetic characters are
           stripped, and everything is forced to lowercase.  (The first two
           steps are done by the &quot;purify_string&quot; routine; see &quot;Generic string-
           processing functions&quot; in Text::BibTeX for a brief description, and
           the descripton of the C function &quot;bt_purify_string()&quot; in bt_misc for
           all the gory details.)
