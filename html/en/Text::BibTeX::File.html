NAME
       Text::BibTeX::File - interface to whole BibTeX files

SYNOPSIS
          use Text::BibTeX;     # this loads Text::BibTeX::File

          $bib = new Text::BibTeX::File &quot;foo.bib&quot; or die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;;
          # or:
          $bib = new Text::BibTeX::File;
          $bib-&gt;open (&quot;foo.bib&quot;) || die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;;

          $bib-&gt;set_structure ($structure_name,
                               $option1 =&gt; $value1, ...);

          $at_eof = $bib-&gt;eof;

          $bib-&gt;close;

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; provides an object-oriented interface to BibTeX
       files.  Its most obvious purpose is to keep track of a filename and
       filehandle together for use by the &quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; module (which is
       much more interesting).  In addition, it allows you to specify certain
       options which are applicable to a whole database (file), rather than
       having to specify them for each entry in the file.  Currently, you can
       specify the database structure and some structure options.  These
       concepts are fully documented in Text::BibTeX::Structure.

METHODS
   Object creation, file operations
       new ([FILENAME [,MODE [,PERMS]]])
           Creates a new &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object.  If FILENAME is supplied,
           passes it to the &quot;open&quot; method (along with MODE and PERMS if they are
           supplied).  If the &quot;open&quot; fails, &quot;new&quot; fails and returns false; if
           the &quot;open&quot; succeeds (or if FILENAME isn&apos;t supplied), &quot;new&quot; returns
           the new object reference.

       open (FILENAME [,MODE [,PERMS]])
           Opens the file specified by FILENAME, possibly using MODE and PERMS.
           See IO::File for full semantics; this &quot;open&quot; is just a front end for
           &quot;IO::File::open&quot;.

       close ()
           Closes the filehandle associated with the object.  If there is no
           such filehandle (i.e., &quot;open&quot; was never called on the object), does
           nothing.

       eof ()
           Returns the end-of-file state of the filehandle associated with the
           object: a true value means we are at the end of the file.

   Object properties
       set_structure (STRUCTURE [, OPTION =&gt; VALUE, ...])
           Sets the database structure for a BibTeX file.  At the simplest
           level, this means that entries from the file are expected to conform
           to certain field requirements as specified by the structure module.
           It also gives you full access to the methods of the particular
           structured entry class for this structure, allowing you to perform
           operations specific to this kind of database.  See &quot;CLASS
           INTERACTIONS&quot; in Text::BibTeX::Structure for all the consequences of
           setting the database structure for a &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object.
&#12;       structure ()
           Returns the name of the database structure associated with the object
           (as set by &quot;set_structure&quot;).

       preserve_values ([PRESERVE])
           Sets the &quot;preserve values&quot; flag, to control all future parsing of
           entries from this file.  If PRESERVE isn&apos;t supplied, returns the
           current state of the flag.  See Text::BibTeX::Value for details on
           parsing in &quot;value preservation&quot; mode.
