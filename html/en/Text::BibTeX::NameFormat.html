NAME
       Text::BibTeX::NameFormat - format BibTeX-style author names

SYNOPSIS
          $format = new Text::BibTeX::NameFormat ($parts, $abbrev_first);

          $format-&gt;set_text ($part,
                             $pre_part, $post_part,
                             $pre_token, $post_token);

          $format-&gt;set_options ($part, $abbrev, $join_tokens, $join_part

          $formatted_name = $format-&gt;apply ($name);

DESCRIPTION
       After splitting a name into its components parts (represented as a
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot; object), you often want to put it back together
       again as a single string formatted in a consistent way.
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot; provides a very flexible way to do this,
       generally in two stages: first, you create a &quot;name format&quot; which
       describes how to put the tokens and parts of any name back together, and
       then you apply the format to a particular name.

       The &quot;name format&quot; is encapsulated in a &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot; object.
       The constructor (&quot;new&quot;) includes some clever behind-the-scenes trickery
       that means you can usually get away with calling it alone, and not need
       to do any customization of the format object.  If you do need to
       customize the format, though, the &quot;set_text()&quot; and &quot;set_options()&quot;
       methods provide that capability.

       Note that &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot; is a fairly direct translation of
       the name-formatting C interface in the btparse library.  This manual page
       is meant to provide enough information to use the Perl class, but for
       more details and examples, consult bt_format_names.

CONSTANTS
       Two enumerated types for dealing with names and name formatting have been
       brought from C into Perl.  In the btparse documentation, you&apos;ll see
       references to &quot;bt_namepart&quot; and &quot;bt_joinmethod&quot;.  The former lists the
       four &quot;parts&quot; of a BibTeX name: first, von, last, and jr; its values (in
       both C and Perl) are &quot;BTN_FIRST&quot;, &quot;BTN_VON&quot;, &quot;BTN_LAST&quot;, and &quot;BTN_JR&quot;.
       The latter lists the ways in which &quot;bt_format_name()&quot; (the C function
       that corresponds to &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot;&apos;s &quot;apply&quot; method) can join
       adjacent tokens together: &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot;, &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot;, &quot;BTJ_FORCETIE&quot;, and
       &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;.  Both sets of values may be imported from the
       &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module, using the import tags &quot;nameparts&quot; and
       &quot;joinmethods&quot;.  For instance:

          use Text::BibTeX qw(:nameparts :joinmethods);
          use Text::BibTeX::Name;
          use Text::BibTeX::NameFormat;

       The &quot;name part&quot; constants are used to specify surrounding text or
       formatting options on a per-part basis: for instance, you can supply the
       &quot;pre-token&quot; text, or the &quot;abbreviate&quot; flag, for a single part without
       affecting other parts.  The &quot;join methods&quot; are two of the three
       formatting options that you can set for a part: you can control how to
       join the individual tokens of a name (&quot;JR Smith&quot;, or &quot;J R Smith&quot;, or &quot;J~R
       Smith&quot;, and you can control how the final token of one part is joined to
       the next part (&quot;la Roche&quot; versus &quot;la~Roche&quot;).

METHODS
       new (PARTS, ABBREV_FIRST)
           Creates a new name format, with the two most common customizations:
           which parts to include (and in what order), and whether to abbreviate
           the first name.  PARTS should be a string with at most four
           characters, one representing each part that you want to occur in a
           formatted name.  For example, &quot;fvlj&quot; means to format names in &quot;first
           von last jr&quot; order, while &quot;vljf&quot; denotes &quot;von last jr first.&quot;
           ABBREV_FIRST is just a boolean value: false to print out the first
           name in full, and true to abbreviate it with periods after each token
           and discretionary ties between tokens.  All intra- and inter-token
           punctuation and spacing is independently controllable with the
           &quot;set_text&quot; and &quot;set_options&quot; methods, although these will rarely be
           necessary---sensible defaults are chosen for everything, based on the
           PARTS and ABBREV_FIRST values that you supply.  See the description
           of &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot; in bt_format_names for full details of
           the choices made.

       set_text (PART, PRE_PART, POST_PART, PRE_TOKEN, POST_TOKEN)
           Allows you to customize some or all of the surrounding text for a
           single name part.  Every name part has four possible chunks of text
           that go around or within it: before/after the part as a whole, and
           before/after each token in the part.  For instance, if you are
           abbreviating first names and wish to control the punctuation after
           each token in the first name, you would set the &quot;post token&quot; text:

              $format-&gt;set_text (&apos;first&apos;, undef, undef, undef, &apos;&apos;);

           would set the post-token text to the empty string, resulting in names
           like &quot;J R Smith&quot;.  (Normally, abbreviated first names will have a
           period after each token: &quot;J. R. Smith&quot;.)  Note that supplying &quot;undef&quot;
           for the other three values leaves them unchanged.

           See bt_format_names for full information on formatting names.

       set_options (PART, ABBREV, JOIN_TOKENS, JOIN_PART)
           Allows further customization of a name format: you can set the
           abbreviation flag and the two token-join methods.  Alas, there is no
           mechanism for leaving a value unchanged; you must set everything with
           &quot;set_options&quot;.

           For example, let&apos;s say that just dropping periods from abbreviated
           tokens in the first name isn&apos;t enough; you really want to save space
           by jamming the abbreviated tokens together: &quot;JR Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J
           R Smith&quot;  Assuming the two calls in the above example have been done,
           the following will finish the job:

              $format-&gt;set_options (BTN_FIRST,
                                    1,             # keep same value for abbrev flag
                                    BTJ_NOTHING,   # jam tokens together
                                    BTJ_SPACE);    # space after final token of part

           Note that we unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current
           values for the abbreviation flag and post-part join method, even
           though we were only setting the intra-part join method.

       apply (NAME)
           Once a name format has been created and customized to your heart&apos;s
           content, you can use it to format any number of names using the
           &quot;apply&quot; method.  NAME must be a &quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot; object (i.e., a
           pre-split name); &quot;apply&quot; returns a string containing the parts of the
           name formatted according to the &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot; structure
           it is called on.

EXAMPLES
       Although the process of splitting and formatting names may sound
       complicated and convoluted from reading the above (along with
       Text::BibTeX::Name), it&apos;s actually quite simple.  There are really only
       three steps to worry about: split the name (create a &quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot;
       object), create and customize the format (&quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot;
       object), and apply the format to the name.

       The first step is covered in Text::BibTeX::Name; here&apos;s a brief example:

          $orig_name = &apos;Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\&apos;e}e Poussin&apos;;
          $name = new Text::BibTeX::Name $orig_name;

       The various parts of the name can now be accessed through
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot; methods; for instance &quot;$name-&gt;part(&apos;von&apos;)&quot; returns
       the list &quot;(&quot;de&quot;,&quot;la&quot;)&quot;.

       Creating the name format is equally simple:

          $format = new Text::BibTeX::NameFormat (&apos;vljf&apos;, 1);

       creates a format that will print the name in &quot;von last jr first&quot; order,
       with the first name abbreviated.  And for no extra charge, you get the
       right punctuation at the right place: a comma before any `jr&apos; or `first&apos;
       tokens, and periods after each `first&apos; token.

       For instance, we can perform no further customization on this format, and
       apply it immediately to $name.  There are in fact two ways to do this,
       depending on whether you prefer to think of it in terms of &quot;Applying the
       format to a name&quot; or &quot;formatting a name&quot;.  The first is done with
       &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot;&apos;s &quot;apply&quot; method:

          $formatted_name = $format-&gt;apply ($name);

       while the second uses &quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot;&apos;s &quot;format&quot; method:

          $formatted_name = $name-&gt;format ($format);

       which is just a wrapper around &quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat::apply&quot;.  In
       either case, the result with the example name and format shown is

          de~la Vall{\&apos;e}e~Poussin, C.~L. X.~J.

       Note the strategic insertion of TeX &quot;ties&quot; (non-breakable spaces) at
       sensitive spots in the name.  (The exact rules for insertion of
       discretionary ties are given in bt_format_names.)
