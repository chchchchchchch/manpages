NAME
       Text::Iconv - Perl interface to iconv() codeset conversion function

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Iconv;
         $converter = Text::Iconv-&gt;new(&quot;fromcode&quot;, &quot;tocode&quot;);
         $converted = $converter-&gt;convert(&quot;Text to convert&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       The Text::Iconv module provides a Perl interface to the iconv() function
       as defined by the Single UNIX Specification.

       The convert() method converts the encoding of characters in the input
       string from the fromcode codeset to the tocode codeset, and returns the
       result.

       Settings of fromcode and tocode and their permitted combinations are
       implementation-dependent.  Valid values are specified in the system
       documentation; the iconv(1) utility should also provide a -l option that
       lists all supported codesets.

   Utility methods
       Text::Iconv objects also provide the following methods:

       retval() returns the return value of the underlying iconv() function for
       the last conversion; according to the Single UNIX Specification, this
       value indicates &quot;the number of non-identical conversions performed.&quot;
       Note, however, that iconv implementations vary widely in the
       interpretation of this specification.

       This method can be called after calling convert(), e.g.:

         $result = $converter-&gt;convert(&quot;lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&quot;);
         $retval = $converter-&gt;retval;

       When called before the first call to convert(), or if an error occured
       during the conversion, retval() returns undef.

       get_attr(): This method is only available with GNU libiconv, otherwise it
       throws an exception.  The get_attr() method allows you to query various
       attributes which influence the behavior of convert().  The currently
       supported attributes are trivialp, transliterate, and discard_ilseq,
       e.g.:

         $state = $converter-&gt;get_attr(&quot;transliterate&quot;);

       See iconvctl(3) for details.  To ensure portability to other iconv
       implementations you should first check for the availability of this
       method using eval {}, e.g.:

           eval { $conv-&gt;get_attr(&quot;trivialp&quot;) };
           if ($@)
           {
             # get_attr() is not available
           }
           else
           {
             # get_attr() is available
           }

       This method should be considered experimental.
&#12;       set_attr(): This method is only available with GNU libiconv, otherwise it
       throws an exception.  The set_attr() method allows you to set various
       attributes which influence the behavior of convert().  The currently
       supported attributes are transliterate and discard_ilseq, e.g.:

         $state = $converter-&gt;set_attr(&quot;transliterate&quot;);

       See iconvctl(3) for details.  To ensure portability to other iconv
       implementations you should first check for the availability of this
       method using eval {}, cf. the description of set_attr() above.

       This method should be considered experimental.

ERRORS
       If the conversion can&apos;t be initialized an exception is raised (using
       croak()).

   Handling of conversion errors
       Text::Iconv provides a class attribute raise_error and a corresponding
       class method for setting and getting its value.  The handling of errors
       during conversion depends on the setting of this attribute.  If
       raise_error is set to a true value, an exception is raised; otherwise,
       the convert() method only returns undef.  By default raise_error is
       false.  Example usage:

         Text::Iconv-&gt;raise_error(1);     # Conversion errors raise exceptions
         Text::Iconv-&gt;raise_error(0);     # Conversion errors return undef
         $a = Text::Iconv-&gt;raise_error(); # Get current setting

   Per-object handling of conversion errors
       As an experimental feature, Text::Iconv also provides an instance
       attribute raise_error and a corresponding method for setting and getting
       its value.  If raise_error is undef, the class-wide settings apply.  If
       raise_error is 1 or 0 (true or false), the object settings override the
       class-wide settings.

       Consult iconv(3) for details on errors that might occur.

   Conversion of undef
       Converting undef, e.g.,

         $converted = $converter-&gt;convert(undef);

       always returns undef.  This is not considered an error.

NOTES
       The supported codesets, their names, the supported conversions, and the
       quality of the conversions are all system-dependent.
