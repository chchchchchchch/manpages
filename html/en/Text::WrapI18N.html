NAME
       Text::WrapI18N - Line wrapping module with support for multibyte,
       fullwidth, and combining characters and languages without whitespaces
       between words

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::WrapI18N qw(wrap $columns);
         wrap(firstheader, nextheader, texts);

DESCRIPTION
       This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module.  This module is
       needed to support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP,
       EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5.  This module also supports characters with
       irregular widths, such as combining characters (which occupy zero columns
       on terminal, like diacritical marks in UTF-8) and fullwidth characters
       (which occupy two columns on terminal, like most of east Asian
       characters).  Also, minimal handling of languages which doesn&apos;t use
       whitespaces between words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported.

       Like Text::Wrap, hyphenation and &quot;kinsoku&quot; processing are not supported,
       to keep simplicity.

       wrap(firstheader, nextheader, texts) is the main subroutine of
       Text::WrapI18N module to execute the line wrapping.  Input parameters and
       output data emulate Text::Wrap.  The texts have to be written in locale
       encoding.
