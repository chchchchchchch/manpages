UFRAW(1)                                                                UFRAW(1)



NAME
       UFRaw - Convert camera RAW images to standard image files.

SYNOPSIS
       ufraw [OPTIONS] &lt;rawfile(s)&gt;
       ufraw-batch [OPTIONS] &lt;rawfile(s)&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and manipulate
       raw images from digital cameras. It reads raw images using Dave Coffin&apos;s
       raw conversion utility - DCRaw. UFRaw supports basic color management
       using Little CMS, allowing the user to apply color profiles. For Nikon
       users UFRaw has the advantage that it can read the camera&apos;s tone curves.
       Even if you don&apos;t own a Nikon, you can still apply a Nikon curve to your
       images.

       By default &apos;ufraw&apos; displays a preview window for each raw image allowing
       the user to tweak the image parameters before saving. If no raw images
       are given at the command line, UFRaw will display a file chooser dialog.
       To process the images with no questions asked (and no preview) use the
       command &apos;ufraw-batch&apos;.

       The input files can be either raw images or UFRaw ID-files.  ID-files
       contain a raw image filename and the parameters for handling the image.

       UFRaw can also work as a GIMP plug-in. To activate it simply open a raw
       image or a UFRaw ID-file in the GIMP.

OPTIONS
       The options supplied on the command-line decide the starting-values for
       the GUI. The GUI will then allow you to tweak these values before saving
       the final image.

   General Options
       --version
           Display the version of UFRaw and exit.

       --help
           Display a brief description of how to use UFRaw and exit.

       --silent
           Do not display any messages during batch conversion.

       --conf=&lt;ID-filename&gt;
           Load all parameters from an ID-file. This feature can be used to
           tweak the parameters for one file using the GUI and using those
           parameters as the starting point for other images as well.

   Image Manipulation Options
       These command-line options override settings from the default
       configuration of UFRaw and from any loaded ID-file. The best way to learn
       about how these parameters work is to experiment with the GUI. All
       parameters correspond exactly to a setting available in the GUI. Not all
       parameters in the GUI have corresponding command-line options.

       --wb=camera|auto
           White balance setting. &quot;camera&quot; means that UFRaw tries to read the
           color-temperature and green color component that the camera recorded
           in the meta-information in the raw-file. This does not work for all
           cameras. If UFRaw fails to read the white-balance information from
           the meta-information, it falls back to &quot;auto&quot;.
&#12;           &quot;auto&quot; means that UFRaw calculates the color-temperature and green
           color component automatically from the image data.

           The white-balance can also be set manually with the --temperature and
           --green options.

       --temperature=TEMP
           Manually set the color temperature in Kelvin (2000 - 7000).

       --green=GREEN
           Green color component. Range 0.20 to 2.50.

       --gamma=GAMMA
           Gamma adjustment of the base curve. Range 0.10 to 1.00. Default 0.45.

       --linearity=LINEARITY
           Linearity of the base curve. Range 0.00 to 1.00. Default 0.10.

       --exposure=auto|EXPOSURE
           Auto exposure or exposure correction in EV. Range -3.00 to 3.00.
           Default 0.

       --restore=clip|lch|hsv
           Control how highlights are restored when applying negative EV.
           &apos;clip&apos; restores nothing and is therefore safe from any artifacts.
           &apos;lch&apos; restores in LCH space, resulting in restored highlights with
           soft details (good for clouds).  &apos;hsv&apos; restores in HSV space,
           resulting in restored highlights with sharp details.  The default is
           &apos;lch&apos;.

       --clip=digital|film
           Control how highlights are clipped when applying positive EV.
           &apos;digital&apos; corresponds to using a linear response, emulating the harsh
           behaviour of the digital sensor.  &apos;film&apos; emulate the soft film
           response.  The default is &apos;digital&apos;.

       --saturation=SAT
           Adjust the color saturation. Range 0.00 to 3.00. Default 1.0, use 0
           for black &amp; white output.

       --wavelet-denoising-threshold=THRESHOLD
           Wavelet denoising threshold (default 0.0).

       --base-curve=manual|linear|custom|camera|CURVE
           Type of tone curve to use. The base curve is a combination of the
           gamma curve corrected by the curve specified here.  The base curve is
           applied to each channel of the raw data after the white balance and
           color matrix, but before the ICC transformation.

           &quot;manual&quot; means that a manual tone curve is used.  This is probably
           not very useful as a command-line option, since there is no way to
           specify what the curve should look like.

           &quot;linear&quot; means that no tone curve corrections is performed.

           &quot;custom&quot; means that UFRaw shall use the curve supplied by the camera
           in the meta-information in the raw-file.

           &quot;camera&quot; means that UFRaw shall use the &quot;custom&quot; curve only if the
           camera was set to use it (according to the meta-information).
           Otherwise the &quot;linear&quot; curve is used.

           CURVE can be the filename (without path) of any curve that was
           previously loaded in the GUI.

           The default is &quot;camera&quot; if such a curve exists, linear otherwise.

       --base-curve-file=&lt;curve-file&gt;
           Load the base curve from a file.  The curve file format can be either
           UFRaw&apos;s XML format or Nikon&apos;s NTC/NCV format.

       --curve=manual|linear|CURVE
           Type of luminosity curve to use. This curve is applied in HSV space
           and therefore hue and saturation should not be effected by it.

           &quot;manual&quot; means that a manual luminosity curve is used.  This is
           probably not very useful as a command-line option, since there is no
           way to specify what the curve should look like.

           &quot;linear&quot; means that no luminosity correction is performed.

           CURVE can be the filename (without path) of any curve that was
           previously loaded in the GUI.

           The default is &quot;linear&quot;.

       --curve-file=&lt;curve-file&gt;
           Load the luminosity curve from a file.  The curve file format can be
           either UFRaw&apos;s XML format or Nikon&apos;s NTC/NCV format.

       --black-point=auto|BLACK
           Black-point value. Range 0.0 to 1.0, default 0.0.

       --interpolation=ahd|vng|four-color|ppg|bilinear
           Interpolation algorithm to use when converting from the Bayer-pattern
           to normal RGB values. AHD (Adaptive Homogeneity Directed)
           interpolation is the best, but also the slowest. VNG (Variable Number
           Gradients) is second best and a bit faster. Bilinear is the simplest
           yet fastest interpolation.

           &quot;four-color&quot; is a variation of the VNG interpolation that should only
           be used if you see strange square patterns in the VNG interpolation,
           See &lt;http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/&gt;.

           AHD is the default interpolation.  AHD interpolation is not supported
           for cameras with four color filters, such as the Sony-828 RGBE
           filter. In such cases, VNG interpolation will be used instead.

       --color-smoothing
           Apply color smoothing.

       --grayscale=none|lightness|luminance|value|mixer
           Grayscale conversion algorithm to use (default none).

       --darkframe=FILE
           Use FILE for raw darkframe subtraction.

   Output Options
       The options which are related to the final output are:

       --shrink=FACTOR
           Shrink the image by FACTOR (default 1).

       --size=SIZE
           Downsize max(height,width) to SIZE.

       --rotate=camera|ANGLE|no
           Rotate image to camera&apos;s setting, by ANGLE degrees clockwise, or do
           not rotate the image (default camera)

       --crop-(left|right|top|bottom)=PIXELS
           Crop the output to the given pixel range, relative to the raw image
           after rotation but before any scaling.

       --out-type=ppm|tiff|tif|png|jpeg|jpg|fits
           Output file-format to use.  The default output file-format is ppm.

       --out-depth=8|16
           Output bit depth per channel.  ppm, tiff, png and fits output formats
           can uses either 8 bits or 16 bits to encode each of the  Red, Green
           and Blue components of each pixel.  The jpeg format only allows for 8
           bits for each color component.

           The raw-files contain more than eight bits of information for each
           color component. This means that by using an eight bit format, you
           are actually discarding some of the information supplied by the
           camera. This is not a problem if you only plan to view the image on
           screen. For prints you should consider a 16 bits workflow.

       --compression=VALUE
           JPEG quality factor. Range 0-100 with a higher number giving a higher
           quality at the cost of a larger file. Default 85. The --compression
           parameter is only relevant if the output file-format is jpeg.

       --[no]exif
           Embed exif in output. Default embed exif. Exif is currently embedded
           in JPEG, PNG and TIFF output.

       --[no]zip
           Enable [disable] TIFF zip compression. The zip-compression is loss-
           less.  Default nozip. The --zip parameter is only relevant if the
           output file-format if tiff8 or tiff16.

       --out-path=PATH
           PATH for output file. In batch mode by default, output-files are
           placed in the same directory as the input-files. In interactive mode
           UFRaw tries to &apos;&apos;guess&apos;&apos; if you have a favorite output directory.

       --output=FILE
           Output file name to use. This is only relevant if a single raw-file
           is supplied on the command-line. . Use &apos;-&apos; to output to stdout. The
           default is to name the output-file the same as the input-file but
           with the extension given by the output file-format.

       --overwrite
           Overwrite existing files without asking. Default is to ask before
           deleting an existing file.

       --create-id=no|also|only
           Control whether UFRaw ID files are created for the output image.
           (Default is no).

       --embedded-image
           Extract the preview image embedded in the raw file instead of
           converting the raw image.

Conversion Setting Priority
       Conversion settings are applied in the following priority order:

       1. Command-line options
       2. Settings from the configuration file specified with --conf=&lt;ID-file&gt;
       (ignoring any filenames in the ID-file).
       3. Settings from an ID-file supplied as an input-file.
       4. Settings from $HOME/.ufrawrc
       5. UFRaw&apos;s default settings.

       This means that an option supplied on the command-line always takes
       precedence over all other options.

       The conversion settings can be changed in the GUI before the resulting
       image is saved.

FILES
       $HOME/.ufrawrc - UFRaw resource file containing the user default
       settings.  This is an XML file that can be modified with any text editor.
       Still, it is recommended not to edit this file. This file is updated from
       the GUI when you save an image, or when you explicitly ask to save this
       file in the &apos;Options&apos; menu.

       $HOME/.ufraw-gtkrc - An optional file for setting up a specific GTK theme
       for UFRaw.
