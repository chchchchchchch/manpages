NAME
       URI::Heuristic - Expand URI using heuristics

SYNOPSIS
        use URI::Heuristic qw(uf_uristr);
        $u = uf_uristr(&quot;perl&quot;);             # http://www.perl.com
        $u = uf_uristr(&quot;www.sol.no/sol&quot;);   # http://www.sol.no/sol
        $u = uf_uristr(&quot;aas&quot;);              # http://www.aas.no
        $u = uf_uristr(&quot;ftp.funet.fi&quot;);     # ftp://ftp.funet.fi
        $u = uf_uristr(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;);      # file:/etc/passwd

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions that expand strings into real absolute
       URIs using some built-in heuristics.  Strings that already represent
       absolute URIs (i.e. that start with a &quot;scheme:&quot; part) are never modified
       and are returned unchanged.  The main use of these functions is to allow
       abbreviated URIs similar to what many web browsers allow for URIs typed
       in by the user.

       The following functions are provided:

       uf_uristr($str)
           Tries to make the argument string into a proper absolute URI string.
           The &quot;uf_&quot; prefix stands for &quot;User Friendly&quot;.  Under MacOS, it assumes
           that any string with a common URL scheme (http, ftp, etc.) is a URL
           rather than a local path.  So don&apos;t name your volumes after common
           URL schemes and expect uf_uristr() to construct valid file: URL&apos;s on
           those volumes for you, because it won&apos;t.

       uf_uri($str)
           Works the same way as uf_uristr() but returns a &quot;URI&quot; object.

ENVIRONMENT
       If the hostname portion of a URI does not contain any dots, then certain
       qualified guesses are made.  These guesses are governed by the following
       environment variables:

       COUNTRY   The two-letter country code (ISO 3166) for your location.  If
                 the domain name of your host ends with two letters, then it is
                 taken to be the default country. See also Locale::Country.

       HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG
                 If COUNTRY is not set, these standard environment variables are
                 examined and country (not language) information possibly found
                 in them is used as the default country.

       URL_GUESS_PATTERN
                 Contains a space-separated list of URL patterns to try.  The
                 string &quot;ACME&quot; is for some reason used as a placeholder for the
                 host name in the URL provided.  Example:

                  URL_GUESS_PATTERN=&quot;www.ACME.no www.ACME.se www.ACME.com&quot;
                  export URL_GUESS_PATTERN

                 Specifying URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any guessing rules based
                 on country.  An empty URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any guessing
                 that involves host name lookups.
