URI::Split(3pm)        User Contributed Perl Documentation       URI::Split(3pm)



NAME
       URI::Split - Parse and compose URI strings

SYNOPSIS
        use URI::Split qw(uri_split uri_join);
        ($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag) = uri_split($uri);
        $uri = uri_join($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag);

DESCRIPTION
       Provides functions to parse and compose URI strings.  The following
       functions are provided:

       ($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag) = uri_split($uri)
           Breaks up a URI string into its component parts.  An &quot;undef&quot; value is
           returned for those parts that are not present.  The $path part is
           always present (but can be the empty string) and is thus never
           returned as &quot;undef&quot;.

           No sensible value is returned if this function is called in a scalar
           context.

       $uri = uri_join($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag)
           Puts together a URI string from its parts.  Missing parts are
           signaled by passing &quot;undef&quot; for the corresponding argument.

           Minimal escaping is applied to parts that contain reserved chars that
           would confuse a parser.  For instance, any occurrence of &apos;?&apos; or &apos;#&apos;
           in $path is always escaped, as it would otherwise be parsed back as a
           query or fragment.
