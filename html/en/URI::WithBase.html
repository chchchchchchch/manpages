NAME
       URI::WithBase - URIs which remember their base

SYNOPSIS
        $u1 = URI::WithBase-&gt;new($str, $base);
        $u2 = $u1-&gt;abs;

        $base = $u1-&gt;base;
        $u1-&gt;base( $new_base )

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the &quot;URI::WithBase&quot; class.  Objects of this class
       are like &quot;URI&quot; objects, but can keep their base too.  The base represents
       the context where this URI was found and can be used to absolutize or
       relativize the URI.  All the methods described in URI are supported for
       &quot;URI::WithBase&quot; objects.

       The methods provided in addition to or modified from those of &quot;URI&quot; are:

       $uri = URI::WithBase-&gt;new($str, [$base])
           The constructor takes an optional base URI as the second argument.
           If provided, this argument initializes the base attribute.

       $uri-&gt;base( [$new_base] )
           Can be used to get or set the value of the base attribute.  The
           return value, which is the old value, is a URI object or &quot;undef&quot;.

       $uri-&gt;abs( [$base_uri] )
           The $base_uri argument is now made optional as the object carries its
           base with it.  A new object is returned even if $uri is already
           absolute (while plain URI objects simply return themselves in that
           case).

       $uri-&gt;rel( [$base_uri] )
           The $base_uri argument is now made optional as the object carries its
           base with it.  A new object is always returned.
