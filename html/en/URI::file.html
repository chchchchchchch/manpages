URI::file(3pm)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        URI::file(3pm)



NAME
       URI::file - URI that maps to local file names

SYNOPSIS
        use URI::file;

        $u1 = URI-&gt;new(&quot;file:/foo/bar&quot;);
        $u2 = URI-&gt;new(&quot;foo/bar&quot;, &quot;file&quot;);

        $u3 = URI::file-&gt;new($path);
        $u4 = URI::file-&gt;new(&quot;c:\\windows\\&quot;, &quot;win32&quot;);

        $u1-&gt;file;
        $u1-&gt;file(&quot;mac&quot;);

DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;URI::file&quot; class supports &quot;URI&quot; objects belonging to the file URI
       scheme.  This scheme allows us to map the conventional file names found
       on various computer systems to the URI name space.  An old specification
       of the file URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.  Some older background
       information is also in RFC 1630. There are no newer specifications as far
       as I know.

       If you simply want to construct file URI objects from URI strings, use
       the normal &quot;URI&quot; constructor.  If you want to construct file URI objects
       from the actual file names used by various systems, then use one of the
       following &quot;URI::file&quot; constructors:

       $u = URI::file-&gt;new( $filename, [$os] )
           Maps a file name to the file: URI name space, creates a URI object
           and returns it.  The $filename is interpreted as belonging to the
           indicated operating system ($os), which defaults to the value of the
           $^O variable.  The $filename can be either absolute or relative, and
           the corresponding type of URI object for $os is returned.

       $u = URI::file-&gt;new_abs( $filename, [$os] )
           Same as URI::file-&gt;new, but makes sure that the URI returned
           represents an absolute file name.  If the $filename argument is
           relative, then the name is resolved relative to the current
           directory, i.e. this constructor is really the same as:

             URI::file-&gt;new($filename)-&gt;abs(URI::file-&gt;cwd);

       $u = URI::file-&gt;cwd
           Returns a file URI that represents the current working directory.
           See Cwd.

       The following methods are supported for file URI (in addition to the
       common and generic methods described in URI):

       $u-&gt;file( [$os] )
           Returns a file name.  It maps from the URI name space to the file
           name space of the indicated operating system.

           It might return &quot;undef&quot; if the name can not be represented in the
           indicated file system.

       $u-&gt;dir( [$os] )
           Some systems use a different form for names of directories than for
           plain files.  Use this method if you know you want to use the name
           for a directory.
&#12;       The &quot;URI::file&quot; module can be used to map generic file names to names
       suitable for the current system.  As such, it can work as a nice
       replacement for the &quot;File::Spec&quot; module.  For instance, the following
       code translates the UNIX-style file name Foo/Bar.pm to a name suitable
       for the local system:

         $file = URI::file-&gt;new(&quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;)-&gt;file;
         die &quot;Can&apos;t map filename Foo/Bar.pm for $^O&quot; unless defined $file;
         open(FILE, $file) || die &quot;Can&apos;t open &apos;$file&apos;: $!&quot;;
         # do something with FILE

MAPPING NOTES
       Most computer systems today have hierarchically organized file systems.
       Mapping the names used in these systems to the generic URI syntax allows
       us to work with relative file URIs that behave as they should when
       resolved using the generic algorithm for URIs (specified in RFC 2396).
       Mapping a file name to the generic URI syntax involves mapping the path
       separator character to &quot;/&quot; and encoding any reserved characters that
       appear in the path segments of the file name.  If path segments
       consisting of the strings &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot; have a different meaning than what
       is specified for generic URIs, then these must be encoded as well.

       If the file system has device, volume or drive specifications as the root
       of the name space, then it makes sense to map them to the authority field
       of the generic URI syntax.  This makes sure that relative URIs can not be
       resolved &quot;above&quot; them, i.e. generally how relative file names work in
       those systems.

       Another common use of the authority field is to encode the host on which
       this file name is valid.  The host name &quot;localhost&quot; is special and
       generally has the same meaning as a missing or empty authority field.
       This use is in conflict with using it as a device specification, but can
       often be resolved for device specifications having characters not legal
       in plain host names.

       File name to URI mapping in normally not one-to-one.  There are usually
       many URIs that map to any given file name.  For instance, an authority of
       &quot;localhost&quot; maps the same as a URI with a missing or empty authority.

       Example 1: The Mac classic (Mac OS 9 and earlier) used &quot;:&quot; as path
       separator, but not in the same way as a generic URI. &quot;:foo&quot; was a
       relative name.  &quot;foo:bar&quot; was an absolute name.  Also, path segments
       could contain the &quot;/&quot; character as well as the literal &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;.  So
       the mapping looks like this:

         Mac classic           URI
         ----------            -------------------
         :foo:bar     &lt;==&gt;     foo/bar
         :            &lt;==&gt;     ./
         ::foo:bar    &lt;==&gt;     ../foo/bar
         :::          &lt;==&gt;     ../../
         foo:bar      &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar
         foo:bar:     &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar/
         ..           &lt;==&gt;     %2E%2E
         &lt;undef&gt;      &lt;==      /
         foo/         &lt;==      file:/foo%2F
         ./foo.txt    &lt;==      file:/.%2Ffoo.txt

       Note that if you want a relative URL, you *must* begin the path with a :.
       Any path that begins with [^:] is treated as absolute.

       Example 2: The UNIX file system is easy to map, as it uses the same path
       separator as URIs, has a single root, and segments of &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;  have
       the same meaning.  URIs that have the character &quot;\0&quot; or &quot;/&quot; as part of
       any path segment can not be turned into valid UNIX file names.

         ----------            ------------------
         foo/bar      &lt;==&gt;     foo/bar
         /foo/bar     &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar
         /foo/bar     &lt;==      file://localhost/foo/bar
         file:         ==&gt;     ./file:
         &lt;undef&gt;      &lt;==      file:/fo%00/bar
         /            &lt;==&gt;     file:/

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The following configuration variables influence how the class and its
       methods behave:

       %URI::file::OS_CLASS
           This hash maps OS identifiers to implementation classes.  You might
           want to add or modify this if you want to plug in your own file
           handler class.  Normally the keys should match the $^O values in use.

           If there is no mapping then the &quot;Unix&quot; implementation is used.

       $URI::file::DEFAULT_AUTHORITY
           This determine what &quot;authority&quot; string to include in absolute file
           URIs.  It defaults to &quot;&quot;.  If you prefer verbose URIs you might set
           it to be &quot;localhost&quot;.

           Setting this value to &quot;undef&quot; force behaviour compatible to URI v1.31
           and earlier.  In this mode host names in UNC paths and drive letters
           are mapped to the authority component on Windows, while we produce
           authority-less URIs on Unix.
