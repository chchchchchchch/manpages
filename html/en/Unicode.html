UNICODE(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 UNICODE(7)



NAME
       Unicode - universal character set

DESCRIPTION
       The  international standard ISO 10646 defines the Universal Character Set
       (UCS).  UCS contains all characters of all other character set standards.
       It  also guarantees round-trip compatibility, i.e., conversion tables can
       be built such that no information is lost when a string is converted from
       any other encoding to UCS and back.

       UCS  contains  the characters required to represent practically all known
       languages.  This includes not only the Latin,  Greek,  Cyrillic,  Hebrew,
       Arabic,  Armenian,  and  Georgian scripts, but also Chinese, Japanese and
       Korean Han ideographs as well as  scripts  such  as  Hiragana,  Katakana,
       Hangul,  Devanagari,  Bengali,  Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu,
       Kannada, Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Bopomofo, Tibetan, Runic, Ethiopic,
       Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Mongolian, Ogham, Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana,
       Yi, and others.  For scripts not yet covered, research  on  how  to  best
       encode  them  for computer usage is still going on and they will be added
       eventually.  This might eventually include not only Hieroglyphs and vari&#8208;
       ous  historic  Indo-European  languages,  but even some selected artistic
       scripts such as Tengwar, Cirth, and Klingon.  UCS  also  covers  a  large
       number  of graphical, typographical, mathematical and scientific symbols,
       including those provided by TeX,  Postscript,  APL,  MS-DOS,  MS-Windows,
       Macintosh, OCR fonts, as well as many word processing and publishing sys&#8208;
       tems, and more are being added.

       The UCS standard (ISO 10646) describes a 31-bit character  set  architec&#8208;
       ture consisting of 128 24-bit groups, each divided into 256 16-bit planes
       made up of 256 8-bit rows with 256 column positions, one for each charac&#8208;
       ter.   Part  1 of the standard (ISO 10646-1) defines the first 65534 code
       positions (0x0000 to 0xfffd), which form  the  Basic  Multilingual  Plane
       (BMP),  that is plane 0 in group 0.  Part 2 of the standard (ISO 10646-2)
       adds characters to group 0  outside  the  BMP  in  several  supplementary
       planes in the range 0x10000 to 0x10ffff.  There are no plans to add char&#8208;
       acters beyond 0x10ffff to the standard,  therefore  of  the  entire  code
       space, only a small fraction of group 0 will ever be actually used in the
       foreseeable future.  The BMP contains all characters found  in  the  com&#8208;
       monly  used  other  character sets.  The supplemental planes added by ISO
       10646-2 cover only more exotic characters for special scientific, dictio&#8208;
       nary  printing, publishing industry, higher-level protocol and enthusiast
       needs.

       The representation of each UCS character as a 2-byte word is referred  to
       as  the UCS-2 form (only for BMP characters), whereas UCS-4 is the repre&#8208;
       sentation of each character by a 4-byte word.  In addition,  there  exist
       two encoding forms UTF-8 for backward compatibility with ASCII processing
       software and UTF-16 for the backward-compatible handling of non-BMP char&#8208;
       acters up to 0x10ffff by UCS-2 software.

       The UCS characters 0x0000 to 0x007f are identical to those of the classic
       US-ASCII character set and the characters in the range 0x0000  to  0x00ff
       are identical to those in ISO 8859-1 Latin-1.

   Combining Characters
       Some  code  points  in  UCS  have  been assigned to combining characters.
       These are similar to the nonspacing accent keys on a typewriter.  A  com&#8208;
       bining character just adds an accent to the previous character.  The most
       important accented characters have codes of their own  in  UCS,  however,
       the combining character mechanism allows us to add accents and other dia&#8208;
       critical marks to any character.  The combining characters always  follow
       the  character  which  they  modify.   For  example, the German character
       Umlaut-A (&quot;Latin capital letter A with diaeresis&quot;) can either  be  repre&#8208;
       sented by the precomposed UCS code 0x00c4, or alternatively as the combi&#8208;
       nation of a normal &quot;Latin capital letter  A&quot;  followed  by  a  &quot;combining
       diaeresis&quot;: 0x0041 0x0308.

       Combining  characters  are  essential  for instance for encoding the Thai
       script or for mathematical typesetting and  users  of  the  International
       Phonetic Alphabet.

   Implementation Levels
       As  not all systems are expected to support advanced mechanisms like com&#8208;
       bining characters, ISO 10646-1 specifies the following three  implementa&#8208;
       tion levels of UCS:

       Level 1  Combining  characters and Hangul Jamo (a variant encoding of the
                Korean script, where a Hangul  syllable  glyph  is  coded  as  a
                triplet or pair of vovel/consonant codes) are not supported.

       Level 2  In addition to level 1, combining characters are now allowed for
                some languages  where  they  are  essential  (e.g.,  Thai,  Lao,
                Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Malayalam).

       Level 3  All UCS characters are supported.

       The  Unicode  3.0  Standard  published by the Unicode Consortium contains
       exactly the UCS Basic Multilingual Plane at implementation  level  3,  as
       described in ISO 10646-1:2000.  Unicode 3.1 added the supplemental planes
       of ISO 10646-2.  The Unicode standard and technical reports published  by
       the  Unicode Consortium provide much additional information on the seman&#8208;
       tics and recommended usages of various characters.  They  provide  guide&#8208;
       lines  and  algorithms for editing, sorting, comparing, normalizing, con&#8208;
       verting and displaying Unicode strings.

   Unicode Under Linux
       Under GNU/Linux, the C type wchar_t is a signed 32-bit integer type.  Its
       values are always interpreted by the C library as UCS code values (in all
       locales), a convention that is signaled by the GNU C library to  applica&#8208;
       tions by defining the constant __STDC_ISO_10646__ as specified in the ISO
       C99 standard.

       UCS/Unicode can be used just like ASCII in input/output streams, terminal
       communication,  plaintext  files, filenames, and environment variables in
       the ASCII compatible UTF-8 multibyte encoding.   To  signal  the  use  of
       UTF-8  as  the  character encoding to all applications, a suitable locale
       has to be selected via environment variables (e.g., &quot;LANG=en_GB.UTF-8&quot;).

       The nl_langinfo(CODESET) function returns the name of the selected encod&#8208;
       ing.  Library functions such as wctomb(3) and mbsrtowcs(3) can be used to
       transform the internal wchar_t characters and  strings  into  the  system
       character  encoding  and  back  and  wcwidth(3) tells, how many positions
       (0&#8211;2) the cursor is advanced by the output of a character.

       Under Linux, in general only the BMP at implementation level 1 should  be
       used  at  the  moment.  Up to two combining characters per base character
       for certain scripts (in particular Thai) are also supported by some UTF-8
       terminal  emulators and ISO 10646 fonts (level 2), but in general precom&#8208;
       posed characters should be preferred where available (Unicode calls  this
       Normalization Form C).

   Private Area
       In  the  BMP,  the  range  0xe000 to 0xf8ff will never be assigned to any
       characters by the standard and is reserved for private  usage.   For  the
       Linux  community,  this private area has been subdivided further into the
       range 0xe000 to 0xefff which can be used individually by any end-user and
       the Linux zone in the range 0xf000 to 0xf8ff where extensions are coordi&#8208;
       nated among all Linux users.  The registry of the characters assigned  to
       the   Linux   zone   is   currently   maintained   by   H.   Peter  Anvin
       &lt;Peter.Anvin@linux.org&gt;.

         a large number of new C library functions for handling wide and  multi&#8208;
         byte  character  encodings,  but  it  does not yet cover ISO C99, which
         improved wide and multibyte character support even further.

BUGS
       When this man page was last revised, the GNU C Library support for  UTF-8
       locales was mature and XFree86 support was in an advanced state, but work
       on making applications (most notably editors) suitable for use  in  UTF-8
       locales  was  still fully in progress.  Current general UCS support under
       Linux usually provides for CJK double-width characters and sometimes even
       simple  overstriking  combining  characters, but usually does not include
       support for scripts with right-to-left writing direction or ligature sub&#8208;
       stitution  requirements  such  as  Hebrew,  Arabic, or the Indic scripts.
       These scripts are currently only supported in  certain  GUI  applications
       (HTML   viewers,  word  processors)  with  sophisticated  text  rendering
       engines.
