NAME
       Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312 - weighting CJK Unified Ideographs for
       Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
           use Unicode::Collate;
           use Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312;

           my $collator = Unicode::Collate-&gt;new(
               overrideCJK =&gt; \&amp;Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312::weightGB2312
           );

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312&quot; provides &quot;weightGB2312()&quot;, that is
       adequate for &quot;overrideCJK&quot; of &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; and makes tailoring of
       CJK Unified Ideographs in the order of CLDR&apos;s gb2312han ordering.

CAVEAT
       The gb2312han ordering includes 5 code points in private use area
       (E2D8..E2DC), that can&apos;t utilize &quot;weightGB2312()&quot; for collation.  For
       them, use &quot;entry&quot; instead.
