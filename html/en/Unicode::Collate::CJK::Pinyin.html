NAME
       Unicode::Collate::CJK::Pinyin - weighting CJK Unified Ideographs for
       Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
           use Unicode::Collate;
           use Unicode::Collate::CJK::Pinyin;

           my $collator = Unicode::Collate-&gt;new(
               overrideCJK =&gt; \&amp;Unicode::Collate::CJK::Pinyin::weightPinyin
           );

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;Unicode::Collate::CJK::Pinyin&quot; provides &quot;weightPinyin()&quot;, that is
       adequate for &quot;overrideCJK&quot; of &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; and makes tailoring of
       CJK Unified Ideographs in the order of CLDR&apos;s pinyin ordering.

CAVEAT
       The pinyin ordering includes some characters that are not CJK Unified
       Ideographs and can&apos;t utilize &quot;weightPinyin()&quot; for collation. For them,
       use &quot;entry&quot; instead.
