NAME
       Unicode::Collate::Locale - Linguistic tailoring for DUCET via
       Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
         use Unicode::Collate::Locale;

         #construct
         $Collator = Unicode::Collate::Locale-&gt;
             new(locale =&gt; $locale_name, %tailoring);

         #sort
         @sorted = $Collator-&gt;sort(@not_sorted);

         #compare
         $result = $Collator-&gt;cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.

       Note: Strings in @not_sorted, $a and $b are interpreted according to
       Perl&apos;s Unicode support. See perlunicode, perluniintro, perlunitut,
       perlunifaq, utf8.  Otherwise you can use &quot;preprocess&quot; (cf.
       &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot;) or should decode them before.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides linguistic tailoring for it taking advantage of
       &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot;.

   Constructor
       The &quot;new&quot; method returns a collator object.

       A parameter list for the constructor is a hash, which can include a
       special key &quot;locale&quot; and its value (case-insensitive) standing for a
       Unicode base language code (two or three-letter).  For example,
       &quot;Unicode::Collate::Locale-&gt;new(locale =&gt; &apos;FR&apos;)&quot; returns a collator
       tailored for French.

       $locale_name may be suffixed with a Unicode script code (four-letter), a
       Unicode region code, a Unicode language variant code. These codes are
       case-insensitive, and separated with &apos;_&apos; or &apos;-&apos;.  E.g. &quot;en_US&quot; for
       English in USA, &quot;az_Cyrl&quot; for Azerbaijani in the Cyrillic script,
       &quot;es_ES_traditional&quot; for Spanish in Spain (Traditional).

       If $locale_name is not available, fallback is selected in the following
       order:

           1. language with a variant code
           2. language with a script code
           3. language with a region code
           4. language
           5. default

       Tailoring tags provided by &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; are allowed as long as they
       are not used for &quot;locale&quot; support.  Esp. the &quot;table&quot; tag is always
       untailorable, since it is reserved for DUCET.

       E.g. a collator for French, which ignores diacritics and case difference
       (i.e. level 1), with reversed case ordering and no normalization.

           Unicode::Collate::Locale-&gt;new(
               level =&gt; 1,
               locale =&gt; &apos;fr&apos;,
               upper_before_lower =&gt; 1,
               normalization =&gt; undef
           )
&#12;       Overriding a behavior already tailored by &quot;locale&quot; is disallowed if such
       a tailoring is passed to &quot;new()&quot;.

           Unicode::Collate::Locale-&gt;new(
               locale =&gt; &apos;da&apos;,
               upper_before_lower =&gt; 0, # causes error as reserved by &apos;da&apos;
           )

       However &quot;change()&quot; inherited from &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; allows such a
       tailoring that is reserved by &quot;locale&quot;. Examples:

           new(locale =&gt; &apos;ca&apos;)-&gt;change(backwards =&gt; undef)
           new(locale =&gt; &apos;da&apos;)-&gt;change(upper_before_lower =&gt; 0)
           new(locale =&gt; &apos;ja&apos;)-&gt;change(overrideCJK =&gt; undef)

   Methods
       &quot;Unicode::Collate::Locale&quot; is a subclass of &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot; and
       methods other than &quot;new&quot; are inherited from &quot;Unicode::Collate&quot;.

       Here is a list of additional methods:

       &quot;$Collator-&gt;getlocale&quot;
           Returns a language code accepted and used actually on collation.  If
           linguistic tailoring is not provided for a language code you passed
           (intensionally for some languages, or due to the incomplete
           implementation), this method returns a string &apos;default&apos; meaning no
           special tailoring.

       &quot;$Collator-&gt;locale_version&quot;
           (Since Unicode::Collate::Locale 0.87) Returns the version number
           (perhaps &quot;/\d\.\d\d/&quot;) of the locale, as that of Locale/*.pl.

           Note: Locale/*.pl that a collator uses should be identified by a
           combination of return values from &quot;getlocale&quot; and &quot;locale_version&quot;.

       Locales according to the default UCA rules include chr (Cherokee), de
       (German), en (English), ga (Irish), id (Indonesian), it (Italian), ka
       (Georgian), ms (Malay), nl (Dutch), pt (Portuguese), st (Southern Sotho),
       sw (Swahili), xh (Xhosa), zu (Zulu).

       Note

       [1] ja: Ideographs are sorted in JIS X 0208 order.  Fullwidth and
       halfwidth forms are identical to their normal form.  The difference
       between hiragana and katakana is at the 4th level, the comparison also
       requires &quot;(variable =&gt; &apos;Non-ignorable&apos;)&quot;, and then
       &quot;katakana_before_hiragana&quot; has no effect.

       [2] ko: Plenty of ideographs are sorted by their reading. Such an
       ideograph is primary (level 1) equal to, and secondary (level 2) greater
       than, the corresponding hangul syllable.

       [3] zh__pinyin and zh__stroke: implemented alt=&apos;short&apos;, where a smaller
       number of ideographs are tailored.

INSTALL
       Installation of &quot;Unicode::Collate::Locale&quot; requires Collate/Locale.pm,
       Collate/Locale/*.pm, Collate/CJK/*.pm and Collate/allkeys.txt.  On
       building, &quot;Unicode::Collate::Locale&quot; doesn&apos;t require any of data/*.txt,
       gendata/*, and mklocale.  Tests for &quot;Unicode::Collate::Locale&quot; are named
       t/loc_*.t.

CAVEAT
       tailoring is not maximum
           Even if a certain letter is tailored, its equivalent would not always
           tailored as well as it. For example, even though W is tailored,
           fullwidth W (&quot;U+FF37&quot;), W with acute (&quot;U+1E82&quot;), etc. are not
           tailored. The result may depend on whether source strings are
           normalized or not, and whether decomposed or composed.  Thus
           &quot;(normalization =&gt; undef)&quot; is less preferred.
