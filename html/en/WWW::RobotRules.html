NAME
       WWW::RobotRules - database of robots.txt-derived permissions

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::RobotRules;
        my $rules = WWW::RobotRules-&gt;new(&apos;MOMspider/1.0&apos;);

        use LWP::Simple qw(get);

        {
          my $url = &quot;http://some.place/robots.txt&quot;;
          my $robots_txt = get $url;
          $rules-&gt;parse($url, $robots_txt) if defined $robots_txt;
        }

        {
          my $url = &quot;http://some.other.place/robots.txt&quot;;
          my $robots_txt = get $url;
          $rules-&gt;parse($url, $robots_txt) if defined $robots_txt;
        }

        # Now we can check if a URL is valid for those servers
        # whose &quot;robots.txt&quot; files we&apos;ve gotten and parsed:
        if($rules-&gt;allowed($url)) {
            $c = get $url;
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses /robots.txt files as specified in &quot;A Standard for
       Robot Exclusion&quot;, at &lt;http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html&gt;
       Webmasters can use the /robots.txt file to forbid conforming robots from
       accessing parts of their web site.

       The parsed files are kept in a WWW::RobotRules object, and this object
       provides methods to check if access to a given URL is prohibited.  The
       same WWW::RobotRules object can be used for one or more parsed
       /robots.txt files on any number of hosts.

       The following methods are provided:

       $rules = WWW::RobotRules-&gt;new($robot_name)
           This is the constructor for WWW::RobotRules objects.  The first
           argument given to new() is the name of the robot.

       $rules-&gt;parse($robot_txt_url, $content, $fresh_until)
           The parse() method takes as arguments the URL that was used to
           retrieve the /robots.txt file, and the contents of the file.

       $rules-&gt;allowed($uri)
           Returns TRUE if this robot is allowed to retrieve this URL.

       $rules-&gt;agent([$name])
           Get/set the agent name. NOTE: Changing the agent name will clear the
           robots.txt rules and expire times out of the cache.

ROBOTS.TXT
       The format and semantics of the &quot;/robots.txt&quot; file are as follows (this
       is an edited abstract of &lt;http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html&gt;):

       The file consists of one or more records separated by one or more blank
       lines. Each record contains lines of the form

         &lt;field-name&gt;: &lt;value&gt;

       The field name is case insensitive.  Text after the &apos;#&apos; character on a
       line is ignored during parsing.  This is used for comments.  The
       following &lt;field-names&gt; can be used:

       User-Agent
          The value of this field is the name of the robot the record is
          describing access policy for.  If more than one User-Agent field is
          present the record describes an identical access policy for more than
          one robot. At least one field needs to be present per record.  If the
          value is &apos;*&apos;, the record describes the default access policy for any
          robot that has not not matched any of the other records.

          The User-Agent fields must occur before the Disallow fields.  If a
          record contains a User-Agent field after a Disallow field, that
          constitutes a malformed record.  This parser will assume that a blank
          line should have been placed before that User-Agent field, and will
          break the record into two.  All the fields before the User-Agent field
          will constitute a record, and the User-Agent field will be the first
          field in a new record.

       Disallow
          The value of this field specifies a partial URL that is not to be
          visited. This can be a full path, or a partial path; any URL that
          starts with this value will not be retrieved

       Unrecognized records are ignored.

ROBOTS.TXT EXAMPLES
       The following example &quot;/robots.txt&quot; file specifies that no robots should
       visit any URL starting with &quot;/cyberworld/map/&quot; or &quot;/tmp/&quot;:

         User-agent: *
         Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space
         Disallow: /tmp/ # these will soon disappear

       This example &quot;/robots.txt&quot; file specifies that no robots should visit any
       URL starting with &quot;/cyberworld/map/&quot;, except the robot called
       &quot;cybermapper&quot;:

         User-agent: *
         Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space

         # Cybermapper knows where to go.
         User-agent: cybermapper
         Disallow:

       This example indicates that no robots should visit this site further:

         # go away
         User-agent: *
         Disallow: /

       This is an example of a malformed robots.txt file.

         # robots.txt for ancientcastle.example.com
         # I&apos;ve locked myself away.
         User-agent: *
         Disallow: /
         # The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like.
         User-agent: Belle
         Disallow: /west-wing/ # except the west wing!
         # It&apos;s good to be the Prince...
         User-agent: Beast
         Disallow:
&#12;       This file is missing the required blank lines between records.  However,
       the intention is clear.
