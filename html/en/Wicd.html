WICD(8)                                                                  WICD(8)



NAME
       Wicd - Wired and Wireless Network Connection Manager


THEORY OF OPERATION
       Wicd  is  designed to give the user as much control over behavior of net&#8208;
       work connections as possible.  Every network, both  wired  and  wireless,
       has  its  own  profile  with its own configuration options and connection
       behavior.  Wicd will try to automatically connect only  to  networks  the
       user specifies it should try, with a preference first to a wired network,
       then to wireless.

       For wired connections, users have many options for determining what  net&#8208;
       work  settings  to  use.   Wicd allows creation of an unlimited number of
       wired profiles, each of which has its own unique settings.  The user  can
       choose  to  automatically connect to a selected default profile, choose a
       profile from a pop-up window every time wicd connects, or have wicd auto&#8208;
       matically choose the last profile used to manually connect.

       For  wireless  connections,  users can select any number of wireless net&#8208;
       works to automatically connect; wicd will choose the one with the highest
       signal strength to try to connect.

       If  the  user  chooses,  wicd will try to automatically reconnect when it
       detects that a connection is lost.  If the last known connection state is
       wired,  wicd  will first try to reconnect to the wired network, and if it
       is not available, wicd will try any  available  wireless  networks  which
       have automatic connection enabled.  If the last known connection state is
       wireless, wicd will first try to reconnect to  the  previously  connected
       network  (even  if  that  network  does  not  have  automatic  connection
       enabled), and should that fail, it will try both a wired  connection  and
       any available wireless networks which have automatic connection enabled.

       Wicd  uses  built-in linux wireless-tools, such as ifconfig and iwconfig,
       to get and configure network info.  There is some flexibility in its  use
       of  DHCP,  providing  support  for dhclient, dhcpcd, and pump.  Wicd uses
       wpa_supplicant to handle all wireless encryption  settings,  and  uses  a
       template-based  system to create the configuration files used by wpa_sup&#8208;
       plicant.  These templates can be edited, and new templates can be created
       by  the user and imported into wicd, allowing connection to networks with
       uncommon encryption settings.


STRUCTURE
       Wicd has two major parts: the daemon, which runs  with  root  privileges;
       and  the user interface, which runs with normal user privileges.  The two
       parts run as separate processes and make use of D-Bus to communicate.

       The daemon is responsible for making and configuring connections, reading
       and  writing  configuration files and logs, and monitoring the connection
       status.  The daemon&apos;s job is split between two processes:  wicd-daemon.py
       and  monitor.py.   All  the  connection status monitoring, as well as the
       auto-reconnection logic, takes place in monitor.py.   Everthing  else  is
       done by wicd-daemon.py.

       The user interface (stored in wicd-gtk), which is made up of a tray icon,
       a main GUI window, and its child dialogs, gets configuration and  network
       info  from the daemon either by querying it using the methods in the dae&#8208;
       mon&apos;s dbus interface or by receiving signals emitted from the daemon over
       D-Bus.   Any  configuration changes made in the user interface are passed
       back to the daemon, which actually applies the changes and writes them to
       configuration files.

       Since  the  user  interface just queries for connection and configuration
       info from the daemon, it is possible to run wicd without the GUI at  all.
       Also,  the  daemon is started by wicd&apos;s init script during system startup
       (before any user logs in), making it possible to use wicd with &quot;headless&quot;
       machines.


USAGE HINTS
       Choosing Alternate Tools
       Wicd  supports  several  alternatives  regarding  the networking tools on
       linux.  In the &quot;External Programs&quot; tab of the Preferences menu,  you  can
       choose  your preferred DHCP client, link detection tool, and routing tool
       if the defaults aren&apos;t suitable for your particular distribution or  sys&#8208;
       tem.

       Custom Scripts
       If  you  need to run any custom commands before or after connecting to or
       disconnecting from a network, Wicd supports this; however, you will  need
       to have a graphical sudo helper installed (currently supported are kdesu,
       gksu, and ktsuss). Also see /etc/wicd/scripts/ in FILES.
       If you do not have a graphical sudo helper installed, you still have  the
       ability to use custom scripts, but you will have to set them up manually.
       See wicd-wired-settings.conf(5) and/or wicd-wireless-settings.conf(5) for
       more information on how to do so.

       Automatically Connecting to Networks
       Wicd uses the BSSID to recognize a particular network (and thus to decide
       whether it should automatically connect to it).  If you are on a  network
       that has many different access points which all have the same ESSID (many
       universities have such networks), there is an  option  in  the  &quot;Advanced
       Settings&quot;  to  &quot;Use  these settings for all networks sharing this essid.&quot;
       With this option enabled, Wicd will autoconnect to that network,  regard&#8208;
       less of which node it sees.



FILES
       /etc/wicd/manager-settings.conf
       This file contains global settings for Wicd.
       See this file&apos;s own man page for more information about it.

       /etc/wicd/wired-settings.conf
       This file contains settings related to the wired interface.
       See this file&apos;s own man page for more information about it.

       /etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf
       This file contains settings related to the wireless interface.
       See this file&apos;s own man page for more information about it.

       /etc/wicd/dhclient.conf.template
       This  is  used  to  replace  /etc/dhclient.conf  during Wicd activity, if
       you&apos;re using dhclient(1) as DHCP client. See  dhclient.conf(5)  for  more
       information.

       /etc/wicd/encryption/templates/
       This  directory  contains  various  templates  for  encrypted  (WEP, WPA,
       etcetera) connections.  If none of them fit your needs,  you  may  create
       your  own  and  add it to this directory.  If you do this, please contact
       the authors (see below) of Wicd.

       /etc/wicd/scripts/
       Dropping a script in the relevant directory will cause it to be  executed
       when  the specified event is preformed upon connection or disconnect from
       or to any network. Please note that pre/post disconnect  scripts  may  be
       executed multiple times on already-disconnected interfaces.
       The  scripts  will  be  passed different parameters, depending if Wicd is
       acting on a wired or a wireless network. In the former case, &quot;wired wired
       wired&quot; will be passed (three times, just for compatibility with the wire&#8208;
       less case). If Wicd is acting on a wireless network, it will pass  &quot;wire&#8208;
       less ESSID BSSID&quot; to the script.
       Available directories are:
       /etc/wicd/scripts/predisconnect
       /etc/wicd/scripts/postdisconnect
       /etc/wicd/scripts/preconnect
       /etc/wicd/scripts/postconnect

       /var/lib/wicd/configurations/
       This directory contains individual configuration files for each encrypted
       network you set up in Wicd.

       /var/log/wicd/
       This directory contains logfiles of Wicd&apos;s activity.  Please refer to the
       log if you are having connection or other problems.
