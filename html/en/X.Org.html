NAME
       X.Org, XProjectTeam - X.Org Group information

SYNOPSIS
       Release  6.5  and  6.6  of  X  Version 11 was brought to you by The X.Org
       Group.  Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The  X  Project
       Team.

DESCRIPTION
       The  Open  Group&apos;s  X  Project Team was created as the successor to the X
       Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium  ceased  operations  and  trans&#8208;
       ferred  ownership  of X11 to The Open Group. The X.Org Group (hereinafter
       called &quot;X.Org&quot;) was created as the successor to The X Project Team  after
       the  The  Open  Group ceased operating The X Project Team. The purpose of
       X.Org was to foster development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Win&#8208;
       dow  System.   X.Org  operates  under  the corporate umbrella of The Open
       Group.

       The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit  Delaware  membership
       corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consor&#8208;
       tium.

       The X Window System was created in the  mid-1980s  at  the  Massachusetts
       Institute  of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
       to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to  sup&#8208;
       port  further  development  of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the
       membership decided it was in their best interests to move the  consortium
       out  of  MIT  and  create  an independent, stand-alone organization.  All
       rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium,  Inc.
       on  January 1, 1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc.  closed
       its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to The Open
       Group.
