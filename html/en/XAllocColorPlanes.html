DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocColor function allocates a read-only colormap entry correspond&#8208;
       ing to the closest RGB value supported by the hardware.  XAllocColor
       returns the pixel value of the color closest to the specified RGB ele&#8208;
       ments supported by the hardware and returns the RGB value actually used.
       The corresponding colormap cell is read-only.  In addition, XAllocColor
       returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed.  Multiple clients
       that request the same effective RGB value can be assigned the same read-
       only entry, thus allowing entries to be shared.  When the last client
       deallocates a shared cell, it is deallocated.  XAllocColor does not use
       or affect the flags in the XColor structure.

       XAllocColor can generate a BadColor error.

       The XAllocNamedColor function looks up the named color with respect to
       the screen that is associated with the specified colormap.  It returns
       both the exact database definition and the closest color supported by the
       screen.  The allocated color cell is read-only.  The pixel value is
       returned in screen_def_return.  If the color name is not in the Host Por&#8208;
       table Character Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.  Use of
       uppercase or lowercase does not matter.  If screen_def_return and
       exact_def_return point to the same structure, the pixel field will be set
       correctly, but the color values are undefined.  XAllocNamedColor returns
       nonzero if a cell is allocated; otherwise, it returns zero.

       XAllocNamedColor can generate a BadColor error.

       delim %% The XAllocColorCells function allocates read/write color cells.
       The number of colors must be positive and the number of planes nonnega&#8208;
       tive, or a BadValue error results.  If ncolors and nplanes are requested,
       then ncolors pixels and nplane plane masks are returned.  No mask will
       have any bits set to 1 in common with any other mask or with any of the
       pixels.  By ORing together each pixel with zero or more masks, ncolors *
       %2 sup nplanes% distinct pixels can be produced.  All of these are allo&#8208;
       cated writable by the request.  For GrayScale or PseudoColor, each mask
       has exactly one bit set to 1.  For DirectColor, each has exactly three
       bits set to 1.  If contig is True and if all masks are ORed together, a
       single contiguous set of bits set to 1 will be formed for GrayScale or
       PseudoColor and three contiguous sets of bits set to 1 (one within each
       pixel subfield) for DirectColor.  The RGB values of the allocated entries
       are undefined.  XAllocColorCells returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero
       if it failed.

       XAllocColorCells can generate BadColor and BadValue errors.

       delim %% The specified ncolors must be positive; and nreds, ngreens, and
       nblues must be nonnegative, or a BadValue error results.  If ncolors col&#8208;
       ors, nreds reds, ngreens greens, and nblues blues are requested, ncolors
       pixels are returned; and the masks have nreds, ngreens, and nblues bits
       set to 1, respectively.  If contig is True, each mask will have a con&#8208;
       tiguous set of bits set to 1.  No mask will have any bits set to 1 in
       common with any other mask or with any of the pixels.  For DirectColor,
       each mask will lie within the corresponding pixel subfield.  By ORing
       together subsets of masks with each pixel value, ncolors * %2 sup
       (nreds+ngreens+nblues)% distinct pixel values can be produced.  All of
       these are allocated by the request.  However, in the colormap, there are
       only ncolors * %2 sup nreds% independent red entries, ncolors * %2 sup
       ngreens% independent green entries, and ncolors * %2 sup nblues% indepen&#8208;
       dent blue entries.  This is true even for PseudoColor.  When the colormap
       entry of a pixel value is changed (using XStoreColors, XStoreColor, or
       XStoreNamedColor), the pixel is decomposed according to the masks, and
       the corresponding independent entries are updated.  XAllocColorPlanes
       returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed.
&#12;       XAllocColorPlanes can generate BadColor and BadValue errors.

       The XFreeColors function frees the cells represented by pixels whose val&#8208;
       ues are in the pixels array.  The planes argument should not have any
       bits set to 1 in common with any of the pixels.  The set of all pixels is
       produced by ORing together subsets of the planes argument with the pix&#8208;
       els.  The request frees all of these pixels that were allocated by the
       client (using XAllocColor, XAllocNamedColor, XAllocColorCells, and XAl&#8208;
       locColorPlanes).  Note that freeing an individual pixel obtained from
       XAllocColorPlanes may not actually allow it to be reused until all of its
       related pixels are also freed.  Similarly, a read-only entry is not actu&#8208;
       ally freed until it has been freed by all clients, and if a client allo&#8208;
       cates the same read-only entry multiple times, it must free the entry
       that many times before the entry is actually freed.

       All specified pixels that are allocated by the client in the colormap are
       freed, even if one or more pixels produce an error.  If a specified pixel
       is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error results.  If a
       specified pixel is not allocated by the client (that is, is unallocated
       or is only allocated by another client) or if the colormap was created
       with all entries writable (by passing AllocAll to XCreateColormap), a
       BadAccess error results.  If more than one pixel is in error, the one
       that gets reported is arbitrary.

       XFreeColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not
                 already allocate.

       BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.

       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Col&#8208;
                 ormap.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
