XAllocSizeHints(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XAllocSizeHints(3)



NAME
       XAllocSizeHints, XSetWMNormalHints, XGetWMNormalHints, XSetWMSizeHints,
       XGetWMSizeHints, XSizeHints - allocate size hints structure and set or
       read a window&apos;s WM_NORMAL_HINTS property

SYNTAX
       XSizeHints *XAllocSizeHints(void);

       void XSetWMNormalHints(Display *display, Window w, XSizeHints *hints);

       Status XGetWMNormalHints(Display *display, Window w, XSizeHints
              *hints_return, long *supplied_return);

       void XSetWMSizeHints(Display *display, Window w, XSizeHints *hints, Atom
              property);

       Status XGetWMSizeHints(Display *display, Window w, XSizeHints
              *hints_return, long *supplied_return, Atom property);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       hints     Specifies the size hints for the window in its normal state.

       hints     Specifies the XSizeHints structure to be used.

       hints_return
                 Returns the size hints for the window in its normal state.

       property  Specifies the property name.

       supplied_return
                 Returns the hints that were supplied by the user.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocSizeHints function allocates and returns a pointer to a XSize&#8208;
       Hints structure.  Note that all fields in the XSizeHints structure are
       initially set to zero.  If insufficient memory is available, XAllocSize&#8208;
       Hints returns NULL.  To free the memory allocated to this structure, use
       XFree.

       The XSetWMNormalHints function replaces the size hints for the WM_NOR&#8208;
       MAL_HINTS property on the specified window.  If the property does not
       already exist, XSetWMNormalHints sets the size hints for the WM_NOR&#8208;
       MAL_HINTS property on the specified window.  The property is stored with
       a type of WM_SIZE_HINTS and a format of 32.

       XSetWMNormalHints can generate BadAlloc and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetWMNormalHints function returns the size hints stored in the
       WM_NORMAL_HINTS property on the specified window.  If the property is of
       type WM_SIZE_HINTS, is of format 32, and is long enough to contain either
       an old (pre-ICCCM) or new size hints structure, XGetWMNormalHints sets
       the various fields of the XSizeHints structure, sets the supplied_return
       argument to the list of fields that were supplied by the user (whether or
       not they contained defined values), and returns a nonzero status.  Other&#8208;
       wise, it returns a zero status.

       If XGetWMNormalHints returns successfully and a pre-ICCCM size hints
       property is read, the supplied_return argument will contain the following
       bits:

       (USPosition|USSize|PPosition|PSize|PMinSize|
        PMaxSize|PResizeInc|PAspect)

       If the property is large enough to contain the base size and window grav&#8208;
       ity fields as well, the supplied_return argument will also contain the
       following bits:

       PBaseSize|PWinGravity

       XGetWMNormalHints can generate a PN BadWindow error.

       The XSetWMSizeHints function replaces the size hints for the specified
       property on the named window.  If the specified property does not already
       exist, XSetWMSizeHints sets the size hints for the specified property on
       the named window.  The property is stored with a type of WM_SIZE_HINTS
       and a format of 32.  To set a window&apos;s normal size hints, you can use the
       XSetWMNormalHints function.

       XSetWMSizeHints can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetWMSizeHints function returns the size hints stored in the speci&#8208;
       fied property on the named window.  If the property is of type
       WM_SIZE_HINTS, is of format 32, and is long enough to contain either an
       old (pre-ICCCM) or new size hints structure, XGetWMSizeHints sets the
       various fields of the XSizeHints structure, sets the supplied_return
       argument to the list of fields that were supplied by the user (whether or
       not they contained defined values), and returns a nonzero status.  Other&#8208;
       wise, it returns a zero status.  To get a window&apos;s normal size hints, you
       can use the XGetWMNormalHints function.

       If XGetWMSizeHints returns successfully and a pre-ICCCM size hints prop&#8208;
       erty is read, the supplied_return argument will contain the following
       bits:

       (USPosition|USSize|PPosition|PSize|PMinSize|
        PMaxSize|PResizeInc|PAspect)

       If the property is large enough to contain the base size and window grav&#8208;
       ity fields as well, the supplied_return argument will also contain the
       following bits:

       PBaseSize|PWinGravity

       XGetWMSizeHints can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

PROPERTIES
       WM_NORMAL_HINTS
                 Size hints for a window in its normal state.  The C type of
                 this property is XSizeHints.

STRUCTURES
       The XSizeHints structure contains:

       /* Size hints mask bits */

       lw(.5i) lw(1.1i) lw(1.5i) lw(3.1i).  T{ #define T}   T{ USPosition
       T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 0) T}   T{ /* user specified x, y */ T} T{ #define T}   T{
       USSize T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 1) T}   T{ /* user specified width, height */ T} T{
       #define T}   T{ PPosition T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 2) T}   T{ /* program specified
       position */ T} T{ #define T}   T{ PSize T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 3) T}   T{ /* pro&#8208;
       gram specified size */ T} T{ #define T}   T{ PMinSize T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 4)
       T}   T{ /* program specified minimum size */ T} T{ #define T}   T{ PMax&#8208;
       Size T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 5) T}   T{ /* program specified maximum size */ T} T{
       #define T}   T{ PResizeInc T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 6) T}   T{ /* program specified
       resize increments */ T} T{ #define T}   T{ PAspect T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 7)
       T}   T{ /* program specified min and max aspect ratios */ T} T{ #define
       T}   T{ PBaseSize T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 8) T} T{ #define T}   T{ PWinGravity
       T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 9) T} T{ #define T}   T{ PAllHints T}   T{ (PPosi&#8208;
       tion|PSize|
       PMinSize|PMaxSize|
       PResizeInc|PAspect) T}   T{ T}
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
            long flags;         /* marks which fields in this structure are defined */
            int x, y;           /* Obsolete */
            int width, height;  /* Obsolete */
            int min_width, min_height;
            int max_width, max_height;
            int width_inc, height_inc;
            struct {
                   int x;       /* numerator */
                   int y;       /* denominator */
            } min_aspect, max_aspect;
            int base_width, base_height;
            int win_gravity;
            /* this structure may be extended in the future */
       } XSizeHints;

       The x, y, width, and height members are now obsolete and are left solely
       for compatibility reasons.  The min_width and min_height members specify
       the minimum window size that still allows the application to be useful.
       The max_width and max_height members specify the maximum window size.
       The width_inc and height_inc members define an arithmetic progression of
       sizes (minimum to maximum) into which the window prefers to be resized.
       The min_aspect and max_aspect members are expressed as ratios of x and y,
       and they allow an application to specify the range of aspect ratios it
       prefers.  The base_width and base_height members define the desired size
       of the window.  The window manager will interpret the position of the
       window and its border width to position the point of the outer rectangle
       of the overall window specified by the win_gravity member.  The outer
       rectangle of the window includes any borders or decorations supplied by
       the window manager.  In other words, if the window manager decides to
       place the window where the client asked, the position on the parent win&#8208;
       dow&apos;s border named by the win_gravity will be placed where the client
       window would have been placed in the absence of a window manager.

       Note that use of the PAllHints macro is highly discouraged.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
