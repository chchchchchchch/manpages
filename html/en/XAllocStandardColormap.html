XAllocStandardColormap(3)        XLIB FUNCTIONS        XAllocStandardColormap(3)



NAME
       XAllocStandardColormap, XSetRGBColormaps, XGetRGBColormaps, XStandardCol&#8208;
       ormap - allocate, set, or read a standard colormap structure

SYNTAX

       void XSetRGBColormaps(Display *display, Window w, XStandardColormap
              *std_colormap, int count, Atom property);

       Status XGetRGBColormaps(Display *display, Window w, XStandardColormap
              **std_colormap_return, int *count_return, Atom property);

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       count     Specifies the number of colormaps.

       count_return
                 Returns the number of colormaps.

       property  Specifies the property name.

       std_colormap
                 Specifies the XStandardColormap structure to be used.

                 Returns the XStandardColormap structure.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocStandardColormap function allocates and returns a pointer to a
       XStandardColormap structure.  Note that all fields in the XStandardCol&#8208;
       ormap structure are initially set to zero.  If insufficient memory is
       available, XAllocStandardColormap returns NULL.  To free the memory allo&#8208;
       cated to this structure, use XFree.

       The XSetRGBColormaps function replaces the RGB colormap definition in the
       specified property on the named window.  If the property does not already
       exist, XSetRGBColormaps sets the RGB colormap definition in the specified
       property on the named window.  The property is stored with a type of
       RGB_COLOR_MAP and a format of 32.  Note that it is the caller&apos;s responsi&#8208;
       bility to honor the ICCCM restriction that only RGB_DEFAULT_MAP contain
       more than one definition.

       The XSetRGBColormaps function usually is only used by window or session
       managers.  To create a standard colormap, follow this procedure:

       1.   Open a new connection to the same server.

       2.   Grab the server.

       3.   See if the property is on the property list of the root window for
            the screen.

       4.   If the desired property is not present:

            &#183;    Create a colormap (unless you are using the default colormap of
                 the screen).

            &#183;    Determine the color characteristics of the visual.

            &#183;    Allocate cells in the colormap (or create it with AllocAll).
&#12;            &#183;    Call XStoreColors to store appropriate color values in the col&#8208;
                 ormap.

            &#183;    Fill in the descriptive members in the XStandardColormap struc&#8208;
                 ture.

            &#183;    Attach the property to the root window.

            &#183;    Use XSetCloseDownMode to make the resource permanent.

       5.   Ungrab the server.

       XSetRGBColormaps can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetRGBColormaps function returns the RGB colormap definitions stored
       in the specified property on the named window.  If the property exists,
       is of type RGB_COLOR_MAP, is of format 32, and is long enough to contain
       a colormap definition, XGetRGBColormaps allocates and fills in space for
       the returned colormaps and returns a nonzero status.  If the visualid is
       not present, XGetRGBColormaps assumes the default visual for the screen
       on which the window is located; if the killid is not present, None is
       assumed, which indicates that the resources cannot be released.  Other&#8208;
       wise, none of the fields are set, and XGetRGBColormaps returns a zero
       status.  Note that it is the caller&apos;s responsibility to honor the ICCCM
       restriction that only RGB_DEFAULT_MAP contain more than one definition.

       XGetRGBColormaps can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

STRUCTURES
       The XStandardColormap structure contains:

       /* Hints */

       lw(.5i) lw(2i) lw(1i).  T{ #define T}   T{ ReleaseByFreeingColormap
       T}   T{ ( (XID) 1L) T} /* Values */
       typedef struct {
            Colormap colormap;
            unsigned long red_max;
            unsigned long red_mult;
            unsigned long green_max;
            unsigned long green_mult;
            unsigned long blue_max;
            unsigned long blue_mult;
            unsigned long base_pixel;
            VisualID visualid;
            XID killid;
       } XStandardColormap;

       The colormap member is the colormap created by the XCreateColormap func&#8208;
       tion.  The red_max, green_max, and blue_max members give the maximum red,
       green, and blue values, respectively.  Each color coefficient ranges from
       zero to its max, inclusive.  For example, a common colormap allocation is
       3/3/2 (3 planes for red, 3 planes for green, and 2 planes for blue).
       This colormap would have red_max = 7, green_max = 7, and blue_max = 3.
       An alternate allocation that uses only 216 colors is red_max = 5,
       green_max = 5, and blue_max = 5.

       The red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult members give the scale factors
       used to compose a full pixel value.  (See the discussion of the
       base_pixel members for further information.)  For a 3/3/2 allocation,
       red_mult might be 32, green_mult might be 4, and blue_mult might be 1.
       For a 6-colors-each allocation, red_mult might be 36, green_mult might be
       6, and blue_mult might be 1.

       The base_pixel member gives the base pixel value used to compose a full
       pixel value.  Usually, the base_pixel is obtained from a call to the XAl&#8208;
       locColorPlanes function.  Given integer red, green, and blue coefficients
       in their appropriate ranges, one then can compute a corresponding pixel
       value by using the following expression:

       (r * red_mult + g * green_mult + b * blue_mult + base_pixel) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF

       For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and
       base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  To com&#8208;
       pute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:

       (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF

       Negative multipliers can be represented by converting the 2&apos;s complement
       representation of the multiplier into an unsigned long and storing the
       result in the appropriate _mult field.  The step of masking by 0xFFFFFFFF
       effectively converts the resulting positive multiplier into a negative
       one.  The masking step will take place automatically on many machine
       architectures, depending on the size of the integer type used to do the
       computation,

       The visualid member gives the ID number of the visual from which the col&#8208;
       ormap was created.  The killid member gives a resource ID that indicates
       whether the cells held by this standard colormap are to be released by
       freeing the colormap ID or by calling the XKillClient function on the
       indicated resource.  (Note that this method is necessary for allocating
       out of an existing colormap.)

       The properties containing the XStandardColormap information have the type
       RGB_COLOR_MAP.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
