DESCRIPTION
       The XAllowEvents function releases some queued events if the client has
       caused a device to freeze.  It has no effect if the specified time is
       earlier than the last-grab time of the most recent active grab for the
       client or if the specified time is later than the current X server time.

       XAllowEvents can generate a BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
