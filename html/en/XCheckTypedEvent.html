       w         Specifies the window  whose event uou are interested in.

DESCRIPTION
       The XNextEvent function copies the first event from the event queue into
       the specified XEvent structure and then removes it from the queue.  If
       the event queue is empty, XNextEvent flushes the output buffer and blocks
       until an event is received.

       The XPeekEvent function returns the first event from the event queue, but
       it does not remove the event from the queue.  If the queue is empty,
       XPeekEvent flushes the output buffer and blocks until an event is
       received.  It then copies the event into the client-supplied XEvent
       structure without removing it from the event queue.

       The XWindowEvent function searches the event queue for an event that
       matches both the specified window and event mask.  When it finds a match,
       XWindowEvent removes that event from the queue and copies it into the
       specified XEvent structure.  The other events stored in the queue are not
       discarded.  If a matching event is not in the queue, XWindowEvent flushes
       the output buffer and blocks until one is received.

       The XCheckWindowEvent function searches the event queue and then the
       events available on the server connection for the first event that
       matches the specified window and event mask.  If it finds a match,
       XCheckWindowEvent removes that event, copies it into the specified XEvent
       structure, and returns True.  The other events stored in the queue are
       not discarded.  If the event you requested is not available, XCheckWin&#8208;
       dowEvent returns False, and the output buffer will have been flushed.

       The XMaskEvent function searches the event queue for the events associ&#8208;
       ated with the specified mask.  When it finds a match, XMaskEvent removes
       that event and copies it into the specified XEvent structure.  The other
       events stored in the queue are not discarded.  If the event you requested
       is not in the queue, XMaskEvent flushes the output buffer and blocks
       until one is received.

       The XCheckMaskEvent function searches the event queue and then any events
       available on the server connection for the first event that matches the
       specified mask.  If it finds a match, XCheckMaskEvent removes that event,
       copies it into the specified XEvent structure, and returns True.  The
       other events stored in the queue are not discarded.  If the event you
       requested is not available, XCheckMaskEvent returns False, and the output
       buffer will have been flushed.

       The XCheckTypedEvent function searches the event queue and then any
       events available on the server connection for the first event that
       matches the specified type.  If it finds a match, XCheckTypedEvent
       removes that event, copies it into the specified XEvent structure, and
       returns True.  The other events in the queue are not discarded.  If the
       event is not available, XCheckTypedEvent returns False, and the output
       buffer will have been flushed.

       The XCheckTypedWindowEvent function searches the event queue and then any
       events available on the server connection for the first event that
       matches the specified type and window.  If it finds a match, XCheckTyped&#8208;
       WindowEvent removes the event from the queue, copies it into the speci&#8208;
       fied XEvent structure, and returns True.  The other events in the queue
       are not discarded.  If the event is not available, XCheckTypedWindowEvent
       returns False, and the output buffer will have been flushed.
