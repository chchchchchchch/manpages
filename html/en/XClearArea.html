XClearArea(3)                    XLIB FUNCTIONS                    XClearArea(3)



NAME
       XClearArea, XClearWindow - clear area or window

SYNTAX
       int XClearArea(Display *display, Window w, int x, int y, unsigned width,
              unsigned height, Bool exposures);

       int XClearWindow(Display *display, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       exposures Specifies a Boolean value that indicates if Expose events are
                 to be generated.

       w         Specifies the window.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions of the
                 rectangle.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the window and specify the upper-left corner of the rec&#8208;
                 tangle.

DESCRIPTION
       The XClearArea function paints a rectangular area in the specified window
       according to the specified dimensions with the window&apos;s background pixel
       or pixmap.  The subwindow-mode effectively is ClipByChildren.  If width
       is zero, it is replaced with the current width of the window minus x.  If
       height is zero, it is replaced with the current height of the window
       minus y.  If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle
       clipped by any children is filled with this tile.  If the window has
       background None, the contents of the window are not changed.  In either
       case, if exposures is True, one or more Expose events are generated for
       regions of the rectangle that are either visible or are being retained in
       a backing store.  If you specify a window whose class is InputOnly, a
       BadMatch error results.

       XClearArea can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XClearWindow function clears the entire area in the specified window
       and is equivalent to XClearArea (display, w, 0, 0, 0, 0, False).  If the
       window has a defined background tile, the rectangle is tiled with a
       plane-mask of all ones and GXcopy function.  If the window has background
       None, the contents of the window are not changed.  If you specify a win&#8208;
       dow whose class is InputOnly, a BadMatch error results.

       XClearWindow can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
