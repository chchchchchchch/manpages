XClientMessageEvent(3)           XLIB FUNCTIONS           XClientMessageEvent(3)



NAME
       XClientMessageEvent - ClientMessage event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for ClientMessage events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ClientMessage */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            Atom message_type;
            int format;
            union {
                 char b[20];
                 short s[10];
                 long l[5];
                    } data;
       } XClientMessageEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The message_type member is set to an atom that indicates how the data
       should be interpreted by the receiving client.  The format member is set
       to 8, 16, or 32 and specifies whether the data should be viewed as a list
       of bytes, shorts, or longs.  The data member is a union that contains the
       members b, s, and l.  The b, s, and l members represent data of twenty
       8-bit values, ten 16-bit values, and five 32-bit values.  Particular mes&#8208;
       sage types might not make use of all these values.  The X server places
       no interpretation on the values in the window, message_type, or data mem&#8208;
       bers.
