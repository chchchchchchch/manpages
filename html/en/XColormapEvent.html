XColormapEvent(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XColormapEvent(3)



NAME
       XColormapEvent - ColormapNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for ColormapNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ColormapNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            Colormap colormap;       /* colormap or None */
            Bool new;
            int state;               /* ColormapInstalled, ColormapUninstalled */
       } XColormapEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose associated colormap is
       changed, installed, or uninstalled.  For a colormap that is changed,
       installed, or uninstalled, the colormap member is set to the colormap
       associated with the window.  For a colormap that is changed by a call to
       XFreeColormap, the colormap member is set to None.  The new member is set
       to indicate whether the colormap for the specified window was changed or
       installed or uninstalled and can be True or False.  If it is True, the
       colormap was changed.  If it is False, the colormap was installed or
       uninstalled.  The state member is always set to indicate whether the col&#8208;
       ormap is installed or uninstalled and can be ColormapInstalled or Col&#8208;
       ormapUninstalled.
