XConfigureEvent(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XConfigureEvent(3)



NAME
       XConfigureEvent - ConfigureNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for ConfigureNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ConfigureNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window event;
            Window window;
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int border_width;
            Window above;
            Bool override_redirect;
       } XConfigureEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the reconfigured window or to its par&#8208;
       ent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was
       selected.  The window member is set to the window whose size, position,
       border, and/or stacking order was changed.

       The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the parent
       window&apos;s origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside cor&#8208;
       ner of the window.  The width and height members are set to the inside
       size of the window, not including the border.  The border_width member is
       set to the width of the window&apos;s border, in pixels.

       The above member is set to the sibling window and is used for stacking
       operations.  If the X server sets this member to None, the window whose
       state was changed is on the bottom of the stack with respect to sibling
       windows.  However, if this member is set to a sibling window, the window
       whose state was changed is placed on top of this sibling window.

       The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of
       the window.  Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if
       the override_redirect member is True.
