NAME
       XConsortium - X Consortium information

SYNOPSIS
       Releases  6.0  through  6.3  of X Version 11 were brought to you by the X
       Consortium, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit  Delaware  membership
       corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consor&#8208;
       tium.  The purpose of the X Consortium was  to  foster  the  development,
       evolution, and maintenance of the X Window System, a comprehensive set of
       vendor-neutral, system-architecture neutral, network-transparent  window&#8208;
       ing and user interface standards.

       The  X  Window  System  was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
       Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded  consortium
       to  provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to sup&#8208;
       port further development of the X Window System.  In 1992,  MIT  and  the
       membership  decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium
       out of MIT and create  an  independent,  stand-alone  organization.   All
       rights  to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc.
       on January 1, 1994.  X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December  31,
       1996.   All  rights to the X Window System have been assigned to the Open
       Software Foundation.

       The X Consortium was financially self-supporting through membership fees.
       There  are  no  license  fees  associated with the use of X Window System
       standards and code developed by the X Consortium.  Membership  in  the  X
       Consortium  was  open to any organization willing to execute a membership
       agreement.

       The X Consortium was a highly participative body.  Members  were  encour&#8208;
       aged to actively cooperate with the staff and other members in the design
       and review of proposed specifications, and  in  the  design,  coding  and
       testing of sample implementations of those specifications.

       The X Consortium accomplished most of its work using electronic mail over
       the Internet, with individual mailing lists for working groups.  Internet
       electronic  mail connectivity was viewed as a requirement for useful par&#8208;
       ticipation in X Consortium activities.  Meetings were held as  necessary,
       often in conjunction with industry conferences and trade shows.
