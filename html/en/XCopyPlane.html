XCopyArea(3)                     XLIB FUNCTIONS                     XCopyArea(3)



NAME
       XCopyArea, XCopyPlane - copy areas

SYNTAX
       int XCopyArea(Display *display, Drawable src, Drawable dest, GC gc, int
              src_x, int src_y, unsigned int width, unsigned height, int dest_x,
              int dest_y);

       int XCopyPlane(Display *display, Drawable src, Drawable dest, GC gc, int
              src_x, int src_y, unsigned width, int height, int dest_x, int
              dest_y, unsigned long plane);

ARGUMENTS
       dest_x
       dest_y    Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the destination rectangle and specify its upper-left
                 corner.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       plane     Specifies the bit plane.  You must set exactly one bit to 1.

       src
       dest      Specify the source and destination rectangles to be combined.

       src_x
       src_y     Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the source rectangle and specify its upper-left corner.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions of both
                 the source and destination rectangles.

DESCRIPTION
       The XCopyArea function combines the specified rectangle of src with the
       specified rectangle of dest.  The drawables must have the same root and
       depth, or a BadMatch error results.

       If regions of the source rectangle are obscured and have not been
       retained in backing store or if regions outside the boundaries of the
       source drawable are specified, those regions are not copied.  Instead,
       the following occurs on all corresponding destination regions that are
       either visible or are retained in backing store.  If the destination is a
       window with a background other than None, corresponding regions of the
       destination are tiled with that background (with plane-mask of all ones
       and GXcopy function).  Regardless of tiling or whether the destination is
       a window or a pixmap, if graphics-exposures is True, then GraphicsExpose
       events for all corresponding destination regions are generated.  If
       graphics-exposures is True but no GraphicsExpose events are generated, a
       NoExpose event is generated.  Note that by default graphics-exposures is
       True in new GCs.

       This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-
       mode, graphics-exposures, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       XCopyArea can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.

       The XCopyPlane function uses a single bit plane of the specified source
       rectangle combined with the specified GC to modify the specified rectan&#8208;
       gle of dest.  The drawables must have the same root but need not have the
       same depth.  If the drawables do not have the same root, a BadMatch error
       results.  If plane does not have exactly one bit set to 1 and the value
       of plane is not less than %2 sup n%, where n is the depth of src, a Bad&#8208;
       Value error results.

       Effectively, XCopyPlane forms a pixmap of the same depth as the rectangle
       of dest and with a size specified by the source region.  It uses the
       foreground/background pixels in the GC (foreground everywhere the bit
       plane in src contains a bit set to 1, background everywhere the bit plane
       in src contains a bit set to 0) and the equivalent of a CopyArea protocol
       request is performed with all the same exposure semantics.  This can also
       be thought of as using the specified region of the source bit plane as a
       stipple with a fill-style of FillOpaqueStippled for filling a rectangular
       area of the destination.

       This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, foreground,
       background, subwindow-mode, graphics-exposures, clip-x-origin, clip-y-
       origin, and clip-mask.

       XCopyPlane can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
