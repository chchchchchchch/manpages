NAME
       XCreateFontCursor, XCreatePixmapCursor, XCreateGlyphCursor - create cur&#8208;
       sors

SYNTAX
       #include &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt;

       Cursor XCreateFontCursor(Display *display, unsigned int shape);

       Cursor XCreatePixmapCursor(Display *display, Pixmap source, Pixmap mask,
              XColor *foreground_color, XColor *background_color, unsigned int
              x, unsigned int y);

       Cursor XCreateGlyphCursor(Display *display, Font source_font, Font
              mask_font, unsigned int source_char, unsigned int mask_char,
              XColor *foreground_color, XColor *background_color);

ARGUMENTS
       background_color
                 Specifies the RGB values for the background of the source.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       foreground_color
                 Specifies the RGB values for the foreground of the source.

       mask      Specifies the cursor&apos;s source bits to be displayed or None.

       mask_char Specifies the glyph character for the mask.

       mask_font Specifies the font for the mask glyph or None.

       shape     Specifies the shape of the cursor.

       source    Specifies the shape of the source cursor.

       source_char
                 Specifies the character glyph for the source.

       source_font
                 Specifies the font for the source glyph.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which indicate the hotspot
                 relative to the source&apos;s origin.

DESCRIPTION
       X provides a set of standard cursor shapes in a special font named cur&#8208;
       sor.  Applications are encouraged to use this interface for their cursors
       because the font can be customized for the individual display type.  The
       shape argument specifies which glyph of the standard fonts to use.

       The hotspot comes from the information stored in the cursor font.  The
       initial colors of a cursor are a black foreground and a white background
       (see XRecolorCursor).

       XCreateFontCursor can generate BadAlloc and BadValue errors.

       The XCreatePixmapCursor function creates a cursor and returns the cursor
       ID associated with it.  The foreground and background RGB values must be
       specified using foreground_color and background_color, even if the X
       server only has a StaticGray or GrayScale screen.  The foreground color
       is used for the pixels set to 1 in the source, and the background color
       is used for the pixels set to 0.  Both source and mask, if specified,
       must have depth one (or a BadMatch error results) but can have any root.
       The mask argument defines the shape of the cursor.  The pixels set to 1
       in the mask define which source pixels are displayed, and the pixels set
       to 0 define which pixels are ignored.  If no mask is given, all pixels of
       the source are displayed.  The mask, if present, must be the same size as
       the pixmap defined by the source argument, or a BadMatch error results.
       The hotspot must be a point within the source, or a BadMatch error
       results.

       The components of the cursor can be transformed arbitrarily to meet dis&#8208;
       play limitations.  The pixmaps can be freed immediately if no further
       explicit references to them are to be made.  Subsequent drawing in the
       source or mask pixmap has an undefined effect on the cursor.  The X
       server might or might not make a copy of the pixmap.

       XCreatePixmapCursor can generate BadAlloc and BadPixmap errors.

       The XCreateGlyphCursor function is similar to XCreatePixmapCursor except
       that the source and mask bitmaps are obtained from the specified font
       glyphs.  The source_char must be a defined glyph in source_font, or a
       BadValue error results.  If mask_font is given, mask_char must be a
       defined glyph in mask_font, or a BadValue error results.  The mask_font
       and character are optional.  The origins of the source_char and mask_char
       (if defined) glyphs are positioned coincidently and define the hotspot.
       The source_char and mask_char need not have the same bounding box met&#8208;
       rics, and there is no restriction on the placement of the hotspot rela&#8208;
       tive to the bounding boxes.  If no mask_char is given, all pixels of the
       source are displayed.  You can free the fonts immediately by calling
       XFreeFont if no further explicit references to them are to be made.

       For 2-byte matrix fonts, the 16-bit value should be formed with the byte1
       member in the most significant byte and the byte2 member in the least
       significant byte.

       XCreateGlyphCursor can generate BadAlloc, BadFont, and BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadFont   A value for a Font or GContext argument does not name a defined
                 Font.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadPixmap A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
