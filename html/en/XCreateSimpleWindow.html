XCreateWindow(3)                 XLIB FUNCTIONS                 XCreateWindow(3)



NAME
       XCreateWindow, XCreateSimpleWindow, XSetWindowAttributes - create windows
       and window attributes structure

SYNTAX
       Window XCreateWindow(Display *display, Window parent, int x, int y,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int bor&#8208;
              der_width, int depth, unsigned int class, Visual *visual, unsigned
              long valuemask, XSetWindowAttributes *attributes);

       Window XCreateSimpleWindow(Display *display, Window parent, int x, int y,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int bor&#8208;
              der_width, unsigned long border, unsigned long background);

ARGUMENTS
       attributes
                 Specifies the structure from which the values (as specified by
                 the value mask) are to be taken.  The value mask should have
                 the appropriate bits set to indicate which attributes have been
                 set in the structure.

       background
                 Specifies the background pixel value of the window.


       border    Specifies the border pixel value of the window.

       border_width
                 Specifies the width of the created window&apos;s border in pixels.

       class     Specifies the created window&apos;s class.  You can pass InputOut&#8208;
                 put, InputOnly, or CopyFromParent.  A class of CopyFromParent
                 means the class is taken from the parent.

       depth     Specifies the window&apos;s depth.  A depth of CopyFromParent means
                 the depth is taken from the parent.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       parent    Specifies the parent window.

       valuemask Specifies which window attributes are defined in the attributes
                 argument.  This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid
                 attribute mask bits.  If valuemask is zero, the attributes are
                 ignored and are not referenced.

       visual    Specifies the visual type.  A visual of CopyFromParent means
                 the visual type is taken from the parent.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the created window&apos;s
                 inside dimensions and do not include the created window&apos;s bor&#8208;
                 ders.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are the top-left outside
                 corner of the window&apos;s borders and are relative to the inside
                 of the parent window&apos;s borders.

DESCRIPTION
       The XCreateWindow function creates an unmapped subwindow for a specified
       parent window, returns the window ID of the created window, and causes
       the X server to generate a CreateNotify event.  The created window is
       placed on top in the stacking order with respect to siblings.

       The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical
       with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-left corner.  Coordinates are inte&#8208;
       gral, in terms of pixels, and coincide with pixel centers.  Each window
       and pixmap has its own coordinate system.  For a window, the origin is
       inside the border at the inside, upper-left corner.

       The border_width for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a BadMatch
       error results.  For class InputOutput, the visual type and depth must be
       a combination supported for the screen, or a BadMatch error results.  The
       depth need not be the same as the parent, but the parent must not be a
       window of class InputOnly, or a BadMatch error results.  For an InputOnly
       window, the depth must be zero, and the visual must be one supported by
       the screen.  If either condition is not met, a BadMatch error results.
       The parent window, however, may have any depth and class.  If you specify
       any invalid window attribute for a window, a BadMatch error results.

       The created window is not yet displayed (mapped) on the user&apos;s display.
       To display the window, call XMapWindow.  The new window initially uses
       the same cursor as its parent.  A new cursor can be defined for the new
       window by calling XDefineCursor.  The window will not be visible on the
       screen unless it and all of its ancestors are mapped and it is not
       obscured by any of its ancestors.

       XCreateWindow can generate BadAlloc BadColor, BadCursor, BadMatch, Bad&#8208;
       Pixmap, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XCreateSimpleWindow function creates an unmapped InputOutput subwin&#8208;
       dow for a specified parent window, returns the window ID of the created
       window, and causes the X server to generate a CreateNotify event.  The
       created window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to
       siblings.  Any part of the window that extends outside its parent window
       is clipped.  The border_width for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a
       BadMatch error results.  XCreateSimpleWindow inherits its depth, class,
       and visual from its parent.  All other window attributes, except back&#8208;
       ground and border, have their default values.

       XCreateSimpleWindow can generate BadAlloc, BadMatch, BadValue, and Bad&#8208;
       Window errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Col&#8208;
                 ormap.

       BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

       BadMatch  The values do not exist for an InputOnly window.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadPixmap A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
