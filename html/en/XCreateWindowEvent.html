NAME
       XCreateWindowEvent - CreateNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for CreateNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* CreateNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window parent;           /* parent of the window */
            Window window;           /* window id of window created */
            int x, y;                /* window location */
            int width, height;       /* size of window */
            int border_width;        /* border width */
            Bool override_redirect;  /* creation should be overridden */
       } XCreateWindowEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the created window&apos;s parent.  The window mem&#8208;
       ber specifies the created window.  The x and y members are set to the
       created window&apos;s coordinates relative to the parent window&apos;s origin and
       indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the created
       window.  The width and height members are set to the inside size of the
       created window (not including the border) and are always nonzero.  The
       border_width member is set to the width of the created window&apos;s border,
       in pixels.  The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
       attribute of the window.  Window manager clients normally should ignore
       this window if the override_redirect member is True.
