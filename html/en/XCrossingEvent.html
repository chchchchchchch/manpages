NAME
       XCrossingEvent - EnterNotify and LeaveNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* EnterNotify or LeaveNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* ``event&apos;&apos; window reported relative to */
            Window root;             /* root window that the event occurred on */
            Window subwindow;        /* child window */
            Time time;               /* milliseconds */
            int x, y;                /* pointer x, y coordinates in event window */
            int x_root, y_root;      /* coordinates relative to root */
            int mode;                /* NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab */
            int detail;
                                     /*
                                     * NotifyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior,
                                     * NotifyNonlinear,NotifyNonlinearVirtual
                                     */
            Bool same_screen;        /* same screen flag */
            Bool focus;              /* boolean focus */
            unsigned int state;      /* key or button mask */
       } XCrossingEvent;
       typedef XCrossingEvent XEnterWindowEvent;
       typedef XCrossingEvent XLeaveWindowEvent;

       When you receive these events, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window on which the EnterNotify or
       LeaveNotify event was generated and is referred to as the event window.
       This is the window used by the X server to report the event, and is rela&#8208;
       tive to the root window on which the event occurred.  The root member is
       set to the root window of the screen on which the event occurred.

       For a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event window contains the ini&#8208;
       tial position of the pointer, the subwindow component is set to that
       child.  Otherwise, the X server sets the subwindow member to None.  For
       an EnterNotify event, if a child of the event window contains the final
       pointer position, the subwindow component is set to that child or None.

       The time member is set to the time when the event was generated and is
       expressed in milliseconds.  The x and y members are set to the coordi&#8208;
       nates of the pointer position in the event window.  This position is
       always the pointer&apos;s final position, not its initial position.  If the
       event window is on the same screen as the root window, x and y are the
       pointer coordinates relative to the event window&apos;s origin.  Otherwise, x
       and y are set to zero.  The x_root and y_root members are set to the
       pointer&apos;s coordinates relative to the root window&apos;s origin at the time of
       the event.

       The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the event window is on
       the same screen as the root window and can be either True or False.  If
       True, the event and root windows are on the same screen.  If False, the
       event and root windows are not on the same screen.

       The focus member is set to indicate whether the event window is the focus
       window or an inferior of the focus window.  The X server can set this
       member to either True or False.  If True, the event window is the focus
       window or an inferior of the focus window.  If False, the event window is
       not the focus window or an inferior of the focus window.

       The state member is set to indicate the state of the pointer buttons and
       modifier keys just prior to the event.  The X server can set this member
       to the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the button or modifier key
       masks: Button1Mask, Button2Mask, Button3Mask, Button4Mask, Button5Mask,
       ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask,
       Mod5Mask.

       The mode member is set to indicate whether the events are normal events,
       pseudo-motion events when a grab activates, or pseudo-motion events when
       a grab deactivates.  The X server can set this member to NotifyNormal,
       NotifyGrab, or NotifyUngrab.

       The detail member is set to indicate the notify detail and can be Noti&#8208;
       fyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior, NotifyNonlinear, or NotifyNon&#8208;
       linearVirtual.
