XDestroyWindow(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XDestroyWindow(3)



NAME
       XDestroyWindow, XDestroySubwindows - destroy windows

SYNTAX
       int XDestroyWindow(Display *display, Window w);

       int XDestroySubwindows(Display *display, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDestroyWindow function destroys the specified window as well as all
       of its subwindows and causes the X server to generate a DestroyNotify
       event for each window.  The window should never be referenced again.  If
       the window specified by the w argument is mapped, it is unmapped automat&#8208;
       ically.  The ordering of the DestroyNotify events is such that for any
       given window being destroyed, DestroyNotify is generated on any inferiors
       of the window before being generated on the window itself.  The ordering
       among siblings and across subhierarchies is not otherwise constrained.
       If the window you specified is a root window, no windows are destroyed.
       Destroying a mapped window will generate Expose events on other windows
       that were obscured by the window being destroyed.

       XDestroyWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XDestroySubwindows function destroys all inferior windows of the
       specified window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.  It causes the X
       server to generate a DestroyNotify event for each window.  If any mapped
       subwindows were actually destroyed, XDestroySubwindows causes the X
       server to generate Expose events on the specified window.  This is much
       more efficient than deleting many windows one at a time because much of
       the work need be performed only once for all of the windows, rather than
       for each window.  The subwindows should never be referenced again.

       XDestroySubwindows can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
