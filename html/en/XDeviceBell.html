XDEVICEBELL(3)                  XINPUT FUNCTIONS                  XDEVICEBELL(3)



NAME
       XDeviceBell - ring a bell on a device supported through the input
       extension

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       Status XDeviceBell( Display *display,
                           XDevice *device,
                           XID feedbackclass,
                           XID feedbackid,
                           int percent);
       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device with which the bell is associated.

       feedbackclass
              Specifies the class of the feedback with which the bell
              is associated.

       feedbackid
              Specifies the id of the feedback with which the bell is
              associated.

       percent
              Specifies the volume in the range -100 to 100 at which
              the bell should be rung.

DESCRIPTION
           The XDeviceBell request causes the server to ring a bell on the
           specified feedback of the specified device, if possible. The
           specified volume is relative to the base volume for the bell.
           If an invalid device is specified, a BadDevice error will be
           returned. The feedbackclass and feedbackid parameters contain
           values returned by an XGetFeedbackControl request and uniquely
           identify the bell to ring. If a feedbackclass is specified that
           does not support a bell, or if a nonexistent feedbackid is
           specified, or a percent value is specified that is not in the
           range -100 to 100, a BadValue error will be returned.

           The volume at which the bell is rung when the percent argument
           is nonnegative is: base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent

           The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument is
           negative is: base + [(base * percent) / 100]

           To change the base volume of the bell, use
           XChangeFeedbackControl.

           XDeviceBell can generate a BadDevice or a BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist, or has not been opened by this client
                  via XOpenInputDevice.

           BadValue
                  An invalid feedbackclass, feedbackid, or percent value
                  was specified.
