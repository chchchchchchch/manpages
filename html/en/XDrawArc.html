XDrawArc(3)                      XLIB FUNCTIONS                      XDrawArc(3)



NAME
       XDrawArc, XDrawArcs, XArc - draw arcs and arc structure

SYNTAX
       int XDrawArc(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, unsigned
              int width, unsigned int height, int angle1, int angle2);

       int XDrawArcs(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XArc *arcs, int
              narcs);

ARGUMENTS
       angle1    Specifies the start of the arc relative to the three-o&apos;clock
                 position from the center, in units of degrees * 64.

       angle2    Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative to the start
                 of the arc, in units of degrees * 64.

       arcs      Specifies an array of arcs.

       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       narcs     Specifies the number of arcs in the array.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the major and minor
                 axes of the arc.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the drawable and specify the upper-left corner of the
                 bounding rectangle.

DESCRIPTION
       delim %% XDrawArc draws a single circular or elliptical arc, and
       XDrawArcs draws multiple circular or elliptical arcs.  Each arc is speci&#8208;
       fied by a rectangle and two angles.  The center of the circle or ellipse
       is the center of the rectangle, and the major and minor axes are speci&#8208;
       fied by the width and height.  Positive angles indicate counterclockwise
       motion, and negative angles indicate clockwise motion.  If the magnitude
       of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, XDrawArc or XDrawArcs truncates it
       to 360 degrees.

       For an arc specified as %[ ~x, ~y, ~width , ~height, ~angle1, ~angle2 ]%,
       the origin of the major and minor axes is at % [ x +^ {width over 2} , ~y
       +^ {height over 2}  ]%, and the infinitely thin path describing the
       entire circle or ellipse intersects the horizontal axis at % [ x, ~y +^
       {height over 2}  ]% and % [ x +^ width , ~y +^ { height over 2 }] % and
       intersects the vertical axis at % [ x +^ { width over 2 } , ~y ]% and % [
       x +^ { width over 2 }, ~y +^ height ]%.  These coordinates can be frac&#8208;
       tional and so are not truncated to discrete coordinates.  The path should
       be defined by the ideal mathematical path.  For a wide line with line-
       width lw, the bounding outlines for filling are given by the two infin&#8208;
       itely thin paths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distance
       from the path of the circle/ellipse is equal to lw/2 (which may be a
       fractional value).  The cap-style and join-style are applied the same as
       for a line corresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at the end&#8208;
       point.
&#12;       For an arc specified as % [ ~x, ~y, ~width, ~height, ~angle1, ~angle2
       ]%, the angles must be specified in the effectively skewed coordinate
       system of the ellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems
       are identical).  The relationship between these angles and angles
       expressed in the normal coordinate system of the screen (as measured with
       a protractor) is as follows:

       % roman &quot;skewed-angle&quot; ~ = ~ atan left ( tan ( roman &quot;normal-angle&quot; )
        * width over height right ) +^ adjust%

       The skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians (rather than
       in degrees scaled by 64) in the range % [ 0 , ~2 pi  ]% and where atan
       returns a value in the range % [ - pi over 2 , ~pi over 2  ] % and adjust
       is:

       l l.  %0%  for normal-angle in the range % [ 0 , ~pi over 2  ]% %pi% for
       normal-angle in the range % [ pi over 2 , ~{3 pi} over 2  ]% %2
       pi%    for normal-angle in the range % [ {3 pi} over 2 , ~2 pi  ]%

       For any given arc, XDrawArc and XDrawArcs do not draw a pixel more than
       once.  If two arcs join correctly and if the line-width is greater than
       zero and the arcs intersect, XDrawArc and XDrawArcs do not draw a pixel
       more than once.  Otherwise, the intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs
       are drawn multiple times.  Specifying an arc with one endpoint and a
       clockwise extent draws the same pixels as specifying the other endpoint
       and an equivalent counterclockwise extent, except as it affects joins.

       If the last point in one arc coincides with the first point in the fol&#8208;
       lowing arc, the two arcs will join correctly.  If the first point in the
       first arc coincides with the last point in the last arc, the two arcs
       will join correctly.  By specifying one axis to be zero, a horizontal or
       vertical line can be drawn.  Angles are computed based solely on the
       coordinate system and ignore the aspect ratio.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, line-width,
       line-style, cap-style, join-style, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-
       origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They also use these GC mode-depen&#8208;
       dent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-
       origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and dash-list.

       XDrawArc and XDrawArcs can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch
       errors.

STRUCTURES
       The XArc structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            short x, y;
            unsigned short width, height;
            short angle1, angle2;             /* Degrees * 64 */
       } XArc;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and height members
       are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You should be careful not to generate
       coordinates and sizes out of the 16-bit ranges, because the protocol only
       has 16-bit fields for these values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.
&#12;       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.
