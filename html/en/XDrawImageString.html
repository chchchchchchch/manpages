XDrawImageString(3)              XLIB FUNCTIONS              XDrawImageString(3)



NAME
       XDrawImageString, XDrawImageString16 - draw image text

SYNTAX
       int XDrawImageString(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y,
              char *string, int length);

       int XDrawImageString16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y,
              XChar2b *string, int length);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       length    Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the
                 first character.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawImageString16 function is similar to XDrawImageString except
       that it uses 2-byte or 16-bit characters.  Both functions also use both
       the foreground and background pixels of the GC in the destination.

       The effect is first to fill a destination rectangle with the background
       pixel defined in the GC and then to paint the text with the foreground
       pixel.  The upper-left corner of the filled rectangle is at:

       [x, y - font-ascent]

       The width is:

       overall-width

       The height is:

       font-ascent + font-descent

       The overall-width, font-ascent, and font-descent are as would be returned
       by XQueryTextExtents using gc and string.  The function and fill-style
       defined in the GC are ignored for these functions.  The effective func&#8208;
       tion is GXcopy, and the effective fill-style is FillSolid.

       For fonts defined with 2-byte matrix indexing and used with XDrawIm&#8208;
       ageString, each byte is used as a byte2 with a byte1 of zero.

       Both functions use these GC components: plane-mask, foreground, back&#8208;
       ground, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
       mask.

       XDrawImageString and XDrawImageString16 can generate BadDrawable, BadGC,
       and BadMatch errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.
