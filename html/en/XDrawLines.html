XDrawLine(3)                     XLIB FUNCTIONS                     XDrawLine(3)



NAME
       XDrawLine, XDrawLines, XDrawSegments, XSegment - draw lines, polygons,
       and line structure

SYNTAX
       int XDrawLine(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x1, int y1, int
              x2, int y2);

       int XDrawLines(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XPoint *points, int
              npoints, int mode);

       int XDrawSegments(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XSegment *seg&#8208;
              ments, int nsegments);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       mode      Specifies the coordinate mode.  You can pass CoordModeOrigin or
                 CoordModePrevious.

       npoints   Specifies the number of points in the array.

       nsegments Specifies the number of segments in the array.

       points    Specifies an array of points.

       segments  Specifies an array of segments.

       x1
       y1
       x2
       y2        Specify the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to be connected.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawLine function uses the components of the specified GC to draw a
       line between the specified set of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).  It does
       not perform joining at coincident endpoints.  For any given line, XDraw&#8208;
       Line does not draw a pixel more than once.  If lines intersect, the
       intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

       The XDrawLines function uses the components of the specified GC to draw
       npoints-1 lines between each pair of points (point[i], point[i+1]) in the
       array of XPoint structures.  It draws the lines in the order listed in
       the array.  The lines join correctly at all intermediate points, and if
       the first and last points coincide, the first and last lines also join
       correctly.  For any given line, XDrawLines does not draw a pixel more
       than once.  If thin (zero line-width) lines intersect, the intersecting
       pixels are drawn multiple times.  If wide lines intersect, the intersect&#8208;
       ing pixels are drawn only once, as though the entire PolyLine protocol
       request were a single, filled shape.  CoordModeOrigin treats all coordi&#8208;
       nates as relative to the origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordi&#8208;
       nates after the first as relative to the previous point.

       The XDrawSegments function draws multiple, unconnected lines.  For each
       segment, XDrawSegments draws a line between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).  It
       draws the lines in the order listed in the array of XSegment structures
       and does not perform joining at coincident endpoints.  For any given
       line, XDrawSegments does not draw a pixel more than once.  If lines
       intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

       All three functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, line-
       width, line-style, cap-style, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin,
       clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  The XDrawLines function also uses the
       join-style GC component.  All three functions also use these GC mode-
       dependent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stip&#8208;
       ple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and dash-list.

       XDrawLine, XDrawLines, and XDrawSegments can generate BadDrawable, BadGC,
       and BadMatch errors.  XDrawLines can also generate a BadValue error.

STRUCTURES
       The XSegment structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            short x1, y1, x2, y2;
       } XSegment;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and height members
       are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You should be careful not to generate
       coordinates and sizes out of the 16-bit ranges, because the protocol only
       has 16-bit fields for these values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
