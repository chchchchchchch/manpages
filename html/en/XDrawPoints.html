XDrawPoint(3)                    XLIB FUNCTIONS                    XDrawPoint(3)



NAME
       XDrawPoint, XDrawPoints, XPoint - draw points and points structure

SYNTAX
       int XDrawPoint(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y);

       int XDrawPoints(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XPoint *points, int
              npoints, int mode);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       mode      Specifies the coordinate mode.  You can pass CoordModeOrigin or
                 CoordModePrevious.

       npoints   Specifies the number of points in the array.

       points    Specifies an array of points.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates where you want the point drawn.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawPoint function uses the foreground pixel and function components
       of the GC to draw a single point into the specified drawable; XDrawPoints
       draws multiple points this way.  CoordModeOrigin treats all coordinates
       as relative to the origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordinates
       after the first as relative to the previous point.  XDrawPoints draws the
       points in the order listed in the array.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, foreground,
       subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       XDrawPoint can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.  XDraw&#8208;
       Points can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

STRUCTURES
       The XPoint structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            short x, y;
       } XPoint;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and height members
       are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You should be careful not to generate
       coordinates and sizes out of the 16-bit ranges, because the protocol only
       has 16-bit fields for these values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.
&#12;       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
