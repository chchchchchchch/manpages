XDrawRectangle(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XDrawRectangle(3)



NAME
       XDrawRectangle, XDrawRectangles, XRectangle - draw rectangles and rectan&#8208;
       gles structure

SYNTAX
       int XDrawRectangle(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height);

       int XDrawRectangles(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XRectangle rec&#8208;
              tangles[], int nrectangles);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       nrectangles
                 Specifies the number of rectangles in the array.

       rectangles
                 Specifies an array of rectangles.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which specify the dimensions of
                 the rectangle.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which specify the upper-left
                 corner of the rectangle.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawRectangle and XDrawRectangles functions draw the outlines of the
       specified rectangle or rectangles as if a five-point PolyLine protocol
       request were specified for each rectangle:

              [x,y] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height] [x,y]

       For the specified rectangle or rectangles, these functions do not draw a
       pixel more than once.  XDrawRectangles draws the rectangles in the order
       listed in the array.  If rectangles intersect, the intersecting pixels
       are drawn multiple times.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, line-width,
       line-style, cap-style, join-style, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-
       origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They also use these GC mode-depen&#8208;
       dent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-
       origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and dash-list.

       XDrawRectangle and XDrawRectangles can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and
       BadMatch errors.

STRUCTURES
       The XRectangle structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            short x, y;
            unsigned short width, height;
       } XRectangle;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and height members
       are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You should be careful not to generate
       coordinates and sizes out of the 16-bit ranges, because the protocol only
       has 16-bit fields for these values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.
