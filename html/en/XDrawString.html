XDrawString(3)                   XLIB FUNCTIONS                   XDrawString(3)



NAME
       XDrawString, XDrawString16 - draw text characters

SYNTAX
       int XDrawString(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, char
              *string, int length);

       int XDrawString16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y,
              XChar2b *string, int length);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       length    Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the
                 first character.

DESCRIPTION
       Each character image, as defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an
       additional mask for a fill operation on the drawable.  The drawable is
       modified only where the font character has a bit set to 1.  For fonts
       defined with 2-byte matrix indexing and used with XDrawString16, each
       byte is used as a byte2 with a byte1 of zero.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
       font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They
       also use these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
       tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XDrawString and XDrawString16 can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and Bad&#8208;
       Match errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.
