XDrawText(3)                     XLIB FUNCTIONS                     XDrawText(3)



NAME
       XDrawText, XDrawText16, XTextItem, XTextItem16 - draw polytext text and
       text drawing structures

SYNTAX
       int XDrawText(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, XTex&#8208;
              tItem *items, int nitems);

       int XDrawText16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, XTex&#8208;
              tItem16 *items, int nitems);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       items     Specifies an array of text items.

       nitems    Specifies the number of text items in the array.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the
                 first character.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawText16 function is similar to XDrawText except that it uses
       2-byte or 16-bit characters.  Both functions allow complex spacing and
       font shifts between counted strings.

       Each text item is processed in turn.  A font member other than None in an
       item causes the font to be stored in the GC and used for subsequent text.
       A text element delta specifies an additional change in the position along
       the x axis before the string is drawn.  The delta is always added to the
       character origin and is not dependent on any characteristics of the font.
       Each character image, as defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an
       additional mask for a fill operation on the drawable.  The drawable is
       modified only where the font character has a bit set to 1.  If a text
       item generates a BadFont error, the previous text items may have been
       drawn.

       For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix index&#8208;
       ing, each XChar2b structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1
       as the most significant byte.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
       font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They
       also use these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
       tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XDrawText and XDrawText16 can generate BadDrawable, BadFont, BadGC, and
       BadMatch errors.

STRUCTURES
       The XTextItem and XTextItem16 structures contain:

       typedef struct {
            char *chars;             /* pointer to string */
            int nchars;              /* number of characters */
            int delta;               /* delta between strings */
            Font font;               /* Font to print it in, None don&apos;t change */
       } XTextItem;

       typedef struct {
            XChar2b *chars;          /* pointer to two-byte characters */
            int nchars;              /* number of characters */
            int delta;               /* delta between strings */
            Font font;               /* font to print it in, None don&apos;t change */
       } XTextItem16;

       If the font member is not None, the font is changed before printing and
       also is stored in the GC.  If an error was generated during text drawing,
       the previous items may have been drawn.  The baseline of the characters
       are drawn starting at the x and y coordinates that you pass in the text
       drawing functions.

       For example, consider the background rectangle drawn by XDrawImageString.
       If you want the upper-left corner of the background rectangle to be at
       pixel coordinate (x,y), pass the (x,y + ascent) as the baseline origin
       coordinates to the text functions.  The ascent is the font ascent, as
       given in the XFontStruct structure.  If you want the lower-left corner of
       the background rectangle to be at pixel coordinate (x,y), pass the (x,y -
       descent + 1) as the baseline origin coordinates to the text functions.
       The descent is the font descent, as given in the XFontStruct structure.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadFont   A value for a Font or GContext argument does not name a defined
                 Font.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.
