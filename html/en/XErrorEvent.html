XErrorEvent(3)                   XLIB FUNCTIONS                   XErrorEvent(3)



NAME
       XErrorEvent - X error event structure

STRUCTURES
       The XErrorEvent structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;
            Display *display;   /* Display the event was read from */
            unsigned long serial;/* serial number of failed request */
            unsigned char error_code;/* error code of failed request */
            unsigned char request_code;/* Major op-code of failed request */
            unsigned char minor_code;/* Minor op-code of failed request */
            XID resourceid;     /* resource id */
       } XErrorEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The serial member is the number of requests, starting from one, sent over
       the network connection since it was opened.  It is the number that was
       the value of NextRequest immediately before the failing call was made.
       The request_code member is a protocol request of the procedure that
       failed, as defined in &lt;X11/Xproto.h&gt;.
