XExposeEvent(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XExposeEvent(3)



NAME
       XExposeEvent - Expose event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for Expose events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* Expose */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int count;               /* if nonzero, at least this many more */
       } XExposeEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the exposed (damaged) window.  The x and y
       members are set to the coordinates relative to the window&apos;s origin and
       indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle.  The width and height
       members are set to the size (extent) of the rectangle.  The count member
       is set to the number of Expose events that are to follow.  If count is
       zero, no more Expose events follow for this window.  However, if count is
       nonzero, at least that number of Expose events (and possibly more) follow
       for this window.  Simple applications that do not want to optimize redis&#8208;
       play by distinguishing between subareas of its window can just ignore all
       Expose events with nonzero counts and perform full redisplays on events
       with zero counts.
