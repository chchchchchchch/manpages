XStoreBytes(3)                   XLIB FUNCTIONS                   XStoreBytes(3)



NAME
       XStoreBytes, XStoreBuffer, XFetchBytes, XFetchBuffer, XRotateBuffers -
       manipulate cut and paste buffers

SYNTAX
       int XStoreBytes(Display *display, char *bytes, int nbytes);

       int XStoreBuffer(Display *display, char *bytes, int nbytes, int buffer);

       char *XFetchBytes(Display *display, int *nbytes_return);

       char *XFetchBuffer(Display *display, int *nbytes_return, int buffer);

       int XRotateBuffers(Display *display, int rotate);

ARGUMENTS
       buffer    Specifies the buffer in which you want to store the bytes or
                 from which you want the stored data returned.

       bytes     Specifies the bytes, which are not necessarily ASCII or null-
                 terminated.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       nbytes    Specifies the number of bytes to be stored.

       nbytes_return
                 Returns the number of bytes in the buffer.

       rotate    Specifies how much to rotate the cut buffers.

DESCRIPTION
       The data can have embedded null characters and need not be null-termi&#8208;
       nated.  The cut buffer&apos;s contents can be retrieved later by any client
       calling XFetchBytes.

       XStoreBytes can generate a BadAlloc error.

       If an invalid buffer is specified, the call has no effect.  The data can
       have embedded null characters and need not be null-terminated.

       XStoreBuffer can generate a BadAlloc error.

       The XFetchBytes function returns the number of bytes in the nbytes_return
       argument, if the buffer contains data.  Otherwise, the function returns
       NULL and sets nbytes to 0.  The appropriate amount of storage is allo&#8208;
       cated and the pointer returned.  The client must free this storage when
       finished with it by calling XFree.

       The XFetchBuffer function returns zero to the nbytes_return argument if
       there is no data in the buffer or if an invalid buffer is specified.

       XFetchBuffer can generate a BadValue error.

       The XRotateBuffers function rotates the cut buffers, such that buffer 0
       becomes buffer n, buffer 1 becomes n + 1 mod 8, and so on.  This cut buf&#8208;
       fer numbering is global to the display.  Note that XRotateBuffers gener&#8208;
       ates BadMatch errors if any of the eight buffers have not been created.

       XRotateBuffers can generate a BadMatch error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
