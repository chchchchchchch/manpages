              unsigned int width, unsigned int height);

       int XFillRectangles(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XRectangle *rec&#8208;
              tangles, int nrectangles);

              narcs);

ARGUMENTS
       angle1    Specifies the start of the arc relative to the three-o&apos;clock
                 position from the center, in units of degrees * 64.

       angle2    Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative to the start
                 of the arc, in units of degrees * 64.

       arcs      Specifies an array of arcs.

       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       mode      Specifies the coordinate mode.  You can pass CoordModeOrigin or
                 CoordModePrevious.

       narcs     Specifies the number of arcs in the array.

       npoints   Specifies the number of points in the array.

       nrectangles
                 Specifies the number of rectangles in the array.

       points    Specifies an array of points.

       rectangles
                 Specifies an array of rectangles.

       shape     Specifies a shape that helps the server to improve performance.
                 You can pass Complex, Convex, or Nonconvex.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions of the
                 rectangle to be filled or the major and minor axes of the arc.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the drawable and specify the upper-left corner of the
                 rectangle.
&#12;DESCRIPTION
       The XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles functions fill the specified rec&#8208;
       tangle or rectangles as if a four-point FillPolygon protocol request were
       specified for each rectangle:

       [x,y] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height]

       Each function uses the x and y coordinates, width and height dimensions,
       and GC you specify.

       XFillRectangles fills the rectangles in the order listed in the array.
       For any given rectangle, XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles do not draw a
       pixel more than once.  If rectangles intersect, the intersecting pixels
       are drawn multiple times.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
       subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They also
       use these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile,
       stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and
       BadMatch errors.

       XFillPolygon fills the region closed by the specified path.  The path is
       closed automatically if the last point in the list does not coincide with
       the first point.  XFillPolygon does not draw a pixel of the region more
       than once.  CoordModeOrigin treats all coordinates as relative to the
       origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordinates after the first as
       relative to the previous point.

       Depending on the specified shape, the following occurs:

       &#183;    If shape is Complex, the path may self-intersect.  Note that con&#8208;
            tiguous coincident points in the path are not treated as self-inter&#8208;
            section.

       &#183;    If shape is Convex, for every pair of points inside the polygon, the
            line segment connecting them does not intersect the path.  If known
            by the client, specifying Convex can improve performance.  If you
            specify Convex for a path that is not convex, the graphics results
            are undefined.

       &#183;    If shape is Nonconvex, the path does not self-intersect, but the
            shape is not wholly convex.  If known by the client, specifying Non&#8208;
            convex instead of Complex may improve performance.  If you specify
            Nonconvex for a self-intersecting path, the graphics results are
            undefined.

       The fill-rule of the GC controls the filling behavior of self-intersect&#8208;
       ing polygons.

       This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
       fill-rule, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
       It also uses these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
       tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XFillPolygon can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue
       errors.

       For each arc, XFillArc or XFillArcs fills the region closed by the infin&#8208;
       itely thin path described by the specified arc and, depending on the arc-
       mode specified in the GC, one or two line segments.  For ArcChord, the
       single line segment joining the endpoints of the arc is used.  For
       ArcPieSlice, the two line segments joining the endpoints of the arc with
       the center point are used.  XFillArcs fills the arcs in the order listed
       in the array.  For any given arc, XFillArc and XFillArcs do not draw a
       pixel more than once.  If regions intersect, the intersecting pixels are
       drawn multiple times.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
       arc-mode, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
       They also use these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
       tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XFillArc and XFillArcs can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
