XFilterEvent(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XFilterEvent(3)



NAME
       XFilterEvent - filter X events for an input method

SYNTAX
       Bool XFilterEvent(XEvent *event, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       event     Specifies the event to filter.

       w         Specifies the window for which the filter is to be applied.

DESCRIPTION
       If the window argument is None, XFilterEvent applies the filter to the
       window specified in the XEvent structure.  The window argument is pro&#8208;
       vided so that layers above Xlib that do event redirection can indicate to
       which window an event has been redirected.

       If XFilterEvent returns True, then some input method has filtered the
       event, and the client should discard the event.  If XFilterEvent returns
       False, then the client should continue processing the event.

       If a grab has occurred in the client and XFilterEvent returns True, the
       client should ungrab the keyboard.
