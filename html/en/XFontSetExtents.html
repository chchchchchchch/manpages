XFontSetExtents(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XFontSetExtents(3)



NAME
       XFontSetExtents - XFontSetExtents structure

STRUCTURES
       The XFontSetExtents structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            XRectangle max_ink_extent;/* over all drawable characters */
            XRectangle max_logical_extent;/* over all drawable characters */
       } XFontSetExtents;

       The XRectangle structures used to return font set metrics are the usual
       Xlib screen-oriented rectangles with x, y giving the upper left corner,
       and width and height always positive.

       The max_ink_extent member gives the maximum extent, over all drawable
       characters, of the rectangles that bound the character glyph image drawn
       in the foreground color, relative to a constant origin.  See XmbTextEx&#8208;
       tents and XwcTextExtents for detailed semantics.

       The max_logical_extent member gives the maximum extent, over all drawable
       characters, of the rectangles that specify minimum spacing to other
       graphical features, relative to a constant origin.  Other graphical fea&#8208;
       tures drawn by the client, for example, a border surrounding the text,
       should not intersect this rectangle.  The max_logical_extent member
       should be used to compute minimum interline spacing and the minimum area
       that must be allowed in a text field to draw a given number of arbitrary
       characters.

       Due to context-dependent rendering, appending a given character to a
       string may change the string&apos;s extent by an amount other than that char&#8208;
       acter&apos;s individual extent.
