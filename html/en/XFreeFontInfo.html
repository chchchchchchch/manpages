NAME
       XListFonts, XFreeFontNames, XListFontsWithInfo, XFreeFontInfo - obtain or
       free font names and information

SYNTAX
       char **XListFonts(Display *display, char *pattern, int maxnames, int
              *actual_count_return);

       int XFreeFontNames(char *list[]);

       char **XListFontsWithInfo(Display *display, char *pattern, int maxnames,
              int *count_return, XFontStruct **info_return);

       int XFreeFontInfo(char **names, XFontStruct *free_info, int
              actual_count);

ARGUMENTS
       actual_count
                 Specifies the actual number of font names.


       actual_count_return
                 Returns the actual number of font names.

       count_return
                 Returns the actual number of matched font names.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       info_return
                 Returns the font information.

       free_info Specifies the font information.


       list      Specifies the array of strings you want to free.

       maxnames  Specifies the maximum number of names to be returned.

       names     Specifies the list of font names.


       pattern   Specifies the null-terminated pattern string that can contain
                 wildcard characters.

DESCRIPTION
       The XListFonts function returns an array of available font names (as con&#8208;
       trolled by the font search path; see XSetFontPath) that match the string
       you passed to the pattern argument.  The pattern string can contain any
       characters, but each asterisk (*) is a wildcard for any number of charac&#8208;
       ters, and each question mark (?) is a wildcard for a single character.
       If the pattern string is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the
       result is implementation-dependent.  Use of uppercase or lowercase does
       not matter.  Each returned string is null-terminated.  If the data
       returned by the server is in the Latin Portable Character Encoding, then
       the returned strings are in the Host Portable Character Encoding.  Other&#8208;
       wise, the result is implementation-dependent.  If there are no matching
       font names, XListFonts returns NULL.  The client should call XFreeFont&#8208;
       Names when finished with the result to free the memory.

       The XFreeFontNames function frees the array and strings returned by
       XListFonts or XListFontsWithInfo.

       The XListFontsWithInfo function returns a list of font names that match
       the specified pattern and their associated font information.  The list of
       names is limited to size specified by maxnames.  The information returned
       for each font is identical to what XLoadQueryFont would return except
       that the per-character metrics are not returned.  The pattern string can
       contain any characters, but each asterisk (*) is a wildcard for any num&#8208;
       ber of characters, and each question mark (?) is a wildcard for a single
       character.  If the pattern string is not in the Host Portable Character
       Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.  Use of uppercase or
       lowercase does not matter.  Each returned string is null-terminated.  If
       the data returned by the server is in the Latin Portable Character Encod&#8208;
       ing, then the returned strings are in the Host Portable Character Encod&#8208;
       ing.  Otherwise, the result is implementation-dependent.  If there are no
       matching font names, XListFontsWithInfo returns NULL.

       To free only the allocated name array, the client should call XFreeFont&#8208;
       Names.  To free both the name array and the font information array or to
       free just the font information array, the client should call XFree&#8208;
       FontInfo.

       The XFreeFontInfo function frees a font structure or an array of font
       structures and optionally an array of font names.  If NULL is passed for
       names, no font names are freed.  If a font structure for an open font
       (returned by XLoadQueryFont) is passed, the structure is freed, but the
       font is not closed; use XUnloadFont to close the font.

       Note that XListFontsWithInfo is not thread-safe. If other threads make X
       requests on the same Display, then this function&apos;s behavior is undefined.
