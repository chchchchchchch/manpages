DESCRIPTION
       The XCreateFontSet function creates a font set for the specified display.
       The font set is bound to the current locale when XCreateFontSet is
       called.  The font set may be used in subsequent calls to obtain font and
       character information and to image text in the locale of the font set.

       The base_font_name_list argument is a list of base font names that Xlib
       uses to load the fonts needed for the locale.  The base font names are a
       comma-separated list.  The string is null-terminated and is assumed to be
       in the Host Portable Character Encoding; otherwise, the result is imple&#8208;
       mentation-dependent.  White space immediately on either side of a sepa&#8208;
       rating comma is ignored.

       Use of XLFD font names permits Xlib to obtain the fonts needed for a
       variety of locales from a single locale-independent base font name.  The
       single base font name should name a family of fonts whose members are
       encoded in the various charsets needed by the locales of interest.

       An XLFD base font name can explicitly name a charset needed for the
       locale.  This allows the user to specify an exact font for use with a
       charset required by a locale, fully controlling the font selection.

       If a base font name is not an XLFD name, Xlib will attempt to obtain an
       XLFD name from the font properties for the font.  If this action is suc&#8208;
       cessful in obtaining an XLFD name, the XBaseFontNameListOfFontSet func&#8208;
       tion will return this XLFD name instead of the client-supplied name.

       Xlib uses the following algorithm to select the fonts that will be used
       to display text with the XFontSet.

       For each font charset required by the locale, the base font name list is
       searched for the first appearance of one of the following cases that
       names a set of fonts that exist at the server:
&#12;       &#183;    The first XLFD-conforming base font name that specifies the required
            charset or a superset of the required charset in its CharSetRegistry
            and CharSetEncoding fields.  The implementation may use a base font
            name whose specified charset is a superset of the required charset,
            for example, an ISO8859-1 font for an ASCII charset.

       &#183;    The first set of one or more XLFD-conforming base font names that
            specify one or more charsets that can be remapped to support the
            required charset.  The Xlib implementation may recognize various
            mappings from a required charset to one or more other charsets and
            use the fonts for those charsets.  For example, JIS Roman is ASCII
            with tilde and backslash replaced by yen and overbar; Xlib may load
            an ISO8859-1 font to support this character set if a JIS Roman font
            is not available.

       &#183;    The first XLFD-conforming font name or the first non-XLFD font name
            for which an XLFD font name can be obtained, combined with the
            required charset (replacing the CharSetRegistry and CharSetEncoding
            fields in the XLFD font name).  As in case 1, the implementation may
            use a charset that is a superset of the required charset.

       &#183;    The first font name that can be mapped in some implementation-depen&#8208;
            dent manner to one or more fonts that support imaging text in the
            charset.

       For example, assume that a locale required the charsets:

       ISO8859-1
       JISX0208.1983
       JISX0201.1976
       GB2312-1980.0

       The user could supply a base_font_name_list that explicitly specifies the
       charsets, ensuring that specific fonts are used if they exist.  For exam&#8208;
       ple:

       &quot;-JIS-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-240-JISX0208.1983-0,\
       -JIS-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-120-JISX0201.1976-0,\
       -GB-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-240-GB2312-1980.0,\
       -Adobe-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--25-180-75-75-M-150-ISO8859-1&quot;

       Alternatively, the user could supply a base_font_name_list that omits the
       charsets, letting Xlib select font charsets required for the locale.  For
       example:

       &quot;-JIS-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-240,\
       -JIS-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-120,\
       -GB-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--26-180-100-100-C-240,\
       -Adobe-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--25-180-100-100-M-150&quot;

       Alternatively, the user could simply supply a single base font name that
       allows Xlib to select from all available fonts that meet certain minimum
       XLFD property requirements.  For example:

       &quot;-*-*-*-R-Normal--*-180-100-100-*-*&quot;

       If XCreateFontSet is unable to create the font set, either because there
       is insufficient memory or because the current locale is not supported,
       XCreateFontSet returns NULL, missing_charset_list_return is set to NULL,
       and missing_charset_count_return is set to zero.  If fonts exist for all
       of the charsets required by the current locale, XCreateFontSet returns a
       valid XFontSet, missing_charset_list_return is set to NULL, and miss&#8208;
       ing_charset_count_return is set to zero.

       If no font exists for one or more of the required charsets, XCreate&#8208;
       FontSet sets missing_charset_list_return to a list of one or more null-
       terminated charset names for which no font exists and sets miss&#8208;
       ing_charset_count_return to the number of missing fonts.  The charsets
       are from the list of the required charsets for the encoding of the locale
       and do not include any charsets to which Xlib may be able to remap a
       required charset.

       If no font exists for any of the required charsets or if the locale defi&#8208;
       nition in Xlib requires that a font exist for a particular charset and a
       font is not found for that charset, XCreateFontSet returns NULL.  Other&#8208;
       wise, XCreateFontSet returns a valid XFontSet to font_set.

       When an Xmb/wc drawing or measuring function is called with an XFontSet
       that has missing charsets, some characters in the locale will not be
       drawable.  If def_string_return is non-NULL, XCreateFontSet returns a
       pointer to a string that represents the glyphs that are drawn with this
       XFontSet when the charsets of the available fonts do not include all font
       glyphs required to draw a codepoint.  The string does not necessarily
       consist of valid characters in the current locale and is not necessarily
       drawn with the fonts loaded for the font set, but the client can draw and
       measure the default glyphs by including this string in a string being
       drawn or measured with the XFontSet.

       If the string returned to def_string_return is the empty string (&quot;&quot;), no
       glyphs are drawn, and the escapement is zero.  The returned string is
       null-terminated.  It is owned by Xlib and should not be modified or freed
       by the client.  It will be freed by a call to XFreeFontSet with the asso&#8208;
       ciated XFontSet.  Until freed, its contents will not be modified by Xlib.

       The client is responsible for constructing an error message from the
       missing charset and default string information and may choose to continue
       operation in the case that some fonts did not exist.

       The returned XFontSet and missing charset list should be freed with
       XFreeFontSet and XFreeStringList, respectively.  The client-supplied
       base_font_name_list may be freed by the client after calling XCreate&#8208;
       FontSet.

       The XFreeFontSet function frees the specified font set.  The associated
       base font name list, font name list, XFontStruct list, and XFontSetEx&#8208;
       tents, if any, are freed.
