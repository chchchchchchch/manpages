XAllocClassHint(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XAllocClassHint(3)



NAME
       XAllocClassHint, XSetClassHint, XGetClassHint, XClassHint - allocate
       class hints structure and set or read a window&apos;s WM_CLASS property

SYNTAX
       XClassHint *XAllocClassHint(void);

       XSetClassHint(Display *display, Window w, XClassHint *class_hints);

       Status XGetClassHint(Display *display, Window w, XClassHint
              *class_hints_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       class_hints
                 Specifies the XClassHint structure that is to be used.

       class_hints_return
                 Returns the XClassHint structure.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocClassHint function allocates and returns a pointer to a
       XClassHint structure.  Note that the pointer fields in the XClassHint
       structure are initially set to NULL.  If insufficient memory is avail&#8208;
       able, XAllocClassHint returns NULL.  To free the memory allocated to this
       structure, use XFree.

       The XSetClassHint function sets the class hint for the specified window.
       If the strings are not in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the
       result is implementation-dependent.

       XSetClassHint can generate BadAlloc and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetClassHint function returns the class hint of the specified window
       to the members of the supplied structure.  If the data returned by the
       server is in the Latin Portable Character Encoding, then the returned
       strings are in the Host Portable Character Encoding.  Otherwise, the
       result is implementation-dependent.  It returns a nonzero status on suc&#8208;
       cess; otherwise, it returns a zero status.  To free res_name and
       res_class when finished with the strings, use XFree on each individually.

       XGetClassHint can generate a BadWindow error.

PROPERTIES
       WM_CLASS  Set by application programs to allow window and session man&#8208;
                 agers to obtain the application&apos;s resources from the resource
                 database.

STRUCTURES
       The XClassHint structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            char *res_name;
            char *res_class;
       } XClassHint;

       The res_name member contains the application name, and the res_class mem&#8208;
       ber contains the application class.  Note that the name set in this prop&#8208;
       erty may differ from the name set as WM_NAME.  That is, WM_NAME specifies
       what should be displayed in the title bar and, therefore, can contain
       temporal information (for example, the name of a file currently in an
       editor&apos;s buffer).  On the other hand, the name specified as part of
       WM_CLASS is the formal name of the application that should be used when
       retrieving the application&apos;s resources from the resource database.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
