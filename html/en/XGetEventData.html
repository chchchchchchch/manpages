XGetEventData(3)                 XLIB FUNCTIONS                 XGetEventData(3)



NAME
       XGetEventData, XFreeEventData, XGenericEventCookie - retrieve and free
       additional event data through cookies.

SYNTAX
       Bool XGetEventData(Display *display, XGenericEventCookie *cookie);

       void XFreeEventData(Display *display, XGenericEventCookie *cookie);



ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       cookie    Specifies the cookie to free or retrieve the data for.


STRUCTURES
       typedef struct {
            int type;
            unsigned long serial;
            Bool send_event;
            Display *display;
            int extension;
            int evtype;
            unsigned int cookie;
            void *data;
       } XGenericEventCookie;


DESCRIPTION
       Some extension XGenericEvents require additional memory to store informa&#8208;
       tion.  For these events, the library returns a XGenericEventCookie with a
       token (&apos;cookie&apos;) unique to this event. The XGenericEventCookie&apos;s data
       pointer is undefined until XGetEventData is called.

       The XGetEventData function retrieves this extra data for the given
       cookie. No round-trip to the server is required. If the cookie is invalid
       or the event is not an event handled by cookie handlers, False is
       returned. If XGetEventData returns True, the cookie&apos;s data pointer points
       to the memory containing the event information. A client must call
       XFreeEventData to free this memory.  XGetEventData returns False for mul&#8208;
       tiple calls for the same event cookie.

       The XFreeEventData function frees the data associated with a cookie. A
       client must call XFreeEventData for each cookie claimed with XGetEvent&#8208;
       Data.


EXAMPLE CODE
       XEvent event;
       XGenericEventCookie *cookie = &amp;ev;

       XNextEvent(display, &amp;event);
       if (XGetEventData(display, cookie)) {
           handle_cookie_event(cookie-&gt;data);
       } else
           handle_event(&amp;event);
       }
       XFreeEventData(display, cookie);
&#12;NOTES
       A cookie is defined as unclaimed if it has been returned to the client
       through XNextEvent but its data has not been retrieved via XGetEventData.
       Subsequent calls to XNextEvent may free memory associated with unclaimed
       cookies.  Multi-threaded X clients must ensure that XGetEventData is
       called before the next call to XNextEvent.
