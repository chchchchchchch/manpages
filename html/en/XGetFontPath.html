XSetFontPath(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XSetFontPath(3)



NAME
       XSetFontPath, XGetFontPath, XFreeFontPath - set, get, or free the font
       search path

SYNTAX
       int XSetFontPath(Display *display, char **directories, int ndirs);

       char **XGetFontPath(Display *display, int *npaths_return);

       int XFreeFontPath(char **list);

ARGUMENTS
       directories
                 Specifies the directory path used to look for a font.  Setting
                 the path to the empty list restores the default path defined
                 for the X server.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       list      Specifies the array of strings you want to free.

       ndirs     Specifies the number of directories in the path.

       npaths_return
                 Returns the number of strings in the font path array.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetFontPath function defines the directory search path for font
       lookup.  There is only one search path per X server, not one per client.
       The encoding and interpretation of the strings are implementation-depen&#8208;
       dent, but typically they specify directories or font servers to be
       searched in the order listed.  An X server is permitted to cache font
       information internally; for example, it might cache an entire font from a
       file and not check on subsequent opens of that font to see if the under&#8208;
       lying font file has changed.  However, when the font path is changed, the
       X server is guaranteed to flush all cached information about fonts for
       which there currently are no explicit resource IDs allocated.  The mean&#8208;
       ing of an error from this request is implementation-dependent.

       XSetFontPath can generate a BadValue error.

       The XGetFontPath function allocates and returns an array of strings con&#8208;
       taining the search path.  The contents of these strings are implementa&#8208;
       tion-dependent and are not intended to be interpreted by client applica&#8208;
       tions.  When it is no longer needed, the data in the font path should be
       freed by using XFreeFontPath.

       The XFreeFontPath function frees the data allocated by XGetFontPath.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
