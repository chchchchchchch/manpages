XGetWindowAttributes(3)          XLIB FUNCTIONS          XGetWindowAttributes(3)



NAME
       XGetWindowAttributes, XGetGeometry, XWindowAttributes - get current win&#8208;
       dow attribute or geometry and current window attributes structure

SYNTAX
       Status XGetWindowAttributes(Display *display, Window w, XWindowAttributes
              *window_attributes_return);

       Status XGetGeometry(Display *display, Drawable d, Window *root_return,
              int *x_return, int *y_return, unsigned int *width_return, unsigned
              int *height_return, unsigned int *border_width_return, unsigned
              int *depth_return);

ARGUMENTS
       border_width_return
                 Returns the border width in pixels.

       d         Specifies the drawable, which can be a window or a pixmap.

       depth_return
                 Returns the depth of the drawable (bits per pixel for the
                 object).

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       root_return
                 Returns the root window.

       w         Specifies the window whose current attributes you want to
                 obtain.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the drawable&apos;s dimensions (width and height).

       window_attributes_return
                 Returns the specified window&apos;s attributes in the XWindowAt&#8208;
                 tributes structure.

       x_return
       y_return  Return the x and y coordinates that define the location of the
                 drawable.  For a window, these coordinates specify the upper-
                 left outer corner relative to its parent&apos;s origin.  For
                 pixmaps, these coordinates are always zero.

DESCRIPTION
       The XGetWindowAttributes function returns the current attributes for the
       specified window to an XWindowAttributes structure.  It returns a nonzero
       status on success; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XGetWindowAttributes can generate BadDrawable and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetGeometry function returns the root window and the current geome&#8208;
       try of the drawable.  The geometry of the drawable includes the x and y
       coordinates, width and height, border width, and depth.  These are
       described in the argument list.  It is legal to pass to this function a
       window whose class is InputOnly.  It returns a nonzero status on success;
       otherwise, it returns a zero status.

STRUCTURES
       The XWindowAttributes structure contains:
&#12;       typedef struct {
            int x, y;                /* location of window */
            int width, height;       /* width and height of window */
            int border_width;        /* border width of window */
            int depth;               /* depth of window */
            Visual *visual;          /* the associated visual structure */
            Window root;             /* root of screen containing window */
            int class;               /* InputOutput, InputOnly*/
            int bit_gravity;         /* one of the bit gravity values */
            int win_gravity;         /* one of the window gravity values */
            int backing_store;       /* NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always */
            unsigned long backing_planes;/* planes to be preserved if possible */
            unsigned long backing_pixel;/* value to be used when restoring planes */
            Bool save_under;         /* boolean, should bits under be saved? */
            Colormap colormap;       /* color map to be associated with window */
            Bool map_installed;      /* boolean, is color map currently installed*/
            int map_state;           /* IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable, IsViewable */
            long all_event_masks;    /* set of events all people have interest in*/
            long your_event_mask;    /* my event mask */
            long do_not_propagate_mask;/* set of events that should not propagate */
            Bool override_redirect;  /* boolean value for override-redirect */
            Screen *screen;          /* back pointer to correct screen */
       } XWindowAttributes;

       The x and y members are set to the upper-left outer corner relative to
       the parent window&apos;s origin.  The width and height members are set to the
       inside size of the window, not including the border.  The border_width
       member is set to the window&apos;s border width in pixels.  The depth member
       is set to the depth of the window (that is, bits per pixel for the
       object).  The visual member is a pointer to the screen&apos;s associated Vis&#8208;
       ual structure.  The root member is set to the root window of the screen
       containing the window.  The class member is set to the window&apos;s class and
       can be either InputOutput or InputOnly.

       The bit_gravity member is set to the window&apos;s bit gravity and can be one
       of the following:

       lw(1.5i) lw(1.5i).  T{ ForgetGravity T}   T{ EastGravity T} T{ NorthWest&#8208;
       Gravity T}   T{ SouthWestGravity T} T{ NorthGravity T}   T{ SouthGravity
       T} T{ NorthEastGravity T}   T{ SouthEastGravity T} T{ WestGravity T}   T{
       StaticGravity T} CenterGravity

       The win_gravity member is set to the window&apos;s window gravity and can be
       one of the following:

       lw(1.5i) lw(1.5i).  T{ UnmapGravity T}   T{ EastGravity T} T{ NorthWest&#8208;
       Gravity T}   T{ SouthWestGravity T} T{ NorthGravity T}   T{ SouthGravity
       T} T{ NorthEastGravity T}   T{ SouthEastGravity T} T{ WestGravity T}   T{
       StaticGravity T} CenterGravity

       For additional information on gravity, see section 3.3.

       The backing_store member is set to indicate how the X server should main&#8208;
       tain the contents of a window and can be WhenMapped, Always, or NotUse&#8208;
       ful.  The backing_planes member is set to indicate (with bits set to 1)
       which bit planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved
       in backing_stores and during save_unders.  The backing_pixel member is
       set to indicate what values to use for planes not set in backing_planes.

       The save_under member is set to True or False.  The colormap member is
       set to the colormap for the specified window and can be a colormap ID or
       None.  The map_installed member is set to indicate whether the colormap
       is currently installed and can be True or False.  The map_state member is
       set to indicate the state of the window and can be IsUnmapped, IsUnview&#8208;
       able, or IsViewable.  IsUnviewable is used if the window is mapped but
       some ancestor is unmapped.

       The all_event_masks member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all
       event masks selected on the window by all clients.  The your_event_mask
       member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event masks selected by
       the querying client.  The do_not_propagate_mask member is set to the bit&#8208;
       wise inclusive OR of the set of events that should not propagate.

       The override_redirect member is set to indicate whether this window over&#8208;
       rides structure control facilities and can be True or False.  Window man&#8208;
       ager clients should ignore the window if this member is True.

       The screen member is set to a screen pointer that gives you a back
       pointer to the correct screen.  This makes it easier to obtain the screen
       information without having to loop over the root window fields to see
       which field matches.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
