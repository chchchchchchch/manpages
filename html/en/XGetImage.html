              mat, XImage *dest_image, int dest_x, dest_y);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       dest_image
                 Specifies the destination image.

       dest_x
       dest_y    Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the drawable and are the coordinates of the subimage or
                 which are relative to the origin of the destination rectangle,
                 specify its upper-left corner, and determine where the subimage
                 is placed in the destination image.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       format    Specifies the format for the image.  You can pass XYPixmap or
                 ZPixmap.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       image     Specifies the image you want combined with the rectangle.

       plane_mask
                 Specifies the plane mask.

       src_x     Specifies the offset in X from the left edge of the image
                 defined by the XImage structure.

       src_y     Specifies the offset in Y from the top edge of the image
                 defined by the XImage structure.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height of the subimage, which define the
                 dimensions of the rectangle.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the ori&#8208;
                 gin of the drawable and define the upper-left corner of the
                 rectangle.

DESCRIPTION
       The XPutImage function combines an image with a rectangle of the speci&#8208;
       fied drawable.  The section of the image defined by the src_x, src_y,
       width, and height arguments is drawn on the specified part of the draw&#8208;
       able.  If XYBitmap format is used, the depth of the image must be one, or
       a BadMatch error results.  The foreground pixel in the GC defines the
       source for the one bits in the image, and the background pixel defines
       the source for the zero bits.  For XYPixmap and ZPixmap, the depth of the
       image must match the depth of the drawable, or a BadMatch error results.

       If the characteristics of the image (for example, byte_order and bit&#8208;
       map_unit) differ from what the server requires, XPutImage automatically
       makes the appropriate conversions.

       This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-
       mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  It also uses these GC
       mode-dependent components: foreground and background.

       XPutImage can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

       The XGetImage function returns a pointer to an XImage structure.  This
       structure provides you with the contents of the specified rectangle of
       the drawable in the format you specify.  If the format argument is XYP&#8208;
       ixmap, the image contains only the bit planes you passed to the
       plane_mask argument.  If the plane_mask argument only requests a subset
       of the planes of the display, the depth of the returned image will be the
       number of planes requested.  If the format argument is ZPixmap, XGetImage
       returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified in the plane_mask
       argument.  The function performs no range checking on the values in
       plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits.

       XGetImage returns the depth of the image to the depth member of the XIm&#8208;
       age structure.  The depth of the image is as specified when the drawable
       was created, except when getting a subset of the planes in XYPixmap for&#8208;
       mat, when the depth is given by the number of bits set to 1 in
       plane_mask.

       If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly contained
       within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error results.  If the drawable is a
       window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the case that if
       there were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle
       of the window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained
       within the outside edges of the window, or a BadMatch error results.
       Note that the borders of the window can be included and read with this
       request.  If the window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are
       returned for regions of the window that are obscured by noninferior win&#8208;
       dows.  If the window does not have backing-store, the returned contents
       of such obscured regions are undefined.  The returned contents of visible
       regions of inferiors of a different depth than the specified window&apos;s
       depth are also undefined.  The pointer cursor image is not included in
       the returned contents.  If a problem occurs, XGetImage returns NULL.

       XGetImage can generate BadDrawable, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

       The XGetSubImage function updates dest_image with the specified subimage
       in the same manner as XGetImage.  If the format argument is XYPixmap, the
       image contains only the bit planes you passed to the plane_mask argument.
       If the format argument is ZPixmap, XGetSubImage returns as zero the bits
       in all planes not specified in the plane_mask argument.  The function
       performs no range checking on the values in plane_mask and ignores extra&#8208;
       neous bits.  As a convenience, XGetSubImage returns a pointer to the same
       XImage structure specified by dest_image.

       The depth of the destination XImage structure must be the same as that of
       the drawable.  If the specified subimage does not fit at the specified
       location on the destination image, the right and bottom edges are
       clipped.  If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly
       contained within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error results.  If the draw&#8208;
       able is a window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the case
       that if there were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified
       rectangle of the window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly
       contained within the outside edges of the window, or a BadMatch error
       results.  If the window has backing-store, then the backing-store con&#8208;
       tents are returned for regions of the window that are obscured by nonin&#8208;
       ferior windows.  If the window does not have backing-store, the returned
       contents of such obscured regions are undefined.  The returned contents
       of visible regions of inferiors of a different depth than the specified
       window&apos;s depth are also undefined.  If a problem occurs, XGetSubImage
       returns NULL.

       XGetSubImage can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
