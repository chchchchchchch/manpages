XSetInputFocus(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XSetInputFocus(3)



NAME
       XSetInputFocus, XGetInputFocus - control input focus

SYNTAX
       int XSetInputFocus(Display *display, Window focus, int revert_to, Time
              time);

       int XGetInputFocus(Display *display, Window *focus_return, int
              *revert_to_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       focus     Specifies the window, PointerRoot, or None.

       focus_return
                 Returns the focus window, PointerRoot, or None.

       revert_to Specifies where the input focus reverts to if the window
                 becomes not viewable.  You can pass RevertToParent, RevertTo&#8208;
                 PointerRoot, or RevertToNone.

       revert_to_return
                 Returns the current focus state (RevertToParent, RevertToPoint&#8208;
                 erRoot, or RevertToNone).

       time      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or Cur&#8208;
                 rentTime.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetInputFocus function changes the input focus and the last-focus-
       change time.  It has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the
       current last-focus-change time or is later than the current X server
       time.  Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the specified time
       (CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server time).  XSetInputFocus
       causes the X server to generate FocusIn and FocusOut events.

       Depending on the focus argument, the following occurs:

       &#183;    If focus is None, all keyboard events are discarded until a new
            focus window is set, and the revert_to argument is ignored.

       &#183;    If focus is a window, it becomes the keyboard&apos;s focus window.  If a
            generated keyboard event would normally be reported to this window
            or one of its inferiors, the event is reported as usual.  Otherwise,
            the event is reported relative to the focus window.

       &#183;    If focus is PointerRoot, the focus window is dynamically taken to be
            the root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each key&#8208;
            board event.  In this case, the revert_to argument is ignored.

       The specified focus window must be viewable at the time XSetInputFocus is
       called, or a BadMatch error results.  If the focus window later becomes
       not viewable, the X server evaluates the revert_to argument to determine
       the new focus window as follows:

       &#183;    If revert_to is RevertToParent, the focus reverts to the parent (or
            the closest viewable ancestor), and the new revert_to value is taken
            to be RevertToNone.

       &#183;    If revert_to is RevertToPointerRoot or RevertToNone, the focus
            reverts to PointerRoot or None, respectively.  When the focus
            reverts, the X server generates FocusIn and FocusOut events, but the
            last-focus-change time is not affected.

       XSetInputFocus can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetInputFocus function returns the focus window and the current
       focus state.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
