XChangeKeyboardControl(3)        XLIB FUNCTIONS        XChangeKeyboardControl(3)



NAME
       XChangeKeyboardControl, XGetKeyboardControl, XAutoRepeatOn, XAutoRe&#8208;
       peatOff, XBell, XQueryKeymap, XKeyboardControl - manipulate keyboard set&#8208;
       tings and keyboard control structure

SYNTAX
       int XChangeKeyboardControl(Display *display, unsigned long value_mask,
              XKeyboardControl *values);

       int XGetKeyboardControl(Display *display, XKeyboardState *values_return);

       int XAutoRepeatOn(Display *display);

       int XAutoRepeatOff(Display *display);

       int XBell(Display *display, int percent);

       int XQueryKeymap(Display *display, char keys_return[32]);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       keys_return
                 Returns an array of bytes that identifies which keys are
                 pressed down.  Each bit represents one key of the keyboard.

       percent   Specifies the volume for the bell, which can range from -100 to
                 100 inclusive.

       value_mask
                 Specifies which controls to change.  This mask is the bitwise
                 inclusive OR of the valid control mask bits.

       values    Specifies one value for each bit set to 1 in the mask.

       values_return
                 Returns the current keyboard controls in the specified XKey&#8208;
                 boardState structure.

DESCRIPTION
       The XChangeKeyboardControl function controls the keyboard characteristics
       defined by the XKeyboardControl structure.  The value_mask argument spec&#8208;
       ifies which values are to be changed.

       XChangeKeyboardControl can generate BadMatch and BadValue errors.

       The XGetKeyboardControl function returns the current control values for
       the keyboard to the XKeyboardState structure.

       The XAutoRepeatOn function turns on auto-repeat for the keyboard on the
       specified display.

       The XAutoRepeatOff function turns off auto-repeat for the keyboard on the
       specified display.

       The XBell function rings the bell on the keyboard on the specified dis&#8208;
       play, if possible.  The specified volume is relative to the base volume
       for the keyboard.  If the value for the percent argument is not in the
       range -100 to 100 inclusive, a BadValue error results.  The volume at
       which the bell rings when the percent argument is nonnegative is:

              base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent
&#12;       The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument is negative
       is:

              base + [(base * percent) / 100]

       To change the base volume of the bell, use XChangeKeyboardControl.

       XBell can generate a BadValue error.

       The XQueryKeymap function returns a bit vector for the logical state of
       the keyboard, where each bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding
       key is currently pressed down.  The vector is represented as 32 bytes.
       Byte N (from 0) contains the bits for keys 8N to 8N + 7 with the least
       significant bit in the byte representing key 8N.

       Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications)
       may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.

STRUCTURES
       The XKeyboardControl structure contains:

       /* Mask bits for ChangeKeyboardControl */

       lw(.5i) lw(2.5i) lw(.8i).  T{ #define T}   T{ KBKeyClickPercent T}   T{
       (1L&lt;&lt;0) T} T{ #define T}   T{ KBBellPercent T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;1) T} T{ #define
       T}   T{ KBBellPitch T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;2) T} T{ #define T}   T{ KBBellDuration
       T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;3) T} T{ #define T}   T{ KBLed T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;4) T} T{ #define
       T}   T{ KBLedMode T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;5) T} T{ #define T}   T{ KBKey T}   T{
       (1L&lt;&lt;6) T} T{ #define T}   T{ KBAutoRepeatMode T}   T{ (1L&lt;&lt;7) T}
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
            int key_click_percent;
            int bell_percent;
            int bell_pitch;
            int bell_duration;
            int led;
            int led_mode;       /* LedModeOn, LedModeOff */
            int key;
            int auto_repeat_mode;/* AutoRepeatModeOff, AutoRepeatModeOn,
                                   AutoRepeatModeDefault */
       } XKeyboardControl;

       The key_click_percent member sets the volume for key clicks between 0
       (off) and 100 (loud) inclusive, if possible.  A setting of -1 restores
       the default.  Other negative values generate a BadValue error.

       The bell_percent sets the base volume for the bell between 0 (off) and
       100 (loud) inclusive, if possible.  A setting of -1 restores the default.
       Other negative values generate a BadValue error.  The bell_pitch member
       sets the pitch (specified in Hz) of the bell, if possible.  A setting of
       -1 restores the default.  Other negative values generate a BadValue
       error.  The bell_duration member sets the duration of the bell specified
       in milliseconds, if possible.  A setting of -1 restores the default.
       Other negative values generate a BadValue error.

       If both the led_mode and led members are specified, the state of that LED
       is changed, if possible.  The led_mode member can be set to LedModeOn or
       LedModeOff.  If only led_mode is specified, the state of all LEDs are
       changed, if possible.  At most 32 LEDs numbered from one are supported.
       No standard interpretation of LEDs is defined.  If led is specified with&#8208;
       out led_mode, a BadMatch error results.

       If both the auto_repeat_mode and key members are specified, the
       auto_repeat_mode of that key is changed (according to AutoRepeatModeOn,
       AutoRepeatModeOff, or AutoRepeatModeDefault), if possible.  If only
       auto_repeat_mode is specified, the global auto_repeat_mode for the entire
       keyboard is changed, if possible, and does not affect the per-key set&#8208;
       tings.  If a key is specified without an auto_repeat_mode, a BadMatch
       error results.  Each key has an individual mode of whether or not it
       should auto-repeat and a default setting for the mode.  In addition,
       there is a global mode of whether auto-repeat should be enabled or not
       and a default setting for that mode.  When global mode is AutoRepeatMod&#8208;
       eOn, keys should obey their individual auto-repeat modes.  When global
       mode is AutoRepeatModeOff, no keys should auto-repeat.  An auto-repeating
       key generates alternating KeyPress and KeyRelease events.  When a key is
       used as a modifier, it is desirable for the key not to auto-repeat,
       regardless of its auto-repeat setting.

       The XKeyboardState structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            int key_click_percent;
            int bell_percent;
            unsigned int bell_pitch, bell_duration;
            unsigned long led_mask;
            int global_auto_repeat;
            char auto_repeats[32];
       } XKeyboardState;

       For the LEDs, the least significant bit of led_mask corresponds to LED
       one, and each bit set to 1 in led_mask indicates an LED that is lit.  The
       global_auto_repeat member can be set to AutoRepeatModeOn or AutoRepeat&#8208;
       ModeOff.  The auto_repeats member is a bit vector.  Each bit set to 1
       indicates that auto-repeat is enabled for the corresponding key.  The
       vector is represented as 32 bytes.  Byte N (from 0) contains the bits for
       keys 8N to 8N + 7 with the least significant bit in the byte representing
       key 8N.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
