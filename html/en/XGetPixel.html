              depth, int format, int offset, char *data, unsigned int width,
              unsigned int height, int bitmap_pad, int bytes_per_line);

       unsigned long XGetPixel(XImage *ximage, int x, int y);

       int XPutPixel(XImage *ximage, int x, int y, unsigned long pixel);

       XImage *XSubImage(XImage *ximage, int x, int y, unsigned int subim&#8208;
              age_width, unsigned int subimage_height);

       int XAddPixel(XImage *ximage, long value);

       int XDestroyImage(XImage *ximage);

ARGUMENTS
       bitmap_pad
                 Specifies the quantum of a scanline (8, 16, or 32).  In other
                 words, the start of one scanline is separated in client memory
                 from the start of the next scanline by an integer multiple of
                 this many bits.

       bytes_per_line
                 Specifies the number of bytes in the client image between the
                 start of one scanline and the start of the next.

       data      Specifies the image data.

       depth     Specifies the depth of the image.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       format    Specifies the format for the image.  You can pass XYBitmap,
                 XYPixmap, or ZPixmap.

       height    Specifies the height of the image, in pixels.

       offset    Specifies the number of pixels to ignore at the beginning of
                 the scanline.

       pixel     Specifies the new pixel value.

       subimage_height
                 Specifies the height of the new subimage, in pixels.

       subimage_width
                 Specifies the width of the new subimage, in pixels.

       value     Specifies the constant value that is to be added.

       visual    Specifies the Visual structure.

       width     Specifies the width of the image, in pixels.

       ximage    Specifies the image.
&#12;       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates.

DESCRIPTION
       The XInitImage function initializes the internal image manipulation rou&#8208;
       tines of an image structure, based on the values of the various structure
       members.  All fields other than the manipulation routines must already be
       initialized.  If the bytes_per_line member is zero, XInitImage will
       assume the image data is contiguous in memory and set the bytes_per_line
       member to an appropriate value based on the other members; otherwise, the
       value of bytes_per_line is not changed.  All of the manipulation routines
       are initialized to functions that other Xlib image manipulation functions
       need to operate on the type of image specified by the rest of the struc&#8208;
       ture.

       This function must be called for any image constructed by the client
       before passing it to any other Xlib function.  Image structures created
       or returned by Xlib do not need to be initialized in this fashion.

       This function returns a nonzero status if initialization of the structure
       is successful.  It returns zero if it detected some error or inconsis&#8208;
       tency in the structure, in which case the image is not changed.

       The XCreateImage function allocates the memory needed for an XImage
       structure for the specified display but does not allocate space for the
       image itself.  Rather, it initializes the structure byte-order, bit-
       order, and bitmap-unit values from the display and returns a pointer to
       the XImage structure.  The red, green, and blue mask values are defined
       for Z format images only and are derived from the Visual structure passed
       in.  Other values also are passed in.  The offset permits the rapid dis&#8208;
       playing of the image without requiring each scanline to be shifted into
       position.  If you pass a zero value in bytes_per_line, Xlib assumes that
       the scanlines are contiguous in memory and calculates the value of
       bytes_per_line itself.

       Note that when the image is created using XCreateImage, XGetImage, or
       XSubImage, the destroy procedure that the XDestroyImage function calls
       frees both the image structure and the data pointed to by the image
       structure.

       The basic functions used to get a pixel, set a pixel, create a subimage,
       and add a constant value to an image are defined in the image object.
       The functions in this section are really macro invocations of the func&#8208;
       tions in the image object and are defined in &lt;X11/Xutil.h&gt;.

       The XGetPixel function returns the specified pixel from the named image.
       The pixel value is returned in normalized format (that is, the least sig&#8208;
       nificant byte of the long is the least significant byte of the pixel).
       The image must contain the x and y coordinates.

       The XPutPixel function overwrites the pixel in the named image with the
       specified pixel value.  The input pixel value must be in normalized for&#8208;
       mat (that is, the least significant byte of the long is the least signif&#8208;
       icant byte of the pixel).  The image must contain the x and y coordi&#8208;
       nates.

       The XSubImage function creates a new image that is a subsection of an
       existing one.  It allocates the memory necessary for the new XImage
       structure and returns a pointer to the new image.  The data is copied
       from the source image, and the image must contain the rectangle defined
       by x, y, subimage_width, and subimage_height.

       The XAddPixel function adds a constant value to every pixel in an image.
       It is useful when you have a base pixel value from allocating color
       resources and need to manipulate the image to that form.

       The XDestroyImage function deallocates the memory associated with the
       XImage structure.
