XAllocWMHints(3)                 XLIB FUNCTIONS                 XAllocWMHints(3)



NAME
       XAllocWMHints, XSetWMHints, XGetWMHints, XWMHints - allocate window man&#8208;
       ager hints structure and set or read a window&apos;s WM_HINTS property

SYNTAX
       XWMHints *XAllocWMHints(void);

       int XSetWMHints(Display *display, Window w, XWMHints *wmhints);

       XWMHints *XGetWMHints(Display *display, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       w         Specifies the window.

       wmhints   Specifies the XWMHints structure to be used.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocWMHints function allocates and returns a pointer to a XWMHints
       structure.  Note that all fields in the XWMHints structure are initially
       set to zero.  If insufficient memory is available, XAllocWMHints returns
       NULL.  To free the memory allocated to this structure, use XFree.

       The XSetWMHints function sets the window manager hints that include icon
       information and location, the initial state of the window, and whether
       the application relies on the window manager to get keyboard input.

       XSetWMHints can generate BadAlloc and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetWMHints function reads the window manager hints and returns NULL
       if no WM_HINTS property was set on the window or returns a pointer to a
       XWMHints structure if it succeeds.  When finished with the data, free the
       space used for it by calling XFree.

       XGetWMHints can generate a BadWindow error.

PROPERTIES
       WM_HINTS  Additional hints set by the client for use by the window man&#8208;
                 ager.  The C type of this property is XWMHints.

STRUCTURES
       The XWMHints structure contains:

       /* Window manager hints mask bits */

       lw(.5i) lw(2.5i) lw(2.5i).  T{ #define T}   T{ InputHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt;
       0) T} T{ #define T}   T{ StateHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 1) T} T{ #define
       T}   T{ IconPixmapHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 2) T} T{ #define T}   T{ IconWin&#8208;
       dowHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 3) T} T{ #define T}   T{ IconPositionHint T}   T{
       (1L &lt;&lt; 4) T} T{ #define T}   T{ IconMaskHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 5) T} T{
       #define T}   T{ WindowGroupHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 6) T} T{ #define T}   T{
       XUrgencyHint T}   T{ (1L &lt;&lt; 8) T} T{ #define T}   T{ AllHints T}   T{
       (InputHint|StateHint|IconPixmapHint|
       IconWindowHint|IconPositionHint|
       IconMaskHint|WindowGroupHint) T}
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
            long flags;         /* marks which fields in this structure are defined */
            Bool input;         /* does this application rely on the window manager to
                                get keyboard input? */
            int initial_state;  /* see below */
            Pixmap icon_pixmap; /* pixmap to be used as icon */
            Window icon_window; /* window to be used as icon */
            int icon_x, icon_y; /* initial position of icon */
            Pixmap icon_mask;   /* pixmap to be used as mask for icon_pixmap */
            XID window_group;   /* id of related window group */
            /* this structure may be extended in the future */
       } XWMHints;

       The input member is used to communicate to the window manager the input
       focus model used by the application.  Applications that expect input but
       never explicitly set focus to any of their subwindows (that is, use the
       push model of focus management), such as X Version 10 style applications
       that use real-estate driven focus, should set this member to True.  Simi&#8208;
       larly, applications that set input focus to their subwindows only when it
       is given to their top-level window by a window manager should also set
       this member to True.  Applications that manage their own input focus by
       explicitly setting focus to one of their subwindows whenever they want
       keyboard input (that is, use the pull model of focus management) should
       set this member to False.  Applications that never expect any keyboard
       input also should set this member to False.

       Pull model window managers should make it possible for push model appli&#8208;
       cations to get input by setting input focus to the top-level windows of
       applications whose input member is True.  Push model window managers
       should make sure that pull model applications do not break them by reset&#8208;
       ting input focus to PointerRoot when it is appropriate (for example,
       whenever an application whose input member is False sets input focus to
       one of its subwindows).

       The definitions for the initial_state flag are:

       lw(.5i) lw(2i) lw(.2i) lw(2.8i).  T{ #define T}   T{ WithdrawnState
       T}   T{ 0 T}   T{ T} T{ #define T}   T{ NormalState T}   T{ 1 T}   T{ /*
       most applications start this way */ T} T{ #define T}   T{ IconicState
       T}   T{ 3 T}   T{ /* application wants to start as an icon */ T} The
       icon_mask specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap should be used as the
       icon.  This allows for nonrectangular icons.  Both icon_pixmap and
       icon_mask must be bitmaps.  The icon_window lets an application provide a
       window for use as an icon for window managers that support such use.  The
       window_group lets you specify that this window belongs to a group of
       other windows.  For example, if a single application manipulates multiple
       top-level windows, this allows you to provide enough information that a
       window manager can iconify all of the windows rather than just the one
       window.

       The UrgencyHint flag, if set in the flags field, indicates that the
       client deems the window contents to be urgent, requiring the timely
       response of the user.  The window manager will make some effort to draw
       the user&apos;s attention to this window while this flag is set.  The client
       must provide some means by which the user can cause the urgency flag to
       be cleared (either mitigating the condition that made the window urgent
       or merely shutting off the alarm) or the window to be withdrawn.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
