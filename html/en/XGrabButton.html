XGrabButton(3)                   XLIB FUNCTIONS                   XGrabButton(3)



NAME
       XGrabButton, XUngrabButton - grab pointer buttons

SYNTAX
       int XGrabButton(Display *display, unsigned int button, unsigned int modi&#8208;
              fiers, Window grab_window, Bool owner_events, unsigned int
              event_mask, int pointer_mode, keyboard_mode, Window confine_to,
              Cursor cursor);

       int XUngrabButton(Display *display, unsigned int button, unsigned int
              modifiers, Window grab_window);

ARGUMENTS
       button    Specifies the pointer button that is to be grabbed or released
                 or AnyButton.

       confine_to
                 Specifies the window to confine the pointer in or None.

       cursor    Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or None.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_mask
                 Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.  The
                 mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid pointer event
                 mask bits.

       grab_window
                 Specifies the grab window.

       keyboard_mode
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

       modifiers Specifies the set of keymasks or AnyModifier.  The mask is the
                 bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.

       owner_events
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the pointer
                 events are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to
                 the grab window if selected by the event mask.

       pointer_mode
                 Specifies further processing of pointer events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

DESCRIPTION
       The XGrabButton function establishes a passive grab.  In the future, the
       pointer is actively grabbed (as for XGrabPointer), the last-pointer-grab
       time is set to the time at which the button was pressed (as transmitted
       in the ButtonPress event), and the ButtonPress event is reported if all
       of the following conditions are true:

       &#183;    The pointer is not grabbed, and the specified button is logically
            pressed when the specified modifier keys are logically down, and no
            other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.

       &#183;    The grab_window contains the pointer.

       &#183;    The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.
&#12;       &#183;    A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist on
            any ancestor of grab_window.

       The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for XGrabPointer.
       The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
       pointer has all buttons released (independent of the state of the logical
       modifier keys), at which point a ButtonRelease event is reported to the
       grabbing window.

       Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications)
       may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.

       This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same
       button/key combinations on the same window.  A modifiers of AnyModifier
       is equivalent to issuing the grab request for all possible modifier com&#8208;
       binations (including the combination of no modifiers).  It is not
       required that all modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes.
       A button of AnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request for all possi&#8208;
       ble buttons.  Otherwise, it is not required that the specified button
       currently be assigned to a physical button.

       If some other client has already issued a XGrabButton with the same but&#8208;
       ton/key combination on the same window, a BadAccess error results.  When
       using AnyModifier or AnyButton, the request fails completely, and a
       BadAccess error results (no grabs are established) if there is a con&#8208;
       flicting grab for any combination.  XGrabButton has no effect on an
       active grab.

       XGrabButton can generate BadCursor, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XUngrabButton function releases the passive button/key combination on
       the specified window if it was grabbed by this client.  A modifiers of
       AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the ungrab request for all possible
       modifier combinations, including the combination of no modifiers.  A but&#8208;
       ton of AnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible
       buttons.  XUngrabButton has no effect on an active grab.

       XUngrabButton can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
