XGrabKeyboard(3)                 XLIB FUNCTIONS                 XGrabKeyboard(3)



NAME
       XGrabKeyboard, XUngrabKeyboard - grab the keyboard

SYNTAX
       int XGrabKeyboard(Display *display, Window grab_window, Bool
              owner_events, int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Time time);

       int XUngrabKeyboard(Display *display, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       grab_window
                 Specifies the grab window.

       keyboard_mode
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

       owner_events
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the keyboard
                 events are to be reported as usual.

       pointer_mode
                 Specifies further processing of pointer events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

       time      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or Cur&#8208;
                 rentTime.

DESCRIPTION
       The XGrabKeyboard function actively grabs control of the keyboard and
       generates FocusIn and FocusOut events.  Further key events are reported
       only to the grabbing client.  XGrabKeyboard overrides any active keyboard
       grab by this client.  If owner_events is False, all generated key events
       are reported with respect to grab_window.  If owner_events is True and if
       a generated key event would normally be reported to this client, it is
       reported normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the
       grab_window.  Both KeyPress and KeyRelease events are always reported,
       independent of any event selection made by the client.

       If the keyboard_mode argument is GrabModeAsync, keyboard event processing
       continues as usual.  If the keyboard is currently frozen by this client,
       then processing of keyboard events is resumed.  If the keyboard_mode
       argument is GrabModeSync, the state of the keyboard (as seen by client
       applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further
       keyboard events until the grabbing client issues a releasing XAllowEvents
       call or until the keyboard grab is released.  Actual keyboard changes are
       not lost while the keyboard is frozen; they are simply queued in the
       server for later processing.

       If pointer_mode is GrabModeAsync, pointer event processing is unaffected
       by activation of the grab.  If pointer_mode is GrabModeSync, the state of
       the pointer (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze, and the X
       server generates no further pointer events until the grabbing client
       issues a releasing XAllowEvents call or until the keyboard grab is
       released.  Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is
       frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client, XGrabKeyboard
       fails and returns AlreadyGrabbed.  If grab_window is not viewable, it
       fails and returns GrabNotViewable.  If the keyboard is frozen by an
       active grab of another client, it fails and returns GrabFrozen.  If the
       specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time or later than
       the current X server time, it fails and returns GrabInvalidTime.  Other&#8208;
       wise, the last-keyboard-grab time is set to the specified time (Current&#8208;
       Time is replaced by the current X server time).

       XGrabKeyboard can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

       The XUngrabKeyboard function releases the keyboard and any queued events
       if this client has it actively grabbed from either XGrabKeyboard or
       XGrabKey.  XUngrabKeyboard does not release the keyboard and any queued
       events if the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time
       or is later than the current X server time.  It also generates FocusIn
       and FocusOut events.  The X server automatically performs an UngrabKey&#8208;
       board request if the event window for an active keyboard grab becomes not
       viewable.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
