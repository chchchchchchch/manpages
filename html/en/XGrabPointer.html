XGrabPointer(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XGrabPointer(3)



NAME
       XGrabPointer, XUngrabPointer, XChangeActivePointerGrab - grab the pointer

SYNTAX
       int XGrabPointer(Display *display, Window grab_window, Bool owner_events,
              unsigned int event_mask, int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Win&#8208;
              dow confine_to, Cursor cursor, Time time);

       int XUngrabPointer(Display *display, Time time);

       int XChangeActivePointerGrab(Display *display, unsigned int event_mask,
              Cursor cursor, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       confine_to
                 Specifies the window to confine the pointer in or None.

       cursor    Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed during the grab or
                 None.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_mask
                 Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.  The
                 mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid pointer event
                 mask bits.

       grab_window
                 Specifies the grab window.

       keyboard_mode
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

       owner_events
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the pointer
                 events are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to
                 the grab window if selected by the event mask.

       pointer_mode
                 Specifies further processing of pointer events.  You can pass
                 GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

       time      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or Cur&#8208;
                 rentTime.

DESCRIPTION
       The XGrabPointer function actively grabs control of the pointer and
       returns GrabSuccess if the grab was successful.  Further pointer events
       are reported only to the grabbing client.  XGrabPointer overrides any
       active pointer grab by this client.  If owner_events is False, all gener&#8208;
       ated pointer events are reported with respect to grab_window and are
       reported only if selected by event_mask.  If owner_events is True and if
       a generated pointer event would normally be reported to this client, it
       is reported as usual.  Otherwise, the event is reported with respect to
       the grab_window and is reported only if selected by event_mask.  For
       either value of owner_events, unreported events are discarded.

       If the pointer_mode is GrabModeAsync, pointer event processing continues
       as usual.  If the pointer is currently frozen by this client, the pro&#8208;
       cessing of events for the pointer is resumed.  If the pointer_mode is
       GrabModeSync, the state of the pointer, as seen by client applications,
       appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further pointer events
       until the grabbing client calls XAllowEvents or until the pointer grab is
       released.  Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is
       frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If the keyboard_mode is GrabModeAsync, keyboard event processing is unaf&#8208;
       fected by activation of the grab.  If the keyboard_mode is GrabModeSync,
       the state of the keyboard, as seen by client applications, appears to
       freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events until the
       grabbing client calls XAllowEvents or until the pointer grab is released.
       Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; they
       are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If a cursor is specified, it is displayed regardless of what window the
       pointer is in.  If None is specified, the normal cursor for that window
       is displayed when the pointer is in grab_window or one of its subwindows;
       otherwise, the cursor for grab_window is displayed.

       If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer is restricted to stay
       contained in that window.  The confine_to window need have no relation&#8208;
       ship to the grab_window.  If the pointer is not initially in the con&#8208;
       fine_to window, it is warped automatically to the closest edge just
       before the grab activates and enter/leave events are generated as usual.
       If the confine_to window is subsequently reconfigured, the pointer is
       warped automatically, as necessary, to keep it contained in the window.

       The time argument allows you to avoid certain circumstances that come up
       if applications take a long time to respond or if there are long network
       delays.  Consider a situation where you have two applications, both of
       which normally grab the pointer when clicked on.  If both applications
       specify the timestamp from the event, the second application may wake up
       faster and successfully grab the pointer before the first application.
       The first application then will get an indication that the other applica&#8208;
       tion grabbed the pointer before its request was processed.

       XGrabPointer generates EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events.

       Either if grab_window or confine_to window is not viewable or if the con&#8208;
       fine_to window lies completely outside the boundaries of the root window,
       XGrabPointer fails and returns GrabNotViewable.  If the pointer is
       actively grabbed by some other client, it fails and returns Already&#8208;
       Grabbed.  If the pointer is frozen by an active grab of another client,
       it fails and returns GrabFrozen.  If the specified time is earlier than
       the last-pointer-grab time or later than the current X server time, it
       fails and returns GrabInvalidTime.  Otherwise, the last-pointer-grab time
       is set to the specified time (CurrentTime is replaced by the current X
       server time).

       XGrabPointer can generate BadCursor, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XUngrabPointer function releases the pointer and any queued events if
       this client has actively grabbed the pointer from XGrabPointer, XGrabBut&#8208;
       ton, or from a normal button press.  XUngrabPointer does not release the
       pointer if the specified time is earlier than the last-pointer-grab time
       or is later than the current X server time.  It also generates Enter&#8208;
       Notify and LeaveNotify events.  The X server performs an UngrabPointer
       request automatically if the event window or confine_to window for an
       active pointer grab becomes not viewable or if window reconfiguration
       causes the confine_to window to lie completely outside the boundaries of
       the root window.

       The XChangeActivePointerGrab function changes the specified dynamic
       parameters if the pointer is actively grabbed by the client and if the
       specified time is no earlier than the last-pointer-grab time and no later
       than the current X server time.  This function has no effect on the pas&#8208;
       sive parameters of a XGrabButton.  The interpretation of event_mask and
       cursor is the same as described in XGrabPointer.

       XChangeActivePointerGrab can generate a BadCursor and BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
