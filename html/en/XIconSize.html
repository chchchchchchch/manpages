XAllocIconSize(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XAllocIconSize(3)



NAME
       XAllocIconSize, XSetIconSizes, XGetIconSizes, XIconSize - allocate icon
       size structure and set or read a window&apos;s WM_ICON_SIZES property

SYNTAX
       XIconSize *XAllocIconSize(void);

       int XSetIconSizes(Display *display, Window w, XIconSize *size_list, int
       count);

       Status XGetIconSizes(Display *display, Window w, XIconSize
       **size_list_return, int count_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       count     Specifies the number of items in the size list.

       count_return
                 Returns the number of items in the size list.

       size_list Specifies the size list.

       size_list_return
                 Returns the size list.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAllocIconSize function allocates and returns a pointer to a XIcon&#8208;
       Size structure.  Note that all fields in the XIconSize structure are ini&#8208;
       tially set to zero.  If insufficient memory is available, XAllocIconSize
       returns NULL.  To free the memory allocated to this structure, use XFree.

       The XSetIconSizes function is used only by window managers to set the
       supported icon sizes.

       XSetIconSizes can generate BadAlloc and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetIconSizes function returns zero if a window manager has not set
       icon sizes; otherwise, it return nonzero.  XGetIconSizes should be called
       by an application that wants to find out what icon sizes would be most
       appreciated by the window manager under which the application is running.
       The application should then use XSetWMHints to supply the window manager
       with an icon pixmap or window in one of the supported sizes.  To free the
       data allocated in size_list_return, use XFree.

       XGetIconSizes can generate a BadWindow error.

PROPERTIES
       WM_ICON_SIZES
                 The window manager may set this property on the root window to
                 specify the icon sizes it supports.  The C type of this prop&#8208;
                 erty is XIconSize.

STRUCTURES
       The XIconSize structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            int min_width, min_height;
            int max_width, max_height;
            int width_inc, height_inc;
       } XIconSize;

       The width_inc and height_inc members define an arithmetic progression of
       sizes (minimum to maximum) that represent the supported icon sizes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
