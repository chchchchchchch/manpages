XIconifyWindow(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XIconifyWindow(3)



NAME
       XIconifyWindow, XWithdrawWindow, XReconfigureWMWindow - manipulate top-
       level windows

SYNTAX
       Status XIconifyWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_number);

       Status XWithdrawWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_number);

       Status XReconfigureWMWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_num&#8208;
              ber, unsigned int value_mask, XWindowChanges *values);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       screen_number
                 Specifies the appropriate screen number on the host server.

       value_mask
                 Specifies which values are to be set using information in the
                 values structure.  This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
                 valid configure window values bits.

       values    Specifies the XWindowChanges structure.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XIconifyWindow function sends a WM_CHANGE_STATE ClientMessage event
       with a format of 32 and a first data element of IconicState (as described
       in section 4.1.4 of the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual)
       and a window of w to the root window of the specified screen with an
       event mask set to SubstructureNotifyMask| SubstructureRedirectMask.  Win&#8208;
       dow managers may elect to receive this message and if the window is in
       its normal state, may treat it as a request to change the window&apos;s state
       from normal to iconic.  If the WM_CHANGE_STATE property cannot be
       interned, XIconifyWindow does not send a message and returns a zero sta&#8208;
       tus.  It returns a nonzero status if the client message is sent success&#8208;
       fully; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       The XWithdrawWindow function unmaps the specified window and sends a syn&#8208;
       thetic UnmapNotify event to the root window of the specified screen.
       Window managers may elect to receive this message and may treat it as a
       request to change the window&apos;s state to withdrawn.  When a window is in
       the withdrawn state, neither its normal nor its iconic representations is
       visible.  It returns a nonzero status if the UnmapNotify event is suc&#8208;
       cessfully sent; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XWithdrawWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XReconfigureWMWindow function issues a ConfigureWindow request on the
       specified top-level window.  If the stacking mode is changed and the
       request fails with a BadMatch error, the error is trapped by Xlib and a
       synthetic ConfigureRequestEvent containing the same configuration parame&#8208;
       ters is sent to the root of the specified window.  Window managers may
       elect to receive this event and treat it as a request to reconfigure the
       indicated window.  It returns a nonzero status if the request or event is
       successfully sent; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XReconfigureWMWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
