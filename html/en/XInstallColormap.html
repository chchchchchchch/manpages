XInstallColormap(3)              XLIB FUNCTIONS              XInstallColormap(3)



NAME
       XInstallColormap, XUninstallColormap, XListInstalledColormaps - control
       colormaps

SYNTAX
       int XInstallColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap);

       int XUninstallColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap);

       Colormap *XListInstalledColormaps(Display *display, Window w, int
              *num_return);

ARGUMENTS
       colormap  Specifies the colormap.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       num_return
                 Returns the number of currently installed colormaps.

       w         Specifies the window that determines the screen.

DESCRIPTION
       The XInstallColormap function installs the specified colormap for its
       associated screen.  All windows associated with this colormap immediately
       display with true colors.  You associated the windows with this colormap
       when you created them by calling XCreateWindow, XCreateSimpleWindow,
       XChangeWindowAttributes, or XSetWindowColormap.

       If the specified colormap is not already an installed colormap, the X
       server generates a ColormapNotify event on each window that has that col&#8208;
       ormap.  In addition, for every other colormap that is installed as a
       result of a call to XInstallColormap, the X server generates a Colormap&#8208;
       Notify event on each window that has that colormap.

       XInstallColormap can generate a BadColor error.

       The XUninstallColormap function removes the specified colormap from the
       required list for its screen.  As a result, the specified colormap might
       be uninstalled, and the X server might implicitly install or uninstall
       additional colormaps.  Which colormaps get installed or uninstalled is
       server dependent except that the required list must remain installed.

       If the specified colormap becomes uninstalled, the X server generates a
       ColormapNotify event on each window that has that colormap.  In addition,
       for every other colormap that is installed or uninstalled as a result of
       a call to XUninstallColormap, the X server generates a ColormapNotify
       event on each window that has that colormap.

       XUninstallColormap can generate a BadColor error.

       The XListInstalledColormaps function returns a list of the currently
       installed colormaps for the screen of the specified window.  The order of
       the colormaps in the list is not significant and is no explicit indica&#8208;
       tion of the required list.  When the allocated list is no longer needed,
       free it by using XFree.

       XListInstalledColormaps can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Col&#8208;
                 ormap.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
