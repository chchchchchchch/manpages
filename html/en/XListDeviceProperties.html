DESCRIPTION
           The XListDeviceProperties function returns a list of the
           properties associated with the input device specified in
           device. Each device may have an arbitrary number of properties
           attached, some of which were created by the driver and/or
           server, others created by clients at runtime.

           The client is expected to free the list of properties using
           XFree.

           XListDeviceProperties can generate a BadDevice error.

DIAGNOSTICS
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The device does not
                  exist.
