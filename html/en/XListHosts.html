XAddHost(3)                      XLIB FUNCTIONS                      XAddHost(3)



NAME
       XAddHost, XAddHosts, XListHosts, XRemoveHost, XRemoveHosts, XSetAccess&#8208;
       Control, XEnableAccessControl, XDisableAccessControl, XHostAddress,
       XServerInterpretedAddress - control host access and host control struc&#8208;
       ture

SYNTAX
       int XAddHost(Display *display, XHostAddress *host);

       int XAddHosts(Display *display, XHostAddress *hosts, int num_hosts);

       XHostAddress *XListHosts(Display *display, int *nhosts_return, Bool
              state_return);

       int XRemoveHost(Display *display, XHostAddress *host);

       int XRemoveHosts(Display *display, XHostAddress *hosts, int num_hosts);

       int XSetAccessControl(Display *display, int mode);

       int XEnableAccessControl(Display *display);

       int XDisableAccessControl(Display *display);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       host      Specifies the host that is to be added or removed.

       hosts     Specifies each host that is to be added or removed.

       mode      Specifies the mode.  You can pass EnableAccess or DisableAc&#8208;
                 cess.

       nhosts_return
                 Returns the number of hosts currently in the access control
                 list.

       num_hosts Specifies the number of hosts.

       state_return
                 Returns the state of the access control.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAddHost function adds the specified host to the access control list
       for that display.  The server must be on the same host as the client
       issuing the command, or a BadAccess error results.

       XAddHost can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.

       The XAddHosts function adds each specified host to the access control
       list for that display.  The server must be on the same host as the client
       issuing the command, or a BadAccess error results.

       XAddHosts can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.

       The XListHosts function returns the current access control list as well
       as whether the use of the list at connection setup was enabled or dis&#8208;
       abled.  XListHosts allows a program to find out what machines can make
       connections.  It also returns a pointer to a list of host structures that
       were allocated by the function.  When no longer needed, this memory
       should be freed by calling XFree.

       The XRemoveHost function removes the specified host from the access con&#8208;
       trol list for that display.  The server must be on the same host as the
       client process, or a BadAccess error results.  If you remove your machine
       from the access list, you can no longer connect to that server, and this
       operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the server.

       XRemoveHost can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.

       The XRemoveHosts function removes each specified host from the access
       control list for that display.  The X server must be on the same host as
       the client process, or a BadAccess error results.  If you remove your
       machine from the access list, you can no longer connect to that server,
       and this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the server.

       XRemoveHosts can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.

       The XSetAccessControl function either enables or disables the use of the
       access control list at each connection setup.

       XSetAccessControl can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.

       The XEnableAccessControl function enables the use of the access control
       list at each connection setup.

       XEnableAccessControl can generate a BadAccess error.

       The XDisableAccessControl function disables the use of the access control
       list at each connection setup.

       XDisableAccessControl can generate a BadAccess error.

STRUCTURES
       The XHostAddress structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            int family;              /* for example FamilyInternet */
            int length;              /* length of address, in bytes */
            char *address;           /* pointer to where to find the address */
       } XHostAddress;

       The family member specifies which protocol address family to use (for
       example, TCP/IP or DECnet) and can be FamilyInternet, FamilyInternet6,
       FamilyServerInterpreted, FamilyDECnet, or FamilyChaos.  The length member
       specifies the length of the address in bytes.  The address member speci&#8208;
       fies a pointer to the address.

       For the ServerInterpreted family, the length is ignored and the address
       member is a pointer to a XServerInterpretedAddress structure which con&#8208;
       tains:

       typedef struct {
            int typelength;          /* length of type string, in bytes */
            int valuelength;         /* length of value string, in bytes */
            char *type;              /* pointer to where to find the type string */
            char *value;             /* pointer to where to find the address */
       } XServerInterpretedAddress;

       The type and value members point to strings representing the type and
       value of the server interpreted entry.  These strings may not be NULL-
       terminated so care should be used when accessing them.  The typelength
       and valuelength members specify the length in byte of the type and value
       strings.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess A client attempted to modify the access control list from other
                 than the local (or otherwise authorized) host.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
