XRaiseWindow(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XRaiseWindow(3)



NAME
       XRaiseWindow, XLowerWindow, XCirculateSubwindows, XCirculateSubwindowsUp,
       XCirculateSubwindowsDown, XRestackWindows - change window stacking order

SYNTAX
       int XRaiseWindow(Display *display, Window w);

       int XLowerWindow(Display *display, Window w);

       int XCirculateSubwindows(Display *display, Window w, int direction);

       int XCirculateSubwindowsUp(Display *display, Window w);

       int XCirculateSubwindowsDown(Display *display, Window w);

       int XRestackWindows(Display *display, Window windows[], int nwindows);

ARGUMENTS
       direction Specifies the direction (up or down) that you want to circulate
                 the window.  You can pass RaiseLowest or LowerHighest.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       nwindows  Specifies the number of windows to be restacked.

       w         Specifies the window.

       windows   Specifies an array containing the windows to be restacked.

DESCRIPTION
       The XRaiseWindow function raises the specified window to the top of the
       stack so that no sibling window obscures it.  If the windows are regarded
       as overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then raising a window
       is analogous to moving the sheet to the top of the stack but leaving its
       x and y location on the desk constant.  Raising a mapped window may gen&#8208;
       erate Expose events for the window and any mapped subwindows that were
       formerly obscured.

       If the override-redirect attribute of the window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no processing is performed.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise, the window is raised.

       XRaiseWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XLowerWindow function lowers the specified window to the bottom of
       the stack so that it does not obscure any sibling windows.  If the win&#8208;
       dows are regarded as overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then
       lowering a window is analogous to moving the sheet to the bottom of the
       stack but leaving its x and y location on the desk constant.  Lowering a
       mapped window will generate Expose events on any windows it formerly
       obscured.

       If the override-redirect attribute of the window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no processing is performed.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise, the window is lowered to the bottom of the stack.

       XLowerWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XCirculateSubwindows function circulates children of the specified
       window in the specified direction.  If you specify RaiseLowest, XCircu&#8208;
       lateSubwindows raises the lowest mapped child (if any) that is occluded
       by another child to the top of the stack.  If you specify LowerHighest,
       XCirculateSubwindows lowers the highest mapped child (if any) that
       occludes another child to the bottom of the stack.  Exposure processing
       is then performed on formerly obscured windows.  If some other client has
       selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the window, the X server generates a
       CirculateRequest event, and no further processing is performed.  If a
       child is actually restacked, the X server generates a CirculateNotify
       event.

       XCirculateSubwindows can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

       The XCirculateSubwindowsUp function raises the lowest mapped child of the
       specified window that is partially or completely occluded by another
       child.  Completely unobscured children are not affected.  This is a con&#8208;
       venience function equivalent to XCirculateSubwindows with RaiseLowest
       specified.

       XCirculateSubwindowsUp can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XCirculateSubwindowsDown function lowers the highest mapped child of
       the specified window that partially or completely occludes another child.
       Completely unobscured children are not affected.  This is a convenience
       function equivalent to XCirculateSubwindows with LowerHighest specified.

       XCirculateSubwindowsDown can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XRestackWindows function restacks the windows in the order specified,
       from top to bottom.  The stacking order of the first window in the win&#8208;
       dows array is unaffected, but the other windows in the array are stacked
       underneath the first window, in the order of the array.  The stacking
       order of the other windows is not affected.  For each window in the win&#8208;
       dow array that is not a sibling of the first window, a BadMatch error
       results.

       If the override-redirect attribute of a window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates ConfigureRequest events for each window whose override-redirect
       flag is not set, and no further processing is performed.  Otherwise, the
       windows will be restacked in top-to-bottom order.

       XRestackWindows can generate BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
