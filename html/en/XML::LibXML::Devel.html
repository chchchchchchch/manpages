DESCRIPTION
       &quot;XML::LibXML::Devel&quot; makes functions from LibXML.xs available that are
       needed to wrap libxml2 nodes in and out of XML::LibXML::Nodes.  This
       gives cleaner dependencies than using LibXML.so directly.

       To XS a library that uses libxml2 nodes the first step is to do this so
       that xmlNodePtr is passed as void *. These raw nodes are then turned into
       libxml nodes by using this &quot;Devel&quot; functions.

       Be aware that this module is currently rather experimental. The function
       names may change if I XS more functions and introduce a reasonable naming
       convention.

       Be also aware that this module is a great tool to cause segfaults and
       introduce memory leaks. It does however provide a partial cure by making
       &quot;xmlMemUsed&quot; available as &quot;mem_used&quot;.
&#12;FUNCTIONS
   NODE MANAGEMENT
       node_to_perl
          node_to_perl($raw_node);

        Returns a LibXML::Node object. This has a proxy node with a reference
        counter and an owner attached. The raw node will be deleted as soon as
        the reference counter reaches zero.  If the C library is keeping a
        pointer to the raw node, you need to call refcnt_inc immediately.  You
        also need to replace xmlFreeNode by a call to refcnt_dec.

       node_to_perl
          node_from_perl($node);

        Returns a raw node. This is a void * pointer and you can do nothing but
        passing it to functions that treat it as an xmlNodePtr. The raw node
        will be freed as soon as its reference counter reaches zero.  If the C
        library is keeping a pointer to the raw node, you need to call
        refcnt_inc immediately.  You also need to replace xmlFreeNode by a call
        to refcnt_dec.

       refcnt_inc
          refcnt_inc($raw_node);

        Increments the raw nodes reference counter. The raw node must already be
        known to perl to have a reference counter.

       refcnt_dec
          refcnt_dec($raw_node);

        Decrements the raw nodes reference counter and returns the value it had
        before. if the counter becomes zero or less, this method will free the
        proxy node holding the reference counter.  If the node is part of a
        subtree, refcnt_dec will fix the reference counts and delete the subtree
        if it is not required any more.

       refcnt
          refcnt($raw_node);

        Returns the value of the reference counter.

       fix_owner
          fix_owner($raw_node, $raw_parent);

        This functions fixes the reference counts for an entire subtree.  it is
        very important to fix an entire subtree after node operations where the
        documents or the owner node may get changed. this method is aware about
        nodes that already belong to a certain owner node.

   MEMORY DEBUGGING
       $ENV{DEBUG_MEMORY}
          BEGIN {$ENV{DEBUG_MEMORY} = 1;};
          use XML::LibXML;

        This turns on libxml2 memory debugging. It must be set before
        XML::LibXML is loaded.

       mem_used
          mem_used();

        Returns the number of bytes currently allocated.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

SEE ALSO
       This was created to support the needs of Apache2::ModXml2. So this can
       serve as an example.
