NAME
       XML::LibXML::SAX::Builder - Building DOM trees from SAX events.

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::LibXML::SAX::Builder;
         my $builder = XML::LibXML::SAX::Builder-&gt;new();

         my $gen = XML::Generator::DBI-&gt;new(Handler =&gt; $builder, dbh =&gt; $dbh);
         $gen-&gt;execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM Users&quot;);

         my $doc = $builder-&gt;result();

DESCRIPTION
       This is a SAX handler that generates a DOM tree from SAX events. Usage is
       as above. Input is accepted from any SAX1 or SAX2 event generator.

       Building DOM trees from SAX events is quite easy with
       XML::LibXML::SAX::Builder. The class is designed as a SAX2 final handler
       not as a filter!

       Since SAX is strictly stream oriented, you should not expect anything to
       return from a generator. Instead you have to ask the builder instance
       directly to get the document built. XML::LibXML::SAX::Builder&apos;s result()
       function holds the document generated from the last SAX stream.
