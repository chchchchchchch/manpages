NAME
       XML::Parser - A perl module for parsing XML documents

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser;

         $p1 = XML::Parser-&gt;new(Style =&gt; &apos;Debug&apos;);
         $p1-&gt;parsefile(&apos;REC-xml-19980210.xml&apos;);
         $p1-&gt;parse(&apos;&lt;foo id=&quot;me&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/foo&gt;&apos;);

         # Alternative
         $p2 = XML::Parser-&gt;new(Handlers =&gt; {Start =&gt; \&amp;handle_start,
                                            End   =&gt; \&amp;handle_end,
                                            Char  =&gt; \&amp;handle_char});
         $p2-&gt;parse($socket);

         # Another alternative
         $p3 = XML::Parser-&gt;new(ErrorContext =&gt; 2);

         $p3-&gt;setHandlers(Char    =&gt; \&amp;text,
                          Default =&gt; \&amp;other);

         open(FOO, &apos;xmlgenerator |&apos;);
         $p3-&gt;parse(*FOO, ProtocolEncoding =&gt; &apos;ISO-8859-1&apos;);
         close(FOO);

         $p3-&gt;parsefile(&apos;junk.xml&apos;, ErrorContext =&gt; 3);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is built on top of
       XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark&apos;s
       expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new
       instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document.
       Expat options may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created.
       These options are then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call.
       They can also be given as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which
       case they override options given at XML::Parser creation time.

       The behavior of the parser is controlled either by &quot;STYLES&quot; and/or
       &quot;HANDLERS&quot; options, or by &quot;setHandlers&quot; method. These all provide
       mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
       XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither &quot;Style&quot; nor &quot;Handlers&quot; are specified,
       then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.

       When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
       parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

METHODS
       new This is a class method, the constructor for XML::Parser. Options are
           passed as keyword value pairs. Recognized options are:

           &#183;   Style

               This option provides an easy way to create a given style of
               parser. The built in styles are: &quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Subs&quot;, &quot;Tree&quot;,
               &quot;Objects&quot;, and &quot;Stream&quot;. These are all defined in separate
               packages under &quot;XML::Parser::Style::*&quot;, and you can find further
               documentation for each style both below, and in those packages.

               Custom styles can be provided by giving a full package name
               containing at least one &apos;::&apos;. This package should then have subs
               defined for each handler it wishes to have installed. See
               &quot;STYLES&quot; below for a discussion of each built in style.

           &#183;   Handlers

               When provided, this option should be an anonymous hash containing
               as keys the type of handler and as values a sub reference to
               handle that type of event. All the handlers get passed as their
               1st parameter the instance of expat that is parsing the document.
               Further details on handlers can be found in &quot;HANDLERS&quot;. Any
               handler set here overrides the corresponding handler set with the
               Style option.

           &#183;   Pkg

               Some styles will refer to subs defined in this package. If not
               provided, it defaults to the package which called the
               constructor.

           &#183;   ErrorContext

               This is an Expat option. When this option is defined, errors are
               reported in context. The value should be the number of lines to
               show on either side of the line in which the error occurred.

           &#183;   ProtocolEncoding

               This is an Expat option. This sets the protocol encoding name. It
               defaults to none. The built-in encodings are: &quot;UTF-8&quot;,
               &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;, &quot;UTF-16&quot;, and &quot;US-ASCII&quot;. Other encodings may be
               used if they have encoding maps in one of the directories in the
               @Encoding_Path list. Check &quot;ENCODINGS&quot; for more information on
               encoding maps. Setting the protocol encoding overrides any
               encoding in the XML declaration.

           &#183;   Namespaces

               This is an Expat option. If this is set to a true value, then
               namespace processing is done during the parse. See &quot;Namespaces&quot;
               in XML::Parser::Expat for further discussion of namespace
               processing.

           &#183;   NoExpand

               This is an Expat option. Normally, the parser will try to expand
               references to entities defined in the internal subset. If this
               option is set to a true value, and a default handler is also set,
               then the default handler will be called when an entity reference
               is seen in text. This has no effect if a default handler has not
               been registered, and it has no effect on the expansion of entity
               references inside attribute values.

           &#183;   Stream_Delimiter

               This is an Expat option. It takes a string value. When this
               string is found alone on a line while parsing from a stream, then
               the parse is ended as if it saw an end of file. The intended use
               is with a stream of xml documents in a MIME multipart format. The
               string should not contain a trailing newline.

           &#183;   ParseParamEnt

               This is an Expat option. Unless standalone is set to &quot;yes&quot; in the
               XML declaration, setting this to a true value allows the external
               DTD to be read, and parameter entities to be parsed and expanded.

           &#183;   NoLWP
&#12;               This option has no effect if the ExternEnt or ExternEntFin
               handlers are directly set. Otherwise, if true, it forces the use
               of a file based external entity handler.

           &#183;   Non-Expat-Options

               If provided, this should be an anonymous hash whose keys are
               options that shouldn&apos;t be passed to Expat. This should only be of
               concern to those subclassing XML::Parser.

       setHandlers(TYPE, HANDLER [, TYPE, HANDLER [...]])
           This method registers handlers for various parser events. It
           overrides any previous handlers registered through the Style or
           Handler options or through earlier calls to setHandlers. By providing
           a false or undefined value as the handler, the existing handler can
           be unset.

           This method returns a list of type, handler pairs corresponding to
           the input. The handlers returned are the ones that were in effect
           prior to the call.

           See a description of the handler types in &quot;HANDLERS&quot;.

       parse(SOURCE [, OPT =&gt; OPT_VALUE [...]])
           The SOURCE parameter should either be a string containing the whole
           XML document, or it should be an open IO::Handle. Constructor options
           to XML::Parser::Expat given as keyword-value pairs may follow the
           SOURCE parameter. These override, for this call, any options or
           attributes passed through from the XML::Parser instance.

           A die call is thrown if a parse error occurs. Otherwise it will
           return 1 or whatever is returned from the Final handler, if one is
           installed.  In other words, what parse may return depends on the
           style.

       parsestring
           This is just an alias for parse for backwards compatibility.

       parsefile(FILE [, OPT =&gt; OPT_VALUE [...]])
           Open FILE for reading, then call parse with the open handle. The file
           is closed no matter how parse returns. Returns what parse returns.

       parse_start([ OPT =&gt; OPT_VALUE [...]])
           Create and return a new instance of XML::Parser::ExpatNB. Constructor
           options may be provided. If an init handler has been provided, it is
           called before returning the ExpatNB object. Documents are parsed by
           making incremental calls to the parse_more method of this object,
           which takes a string. A single call to the parse_done method of this
           object, which takes no arguments, indicates that the document is
           finished.

           If there is a final handler installed, it is executed by the
           parse_done method before returning and the parse_done method returns
           whatever is returned by the final handler.

HANDLERS
       Expat is an event based parser. As the parser recognizes parts of the
       document (say the start or end tag for an XML element), then any handlers
       registered for that type of an event are called with suitable parameters.
       All handlers receive an instance of XML::Parser::Expat as their first
       argument. See &quot;METHODS&quot; in XML::Parser::Expat for a discussion of the
       methods that can be called on this object.

   Init                (Expat)
       This is called just before the parsing of the document starts.

   Final                (Expat)
       This is called just after parsing has finished, but only if no errors
       occurred during the parse. Parse returns what this returns.

   Start                (Expat, Element [, Attr, Val [,...]])
       This event is generated when an XML start tag is recognized. Element is
       the name of the XML element type that is opened with the start tag. The
       Attr &amp; Val pairs are generated for each attribute in the start tag.

   End                (Expat, Element)
       This event is generated when an XML end tag is recognized. Note that an
       XML empty tag (&lt;foo/&gt;) generates both a start and an end event.

   Char                (Expat, String)
       This event is generated when non-markup is recognized. The non-markup
       sequence of characters is in String. A single non-markup sequence of
       characters may generate multiple calls to this handler. Whatever the
       encoding of the string in the original document, this is given to the
       handler in UTF-8.

   Proc                (Expat, Target, Data)
       This event is generated when a processing instruction is recognized.

   Comment                (Expat, Data)
       This event is generated when a comment is recognized.

   CdataStart        (Expat)
       This is called at the start of a CDATA section.

   CdataEnd                (Expat)
       This is called at the end of a CDATA section.

   Default                (Expat, String)
       This is called for any characters that don&apos;t have a registered handler.
       This includes both characters that are part of markup for which no events
       are generated (markup declarations) and characters that could generate
       events, but for which no handler has been registered.

       Whatever the encoding in the original document, the string is returned to
       the handler in UTF-8.

   Unparsed                (Expat, Entity, Base, Sysid, Pubid, Notation)
       This is called for a declaration of an unparsed entity. Entity is the
       name of the entity. Base is the base to be used for resolving a relative
       URI.  Sysid is the system id. Pubid is the public id. Notation is the
       notation name. Base and Pubid may be undefined.

   Notation                (Expat, Notation, Base, Sysid, Pubid)
       This is called for a declaration of notation. Notation is the notation
       name.  Base is the base to be used for resolving a relative URI. Sysid is
       the system id. Pubid is the public id. Base, Sysid, and Pubid may all be
       undefined.

   ExternEnt        (Expat, Base, Sysid, Pubid)
       This is called when an external entity is referenced. Base is the base to
       be used for resolving a relative URI. Sysid is the system id. Pubid is
       the public id. Base, and Pubid may be undefined.

       This handler should either return a string, which represents the contents
       of the external entity, or return an open filehandle that can be read to
       obtain the contents of the external entity, or return undef, which
       indicates the external entity couldn&apos;t be found and will generate a parse
       error.

       If an open filehandle is returned, it must be returned as either a glob
       (*FOO) or as a reference to a glob (e.g. an instance of IO::Handle).

       A default handler is installed for this event. The default handler is
       XML::Parser::lwp_ext_ent_handler unless the NoLWP option was provided
       with a true value, otherwise XML::Parser::file_ext_ent_handler is the
       default handler for external entities. Even without the NoLWP option, if
       the URI or LWP modules are missing, the file based handler ends up being
       used after giving a warning on the first external entity reference.

       The LWP external entity handler will use proxies defined in the
       environment (http_proxy, ftp_proxy, etc.).

       Please note that the LWP external entity handler reads the entire entity
       into a string and returns it, where as the file handler opens a
       filehandle.

       Also note that the file external entity handler will likely choke on
       absolute URIs or file names that don&apos;t fit the conventions of the local
       operating system.

       The expat base method can be used to set a basename for relative
       pathnames. If no basename is given, or if the basename is itself a
       relative name, then it is relative to the current working directory.

   ExternEntFin        (Expat)
       This is called after parsing an external entity. It&apos;s not called unless
       an ExternEnt handler is also set. There is a default handler installed
       that pairs with the default ExternEnt handler.

       If you&apos;re going to install your own ExternEnt handler, then you should
       set (or unset) this handler too.

   Entity                (Expat, Name, Val, Sysid, Pubid, Ndata, IsParam)
       This is called when an entity is declared. For internal entities, the Val
       parameter will contain the value and the remaining three parameters will
       be undefined. For external entities, the Val parameter will be undefined,
       the Sysid parameter will have the system id, the Pubid parameter will
       have the public id if it was provided (it will be undefined otherwise),
       the Ndata parameter will contain the notation for unparsed entities. If
       this is a parameter entity declaration, then the IsParam parameter is
       true.

       Note that this handler and the Unparsed handler above overlap. If both
       are set, then this handler will not be called for unparsed entities.

   Element                (Expat, Name, Model)
       The element handler is called when an element declaration is found. Name
       is the element name, and Model is the content model as an
       XML::Parser::Content object. See &quot;XML::Parser::ContentModel Methods&quot; in
       XML::Parser::Expat for methods available for this class.

   Attlist                (Expat, Elname, Attname, Type, Default, Fixed)
       This handler is called for each attribute in an ATTLIST declaration.  So
       an ATTLIST declaration that has multiple attributes will generate
       multiple calls to this handler. The Elname parameter is the name of the
       element with which the attribute is being associated. The Attname
       parameter is the name of the attribute. Type is the attribute type, given
       as a string. Default is the default value, which will either be
       &quot;#REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;#IMPLIED&quot; or a quoted string (i.e. the returned string will
       begin and end with a quote character).  If Fixed is true, then this is a
       fixed attribute.

   Doctype                (Expat, Name, Sysid, Pubid, Internal)
       This handler is called for DOCTYPE declarations. Name is the document
       type name. Sysid is the system id of the document type, if it was
       provided, otherwise it&apos;s undefined. Pubid is the public id of the
       document type, which will be undefined if no public id was given.
       Internal is the internal subset, given as a string. If there was no
       internal subset, it will be undefined. Internal will contain all
       whitespace, comments, processing instructions, and declarations seen in
       the internal subset. The declarations will be there whether or not they
       have been processed by another handler (except for unparsed entities
       processed by the Unparsed handler). However, comments and processing
       instructions will not appear if they&apos;ve been processed by their
       respective handlers.
&#12;   * DoctypeFin                (Parser)
       This handler is called after parsing of the DOCTYPE declaration has
       finished, including any internal or external DTD declarations.

   XMLDecl                (Expat, Version, Encoding, Standalone)
       This handler is called for xml declarations. Version is a string containg
       the version. Encoding is either undefined or contains an encoding string.
       Standalone will be either true, false, or undefined if the standalone
       attribute is yes, no, or not made respectively.

STYLES
   Debug
       This just prints out the document in outline form. Nothing special is
       returned by parse.

   Subs
       Each time an element starts, a sub by that name in the package specified
       by the Pkg option is called with the same parameters that the Start
       handler gets called with.

       Each time an element ends, a sub with that name appended with an
       underscore (&quot;_&quot;), is called with the same parameters that the End handler
       gets called with.

       Nothing special is returned by parse.

   Tree
       Parse will return a parse tree for the document. Each node in the tree
       takes the form of a tag, content pair. Text nodes are represented with a
       pseudo-tag of &quot;0&quot; and the string that is their content. For elements, the
       content is an array reference. The first item in the array is a (possibly
       empty) hash reference containing attributes. The remainder of the array
       is a sequence of tag-content pairs representing the content of the
       element.

       So for example the result of parsing:

         &lt;foo&gt;&lt;head id=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;bar&gt;Howdy&lt;ref/&gt;&lt;/bar&gt;do&lt;/foo&gt;

       would be:

                    Tag   Content
         ==================================================================
         [foo, [{}, head, [{id =&gt; &quot;a&quot;}, 0, &quot;Hello &quot;,  em, [{}, 0, &quot;there&quot;]],
                     bar, [         {}, 0, &quot;Howdy&quot;,  ref, [{}]],
                       0, &quot;do&quot;
               ]
         ]

       The root document &quot;foo&quot;, has 3 children: a &quot;head&quot; element, a &quot;bar&quot;
       element and the text &quot;do&quot;. After the empty attribute hash, these are
       represented in it&apos;s contents by 3 tag-content pairs.

   Objects
       This is similar to the Tree style, except that a hash object is created
       for each element. The corresponding object will be in the class whose
       name is created by appending &quot;::&quot; and the element name to the package set
       with the Pkg option. Non-markup text will be in the ::Characters class.
       The contents of the corresponding object will be in an anonymous array
       that is the value of the Kids property for that object.

   Stream
       This style also uses the Pkg package. If none of the subs that this style
       looks for is there, then the effect of parsing with this style is to
       print a canonical copy of the document without comments or declarations.
       All the subs receive as their 1st parameter the Expat instance for the
       document they&apos;re parsing.

       It looks for the following routines:

       &#183;   StartDocument

           Called at the start of the parse .

       &#183;   StartTag

           Called for every start tag with a second parameter of the element
           type. The $_ variable will contain a copy of the tag and the %_
           variable will contain attribute values supplied for that element.

       &#183;   EndTag

           Called for every end tag with a second parameter of the element type.
           The $_ variable will contain a copy of the end tag.

       &#183;   Text

           Called just before start or end tags with accumulated non-markup text
           in the $_ variable.

       &#183;   PI

           Called for processing instructions. The $_ variable will contain a
           copy of the PI and the target and data are sent as 2nd and 3rd
           parameters respectively.

       &#183;   EndDocument

           Called at conclusion of the parse.

ENCODINGS
       XML documents may be encoded in character sets other than Unicode as long
       as they may be mapped into the Unicode character set. Expat has further
       restrictions on encodings. Read the xmlparse.h header file in the expat
       distribution to see details on these restrictions.

       Expat has built-in encodings for: &quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;, &quot;UTF-16&quot;, and
       &quot;US-ASCII&quot;. Encodings are set either through the XML declaration encoding
       attribute or through the ProtocolEncoding option to XML::Parser or
       XML::Parser::Expat.

       For encodings other than the built-ins, expat calls the function
       load_encoding in the Expat package with the encoding name. This function
       looks for a file in the path list @XML::Parser::Expat::Encoding_Path,
       that matches the lower-cased name with a &apos;.enc&apos; extension. The first one
       it finds, it loads.

       If you wish to build your own encoding maps, check out the XML::Encoding
       module from CPAN.
