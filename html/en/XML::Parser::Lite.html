NAME
       XML::Parser::Lite - Lightweight regexp-based XML parser

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser::Lite;

         $p1 = new XML::Parser::Lite;
         $p1-&gt;setHandlers(
           Start =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;start: @_\n&quot; },
           Char =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;char: @_\n&quot; },
           End =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;end: @_\n&quot; },
         );
         $p1-&gt;parse(&apos;&lt;foo id=&quot;me&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/foo&gt;&apos;);

         $p2 = new XML::Parser::Lite
           Handlers =&gt; {
             Start =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;start: @_\n&quot; },
             Char =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;char: @_\n&quot; },
             End =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;end: @_\n&quot; },
           }
         ;
         $p2-&gt;parse(&apos;&lt;foo id=&quot;me&quot;&gt;Hello &lt;bar&gt;cruel&lt;/bar&gt; World!&lt;/foo&gt;&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl implements an XML parser with a interface similar to
       XML::Parser. Though not all callbacks are supported, you should be able
       to use it in the same way you use XML::Parser. Due to using experimantal
       regexp features it&apos;ll work only on Perl 5.6 and above and may behave
       differently on different platforms.

       Note that you cannot use regular expressions or split in callbacks. This
       is due to a limitation of perl&apos;s regular expression implementation (which
       is not re-entrant).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   new
       Constructor.

       As (almost) all SOAP::Lite constructors, new() returns the object called
       on when called as object method. This means that the following
       effectifely is a no-op if $obj is a object:

        $obj = $obj-&gt;new();

       New accepts a single named parameter, &quot;Handlers&quot; with a hash ref as
       value:

        my $parser = XML::Parser::Lite-&gt;new(
           Handlers =&gt; {
               Start =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;start: @_\n&quot; },
               Char =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;char: @_\n&quot; },
               End =&gt; sub { shift; print &quot;end: @_\n&quot; },
           }
        );

       The handlers given will be passed to setHandlers.

   setHandlers
       Sets (or resets) the parsing handlers. Accepts a hash with the handler
       names and handler code references as parameters. Passing &quot;undef&quot; instead
       of a code reference replaces the handler by a no-op.
&#12;       The following handlers can be set:

        Init
        Start
        Char
        End
        Final

       All other handlers are ignored.

       Calling setHandlers without parameters resets all handlers to no-ops.

   parse
       Parses the XML given. In contrast to XML::Parser&apos;s parse method, parse()
       only parses strings.

Handler methods
   Init
       Called before parsing starts. You should perform any necessary
       initializations in Init.

   Start
       Called at the start of each XML node. See XML::Parser for details.

   Char
       Called for each character sequence. May be called multiple times for the
       characters contained in an XML node (even for every single character).
       Your implementation has to make sure that it captures all characters.

   End
       Called at the end of each XML node. See XML::Parser for details

   Comment
       See XML::Parser for details

   XMLDecl
       See XML::Parser for details

   Doctype
       See XML::Parser for details

   Final
       Called at the end of the parsing process. You should perform any
       necessary cleanup here.
