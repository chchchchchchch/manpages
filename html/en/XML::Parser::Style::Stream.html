NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Stream - Stream style for XML::Parser

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser;
         my $p = XML::Parser-&gt;new(Style =&gt; &apos;Stream&apos;, Pkg =&gt; &apos;MySubs&apos;);
         $p-&gt;parsefile(&apos;foo.xml&apos;);

         {
           package MySubs;

           sub StartTag {
             my ($e, $name) = @_;
             # do something with start tags
           }

           sub EndTag {
             my ($e, $name) = @_;
             # do something with end tags
           }

           sub Characters {
             my ($e, $data) = @_;
             # do something with text nodes
           }
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This style uses the Pkg option to find subs in a given package to call
       for each event.  If none of the subs that this style looks for is there,
       then the effect of parsing with this style is to print a canonical copy
       of the document without comments or declarations.  All the subs receive
       as their 1st parameter the Expat instance for the document they&apos;re
       parsing.

       It looks for the following routines:

       &#183;   StartDocument

           Called at the start of the parse .

       &#183;   StartTag

           Called for every start tag with a second parameter of the element
           type. The $_ variable will contain a copy of the tag and the %_
           variable will contain attribute values supplied for that element.

       &#183;   EndTag

           Called for every end tag with a second parameter of the element type.
           The $_ variable will contain a copy of the end tag.

       &#183;   Text

           Called just before start or end tags with accumulated non-markup text
           in the $_ variable.

       &#183;   PI

           Called for processing instructions. The $_ variable will contain a
           copy of the PI and the target and data are sent as 2nd and 3rd
           parameters respectively.

       &#183;   EndDocument

           Called at conclusion of the parse.
