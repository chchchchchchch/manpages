NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Subs - glue for handling element callbacks

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser;
         my $p = XML::Parser-&gt;new(Style =&gt; &apos;Subs&apos;, Pkg =&gt; &apos;MySubs&apos;);
         $p-&gt;parsefile(&apos;foo.xml&apos;);

         {
           package MySubs;

           sub foo {
             # start of foo tag
           }

           sub foo_ {
             # end of foo tag
           }
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Each time an element starts, a sub by that name in the package specified
       by the Pkg option is called with the same parameters that the Start
       handler gets called with.

       Each time an element ends, a sub with that name appended with an
       underscore (&quot;_&quot;), is called with the same parameters that the End handler
       gets called with.

       Nothing special is returned by parse.
