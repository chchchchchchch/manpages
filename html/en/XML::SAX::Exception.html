XML::SAX::Exception(3pmUser Contributed Perl DocumentatiXML::SAX::Exception(3pm)



NAME
       XML::SAX::Exception - Exception classes for XML::SAX

SYNOPSIS
         throw XML::SAX::Exception::NotSupported(
                 Message =&gt; &quot;The foo feature is not supported&quot;,
                 );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the base class for all SAX Exceptions, those defined in
       the spec as well as those that one may create for one&apos;s own SAX errors.

       There are three subclasses included, corresponding to those of the SAX
       spec:

         XML::SAX::Exception::NotSupported
         XML::SAX::Exception::NotRecognized
         XML::SAX::Exception::Parse

       Use them wherever you want, and as much as possible when you encounter
       such errors. SAX is meant to use exceptions as much as possible to flag
       problems.

CREATING NEW EXCEPTION CLASSES
       All you need to do to create a new exception class is:

         @XML::SAX::Exception::MyException::ISA = (&apos;XML::SAX::Exception&apos;)

       The given package doesn&apos;t need to exist, it&apos;ll behave correctly this way.
       If your exception refines an existing exception class, then you may also
       inherit from that instead of from the base class.

THROWING EXCEPTIONS
       This is as simple as exemplified in the SYNOPSIS. In fact, there&apos;s
       nothing more to know. All you have to do is:

         throw XML::SAX::Exception::MyException( Message =&gt; &apos;Something went wrong&apos; );

       and voila, you&apos;ve thrown an exception which can be caught in an eval
       block.
