NAME
       XML::SAX::Expat - SAX2 Driver for Expat (XML::Parser)

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::SAX::Expat;
         use XML::SAX::MyFooHandler;
         my $h = XML::SAX::MyFooHandler-&gt;new;
         my $p = XML::SAX::Expat-&gt;new(Handler =&gt; $h);
         $p-&gt;parse_file(&apos;/path/to/foo.xml&apos;);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an implementation of a SAX2 driver sitting on top of Expat
       (XML::Parser) which Ken MacLeod posted to perl-xml and which I have
       updated.

       It is still incomplete, though most of the basic SAX2 events should be
       available. The SAX2 spec is currently available from
       http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/perl-xml/libxml-perl/doc/sax-2.0.html?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/html

       A more friendly URL as well as a PODification of the spec are in the
       works.

METHODS
       The methods defined in this class correspond to those listed in the
       PerlSAX2 specification, available above.

FEATURES AND CAVEATS
       supported_features
         Returns:

           * http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities
           * http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities
           * [ Features supported by ancestors ]

         Turning one of the first two on also turns the other on (this maps to
         the XML::Parser ParseParamEnts option). This may be fixed in the
         future, so don&apos;t rely on this behaviour.

MISSING PARTS
       XML::Parser has no listed callbacks for the following events, which are
       therefore not presently generated (ways may be found in the future):

         * ignorable_whitespace
         * skipped_entity
         * start_entity / end_entity
         * resolve_entity

       Ways of signalling them are welcome. In addition to those,
       set_document_locator is not yet called.

TODO
         - reuse Ken&apos;s tests and add more
