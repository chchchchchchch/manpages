NAME
       XML::Writer::String - Capture output from XML::Writer.

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Writer;
         use XML::Writer::String;

         my $s = XML::Writer::String-&gt;new();
         my $writer = new XML::Writer( OUTPUT =&gt; $s );

         $writer-&gt;xmlDecl();
         $writer-&gt;startTag(&apos;root&apos;);
         $writer-&gt;endTag();
         $writer-&gt;end();

         print $s-&gt;value();

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a bare-bones class specifically for the purpose of
       capturing data from the XML::Writer module.  XML::Writer expects an
       IO::Handle object and writes XML data to the specified object (or STDOUT)
       via it&apos;s print() method.  This module simulates such an object for the
       specific purpose of providing the required print() method.

       It is recommended that $writer-&gt;end() is called prior to calling
       $s-&gt;value() to check for well-formedness.

METHODS
       XML::Writer::String provides three methods, &quot;new()&quot;, &quot;print()&quot; and
       &quot;value()&quot;:

       &quot;$s = XML::Writer::String-&quot;new([list]);&gt;
           new() returns a new String handle.

       &quot;$count = $s-&quot;print([list]);&gt;
           print() appends concatenated list data and returns number of items in
           list.

       &quot;$val = $s-&quot;value([list]);&gt;
           value() returns the current content of the object as a scalar.  It
           can also be used to initialize/overwrite the current content with
           concatenated list data.

NOTES
       This module is designed for the specific purpose of capturing the output
       of XML::Writer objects, as described in this document.  It does not
       inherit form IO::Handle.  For an alternative solution look at IO::Scalar,
       IO::Lines, IO::String or Tie::Handle::Scalar.
