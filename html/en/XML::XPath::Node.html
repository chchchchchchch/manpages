XPath::Node(3pm)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      XPath::Node(3pm)



NAME
       XML::XPath::Node - internal representation of a node

API
       The Node API aims to emulate DOM to some extent, however the API isn&apos;t
       quite compatible with DOM. This is to ease transition from XML::DOM
       programming to XML::XPath. Compatibility with DOM may arise once XML::DOM
       gets namespace support.

   new
       Creates a new node. See the sub-classes for parameters to pass to new().

   getNodeType
       Returns one of ELEMENT_NODE, TEXT_NODE, COMMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE,
       PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE or NAMESPACE_NODE. UNKNOWN_NODE is returned
       if the sub-class doesn&apos;t implement getNodeType - but that means something
       is broken! The constants are exported by default from XML::XPath::Node.
       The constants have the same numeric value as the XML::DOM versions.

   getParentNode
       Returns the parent of this node, or undef if this is the root node. Note
       that the root node is the root node in terms of XPath - not the root
       element node.

   to_sax ( $handler | %handlers )
       Generates sax calls to the handler or handlers. See the PerlSAX docs for
       details (not yet implemented correctly).
