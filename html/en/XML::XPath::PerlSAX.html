NAME
       XML::XPath::PerlSAX - A PerlSAX event generator for my weird node
       structure

SYNOPSIS
               use XML::XPath;
               use XML::XPath::PerlSAX;
               use XML::DOM::PerlSAX;

               my $xp = XML::XPath-&gt;new(filename =&gt; &apos;test.xhtml&apos;);
               my $paras = $xp-&gt;find(&apos;/html/body/p&apos;);

               my $handler = XML::DOM::PerlSAX-&gt;new();
               my $generator = XML::XPath::PerlSAX-&gt;new( Handler =&gt; $handler );

               foreach my $node ($paras-&gt;get_nodelist) {
                       my $domtree = $generator-&gt;parse($node);
                       # do something with $domtree
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module generates PerlSAX events to pass to a PerlSAX handler such as
       XML::DOM::PerlSAX. It operates specifically on my weird tree format.

       Unfortunately SAX doesn&apos;t seem to cope with namespaces, so these are lost
       completely. I believe SAX2 is doing namespaces.

Other
       The XML::DOM::PerlSAX handler I tried was completely broken (didn&apos;t even
       compile before I patched it a bit), so I don&apos;t know how correct this is
       or how far it will work.

       This software may only be distributed as part of the XML::XPath package.
