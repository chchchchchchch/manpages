NAME
       XML::XPathEngine - a re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
       module/classes that implement trees.

       In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimick
       DOM nodes. The degree of similitude between the user tree and a DOM
       dictates how much of the XPath features can be used. A module
       implementing all of the DOM should be able to use this module very easily
       (you might need to add the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered
       result sets).

       This code is a more or less direct copy of the XML::XPath module by Matt
       Sergeant. I only removed the XML processing part to remove the dependency
       on XML::Parser, applied a couple of patches, renamed a whole lot of
       methods to make Pod::Coverage happy, and changed the docs.

       The article eXtending XML XPath,
       http://www.xmltwig.com/article/extending_xml_xpath/ should give authors
       who want to use this module enough background to do so.

       Otherwise, my email is below ;--)

       WARNING: while the underlying code is rather solid, this module mostly
       lacks docs.  As they say, &quot;patches welcome&quot;...

SYNOPSIS
           use XML::XPathEngine;

           my $tree= my_tree-&gt;new( ...);
           my $xp = XML::XPathEngine-&gt;new();

           my @nodeset = $xp-&gt;find(&apos;/root/kid/grandkid[1]&apos;, $tree); # find all first grankids

           package XML::MyTree;

           # needs to provide DOM methods

DETAILS
API
       XML::XPathEngine will provide the following methods:

   new
   findnodes ($path, $context)
       Returns a list of nodes found by $path, optionally in context $context.
       In scalar context returns an XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet object.

   findnodes_as_string ($path, $context)
       Returns the nodes found as a single string. The result is not guaranteed
       to be valid XML though (it could for example be just text if the query
       returns attribute values).

   findnodes_as_strings ($path, $context)
       Returns the nodes found as a list of strings, one per node found.

   findvalue ($path, $context)
       Returns the result as a string (the concatenation of the values of the
       result nodes).

   findvalues($path, $context)
       Returns the values of the result nodes as a list of strings.
&#12;   exists ($path, $context)
       Returns true if the given path exists.

   matches($node, $path, $context)
       Returns true if the node matches the path.

   find ($path, $context)
       The find function takes an XPath expression (a string) and returns either
       a XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet object containing the nodes it found (or
       empty if no nodes matched the path), or one of XML::XPathEngine::Literal
       (a string), XML::XPathEngine::Number, or XML::XPathEngine::Boolean. It
       should always return something - and you can use -&gt;isa() to find out what
       it returned. If you need to check how many nodes it found you should
       check $nodeset-&gt;size.  See XML::XPathEngine::NodeSet.

   getNodeText ($path)
       Returns the text string for a particular node. Returns a string, or undef
       if the node doesn&apos;t exist.

   set_namespace ($prefix, $uri)
       Sets the namespace prefix mapping to the uri.

       Normally in XML::XPathEngine the prefixes in XPath node tests take their
       context from the current node. This means that foo:bar will always match
       an element &lt;foo:bar&gt; regardless of the namespace that the prefix foo is
       mapped to (which might even change within the document, resulting in
       unexpected results). In order to make prefixes in XPath node tests
       actually map to a real URI, you need to enable that via a call to the
       set_namespace method of your XML::XPathEngine object.

   clear_namespaces ()
       Clears all previously set namespace mappings.

   get_namespace ($prefix, $node)
       Returns the uri associated to the prefix for the node (mostly for
       internal usage)

   set_strict_namespaces ($strict)
       By default, for historical as well as convenience reasons,
       XML::XPathEngine has a slightly non-standard way of dealing with the
       default namespace.

       If you search for &quot;//tag&quot; it will return elements &quot;tag&quot;. As far as I
       understand it, if the document has a default namespace, this should not
       return anything.  You would have to first do a &quot;set_namespace&quot;, and then
       search using the namespace.

       Passing a true value to &quot;set_strict_namespaces&quot; will activate this
       behaviour, passing a false value will return it to its default behaviour.

   set_var ($var. $val)
       Sets an XPath variable (that can be used in queries as $var)

   get_var ($var)
       Returns the value of the XPath variable (mostly for internal usage)

   $XML::XPathEngine::Namespaces
       Set this to 0 if you don&apos;t want namespace processing to occur. This will
       make everything a little (tiny) bit faster, but you&apos;ll suffer for it,
       probably.

Node Object Model
       Nodes need to provide the same API as nodes in XML::XPath (at least the
       access API, not the tree manipulation one).

Example
       Please see the test files in t/ for examples on how to use XPath.
&#12;XPath extension
       The module supports the XPath recommendation to the same extend as
       XML::XPath (that is, rather completely).

       It includes a perl-specific extension: direct support for regular
       expressions.

       You can use the usual (in Perl!) &quot;=~&quot; and &quot;!~&quot; operators. Regular
       expressions are / delimited (no other delimiter is accepted, \ inside
       regexp must be backslashed), the &quot;imsx&quot; modifiers can be used.

         $xp-&gt;findnodes( &apos;//@att[.=~ /^v.$/]&apos;); # returns the list of attributes att
                                                # whose value matches ^v.$
