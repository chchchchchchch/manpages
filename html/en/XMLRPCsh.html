XMLRPCSH(1p)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          XMLRPCSH(1p)



NAME
       XMLRPCsh - Interactive shell for XMLRPC calls

SYNOPSIS
         perl XMLRPCsh http://betty.userland.com/RPC2
         &gt; examples.getStateName(2)
         &gt; examples.getStateNames(1,2,3,7)
         &gt; examples.getStateList([1,9])
         &gt; examples.getStateStruct({a=&gt;1, b=&gt;24})
         &gt; Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

       or

         # all parameters after uri will be executed as methods
         perl XMLRPCsh http://betty.userland.com/RPC2 examples.getStateName(2)
         &gt; Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

DESCRIPTION
       XMLRPCsh is a shell for making XMLRPC calls. It takes one parameter,
       endpoint (actually it will tell you about it if you try to run it).
       Additional commands can follow.

       After that you&apos;ll be able to run any methods of XMLRPC::Lite, like
       autotype, readable, etc. You can run it the same way as you do it in your
       Perl script. You&apos;ll see output from method, result of XMLRPC call,
       detailed info on XMLRPC faulure or transport error.

       For full list of available methods see documentation for XMLRPC::Lite.

       Along with methods of XMLRPC::Lite you&apos;ll be able (and that&apos;s much more
       interesting) run any XMLRPC methods you know about on remote server and
       see processed results. You can even switch on debugging (with call
       something like: &quot;on_debug(sub{print@_})&quot;) and see XMLRPC code with
       headers sent and received.
