XMapRequestEvent(3)              XLIB FUNCTIONS              XMapRequestEvent(3)



NAME
       XMapRequestEvent - MapRequest event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for MapRequest events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MapRequest */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window parent;
            Window window;
       } XMapRequestEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the parent window.  The window member is set
       to the window to be mapped.
