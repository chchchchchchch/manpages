XMapWindow(3)                    XLIB FUNCTIONS                    XMapWindow(3)



NAME
       XMapWindow, XMapRaised, XMapSubwindows - map windows

SYNTAX
       int XMapWindow(Display *display, Window w);

       int XMapRaised(Display *display, Window w);

       int XMapSubwindows(Display *display, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XMapWindow function maps the window and all of its subwindows that
       have had map requests.  Mapping a window that has an unmapped ancestor
       does not display the window but marks it as eligible for display when the
       ancestor becomes mapped.  Such a window is called unviewable.  When all
       its ancestors are mapped, the window becomes viewable and will be visible
       on the screen if it is not obscured by another window.  This function has
       no effect if the window is already mapped.

       If the override-redirect of the window is False and if some other client
       has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent window, then the X
       server generates a MapRequest event, and the XMapWindow function does not
       map the window.  Otherwise, the window is mapped, and the X server gener&#8208;
       ates a MapNotify event.

       If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for it are remem&#8208;
       bered, the X server tiles the window with its background.  If the win&#8208;
       dow&apos;s background is undefined, the existing screen contents are not
       altered, and the X server generates zero or more Expose events.  If back&#8208;
       ing-store was maintained while the window was unmapped, no Expose events
       are generated.  If backing-store will now be maintained, a full-window
       exposure is always generated.  Otherwise, only visible regions may be
       reported.  Similar tiling and exposure take place for any newly viewable
       inferiors.

       If the window is an InputOutput window, XMapWindow generates Expose
       events on each InputOutput window that it causes to be displayed.  If the
       client maps and paints the window and if the client begins processing
       events, the window is painted twice.  To avoid this, first ask for Expose
       events and then map the window, so the client processes input events as
       usual.  The event list will include Expose for each window that has
       appeared on the screen.  The client&apos;s normal response to an Expose event
       should be to repaint the window.  This method usually leads to simpler
       programs and to proper interaction with window managers.

       XMapWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XMapRaised function essentially is similar to XMapWindow in that it
       maps the window and all of its subwindows that have had map requests.
       However, it also raises the specified window to the top of the stack.

       XMapRaised can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XMapSubwindows function maps all subwindows for a specified window in
       top-to-bottom stacking order.  The X server generates Expose events on
       each newly displayed window.  This may be much more efficient than map&#8208;
       ping many windows one at a time because the server needs to perform much
       of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather than for each win&#8208;
       dow.

       XMapSubwindows can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
