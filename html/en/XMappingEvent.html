XMapEvent(3)                     XLIB FUNCTIONS                     XMapEvent(3)



NAME
       XMapEvent, XMappingEvent - MapNotify and MappingNotify event structures

STRUCTURES
       The structure for MapNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MapNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window event;
            Window window;
            Bool override_redirect;  /* boolean, is override set... */
       } XMapEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the window that was mapped or to its
       parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was
       selected.  The window member is set to the window that was mapped.  The
       override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the
       window.  Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the
       override-redirect attribute is True, because these events usually are
       generated from pop-ups, which override structure control.

       The structure for MappingNotify events is:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MappingNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* unused */
            int request;             /* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard,
                                        MappingPointer */
            int first_keycode;       /* first keycode */
            int count;               /* defines range of change w. first_keycode*/
       } XMappingEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The request member is set to indicate the kind of mapping change that
       occurred and can be MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard, MappingPointer.  If
       it is MappingModifier, the modifier mapping was changed.  If it is Map&#8208;
       pingKeyboard, the keyboard mapping was changed.  If it is MappingPointer,
       the pointer button mapping was changed.  The first_keycode and count mem&#8208;
       bers are set only if the request member was set to MappingKeyboard.  The
       number in first_keycode represents the first number in the range of the
       altered mapping, and count represents the number of keycodes altered.
