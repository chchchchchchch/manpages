XConfigureWindow(3)              XLIB FUNCTIONS              XConfigureWindow(3)



NAME
       XConfigureWindow, XMoveWindow, XResizeWindow, XMoveResizeWindow, XSetWin&#8208;
       dowBorderWidth, XWindowChanges - configure windows and window changes
       structure

SYNTAX
       int XConfigureWindow(Display *display, Window w, unsigned value_mask,
              XWindowChanges *changes);

       int XMoveWindow(Display *display, Window w, int x, y);

       int XResizeWindow(Display *display, Window w, unsigned width, unsigned
              height);

       int XMoveResizeWindow(Display *display, Window w, int x, int y, unsigned
              width, unsigned height);

       int XSetWindowBorderWidth(Display *display, Window w, unsigned width);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       value_mask
                 Specifies which values are to be set using information in the
                 values structure.  This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
                 valid configure window values bits.

       values    Specifies the XWindowChanges structure.

       w         Specifies the window to be reconfigured, moved, or resized..

       width     Specifies the width of the window border.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the interior dimensions
                 of the window.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which define the new location
                 of the top-left pixel of the window&apos;s border or the window
                 itself if it has no border or define the new position of the
                 window relative to its parent.

DESCRIPTION
       The XConfigureWindow function uses the values specified in the XWin&#8208;
       dowChanges structure to reconfigure a window&apos;s size, position, border,
       and stacking order.  Values not specified are taken from the existing
       geometry of the window.

       If a sibling is specified without a stack_mode or if the window is not
       actually a sibling, a BadMatch error results.  Note that the computations
       for BottomIf, TopIf, and Opposite are performed with respect to the win&#8208;
       dow&apos;s final geometry (as controlled by the other arguments passed to
       XConfigureWindow), not its initial geometry.  Any backing store contents
       of the window, its inferiors, and other newly visible windows are either
       discarded or changed to reflect the current screen contents (depending on
       the implementation).

       XConfigureWindow can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XMoveWindow function moves the specified window to the specified x
       and y coordinates, but it does not change the window&apos;s size, raise the
       window, or change the mapping state of the window.  Moving a mapped win&#8208;
       dow may or may not lose the window&apos;s contents depending on if the window
       is obscured by nonchildren and if no backing store exists.  If the con&#8208;
       tents of the window are lost, the X server generates Expose events.  Mov&#8208;
       ing a mapped window generates Expose events on any formerly obscured win&#8208;
       dows.

       If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no further processing is per&#8208;
       formed.  Otherwise, the window is moved.

       XMoveWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XResizeWindow function changes the inside dimensions of the specified
       window, not including its borders.  This function does not change the
       window&apos;s upper-left coordinate or the origin and does not restack the
       window.  Changing the size of a mapped window may lose its contents and
       generate Expose events.  If a mapped window is made smaller, changing its
       size generates Expose events on windows that the mapped window formerly
       obscured.

       If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no further processing is per&#8208;
       formed.  If either width or height is zero, a BadValue error results.

       XResizeWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

       The XMoveResizeWindow function changes the size and location of the spec&#8208;
       ified window without raising it.  Moving and resizing a mapped window may
       generate an Expose event on the window.  Depending on the new size and
       location parameters, moving and resizing a window may generate Expose
       events on windows that the window formerly obscured.

       If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and some other
       client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent, the X server
       generates a ConfigureRequest event, and no further processing is per&#8208;
       formed.  Otherwise, the window size and location are changed.

       XMoveResizeWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

       The XSetWindowBorderWidth function sets the specified window&apos;s border
       width to the specified width.

       XSetWindowBorderWidth can generate a BadWindow error.

STRUCTURES
       The XWindowChanges structure contains:

       /* Configure window value mask bits */

       lw(.5i) lw(2.5i) lw(.8i).  T{ #define T}   T{ CWX T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;0) T} T{
       #define T}   T{ CWY T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;1) T} T{ #define T}   T{ CWWidth T}   T{
       (1&lt;&lt;2) T} T{ #define T}   T{ CWHeight T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;3) T} T{ #define
       T}   T{ CWBorderWidth T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;4) T} T{ #define T}   T{ CWSibling
       T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;5) T} T{ #define T}   T{ CWStackMode T}   T{ (1&lt;&lt;6) T}
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int border_width;
            Window sibling;
            int stack_mode;
       } XWindowChanges;

       The x and y members are used to set the window&apos;s x and y coordinates,
       which are relative to the parent&apos;s origin and indicate the position of
       the upper-left outer corner of the window.  The width and height members
       are used to set the inside size of the window, not including the border,
       and must be nonzero, or a BadValue error results.  Attempts to configure
       a root window have no effect.

       The border_width member is used to set the width of the border in pixels.
       Note that setting just the border width leaves the outer-left corner of
       the window in a fixed position but moves the absolute position of the
       window&apos;s origin.  If you attempt to set the border-width attribute of an
       InputOnly window nonzero, a BadMatch error results.

       The sibling member is used to set the sibling window for stacking opera&#8208;
       tions.  The stack_mode member is used to set how the window is to be
       restacked and can be set to Above, Below, TopIf, BottomIf, or Opposite.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
