XOpenDisplay(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XOpenDisplay(3)



NAME
       XOpenDisplay, XCloseDisplay - connect or disconnect to X server

SYNTAX
       Display *XOpenDisplay(char *display_name);

       int XCloseDisplay(Display *display);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       display_name
                 Specifies the hardware display name, which determines the dis&#8208;
                 play and communications domain to be used.  On a POSIX-confor&#8208;
                 mant system, if the display_name is NULL, it defaults to the
                 value of the DISPLAY environment variable.

DESCRIPTION
       The XOpenDisplay function returns a Display structure that serves as the
       connection to the X server and that contains all the information about
       that X server.  XOpenDisplay connects your application to the X server
       through TCP or DECnet communications protocols, or through some local
       inter-process communication protocol.  If the hostname is a host machine
       name and a single colon (:) separates the hostname and display number,
       XOpenDisplay connects using TCP streams.  If the hostname is not speci&#8208;
       fied, Xlib uses whatever it believes is the fastest transport.  If the
       hostname is a host machine name and a double colon (::) separates the
       hostname and display number, XOpenDisplay connects using DECnet.  A sin&#8208;
       gle X server can support any or all of these transport mechanisms simul&#8208;
       taneously.  A particular Xlib implementation can support many more of
       these transport mechanisms.

       If successful, XOpenDisplay returns a pointer to a Display structure,
       which is defined in &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;.  If XOpenDisplay does not succeed, it
       returns NULL.  After a successful call to XOpenDisplay, all of the
       screens in the display can be used by the client.  The screen number
       specified in the display_name argument is returned by the DefaultScreen
       macro (or the XDefaultScreen function).  You can access elements of the
       Display and Screen structures only by using the information macros or
       functions.  For information about using macros and functions to obtain
       information from the Display structure, see section 2.2.1.

       The XCloseDisplay function closes the connection to the X server for the
       display specified in the Display structure and destroys all windows,
       resource IDs (Window, Font, Pixmap, Colormap, Cursor, and GContext), or
       other resources that the client has created on this display, unless the
       close-down mode of the resource has been changed (see XSetCloseDownMode).
       Therefore, these windows, resource IDs, and other resources should never
       be referenced again or an error will be generated.  Before exiting, you
       should call XCloseDisplay explicitly so that any pending errors are
       reported as XCloseDisplay performs a final XSync operation.

       XCloseDisplay can generate a BadGC error.
