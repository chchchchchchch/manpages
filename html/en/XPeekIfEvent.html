XIfEvent(3)                      XLIB FUNCTIONS                      XIfEvent(3)



NAME
       XIfEvent, XCheckIfEvent, XPeekIfEvent - check the event queue with a
       predicate procedure

SYNTAX
       int XIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent *event_return, Bool (*predicate)(),
              XPointer arg);

       Bool XCheckIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent *event_return, Bool (*predi&#8208;
              cate)(), XPointer arg);

       int XPeekIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent *event_return, Bool (*predi&#8208;
              cate)(), XPointer arg);

ARGUMENTS
       arg       Specifies the user-supplied argument that will be passed to the
                 predicate procedure.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_return
                 Returns either a copy of or  the matched event&apos;s associated
                 structure.

       predicate Specifies the procedure that is to be called to determine if
                 the next event in the queue matches what you want.

DESCRIPTION
       The XIfEvent function completes only when the specified predicate proce&#8208;
       dure returns True for an event, which indicates an event in the queue
       matches.  XIfEvent flushes the output buffer if it blocks waiting for
       additional events.  XIfEvent removes the matching event from the queue
       and copies the structure into the client-supplied XEvent structure.

       When the predicate procedure finds a match, XCheckIfEvent copies the
       matched event into the client-supplied XEvent structure and returns True.
       (This event is removed from the queue.)  If the predicate procedure finds
       no match, XCheckIfEvent returns False, and the output buffer will have
       been flushed.  All earlier events stored in the queue are not discarded.

       The XPeekIfEvent function returns only when the specified predicate pro&#8208;
       cedure returns True for an event.  After the predicate procedure finds a
       match, XPeekIfEvent copies the matched event into the client-supplied
       XEvent structure without removing the event from the queue.  XPeekIfEvent
       flushes the output buffer if it blocks waiting for additional events.

       Each of these functions requires you to pass a predicate procedure that
       determines if an event matches what you want.  Your predicate procedure
       must decide if the event is useful without calling any Xlib functions.
       If the predicate directly or indirectly causes the state of the event
       queue to change, the result is not defined.  If Xlib has been initialized
       for threads, the predicate is called with the display locked and the
       result of a call by the predicate to any Xlib function that locks the
       display is not defined unless the caller has first called XLockDisplay.

       The predicate procedure and its associated arguments are:

       Bool (*predicate)(Display *display, XEvent *event, XPointer arg)

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event     Specifies the XEvent structure.
&#12;       arg       Specifies the argument passed in from the XIfEvent, XCheck&#8208;
                 IfEvent, or XPeekIfEvent function.

       The predicate procedure is called once for each event in the queue until
       it finds a match.  After finding a match, the predicate procedure must
       return True.  If it did not find a match, it must return False.
