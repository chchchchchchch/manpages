XPropertyEvent(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XPropertyEvent(3)



NAME
       XPropertyEvent - PropertyNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for PropertyNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* PropertyNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            Atom atom;
            Time time;
            int state;               /* PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete */
       } XPropertyEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose associated property was
       changed.  The atom member is set to the property&apos;s atom and indicates
       which property was changed or desired.  The time member is set to the
       server time when the property was changed.  The state member is set to
       indicate whether the property was changed to a new value or deleted and
       can be PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete.  The state member is set to
       PropertyNewValue when a property of the window is changed using XChange&#8208;
       Property or XRotateWindowProperties (even when adding zero-length data
       using XChangeProperty) and when replacing all or part of a property with
       identical data using XChangeProperty or XRotateWindowProperties.  The
       state member is set to PropertyDelete when a property of the window is
       deleted using XDeleteProperty or, if the delete argument is True,
       XGetWindowProperty.
