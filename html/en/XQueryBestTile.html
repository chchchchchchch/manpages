XQueryBestSize(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XQueryBestSize(3)



NAME
       XQueryBestSize, XQueryBestTile, XQueryBestStipple - determine efficient
       sizes

SYNTAX
       Status XQueryBestSize(Display *display, int class, Drawable which_screen,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int
              *width_return, unsigned int *height_return);

       Status XQueryBestTile(Display *display, Drawable which_screen, unsigned
              int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int *width_return,
              unsigned int *height_return);

       Status XQueryBestStipple(Display *display, Drawable which_screen,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int
              *width_return, unsigned int *height_return);

ARGUMENTS
       class     Specifies the class that you are interested in.  You can pass
                 TileShape, CursorShape, or StippleShape.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height.

       which_screen
                 Specifies any drawable on the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height of the object best supported by the
                 display hardware.

DESCRIPTION
       The XQueryBestSize function returns the best or closest size to the spec&#8208;
       ified size.  For CursorShape, this is the largest size that can be fully
       displayed on the screen specified by which_screen.  For TileShape, this
       is the size that can be tiled fastest.  For StippleShape, this is the
       size that can be stippled fastest.  For CursorShape, the drawable indi&#8208;
       cates the desired screen.  For TileShape and StippleShape, the drawable
       indicates the screen and possibly the window class and depth.  An Inpu&#8208;
       tOnly window cannot be used as the drawable for TileShape or Stipple&#8208;
       Shape, or a BadMatch error results.

       XQueryBestSize can generate BadDrawable, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

       The XQueryBestTile function returns the best or closest size, that is,
       the size that can be tiled fastest on the screen specified by
       which_screen.  The drawable indicates the screen and possibly the window
       class and depth.  If an InputOnly window is used as the drawable, a Bad&#8208;
       Match error results.

       XQueryBestTile can generate BadDrawable and BadMatch errors.

       The XQueryBestStipple function returns the best or closest size, that is,
       the size that can be stippled fastest on the screen specified by
       which_screen.  The drawable indicates the screen and possibly the window
       class and depth.  If an InputOnly window is used as the drawable, a Bad&#8208;
       Match error results.

       XQueryBestStipple can generate BadDrawable and BadMatch errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadMatch  The values do not exist for an InputOnly window.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
