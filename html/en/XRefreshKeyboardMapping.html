XLookupKeysym(3)                 XLIB FUNCTIONS                 XLookupKeysym(3)



NAME
       XLookupKeysym, XRefreshKeyboardMapping, XLookupString, XRebindKeysym -
       handle keyboard input events in Latin-1

SYNTAX
       KeySym XLookupKeysym(XKeyEvent *key_event, int index);

       int XRefreshKeyboardMapping(XMappingEvent *event_map);

       int XLookupString(XKeyEvent *event_struct, char *buffer_return, int
              bytes_buffer, KeySym *keysym_return, XComposeStatus *sta&#8208;
              tus_in_out);

       int XRebindKeysym(Display *display, KeySym keysym, KeySym list[], int
              mod_count, unsigned char *string, int num_bytes);

ARGUMENTS
       buffer_return
                 Returns the translated characters.

       bytes_buffer
                 Specifies the length of the buffer.  No more than bytes_buffer
                 of translation are returned.

       num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes in the string argument.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_map Specifies the mapping event that is to be used.

       event_struct
                 Specifies the key event structure to be used.  You can pass
                 XKeyPressedEvent or XKeyReleasedEvent.

       index     Specifies the index into the KeySyms list for the event&apos;s Key&#8208;
                 Code.

       key_event Specifies the KeyPress or KeyRelease event.

       keysym    Specifies the KeySym that is to be .

       keysym_return
                 Returns the KeySym computed from the event if this argument is
                 not NULL.

       list      Specifies the KeySyms to be used as modifiers.

       mod_count Specifies the number of modifiers in the modifier list.

       status_in_out
                 Specifies or returns the XComposeStatus structure or NULL.

       string    Specifies the string that is copied and will be returned by
                 XLookupString.

DESCRIPTION
       The XLookupKeysym function uses a given keyboard event and the index you
       specified to return the KeySym from the list that corresponds to the Key&#8208;
       Code member in the XKeyPressedEvent or XKeyReleasedEvent structure.  If
       no KeySym is defined for the KeyCode of the event, XLookupKeysym returns
       NoSymbol.
&#12;       The XRefreshKeyboardMapping function refreshes the stored modifier and
       keymap information.  You usually call this function when a MappingNotify
       event with a request member of MappingKeyboard or MappingModifier occurs.
       The result is to update Xlib&apos;s knowledge of the keyboard.

       The XLookupString function translates a key event to a KeySym and a
       string.  The KeySym is obtained by using the standard interpretation of
       the Shift, Lock, group, and numlock modifiers as defined in the X Proto&#8208;
       col specification.  If the KeySym has been rebound (see XRebindKeysym),
       the bound string will be stored in the buffer.  Otherwise, the KeySym is
       mapped, if possible, to an ISO Latin-1 character or (if the Control modi&#8208;
       fier is on) to an ASCII control character, and that character is stored
       in the buffer.  XLookupString returns the number of characters that are
       stored in the buffer.

       If present (non-NULL), the XComposeStatus structure records the state,
       which is private to Xlib, that needs preservation across calls to
       XLookupString to implement compose processing.  The creation of XCompos&#8208;
       eStatus structures is implementation-dependent; a portable program must
       pass NULL for this argument.

       The XRebindKeysym function can be used to rebind the meaning of a KeySym
       for the client.  It does not redefine any key in the X server but merely
       provides an easy way for long strings to be attached to keys.  XLookup&#8208;
       String returns this string when the appropriate set of modifier keys are
       pressed and when the KeySym would have been used for the translation.  No
       text conversions are performed; the client is responsible for supplying
       appropriately encoded strings.  Note that you can rebind a KeySym that
       may not exist.
