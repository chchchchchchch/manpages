XAddConnectionWatch(3)           XLIB FUNCTIONS           XAddConnectionWatch(3)



NAME
       XAddConnectionWatch, XRemoveConnectionWatch, XProcessInternalConnection,
       XInternalConnectionNumbers - handle Xlib internal connections

SYNTAX
       typedef void (*XConnectionWatchProc)(Display *display, XPointer
              client_data, int fd, Bool opening, XPointer *watch_data);

       Status XAddConnectionWatch(Display *display, XWatchProc procedure,
              XPointer client_data);

       Status XRemoveConnectionWatch(Display *display, XWatchProc procedure,
              XPointer client_data);

       void XProcessInternalConnection(Display *display, int fd);

       Status XInternalConnectionNumbers(Display *display, int **fd_return, int
              *count_return);

ARGUMENTS
       client_data
                 Specifies the additional client data.

       count_return
                 Returns the number of file descriptors.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fd        Specifies the file descriptor.

       fd_return Returns the file descriptors.

       procedure Specifies the procedure to be called.

DESCRIPTION
       The XAddConnectionWatch function registers a procedure to be called each
       time Xlib opens or closes an internal connection for the specified dis&#8208;
       play.  The procedure is passed the display, the specified client_data,
       the file descriptor for the connection, a Boolean indicating whether the
       connection is being opened or closed, and a pointer to a location for
       private watch data.  If opening is True, the procedure can store a
       pointer to private data in the location pointed to by watch_data; when
       the procedure is later called for this same connection and opening is
       False, the location pointed to by watch_data will hold this same private
       data pointer.

       This function can be called at any time after a display is opened.  If
       internal connections already exist, the registered procedure will immedi&#8208;
       ately be called for each of them, before XAddConnectionWatch returns.
       XAddConnectionWatch returns a nonzero status if the procedure is success&#8208;
       fully registered; otherwise, it returns zero.

       The registered procedure should not call any Xlib functions.  If the pro&#8208;
       cedure directly or indirectly causes the state of internal connections or
       watch procedures to change, the result is not defined.  If Xlib has been
       initialized for threads, the procedure is called with the display locked
       and the result of a call by the procedure to any Xlib function that locks
       the display is not defined unless the executing thread has externally
       locked the display using XLockDisplay.

       The XRemoveConnectionWatch function removes a previously registered con&#8208;
       nection watch procedure.  The client_data must match the client_data used
       when the procedure was initially registered.


       The XProcessInternalConnection function processes input available on an
       internal connection.  This function should be called for an internal con&#8208;
       nection only after an operating system facility (for example, select or
       poll) has indicated that input is available; otherwise, the effect is not
       defined.

       The XInternalConnectionNumbers function returns a list of the file
       descriptors for all internal connections currently open for the specified
       display.  When the allocated list is no longer needed, free it by using
       XFree.  This functions returns a nonzero status if the list is success&#8208;
       fully allocated; otherwise, it returns zero.
