XReparentEvent(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XReparentEvent(3)



NAME
       XReparentEvent - ReparentNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for ReparentNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ReparentNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window event;
            Window window;
            Window parent;
            int x, y;
            Bool override_redirect;
       } XReparentEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the reparented window or to the old or
       the new parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNo&#8208;
       tify was selected.  The window member is set to the window that was
       reparented.  The parent member is set to the new parent window.  The x
       and y members are set to the reparented window&apos;s coordinates relative to
       the new parent window&apos;s origin and define the upper-left outer corner of
       the reparented window.  The override_redirect member is set to the over&#8208;
       ride-redirect attribute of the window specified by the window member.
       Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the over&#8208;
       ride_redirect member is True.
