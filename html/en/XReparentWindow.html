XReparentWindow(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XReparentWindow(3)



NAME
       XReparentWindow - reparent windows

SYNTAX
       int XReparentWindow(Display *display, Window w, Window parent, int x, int
              y);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       parent    Specifies the parent window.

       w         Specifies the window.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinatesof the position in the new par&#8208;
                 ent window.

DESCRIPTION
       If the specified window is mapped, XReparentWindow automatically performs
       an UnmapWindow request on it, removes it from its current position in the
       hierarchy, and inserts it as the child of the specified parent.  The win&#8208;
       dow is placed in the stacking order on top with respect to sibling win&#8208;
       dows.

       After reparenting the specified window, XReparentWindow causes the X
       server to generate a ReparentNotify event.  The override_redirect member
       returned in this event is set to the window&apos;s corresponding attribute.
       Window manager clients usually should ignore this window if this member
       is set to True.  Finally, if the specified window was originally mapped,
       the X server automatically performs a MapWindow request on it.

       The X server performs normal exposure processing on formerly obscured
       windows.  The X server might not generate Expose events for regions from
       the initial UnmapWindow request that are immediately obscured by the
       final MapWindow request.  A BadMatch error results if:

       &#183;    The new parent window is not on the same screen as the old parent
            window.

       &#183;    The new parent window is the specified window or an inferior of the
            specified window.

       &#183;    The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.

       &#183;    The specified window has a ParentRelative background, and the new
            parent window is not the same depth as the specified window.

       XReparentWindow can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
