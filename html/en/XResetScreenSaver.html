NAME
       XSetScreenSaver, XForceScreenSaver, XActivateScreenSaver, XResetScreen&#8208;
       Saver, XGetScreenSaver - manipulate the screen saver

SYNTAX
       int XSetScreenSaver(Display *display, int timeout, int interval, int pre&#8208;
              fer_blanking, int allow_exposures);

       int XForceScreenSaver(Display *display, int mode);

       int XActivateScreenSaver(Display *display);

       int XResetScreenSaver(Display *display);

       int XGetScreenSaver(Display *display, int *timeout_return, int *inter&#8208;
              val_return, int *prefer_blanking_return, int *allow_expo&#8208;
              sures_return);

ARGUMENTS
       allow_exposures
                 Specifies the screen save control values.  You can pass DontAl&#8208;
                 lowExposures, AllowExposures, or DefaultExposures.

       allow_exposures_return
                 Returns the current screen save control value (DontAllowExpo&#8208;
                 sures, AllowExposures, or DefaultExposures).

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       interval  Specifies the interval, in seconds, between screen saver alter&#8208;
                 ations.

       interval_return
                 Returns the interval between screen saver invocations.

       mode      Specifies the mode that is to be applied.  You can pass Screen&#8208;
                 SaverActive or ScreenSaverReset.

       prefer_blanking
                 Specifies how to enable screen blanking.  You can pass Dont&#8208;
                 PreferBlanking, PreferBlanking, or DefaultBlanking.

       prefer_blanking_return
                 Returns the current screen blanking preference (Dont&#8208;
                 PreferBlanking, PreferBlanking, or DefaultBlanking).

       timeout   Specifies the timeout, in seconds, until the screen saver turns
                 on.

       timeout_return
                 Returns the timeout, in seconds, until the screen saver turns
                 on.

DESCRIPTION
       Timeout and interval are specified in seconds.  A timeout of 0 disables
       the screen saver (but an activated screen saver is not deactivated), and
       a timeout of -1 restores the default.  Other negative values generate a
       BadValue error.  If the timeout value is nonzero, XSetScreenSaver enables
       the screen saver.  An interval of 0 disables the random-pattern motion.
       Both values are limited to a 16-bit signed integer range by the wire pro&#8208;
       tocol, despite the C prototype.  If no input from devices (keyboard,
       mouse, and so on) is generated for the specified number of timeout sec&#8208;
       onds once the screen saver is enabled, the screen saver is activated.

       For each screen, if blanking is preferred and the hardware supports video
       blanking, the screen simply goes blank.  Otherwise, if either exposures
       are allowed or the screen can be regenerated without sending Expose
       events to clients, the screen is tiled with the root window background
       tile randomly re-origined each interval seconds.  Otherwise, the screens&apos;
       state do not change, and the screen saver is not activated.  The screen
       saver is deactivated, and all screen states are restored at the next key&#8208;
       board or pointer input or at the next call to XForceScreenSaver with mode
       ScreenSaverReset.

       If the server-dependent screen saver method supports periodic change, the
       interval argument serves as a hint about how long the change period
       should be, and zero hints that no periodic change should be made.  Exam&#8208;
       ples of ways to change the screen include scrambling the colormap period&#8208;
       ically, moving an icon image around the screen periodically, or tiling
       the screen with the root window background tile, randomly re-origined
       periodically.

       XSetScreenSaver can generate a BadValue error.

       If the specified mode is ScreenSaverActive and the screen saver currently
       is deactivated, XForceScreenSaver activates the screen saver even if the
       screen saver had been disabled with a timeout of zero.  If the specified
       mode is ScreenSaverReset and the screen saver currently is enabled,
       XForceScreenSaver deactivates the screen saver if it was activated, and
       the activation timer is reset to its initial state (as if device input
       had been received).

       XForceScreenSaver can generate a BadValue error.

       The XActivateScreenSaver function activates the screen saver.

       The XResetScreenSaver function resets the screen saver.

       The XGetScreenSaver function gets the current screen saver values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
