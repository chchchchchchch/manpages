XResourceManagerString(3)        XLIB FUNCTIONS        XResourceManagerString(3)



NAME
       XResourceManagerString, XScreenResourceString - obtain server resource
       properties

SYNTAX
       char *XResourceManagerString(Display *display);

       char *XScreenResourceString(Screen *screen);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

DESCRIPTION
       The XResourceManagerString function returns the RESOURCE_MANAGER property
       from the server&apos;s root window of screen zero, which was returned when the
       connection was opened using XOpenDisplay.  The property is converted from
       type STRING to the current locale.  The conversion is identical to that
       produced by XmbTextPropertyToTextList for a single element STRING prop&#8208;
       erty.  The returned string is owned by Xlib and should not be freed by
       the client.  The property value must be in a format that is acceptable to
       XrmGetStringDatabase.  If no property exists, NULL is returned.

       The XScreenResourceString function returns the SCREEN_RESOURCES property
       from the root window of the specified screen.  The property is converted
       from type STRING to the current locale.  The conversion is identical to
       that produced by XmbTextPropertyToTextList for a single element STRING
       property.  The property value must be in a format that is acceptable to
       XrmGetStringDatabase.  If no property exists, NULL is returned.  The
       caller is responsible for freeing the returned string by using XFree.
