XSelectInput(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XSelectInput(3)



NAME
       XSelectInput - select input events

SYNTAX
       int XSelectInput(Display *display, Window w, long event_mask);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_mask
                 Specifies the event mask.

       w         Specifies the window whose events you are interested in.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSelectInput function requests that the X server report the events
       associated with the specified event mask.  Initially, X will not report
       any of these events.  Events are reported relative to a window.  If a
       window is not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to the
       closest ancestor that is interested, unless the do_not_propagate mask
       prohibits it.

       Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any previous call
       for the same window but not for other clients.  Multiple clients can
       select for the same events on the same window with the following restric&#8208;
       tions:

       &#183;    Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their
            event masks are disjoint.  When the X server generates an event, it
            reports it to all interested clients.

       &#183;    Only one client at a time can select CirculateRequest, Configur&#8208;
            eRequest, or MapRequest events, which are associated with the event
            mask SubstructureRedirectMask.

       &#183;    Only one client at a time can select a ResizeRequest event, which is
            associated with the event mask ResizeRedirectMask.

       &#183;    Only one client at a time can select a ButtonPress event, which is
            associated with the event mask ButtonPressMask.

       The server reports the event to all interested clients.

       XSelectInput can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
