XSelectionEvent(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XSelectionEvent(3)



NAME
       XSelectionEvent - SelectionNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for SelectionNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* SelectionNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window requestor;
            Atom selection;
            Atom target;
            Atom property;           /* atom or None */
            Time time;
       } XSelectionEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The requestor member is set to the window associated with the requestor
       of the selection.  The selection member is set to the atom that indicates
       the selection.  For example, PRIMARY is used for the primary selection.
       The target member is set to the atom that indicates the converted type.
       For example, PIXMAP is used for a pixmap.  The property member is set to
       the atom that indicates which property the result was stored on.  If the
       conversion failed, the property member is set to None.  The time member
       is set to the time the conversion took place and can be a timestamp or
       CurrentTime.
