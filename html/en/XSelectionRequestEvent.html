XSelectionRequestEvent(3)        XLIB FUNCTIONS        XSelectionRequestEvent(3)



NAME
       XSelectionRequestEvent - SelectionRequest event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for SelectionRequest events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* SelectionRequest */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window owner;
            Window requestor;
            Atom selection;
            Atom target;
            Atom property;
            Time time;
       } XSelectionRequestEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The owner member is set to the window that was specified by the current
       owner in its XSetSelectionOwner call.  The requestor member is set to the
       window requesting the selection.  The selection member is set to the atom
       that names the selection.  For example, PRIMARY is used to indicate the
       primary selection.  The target member is set to the atom that indicates
       the type the selection is desired in.  The property member can be a prop&#8208;
       erty name or None.  The time member is set to the timestamp or Current&#8208;
       Time value from the ConvertSelection request.
