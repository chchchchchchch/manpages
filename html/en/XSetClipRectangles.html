XSetClipOrigin(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XSetClipOrigin(3)



NAME
       XSetClipOrigin, XSetClipMask, XSetClipRectangles - GC convenience rou&#8208;
       tines

SYNTAX
       int XSetClipOrigin(Display *display, GC gc, int clip_x_origin, int
              clip_y_origin);

       int XSetClipMask(Display *display, GC gc, Pixmap pixmap);

       int XSetClipRectangles(Display *display, GC gc, int clip_x_origin, int
              clip_y_origin, XRectangle rectangles[], int n, int ordering);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       clip_x_origin
       clip_y_origin
                 Specify the x and y coordinates of the clip-mask origin.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       n         Specifies the number of rectangles.

       ordering  Specifies the ordering relations on the rectangles.  You can
                 pass Unsorted, YSorted, YXSorted, or YXBanded.

       pixmap    Specifies the pixmap or None.

       rectangles
                 Specifies an array of rectangles that define the clip-mask.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetClipOrigin function sets the clip origin in the specified GC.
       The clip-mask origin is interpreted relative to the origin of whatever
       destination drawable is specified in the graphics request.

       XSetClipOrigin can generate BadAlloc and BadGC errors.

       The XSetClipMask function sets the clip-mask in the specified GC to the
       specified pixmap.  If the clip-mask is set to None, the pixels are are
       always drawn (regardless of the clip-origin).

       XSetClipMask can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

       The XSetClipRectangles function changes the clip-mask in the specified GC
       to the specified list of rectangles and sets the clip origin.  The output
       is clipped to remain contained within the rectangles.  The clip-origin is
       interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is
       specified in a graphics request.  The rectangle coordinates are inter&#8208;
       preted relative to the clip-origin.  The rectangles should be noninter&#8208;
       secting, or the graphics results will be undefined.  Note that the list
       of rectangles can be empty, which effectively disables output.  This is
       the opposite of passing None as the clip-mask in XCreateGC, XChangeGC,
       and XSetClipMask.

       If known by the client, ordering relations on the rectangles can be spec&#8208;
       ified with the ordering argument.  This may provide faster operation by
       the server.  If an incorrect ordering is specified, the X server may gen&#8208;
       erate a BadMatch error, but it is not required to do so.  If no error is
       generated, the graphics results are undefined.  Unsorted means the rec&#8208;
       tangles are in arbitrary order.  YSorted means that the rectangles are
       nondecreasing in their Y origin.  YXSorted additionally constrains
       YSorted order in that all rectangles with an equal Y origin are nonde&#8208;
       creasing in their X origin.  YXBanded additionally constrains YXSorted by
       requiring that, for every possible Y scanline, all rectangles that
       include that scanline have an identical Y origins and Y extents.

       XSetClipRectangles can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
                 range but fails to match in some other way required by the
                 request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
