XSetCloseDownMode(3)             XLIB FUNCTIONS             XSetCloseDownMode(3)



NAME
       XSetCloseDownMode, XKillClient - control clients

SYNTAX
       int XSetCloseDownMode(Display *display, int close_mode);

       int XKillClient(Display *display, XID resource);

ARGUMENTS
       close_mode
                 Specifies the client close-down mode.  You can pass DestroyAll,
                 RetainPermanent, or RetainTemporary.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       resource  Specifies any resource associated with the client that you want
                 to destroy or AllTemporary.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetCloseDownMode defines what will happen to the client&apos;s resources
       at connection close.  A connection starts in DestroyAll mode.  For infor&#8208;
       mation on what happens to the client&apos;s resources when the close_mode
       argument is RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, see section 2.6.

       XSetCloseDownMode can generate a BadValue error.

       The XKillClient function forces a close down of the client that created
       the resource if a valid resource is specified.  If the client has already
       terminated in either RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode, all of the
       client&apos;s resources are destroyed.  If AllTemporary is specified, the
       resources of all clients that have terminated in RetainTemporary are
       destroyed (see section 2.5).  This permits implementation of window man&#8208;
       ager facilities that aid debugging.  A client can set its close-down mode
       to RetainTemporary.  If the client then crashes, its windows would not be
       destroyed.  The programmer can then inspect the application&apos;s window tree
       and use the window manager to destroy the zombie windows.

       XKillClient can generate a BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
