XSetLineAttributes(3)            XLIB FUNCTIONS            XSetLineAttributes(3)



NAME
       XSetLineAttributes, XSetDashes - GC convenience routines

SYNTAX
       int XSetLineAttributes(Display *display, GC gc, unsigned int line_width,
              int line_style, int cap_style, int join_style);

       int XSetDashes(Display *display, GC gc, int dash_offset, char
              dash_list[], int n);

ARGUMENTS
       cap_style Specifies the line-style and cap-style you want to set for the
                 specified GC.  You can pass CapNotLast, CapButt, CapRound, or
                 CapProjecting.

       dash_list Specifies the dash-list for the dashed line-style you want to
                 set for the specified GC.

       dash_offset
                 Specifies the phase of the pattern for the dashed line-style
                 you want to set for the specified GC.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       join_style
                 Specifies the line join-style you want to set for the specified
                 GC.  You can pass JoinMiter, JoinRound, or JoinBevel.

       line_style
                 Specifies the line-style you want to set for the specified GC.
                 You can pass LineSolid, LineOnOffDash, or LineDoubleDash.

       line_width
                 Specifies the line-width you want to set for the specified GC.

       n         Specifies the number of elements in dash_list.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetLineAttributes function sets the line drawing components in the
       specified GC.

       XSetLineAttributes can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, and BadValue errors.

       The XSetDashes function sets the dash-offset and dash-list attributes for
       dashed line styles in the specified GC.  There must be at least one ele&#8208;
       ment in the specified dash_list, or a BadValue error results.  The ini&#8208;
       tial and alternating elements (second, fourth, and so on) of the
       dash_list are the even dashes, and the others are the odd dashes.  Each
       element specifies a dash length in pixels.  All of the elements must be
       nonzero, or a BadValue error results.  Specifying an odd-length list is
       equivalent to specifying the same list concatenated with itself to pro&#8208;
       duce an even-length list.

       The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern, specifying how many
       pixels into the dash-list the pattern should actually begin in any single
       graphics request.  Dashing is continuous through path elements combined
       with a join-style but is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence
       of joined lines.

       The unit of measure for dashes is the same for the ordinary coordinate
       system.  Ideally, a dash length is measured along the slope of the line,
       but implementations are only required to match this ideal for horizontal
       and vertical lines.  Failing the ideal semantics, it is suggested that
       the length be measured along the major axis of the line.  The major axis
       is defined as the x axis for lines drawn at an angle of between -45 and
       +45 degrees or between 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis.  For all
       other lines, the major axis is the y axis.

       XSetDashes can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, and BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
