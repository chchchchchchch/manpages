NAME
       XSetErrorHandler, XGetErrorText, XDisplayName, XSetIOErrorHandler,
       XGetErrorDatabaseText - default error handlers

SYNTAX
       int (*XSetErrorHandler(int (*handler)(Display *, XErrorEvent *)))();

       int XGetErrorText(Display *display, int code, char *buffer_return, int
              length);

       char *XDisplayName(char *string);

       int (*XSetIOErrorHandler(int (*handler)(Display *)))();

       int XGetErrorDatabaseText(Display *display, char *name, char *message,
              char *default_string, char *buffer_return, int length);

ARGUMENTS
       buffer_return
                 Returns the error description.

       code      Specifies the error code for which you want to obtain a
                 description.

       default_string
                 Specifies the default error message if none is found in the
                 database.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       handler   Specifies the program&apos;s supplied error handler.

       length    Specifies the size of the buffer.

       message   Specifies the type of the error message.

       name      Specifies the name of the application.

       string    Specifies the character string.

DESCRIPTION
       Xlib generally calls the program&apos;s supplied error handler whenever an
       error is received.  It is not called on BadName errors from OpenFont,
       LookupColor, or AllocNamedColor protocol requests or on BadFont errors
       from a QueryFont protocol request.  These errors generally are reflected
       back to the program through the procedural interface.  Because this con&#8208;
       dition is not assumed to be fatal, it is acceptable for your error han&#8208;
       dler to return; the returned value is ignored.  However, the error han&#8208;
       dler should not call any functions (directly or indirectly) on the dis&#8208;
       play that will generate protocol requests or that will look for input
       events.  The previous error handler is returned.

       The XGetErrorText function copies a null-terminated string describing the
       specified error code into the specified buffer.  The returned text is in
       the encoding of the current locale.  It is recommended that you use this
       function to obtain an error description because extensions to Xlib may
       define their own error codes and error strings.

       The XDisplayName function returns the name of the display that XOpenDis&#8208;
       play would attempt to use.  If a NULL string is specified, XDisplayName
       looks in the environment for the display and returns the display name
       that XOpenDisplay would attempt to use.  This makes it easier to report
       to the user precisely which display the program attempted to open when
       the initial connection attempt failed.

       The XSetIOErrorHandler sets the fatal I/O error handler.  Xlib calls the
       program&apos;s supplied error handler if any sort of system call error occurs
       (for example, the connection to the server was lost).  This is assumed to
       be a fatal condition, and the called routine should not return.  If the
       I/O error handler does return, the client process exits.

       Note that the previous error handler is returned.

       The XGetErrorDatabaseText function returns a null-terminated message (or
       the default message) from the error message database.  Xlib uses this
       function internally to look up its error messages.  The text in the
       default_string argument is assumed to be in the encoding of the current
       locale, and the text stored in the buffer_return argument is in the
       encoding of the current locale.

       The name argument should generally be the name of your application.  The
       message argument should indicate which type of error message you want.
       If the name and message are not in the Host Portable Character Encoding,
       the result is implementation-dependent.  Xlib uses three predefined
       ``application names&apos;&apos; to report errors.  In these names, uppercase and
       lowercase matter.

       XProtoError
                 The protocol error number is used as a string for the message
                 argument.

       XlibMessage
                 These are the message strings that are used internally by the
                 library.

       XRequest  For a core protocol request, the major request protocol number
                 is used for the message argument.  For an extension request,
                 the extension name (as given by InitExtension) followed by a
                 period (.) and the minor request protocol number is used for
                 the message argument.  If no string is found in the error data&#8208;
                 base, the default_string is returned to the buffer argument.
