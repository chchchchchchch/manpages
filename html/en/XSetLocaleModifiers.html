XSupportsLocale(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XSupportsLocale(3)



NAME
       XSupportsLocale, XSetLocaleModifiers - determine locale support and con&#8208;
       figure locale modifiers

SYNTAX
       Bool XSupportsLocale(void);

       char *XSetLocaleModifiers(char *modifier_list);

ARGUMENTS
       modifier_list
                 Specifies the modifiers.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSupportsLocale function returns True if Xlib functions are capable
       of operating under the current locale.  If it returns False, Xlib locale-
       dependent functions for which the XLocaleNotSupported return status is
       defined will return XLocaleNotSupported.  Other Xlib locale-dependent
       routines will operate in the ``C&apos;&apos; locale.

       The XSetLocaleModifiers function sets the X modifiers for the current
       locale setting.  The modifier_list argument is a null-terminated string
       of the form ``{@category=value}&apos;&apos;, that is, having zero or more concate&#8208;
       nated ``@category=value&apos;&apos; entries, where category is a category name and
       value is the (possibly empty) setting for that category.  The values are
       encoded in the current locale.  Category names are restricted to the
       POSIX Portable Filename Character Set.

       The local host X locale modifiers announcer (on POSIX-compliant systems,
       the XMODIFIERS environment variable) is appended to the modifier_list to
       provide default values on the local host.  If a given category appears
       more than once in the list, the first setting in the list is used.  If a
       given category is not included in the full modifier list, the category is
       set to an implementation-dependent default for the current locale.  An
       empty value for a category explicitly specifies the implementation-depen&#8208;
       dent default.

       If the function is successful, it returns a pointer to a string.  The
       contents of the string are such that a subsequent call with that string
       (in the same locale) will restore the modifiers to the same settings.  If
       modifier_list is a NULL pointer, XSetLocaleModifiers also returns a
       pointer to such a string, and the current locale modifiers are not
       changed.

       If invalid values are given for one or more modifier categories supported
       by the locale, a NULL pointer is returned, and none of the current modi&#8208;
       fiers are changed.

       At program startup, the modifiers that are in effect are unspecified
       until the first successful call to set them.  Whenever the locale is
       changed, the modifiers that are in effect become unspecified until the
       next successful call to set them.  Clients should always call XSetLocale&#8208;
       Modifiers with a non-NULL modifier_list after setting the locale before
       they call any locale-dependent Xlib routine.

       The only standard modifier category currently defined is ``im&apos;&apos;, which
       identifies the desired input method.  The values for input method are not
       standardized.  A single locale may use multiple input methods, switching
       input method under user control.  The modifier may specify the initial
       input method in effect or an ordered list of input methods.  Multiple
       input methods may be specified in a single im value string in an imple&#8208;
       mentation-dependent manner.

       The returned modifiers string is owned by Xlib and should not be modified
       or freed by the client.  It may be freed by Xlib after the current locale
       or modifiers are changed.  Until freed, it will not be modified by Xlib.
