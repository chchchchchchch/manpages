XSetPointerMapping(3)            XLIB FUNCTIONS            XSetPointerMapping(3)



NAME
       XSetPointerMapping, XGetPointerMapping - manipulate pointer settings

SYNTAX
       int XSetPointerMapping(Display *display, unsigned char map[], int nmap);

       int XGetPointerMapping(Display *display, unsigned char map_return[], int
              nmap);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       map       Specifies the mapping list.

       map_return
                 Returns the mapping list.

       nmap      Specifies the number of items in the mapping list.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetPointerMapping function sets the mapping of the pointer.  If it
       succeeds, the X server generates a MappingNotify event, and XSetPoint&#8208;
       erMapping returns MappingSuccess.  Element map[i] defines the logical
       button number for the physical button i+1.  The length of the list must
       be the same as XGetPointerMapping would return, or a BadValue error
       results.  A zero element disables a button, and elements are not
       restricted in value by the number of physical buttons.  However, no two
       elements can have the same nonzero value, or a BadValue error results.
       If any of the buttons to be altered are logically in the down state,
       XSetPointerMapping returns MappingBusy, and the mapping is not changed.

       XSetPointerMapping can generate a BadValue error.

       The XGetPointerMapping function returns the current mapping of the
       pointer.  Pointer buttons are numbered starting from one.  XGetPoint&#8208;
       erMapping returns the number of physical buttons actually on the pointer.
       The nominal mapping for a pointer is map[i]=i+1.  The nmap argument spec&#8208;
       ifies the length of the array where the pointer mapping is returned, and
       only the first nmap elements are returned in map_return.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
