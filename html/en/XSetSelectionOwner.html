XSetSelectionOwner(3)            XLIB FUNCTIONS            XSetSelectionOwner(3)



NAME
       XSetSelectionOwner, XGetSelectionOwner, XConvertSelection - manipulate
       window selection

SYNTAX
       int XSetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom selection, Window owner,
              Time time);

       Window XGetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom selection);

       int XConvertSelection(Display *display, Atom selection, Atom target, Atom
              property, Window requestor, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       owner     Specifies the owner of the specified selection atom.  You can
                 pass a window or None.

       property  Specifies the property name.  You also can pass None.

       requestor Specifies the requestor.

       selection Specifies the selection atom.

       target    Specifies the target atom.

       time      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or Cur&#8208;
                 rentTime.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetSelectionOwner function changes the owner and last-change time
       for the specified selection and has no effect if the specified time is
       earlier than the current last-change time of the specified selection or
       is later than the current X server time.  Otherwise, the last-change time
       is set to the specified time, with CurrentTime replaced by the current
       server time.  If the owner window is specified as None, then the owner of
       the selection becomes None (that is, no owner).  Otherwise, the owner of
       the selection becomes the client executing the request.

       If the new owner (whether a client or None) is not the same as the cur&#8208;
       rent owner of the selection and the current owner is not None, the cur&#8208;
       rent owner is sent a SelectionClear event.  If the client that is the
       owner of a selection is later terminated (that is, its connection is
       closed) or if the owner window it has specified in the request is later
       destroyed, the owner of the selection automatically reverts to None, but
       the last-change time is not affected.  The selection atom is uninter&#8208;
       preted by the X server.  XGetSelectionOwner returns the owner window,
       which is reported in SelectionRequest and SelectionClear events.  Selec&#8208;
       tions are global to the X server.

       XSetSelectionOwner can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetSelectionOwner function returns the window ID associated with the
       window that currently owns the specified selection.  If no selection was
       specified, the function returns the constant None.  If None is returned,
       there is no owner for the selection.

       XGetSelectionOwner can generate a BadAtom error.

       XConvertSelection requests that the specified selection be converted to
       the specified target type:

       &#183;    If the specified selection has an owner, the X server sends a Selec&#8208;
            tionRequest event to that owner.

       &#183;    If no owner for the specified selection exists, the X server gener&#8208;
            ates a SelectionNotify event to the requestor with property None.

       The arguments are passed on unchanged in either of the events.  There are
       two predefined selection atoms: PRIMARY and SECONDARY.

       XConvertSelection can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
