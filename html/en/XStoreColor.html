XStoreColors(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XStoreColors(3)



NAME
       XStoreColors, XStoreColor, XStoreNamedColor - set colors

SYNTAX
       int XStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XColor color[], int
              ncolors);

       int XStoreColor(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XColor *color);

       int XStoreNamedColor(Display *display, Colormap colormap, char *color,
              unsigned long pixel, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       color     Specifies the pixel and RGB values or the color name string
                 (for example, red).

       color     Specifies an array of color definition structures to be stored.

       colormap  Specifies the colormap.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       flags     Specifies which red, green, and blue components are set.

       ncolors   Specifies the number of XColor structures in the color defini&#8208;
                 tion array.

       pixel     Specifies the entry in the colormap.

DESCRIPTION
       The XStoreColors function changes the colormap entries of the pixel val&#8208;
       ues specified in the pixel members of the XColor structures.  You specify
       which color components are to be changed by setting DoRed, DoGreen,
       and/or DoBlue in the flags member of the XColor structures.  If the col&#8208;
       ormap is an installed map for its screen, the changes are visible immedi&#8208;
       ately.  XStoreColors changes the specified pixels if they are allocated
       writable in the colormap by any client, even if one or more pixels gener&#8208;
       ates an error.  If a specified pixel is not a valid index into the col&#8208;
       ormap, a BadValue error results.  If a specified pixel either is unallo&#8208;
       cated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error results.  If more than
       one pixel is in error, the one that gets reported is arbitrary.

       XStoreColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

       The XStoreColor function changes the colormap entry of the pixel value
       specified in the pixel member of the XColor structure.  You specified
       this value in the pixel member of the XColor structure.  This pixel value
       must be a read/write cell and a valid index into the colormap.  If a
       specified pixel is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error
       results.  XStoreColor also changes the red, green, and/or blue color com&#8208;
       ponents.  You specify which color components are to be changed by setting
       DoRed, DoGreen, and/or DoBlue in the flags member of the XColor struc&#8208;
       ture.  If the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the changes
       are visible immediately.

       XStoreColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

       The XStoreNamedColor function looks up the named color with respect to
       the screen associated with the colormap and stores the result in the
       specified colormap.  The pixel argument determines the entry in the col&#8208;
       ormap.  The flags argument determines which of the red, green, and blue
       components are set.  You can set this member to the bitwise inclusive OR
       of the bits DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue.  If the color name is not in the
       Host Portable Character Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.
       Use of uppercase or lowercase does not matter.  If the specified pixel is
       not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error results.  If the
       specified pixel either is unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAc&#8208;
       cess error results.

       XStoreNamedColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor, BadName, and BadValue
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not
                 already allocate.

       BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.

       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Col&#8208;
                 ormap.

       BadName   A font or color of the specified name does not exist.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
