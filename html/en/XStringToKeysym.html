XStringToKeysym(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XStringToKeysym(3)



NAME
       XStringToKeysym, XKeysymToString, XKeycodeToKeysym, XKeysymToKeycode,
       XConvertCase - convert keysyms

SYNTAX
       KeySym XStringToKeysym(char *string);

       char *XKeysymToString(KeySym keysym);

       KeySym XKeycodeToKeysym(Display *display, KeyCode keycode, int index);

       KeyCode XKeysymToKeycode(Display *display, KeySym keysym);

       void XConvertCase(KeySym keysym, KeySym *lower_return, KeySym
              *upper_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       index     Specifies the element of KeyCode vector.

       keycode   Specifies the KeyCode.

       keysym    Specifies the KeySym that is to be searched for or converted.

       lower_return
                 Returns the lowercase form of keysym, or keysym.

       string    Specifies the name of the KeySym that is to be converted.

       upper_return
                 Returns the uppercase form of keysym, or keysym.

DESCRIPTION
       Standard KeySym names are obtained from &lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt; by removing the
       XK_ prefix from each name.  KeySyms that are not part of the Xlib stan&#8208;
       dard also may be obtained with this function.  The set of KeySyms that
       are available in this manner and the mechanisms by which Xlib obtains
       them is implementation-dependent.

       If the KeySym name is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the
       result is implementation-dependent.  If the specified string does not
       match a valid KeySym, XStringToKeysym returns NoSymbol.

       The returned string is in a static area and must not be modified.  The
       returned string is in the Host Portable Character Encoding.  If the spec&#8208;
       ified KeySym is not defined, XKeysymToString returns a NULL.

       The XKeycodeToKeysym function uses internal Xlib tables and returns the
       KeySym defined for the specified KeyCode and the element of the KeyCode
       vector.  If no symbol is defined, XKeycodeToKeysym returns NoSymbol.
       XKeycodeToKeysym predates the XKB extension. If you want to lookup a
       KeySym while using XKB you have to use XkbKeycodeToKeysym.

       If the specified KeySym is not defined for any KeyCode, XKeysymToKeycode
       returns zero.

       The XConvertCase function returns the uppercase and lowercase forms of
       the specified Keysym, if the KeySym is subject to case conversion; other&#8208;
       wise, the specified KeySym is returned to both lower_return and
       upper_return.  Support for conversion of other than Latin and Cyrillic
       KeySyms is implementation-dependent.
