XTextExtents(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XTextExtents(3)



NAME
       XTextExtents, XTextExtents16, XQueryTextExtents, XQueryTextExtents16 -
       compute or query text extents

SYNTAX
       int XTextExtents(XFontStruct *font_struct, char *string, int nchars, int
              *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int
              *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XTextExtents16(XFontStruct *font_struct, XChar2b *string, int nchars,
              int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int
              *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XQueryTextExtents(Display *display, XID font_ID, char *string, int
              nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int
              *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XQueryTextExtents16(Display *display, XID font_ID, XChar2b *string,
              int nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int
              *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

ARGUMENTS
       direction_return
                 Returns the value of the direction hint (FontLeftToRight or
                 FontRightToLeft).

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       font_ID   Specifies either the font ID or the GContext ID that contains
                 the font.

       font_ascent_return
                 Returns the font ascent.

       font_descent_return
                 Returns the font descent.

       font_struct
                 Specifies the XFontStruct structure.

       nchars    Specifies the number of characters in the character string.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       overall_return
                 Returns the overall size in the specified XCharStruct struc&#8208;
                 ture.

DESCRIPTION
       The XTextExtents and XTextExtents16 functions perform the size computa&#8208;
       tion locally and, thereby, avoid the round-trip overhead of XQueryTextEx&#8208;
       tents and XQueryTextExtents16.  Both functions return an XCharStruct
       structure, whose members are set to the values as follows.

       The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all
       characters in the string.  The descent member is set to the maximum of
       the descent metrics.  The width member is set to the sum of the charac&#8208;
       ter-width metrics of all characters in the string.  For each character in
       the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all char&#8208;
       acters preceding it in the string.  Let L be the left-side-bearing metric
       of the character plus W.  Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the
       character plus W.  The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all
       characters in the string.  The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.

       For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix index&#8208;
       ing, each XChar2b structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1
       as the most significant byte.  If the font has no defined default charac&#8208;
       ter, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero met&#8208;
       rics.

       The XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 functions return the bound&#8208;
       ing box of the specified 8-bit and 16-bit character string in the speci&#8208;
       fied font or the font contained in the specified GC.  These functions
       query the X server and, therefore, suffer the round-trip overhead that is
       avoided by XTextExtents and XTextExtents16.  Both functions return a
       XCharStruct structure, whose members are set to the values as follows.

       The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all
       characters in the string.  The descent member is set to the maximum of
       the descent metrics.  The width member is set to the sum of the charac&#8208;
       ter-width metrics of all characters in the string.  For each character in
       the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all char&#8208;
       acters preceding it in the string.  Let L be the left-side-bearing metric
       of the character plus W.  Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the
       character plus W.  The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all
       characters in the string.  The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.

       For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix index&#8208;
       ing, each XChar2b structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1
       as the most significant byte.  If the font has no defined default charac&#8208;
       ter, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero met&#8208;
       rics.

       Characters with all zero metrics are ignored.  If the font has no defined
       default_char, the undefined characters in the string are also ignored.

       XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 can generate BadFont and BadGC
       errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadFont   A value for a Font or GContext argument does not name a defined
                 Font.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GCon&#8208;
                 text.
