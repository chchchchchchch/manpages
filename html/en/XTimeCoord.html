XSendEvent(3)                    XLIB FUNCTIONS                    XSendEvent(3)



NAME
       XSendEvent, XDisplayMotionBufferSize, XGetMotionEvents, XTimeCoord - send
       events and pointer motion history structure

SYNTAX
       Status XSendEvent(Display *display, Window w, Bool propagate, long
              event_mask, XEvent *event_send);

       unsigned long XDisplayMotionBufferSize(Display *display);

       XTimeCoord *XGetMotionEvents(Display *display, Window w, Time start, Time
              stop, int *nevents_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_mask
                 Specifies the event mask.

       event_send
                 Specifies the event that is to be sent.

       nevents_return
                 Returns the number of events from the motion history buffer.

       propagate Specifies a Boolean value.

       start
       stop      Specify the time interval in which the events are returned from
                 the motion history buffer.  You can pass a timestamp or Cur&#8208;
                 rentTime.  PointerWindow, or InputFocus.

       w         Specifies the window the window the event is to be sent to,.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSendEvent function identifies the destination window, determines
       which clients should receive the specified events, and ignores any active
       grabs.  This function requires you to pass an event mask.  For a discus&#8208;
       sion of the valid event mask names, see section 10.3.  This function uses
       the w argument to identify the destination window as follows:

       &#183;    If w is PointerWindow, the destination window is the window that
            contains the pointer.

       &#183;    If w is InputFocus and if the focus window contains the pointer, the
            destination window is the window that contains the pointer; other&#8208;
            wise, the destination window is the focus window.

       To determine which clients should receive the specified events, XSendE&#8208;
       vent uses the propagate argument as follows:

       &#183;    If event_mask is the empty set, the event is sent to the client that
            created the destination window.  If that client no longer exists, no
            event is sent.

       &#183;    If propagate is False, the event is sent to every client selecting
            on destination any of the event types in the event_mask argument.

       &#183;    If propagate is True and no clients have selected on destination any
            of the event types in event-mask, the destination is replaced with
            the closest ancestor of destination for which some client has
            selected a type in event-mask and for which no intervening window
            has that type in its do-not-propagate-mask.  If no such window
            exists or if the window is an ancestor of the focus window and
            InputFocus was originally specified as the destination, the event is
            not sent to any clients.  Otherwise, the event is reported to every
            client selecting on the final destination any of the types specified
            in event_mask.

       The event in the XEvent structure must be one of the core events or one
       of the events defined by an extension (or a BadValue error results) so
       that the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as necessary.  The
       contents of the event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X
       server except to force send_event to True in the forwarded event and to
       set the serial number in the event correctly; therefore these fields and
       the display field are ignored by XSendEvent.

       XSendEvent returns zero if the conversion to wire protocol format failed
       and returns nonzero otherwise.  XSendEvent can generate BadValue and Bad&#8208;
       Window errors.

       The server may retain the recent history of the pointer motion and do so
       to a finer granularity than is reported by MotionNotify events.  The
       XGetMotionEvents function makes this history available.

       The XGetMotionEvents function returns all events in the motion history
       buffer that fall between the specified start and stop times, inclusive,
       and that have coordinates that lie within the specified window (including
       its borders) at its present placement.  If the server does not support
       motion history, if the start time is later than the stop time, or if the
       start time is in the future, no events are returned; XGetMotionEvents
       returns NULL.  If the stop time is in the future, it is equivalent to
       specifying CurrentTime.  XGetMotionEvents can generate a BadWindow error.

STRUCTURES
       The XTimeCoord structure contains:

       typedef struct {
            Time time;
            short x, y;
       } XTimeCoord;

       The time member is set to the time, in milliseconds.  The x and y members
       are set to the coordinates of the pointer and are reported relative to
       the origin of the specified window.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
