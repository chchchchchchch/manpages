XUnmapWindow(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XUnmapWindow(3)



NAME
       XUnmapWindow, XUnmapSubwindows - unmap windows

SYNTAX
       int XUnmapWindow(Display *display, Window w);

       int XUnmapSubwindows(Display *display, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The XUnmapWindow function unmaps the specified window and causes the X
       server to generate an UnmapNotify event.  If the specified window is
       already unmapped, XUnmapWindow has no effect.  Normal exposure processing
       on formerly obscured windows is performed.  Any child window will no
       longer be visible until another map call is made on the parent.  In other
       words, the subwindows are still mapped but are not visible until the par&#8208;
       ent is mapped.  Unmapping a window will generate Expose events on windows
       that were formerly obscured by it.

       XUnmapWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XUnmapSubwindows function unmaps all subwindows for the specified
       window in bottom-to-top stacking order.  It causes the X server to gener&#8208;
       ate an UnmapNotify event on each subwindow and Expose events on formerly
       obscured windows.  Using this function is much more efficient than unmap&#8208;
       ping multiple windows one at a time because the server needs to perform
       much of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather than for each
       window.

       XUnmapSubwindows can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
