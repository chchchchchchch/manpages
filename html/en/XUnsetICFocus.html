XSetICFocus(3)                   XLIB FUNCTIONS                   XSetICFocus(3)



NAME
       XSetICFocus, XUnsetICFocus - set and unset input context focus

SYNTAX
       void XSetICFocus(XIC ic);

       void XUnsetICFocus(XIC ic);

ARGUMENTS
       ic        Specifies the input context.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetICFocus function allows a client to notify an input method that
       the focus window attached to the specified input context has received
       keyboard focus.  The input method should take action to provide appropri&#8208;
       ate feedback.  Complete feedback specification is a matter of user inter&#8208;
       face policy.

       Calling XSetICFocus does not affect the focus window value.

       The XUnsetICFocus function allows a client to notify an input method that
       the specified input context has lost the keyboard focus and that no more
       input is expected on the focus window attached to that input context.
       The input method should take action to provide appropriate feedback.
       Complete feedback specification is a matter of user interface policy.

       Calling XUnsetICFocus does not affect the focus window value; the client
       may still receive events from the input method that are directed to the
       focus window.
