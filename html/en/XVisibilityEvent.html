XVisibilityEvent(3)              XLIB FUNCTIONS              XVisibilityEvent(3)



NAME
       XVisibilityEvent - VisibilityNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for VisibilityNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* VisibilityNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            int state;
       } XVisibilityEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
       identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
       event to a client application, it sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent structure
       with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to
       a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is
       set to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request.  The
       serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
       The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
       dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose visibility state changes.
       The state member is set to the state of the window&apos;s visibility and can
       be VisibilityUnobscured, VisibilityPartiallyObscured, or VisibilityFully&#8208;
       Obscured.  The X server ignores all of a window&apos;s subwindows when deter&#8208;
       mining the visibility state of the window and processes VisibilityNotify
       events according to the following:

       &#183;    When the window changes state from partially obscured, fully
            obscured, or not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured, the
            X server generates the event with the state member of the XVisibili&#8208;
            tyEvent structure set to VisibilityUnobscured.

       &#183;    When the window changes state from viewable and completely unob&#8208;
            scured or not viewable to viewable and partially obscured, the X
            server generates the event with the state member of the XVisibili&#8208;
            tyEvent structure set to VisibilityPartiallyObscured.

       &#183;    When the window changes state from viewable and completely unob&#8208;
            scured, viewable and partially obscured, or not viewable to viewable
            and fully obscured, the X server generates the event with the state
            member of the XVisibilityEvent structure set to VisibilityFullyOb&#8208;
            scured.
