XParseGeometry(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XParseGeometry(3)



NAME
       XParseGeometry, XWMGeometry - parse window geometry

SYNTAX
       int XParseGeometry(char *parsestring, int *x_return, int *y_return,
              unsigned int *width_return, unsigned int *height_return);

       int XWMGeometry(Display *display, int screen, char *user_geom, char
              *def_geom, unsigned int bwidth, XSizeHints *hints, int *x_return,
              int *y_return, int *width_return, int *height_return, int *grav&#8208;
              ity_return);

ARGUMENTS
       position
       default_position
                 Specify the geometry specifications.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fheight
       fwidth    Specify the font height and width in pixels (increment size).

       parsestring
                 Specifies the string you want to parse.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height determined.

       xadder
       yadder    Specify additional interior padding needed in the window.

       x_return
       y_return  Return the x and y offsets.

       bwidth    Specifies the border width.

       hints     Specifies the size hints for the window in its normal state.

       def_geom  Specifies the application&apos;s default geometry or NULL.

       gravity_return
                 Returns the window gravity.

       user_geom Specifies the user-specified geometry or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       By convention, X applications use a standard string to indicate window
       size and placement.  XParseGeometry makes it easier to conform to this
       standard because it allows you to parse the standard window geometry.
       Specifically, this function lets you parse strings of the form:

       [=][&lt;width&gt;{xX}&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]

       The fields map into the arguments associated with this function.  (Items
       enclosed in &lt;&gt; are integers, items in [] are optional, and items enclosed
       in {} indicate ``choose one of.&apos;&apos;  Note that the brackets should not
       appear in the actual string.)  If the string is not in the Host Portable
       Character Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.
&#12;       The XParseGeometry function returns a bitmask that indicates which of the
       four values (width, height, xoffset, and yoffset) were actually found in
       the string and whether the x and y values are negative.  By convention,
       -0 is not equal to +0, because the user needs to be able to say ``posi&#8208;
       tion the window relative to the right or bottom edge.&apos;&apos;  For each value
       found, the corresponding argument is updated.  For each value not found,
       the argument is left unchanged.  The bits are represented by XValue,
       YValue, WidthValue, HeightValue, XNegative, or YNegative and are defined
       in &lt;X11/Xutil.h&gt;.  They will be set whenever one of the values is defined
       or one of the signs is set.

       If the function returns either the XValue or YValue flag, you should
       place the window at the requested position.

       The XWMGeometry function combines any geometry information (given in the
       format used by XParseGeometry) specified by the user and by the calling
       program with size hints (usually the ones to be stored in WM_NOR&#8208;
       MAL_HINTS) and returns the position, size, and gravity (NorthWestGravity,
       NorthEastGravity, SouthEastGravity, or SouthWestGravity) that describe
       the window.  If the base size is not set in the XSizeHints structure, the
       minimum size is used if set.  Otherwise, a base size of zero is assumed.
       If no minimum size is set in the hints structure, the base size is used.
       A mask (in the form returned by XParseGeometry) that describes which val&#8208;
       ues came from the user specification and whether or not the position
       coordinates are relative to the right and bottom edges is returned.  Note
       that these coordinates will have already been accounted for in the
       x_return and y_return values.

       Note that invalid geometry specifications can cause a width or height of
       zero to be returned.  The caller may pass the address of the hints
       win_gravity field as gravity_return to update the hints directly.
