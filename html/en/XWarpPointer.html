XWarpPointer(3)                  XLIB FUNCTIONS                  XWarpPointer(3)



NAME
       XWarpPointer - move pointer

SYNTAX
       int XWarpPointer(Display *display, Window src_w, Window dest_w, int
              src_x, int src_y, unsigned int src_width, unsigned int src_height,
              int dest_x, int dest_y);

ARGUMENTS
       dest_w    Specifies the destination window or None.

       dest_x
       dest_y    Specify the x and y coordinates within the destination window.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       src_x
       src_y
       src_width
       src_height
                 Specify a rectangle in the source window.

       src_w     Specifies the source window or None.

DESCRIPTION
       If dest_w is None, XWarpPointer moves the pointer by the offsets (dest_x,
       dest_y) relative to the current position of the pointer.  If dest_w is a
       window, XWarpPointer moves the pointer to the offsets (dest_x, dest_y)
       relative to the origin of dest_w.  However, if src_w is a window, the
       move only takes place if the window src_w contains the pointer and if the
       specified rectangle of src_w contains the pointer.

       The src_x and src_y coordinates are relative to the origin of src_w.  If
       src_height is zero, it is replaced with the current height of src_w minus
       src_y.  If src_width is zero, it is replaced with the current width of
       src_w minus src_x.

       There is seldom any reason for calling this function.  The pointer should
       normally be left to the user.  If you do use this function, however, it
       generates events just as if the user had instantaneously moved the
       pointer from one position to another.  Note that you cannot use XWarp&#8208;
       Pointer to move the pointer outside the confine_to window of an active
       pointer grab.  An attempt to do so will only move the pointer as far as
       the closest edge of the confine_to window.

       XWarpPointer can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
