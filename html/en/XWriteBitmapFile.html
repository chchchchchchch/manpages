NAME
       XReadBitmapFile, XReadBitmapFileData, XWriteBitmapFile, XCre&#8208;
       atePixmapFromBitmapData, XCreateBitmapFromData - manipulate bitmaps

SYNTAX
       int XReadBitmapFile(Display *display, Drawable d, char *filename,
              unsigned int *width_return, unsigned int *height_return, Pixmap
              *bitmap_return, int *x_hot_return, int *y_hot_return);

       int XReadBitmapFileData(char *filename, unsigned int *width_return,
              unsigned int *height_return, unsigned char *data_return, int
              *x_hot_return, int *y_hot_return);

       int XWriteBitmapFile(Display *display, char *filename, Pixmap bitmap,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height, int x_hot, int y_hot);

       Pixmap XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData(Display *display, Drawable d, char
              *data, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned long fg,
              unsigned long bg, unsigned int depth);

       Pixmap XCreateBitmapFromData(Display *display, Drawable d, char *data,
              unsigned int width, unsigned int height);

ARGUMENTS
       bitmap    Specifies the bitmap.

       bitmap_return
                 Returns the bitmap that is created.

       d         Specifies the drawable that indicates the screen.

       data      Specifies the data in bitmap format.

       data      Specifies the location of the bitmap data.

       data_return
                 Returns the bitmap data.

       depth     Specifies the depth of the pixmap.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fg
       bg        Specify the foreground and background pixel values to use.

       filename  Specifies the file name to use.  The format of the file name is
                 operating-system dependent.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height values of the read in bitmap file.

       x_hot
       y_hot     Specify where to place the hotspot coordinates (or -1,-1 if
                 none are present) in the file.

       x_hot_return
       y_hot_return
                 Return the hotspot coordinates.
&#12;DESCRIPTION
       The XReadBitmapFile function reads in a file containing a bitmap.  The
       file is parsed in the encoding of the current locale.  The ability to
       read other than the standard format is implementation-dependent.  If the
       file cannot be opened, XReadBitmapFile returns BitmapOpenFailed.  If the
       file can be opened but does not contain valid bitmap data, it returns
       BitmapFileInvalid.  If insufficient working storage is allocated, it
       returns BitmapNoMemory.  If the file is readable and valid, it returns
       BitmapSuccess.

       XReadBitmapFile returns the bitmap&apos;s height and width, as read from the
       file, to width_return and height_return.  It then creates a pixmap of the
       appropriate size, reads the bitmap data from the file into the pixmap,
       and assigns the pixmap to the caller&apos;s variable bitmap.  The caller must
       free the bitmap using XFreePixmap when finished.  If name_x_hot and
       name_y_hot exist, XReadBitmapFile returns them to x_hot_return and
       y_hot_return; otherwise, it returns -1,-1.

       XReadBitmapFile can generate BadAlloc and BadDrawable errors.

       The XReadBitmapFileData function reads in a file containing a bitmap, in
       the same manner as XReadBitmapFile, but returns the data directly rather
       than creating a pixmap in the server.  The bitmap data is returned in
       data_return; the client must free this storage when finished with it by
       calling XFree.  The status and other return values are the same as for
       XReadBitmapFile.

       The XWriteBitmapFile function writes a bitmap out to a file in the X Ver&#8208;
       sion 11 format.  The name used in the output file is derived from the
       file name by deleting the directory prefix.  The file is written in the
       encoding of the current locale.  If the file cannot be opened for writ&#8208;
       ing, it returns BitmapOpenFailed.  If insufficient memory is allocated,
       XWriteBitmapFile returns BitmapNoMemory; otherwise, on no error, it
       returns BitmapSuccess.  If x_hot and y_hot are not -1, -1, XWriteBitmap&#8208;
       File writes them out as the hotspot coordinates for the bitmap.

       XWriteBitmapFile can generate BadDrawable and BadMatch errors.

       The XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData function creates a pixmap of the given
       depth and then does a bitmap-format XPutImage of the data into it.  The
       depth must be supported by the screen of the specified drawable, or a
       BadMatch error results.

       XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData can generate BadAlloc and BadMatch errors.

       The XCreateBitmapFromData function allows you to include in your C pro&#8208;
       gram (using #include) a bitmap file that was written out by XWriteBitmap&#8208;
       File (X version 11 format only) without reading in the bitmap file.  The
       following example creates a gray bitmap:

       #include &quot;gray.bitmap&quot;
       Pixmap bitmap;
       bitmap = XCreateBitmapFromData(display, window, gray_bits, gray_width, gray_height);

       If insufficient working storage was allocated, XCreateBitmapFromData
       returns None.  It is your responsibility to free the bitmap using XFreeP&#8208;
       ixmap when finished.

       XCreateBitmapFromData can generate a BadAlloc error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window
                 or Pixmap.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.
