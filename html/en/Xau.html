NAME
       Xau   library:   XauFileName,  XauReadAuth,  XauLockAuth,  XauUnlockAuth,
       XauWriteAuth, XauDisposeAuth, XauGetAuthByAddr, XauGetBestAuthByAddr -  X
       authority database routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;X11/Xauth.h&gt;

       typedef struct xauth {
            unsigned short family;
            unsigned short address_length;
            char           *address;
            unsigned short number_length;
            char           *number;
            unsigned short name_length;
            char           *name;
            unsigned short data_length;
            char           *data;
       } Xauth;


       char *XauFileName (void);

       Xauth *XauReadAuth (FILE *auth_file);

       int XauWriteAuth (FILE *auth_file, Xauth *auth);

       Xauth *XauGetAuthByAddr (unsigned short family, unsigned short
              address_length, const char *address, unsigned short
              number_length, const char *number, unsigned short
              name_length, const char *name);

       Xauth *XauGetBestAuthByAddr (unsigned short family, unsigned short
              address_length, const char *address, unsigned short
              number_length, const char *number, int types_length,
              char **types, const int *type_lengths);

       int XauLockAuth (const char *file_name, int retries, int
              timeout, long dead);

       int XauUnlockAuth (const char *file_name);

       int XauDisposeAuth (Xauth *auth);

DESCRIPTION
       XauFileName generates the default authorization file name by first check&#8208;
       ing  the  XAUTHORITY  environment  variable  if  set,  else  it   returns
       $HOME/.Xauthority.   This  name is statically allocated and should not be
       freed.

       XauReadAuth reads the next entry from auth_file.  The entry is not stati&#8208;
       cally allocated and should be freed by calling XauDisposeAuth.

       XauWriteAuth writes an authorization entry to auth_file.  It returns 1 on
       success, 0 on failure.

       XauGetAuthByAddr searches for an entry which matches  the  given  network
       address/display  number  pair.  The entry is not statically allocated and
       should be freed by calling XauDisposeAuth.

       XauGetBestAuthByAddr is similar to XauGetAuthByAddr, except that  a  list
       of  acceptable  authentication methods is specified.  Xau will choose the
       file entry which matches the earliest entry in this list (e.g., the  most
       secure  authentication  method).   The  types  argument  is  an  array of
       strings, one string for each authentication method.  types_length  speci&#8208;
       fies how many elements are in the types array.  types_lengths is an array
       of integers representing the length of each string.

       XauLockAuth does the work necessary to synchronously update an authoriza&#8208;
       tion  file.   First  it makes two file names, one with ``-c&apos;&apos; appended to
       file_name, the other with ``-l&apos;&apos; appended.  If the  ``-c&apos;&apos;  file  already
       exists  and is more than dead seconds old, XauLockAuth removes it and the
       associated ``-l&apos;&apos; file.  To  prevent  possible  synchronization  troubles
       with  NFS, a dead value of zero forces the files to be removed.  XauLock&#8208;
       Auth makes retries attempts to create and link the  file  names,  pausing
       timeout  seconds  between each attempt.  XauLockAuth returns a collection
       of values depending on the results:

            LOCK_ERROR     A system error occurred, either a file_name
                           which is too long, or an unexpected failure from
                           a system call.  errno may prove useful.

            LOCK_TIMEOUT   retries attempts failed

            LOCK_SUCCESS   The lock succeeded.


       XauUnlockAuth undoes the work of XauLockAuth by unlinking both the ``-c&apos;&apos;
       and ``-l&apos;&apos; file names.

       XauDisposeAuth frees storage allocated to hold an authorization entry.
