Xaw(3)                                                                    Xaw(3)



NAME
        Xaw - X Athena Widgets

DESCRIPTION
       Xaw is a widget set based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt) Library.  This
       release by the X.Org  Foundation  includes  additions  and  modifications
       originally made for The XFree86 Project, Inc.  This manual page describes
       these changes as well as some of the common interfaces between  its  ver&#8208;
       sion and the previous X Consortium release (Xaw6).

       The  bulk  of  the  Xaw documentation is located in the API specification
       which may be installed in /usr/share/doc/libxaw7-dev,  or  found  on  the
       X.Org website.

ACTIONS
       All  of  the  Xaw widgets now have the additional translations call-proc,
       declare, get-values and set-values. The syntax for these actions is:

       action-name (boolean-expression, arguments)

       Action-name is one of call-proc, declare, get-values or set-values.

       Boolean-expression is composed with the operators  |  (or),  &amp;  (and),  ^
       (xor),  and  ~  (not).  The operands can be a variable name, which starts
       with a $; a resource name without the bindings .  or  *;  or  a  constant
       name,  including  mine  (event-&gt;xany.window  ==  XtWindow(widget)), faked
       (event-&gt;xany.send_event != 0), true (1) and false (0).

       Arguments are self-explanatory; when starting with a $ they name a  vari&#8208;
       able, otherwise, they indicate a resource name.

       call-proc (boolean-expression, procedure-name)
               This  action allows the evaluation of a boolean expression in the
               first parameter before calling a action procedure.  The procedure
               is only called if the expression evaluates as true.  Example:
               call-proc(&quot;$inside &amp; $pressed&quot;, notify)

       declare (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...)
               This  action is used to create new variables or change their val&#8208;
               ues.  Any number  of  variable-value  tuples  may  be  specified.
               Example:
               declare(1, $pressed, 1)

       get-values (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...)
               This  action  reads a widget resource value into a variable.  Any
               number of variable-value tuples may be specified.  Example:
               get-values(1, $fg, foreground, $bg, background)

       set-values (boolean-expression, variable, value, ...)
               This action sets a widget resource to the given value, which  may
               be a variable.  Any number of variable-value tuples may be speci&#8208;
               fied.  Example:
               set-values(1, foreground, $bg, background, $fg)

       Here is a sample translation to make a label widget behave like a button:

       &lt;Map&gt;:      get-values(1, $fg, foreground, $bg, background)\n\
       &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: set-values(1, foreground, yellow, background, gray30)\n\
       &lt;Btn1Up&gt;:   set-values(1, foreground, $fg, background, $bg)

DISPLAY LISTS
       All of the Xaw widgets have  now  the  additional  resource  displayList.
       This resource allows drawing the widget decorations using commands embed&#8208;
       ded in a resource string.  The displayList resource has the syntax:

       [class-name:]function-name arguments[[{;\n}]...]

       Class-name is any registered set of functions  to  draw  in  the  widget.
       Currently  the  only existing class is xlib, which provides access to the
       Xlib drawing primitives.

       Function-name is the drawing or  configuration  function  to  be  called,
       described bellow.

       Arguments  may  be  anything  suitable  to the displayList function being
       called. When the function requires a coordinate, the syntax is {+-}&lt;inte&#8208;
       ger&gt; or &lt;integer&gt;/&lt;integer&gt;. Examples:
            +0,+0      top, left
            -0,-0      bottom, right
            -+10,-+10  bottom+10, right+10
            +0,1/2     left, vertical-center

       arc-mode mode
               Sets  the  arc  mode.  Accepted modes are &quot;pieslice&quot; and &quot;chord&quot;,
               which set the  arc  to  ArcPieSlice  or  ArcChord,  respectively.
               Example:
               arc-mode chord

       bg color-spec
       background color-spec
               Sets the  background color.  color-spec must a valid color speci&#8208;
               fication.  Example:
               background red

       cap-style style
               Sets the cap  style.   Accepted  styles  are  &quot;notlast&quot;,  &quot;butt&quot;,
               &quot;round&quot;, and &quot;projecting&quot;, which set the cap style to CapNotLast,
               CapBut, CapRound or CapProjecting, respectively.  Example:
               cap-style round

       clip-mask pixmap-spec
               Sets the pixmap for the clip mask.  Requires a pixmap  parameter,
               as described in the PIXMAPS section below.  Example:
               clip-mask xlogo11

       clip-origin x,y
               Sets  the clip x and y origin.  Requires two arguments, the x and
               y coordinates.  Example:
               clip-origin 10,10

       clip-rects x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]
       clip-rectangles x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]
               Sets a list of rectangles to the clip mask.  The number of  argu&#8208;
               ments must be a multiple of four.  The arguments are coordinates.
               The parser calculates the width and  height  of  the  rectangles.
               Example:
               clip-rects 0,0,10,20, 20,10,30,30

       coord-mode mode
               Changes  the  coord  mode for fill-polygon, draw-lines, and draw-
               points.  Accepted parameters  are  &quot;modeorigin&quot;  and  &quot;previous&quot;,
               that sets the coord mode to CoordModeOrigin or CoordModePrevious,
               respectively.  Example:
               coord-mode previous

       copy-area {pixmap-spec|.},dstx,dsty[,x2,y2,srcx,srcy]
               Calls XCopyArea.  The character . means copy the window contents;
               pixmap-spec  is  as defined in the PIXMAPS section below.  X2 and
               y2 are the coordinates of the end copy, not the width and height;
               if  not  defined,  the  parser  calculates  them. src_x and src_y
               default to zero.  Example:
               copy-area Term,10,10

       copy-plane {pixmap-spec|.},dstx,dsty[,x2,y2,srcx,srcy,plane]
               Calls XCopyPlane. The character . means copy the window contents;
               pixmap-spec  is  as defined in the PIXMAPS section below.  X2 and
               y2 are the coordinates of the end copy, not the width and height;
               if  not  defined,  the  parser  calculates them.  src_x and src_y
               default to zero. Plane defaults to one.  Example:
               copy-plane star,10,10

       dashes i1[...,in]
               Sets the dashes for line drawing.  Accepts up to  127  arguments.
               Example:
               dashes 3,7 9,10

       draw-arc x1,y1,x2,y2[,start-angle,end-angle]
               Draws an arc.  The four first arguments are the rectangle enclos&#8208;
               ing the arc.  The two remaining arguments, if specified, are  the
               start and end angle, in degrees.  Example:
               draw-arc +0,+0,-1,-1,0,90

       draw-rect x1,y1,x2,y2
       draw-rectangle x1,y1,x2,y2
               Draws  a rectangle.  Requires four arguments, which are the start
               and end coordinate pairs.  Example:
               draw-rect +1,+1,-5,-5

       draw-string x,y,&quot;string&quot;
               Draws a text string.  Requires three arguments, a x coordinate, a
               y coordinate, and a string.  Strings that have white space can be
               quoted with the &quot; character; the backslash character \  can  also
               be used, but it will be necessary escape it twice.  Example:
                draw-string 10,10, &quot;Hello world!&quot;

       exposures boolean
               Sets  graphics  exposures  in  the  GC.  Allowed parameters are a
               integer or the strings &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;.  Example:

       fill-arc x1,y1,x2,y2[,start-angle,end-angle]
               Like draw-arc, but fills the contents of the arc  with  the  cur&#8208;
               rently selected foreground.  Example:
               fill-arc +0,+0,-1,-1,0,180

       fill-poly x1,y1 [...,xn,yn]
       fill-polygon x1,y1 [...,xn,yn]
               Like  draw-lines,  but  fills  the enclosed polygon and joins the
               first and last point, if they  are  not  at  the  same  position.
               Example:
               fill-poly +0,+10, +10,+20, +30,+0

       fill-rect x1,y1,x2,y2
       fill-rectangle x1,y1,x2,y2
               Like  draw-rect, but fills the contents of the rectangle with the
               selected foreground color.  Example:
               fill-rect +10,+10,-20,-20

       fill-rule rule
               Sets the fill rule.  Accepted parameters are &quot;evenodd&quot; and &quot;wind&#8208;
               ing&quot;,  which  set  the  fill  rule to EvenOddRule or WindingRule,
               respectively.  Example:
               fill-rule winding

       fill-style style
               Sets the fill style.  Allowed parameters  are  &quot;solid&quot;,  &quot;tiled&quot;,
               &quot;stippled&quot;  and  &quot;opaquestippled&quot;,  which  set  the fill style to
               FillSolid, FillTiled, FillStippled or FillOpaqueStippled, respec&#8208;
               tively.  Example:
               fill-style tiled

       font font-spec
               Sets the font for text functions.  Example:

               Like background, but sets the current foreground color.  Example:
               foreground blue

       mask    This  command  is useful when you want to draw only in the region
               that really needs to be repainted.  Requires no arguments.

       function function-spec
               Sets the specific GC function.   Allowed  parameters  are  &quot;set&quot;,

               &quot;bevel&quot;,  which  set  the  join style to JoinMiter, JoinRound and
               JoinBevel, respectively.  Example:
               join-style round

       image {pixmap-spec},xs,ys,[xe,ye]
               This function is implemented as a way to quickly compose  complex
               decorations in widgets.  Pixmap-spec is as defined in the PIXMAPS
               section below. xs and ys are the coordinates from where to  start
               copying  the pixmap; xe and ye are optional (they default to xs +
               pixmap.width and  ys  +  pixmap.height,  respectively).   If  the
               pixmap has a mask, the copy is masked accordingly.  Example:
               image pixmap.xpm,0,0,20,20

       line x1,y1,x2,y2
       draw-line x1,y1,x2,y2
               Draws  a  line  with the current foreground color.  Requires four
               arguments, the starting and ending coordinate pairs.  Example:
               line +0,+0, -1,-1

       line-width integer
               Selects a line width for drawing.  Example:
               line-width 2

       line-style style
               Sets the line style.  Accepted parameters  are  &quot;solid&quot;,  &quot;onoff&#8208;
               dash&quot;  and  &quot;doubledash&quot;,  which set the line style to LineSolid,
               LineOnOffDash or LineDoubleDash, respectively.  Example:
               line-style onoffdash

       lines x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]
       draw-lines x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]
               Draws a list of lines. Any number of argument pairs may  be  sup&#8208;
               plied.  Example:
               lines +0,-1, -1,-1, -1,+0

       paint-string x,y,&quot;string&quot;
               Identical  to  draw-string,  but  also uses the background color.

               Sets the plane mask.  Requires an integer parameter.  Example:
               plane-mask -1

       points x1,y1 [...,xn,yn]
       draw-points x1,y1 [...,xn,yn]
               Draws a list of points at the specified coordinates.  Example:
               points +1,+2, +1,+4, +1,+6

       segments x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]
       draw-segments x1,y1,x2,y2 [...,xn,yn]

               segments +1,+2,+1,-3, +2,-2,-3,-2

       shape-mode mode
               Sets the shape mode used in  fill-polygon.   Accepted  parameters
               are  &quot;complex&quot;, &quot;convex&quot; or &quot;nonconvex&quot;, which set the shape mode
               to Complex, Convex or Nonconvex, accordingly.  Example:
               shape-mode convex

       stipple pixmap-spec
               Sets the pixmap for a stipple.  Requires a pixmap  parameter,  as

               stipple plaid

       subwindow-mode mode
               Sets  the  subwindow  mode  in  the  GC.  Accepted parameters are
               &quot;includeinferiors&quot; and &quot;clipbychildren&quot;, which set the  subwindow
               mode  to IncludeInferiors or ClipByChildren, respectively.  Exam&#8208;
               ple:
               subwindow-mode includeinferiors

       tile pixmap-spec
               Sets the pixmap for a tile.   Requires  a  pixmap  parameter,  as
               described in the PIXMAPS section below.  Example:

       draw-lines +1,-1,-1,-1,-1,+1;\
       foreground gray85;\
       draw-lines -1,+0,+0,+0,+0,-1

PIXMAPS
       A  String  to Pixmap converter has been  added to Xaw.  This converter is
       meant to be extended, and has enough abstraction to allow loading several
       image formats.  It uses a format that resembles a URL, with the syntax:

       [type:]name[?arg=val[{&amp;}...]]

       Type can be one of bitmap, gradient or xpm.

       Name  may be a file name, or, in the case of type gradient, may be either
       vertical or horizontal.

       Arg=val is a list of arguments to the converter.   An  argument  list  is
       preceded  by  a  question  mark,  and multiple arguments are separated by
       ampersands.  The most common arguments  are  foreground  and  background.
       Gradients  also support the arguments start and end (colors with which to
       start and end the gradient); the steps argument, to allow using less col&#8208;
       ors;  and  the  dimension  argument  to  specify  the  size of the gradi&#8208;
       ent.     The xpm converter understands the closeness argument, which aids
       in using fewer colors (useful if you have a limited colormap).

TEXT WIDGET
       Most  of  the changes to this version of the Xaw library were done in the
       TextWidget, TextSrcObject, TextSinkObject and related files.

       A couple of highly visible changes in the Text widget  are  due  to  many
       bugs  in  the Xaw6 implementation involving scrollbars and auto-resizing.
       Scrollbars being added or removed caused several problems in keeping  the
       text cursor visible, and in Xaw6 it was very easy to have a widget think&#8208;
       ing the cursor was visible, when it was not.  Also, permitting  automatic
       resizing  of the widget to a larger geometry created other problems, mak&#8208;
       ing it difficult to have a consistent layout in the application, and,  if
       the  window  manager  did  not  interfere, windows larger than the screen
       could result.  Therefore, some  functionality  involving  scrollbars  and
       auto-resizing has been disabled; see the section on new and modified Text
       widget resources below.

       The Text widget&apos;s default key bindings were originally based on the Emacs
       text  editor.   In  this  release, even more operations familiar to Emacs
       users have been added.  New text actions include:

       indent  Indents text blocks.  Not bound by default.  The Text widget also
               does not attempt to perform auto-indentation of its source object
               by default.

       keyboard-reset
               Resets the keyboard state.  Reverts the action multiplier  to  1,
               and  if undo is enabled, toggles between undo and redo.  Bound by
               default to Control&lt;Key&gt;G.

       kill-ring-yank
               In this version of Xaw, text killed in any text field is kept  in
               memory,  allowing cut and paste operations internally to the pro&#8208;
               gram between text fields.  Bound by default to Meta&lt;Key&gt;Y.

       numeric Listed here  only  for  purposes  of  documentation.   Called  by
               default  when one of the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0,
               or - is typed, allowing composition of the multiplication  number
               of text actions.

       set-keyboard-focus
               Sets  the  input focus of the top level widget to the text field.
               Not enabled by default, but bound to the &lt;Btn1Down&gt; event.

       toggle-overwrite
               Toggles overwrite mode.  In overwrite mode, any text inserted  in
               a  text  field  will  replace existing text.  Bound by default to
               &lt;Key&gt;Insert.

       undo    Sets the enableUndo resource of the textSrcObject.   Not  enabled
               by default, but bound to Control&lt;Key&gt;_.

       New and modified Text widget resources include:

       justify (Class Justify)
               Sets  the text justification.  Can be one of left, right, center,
               or full.  Only enabled when the autoFill resource is set, and the
               resources leftColumn and rightColumn are correctly set.

       leftColumn (Class Column)
               Specifies  the  left  column  at which to break text.  Text lines
               started with an alphanumeric character will  automatically  start
               at this column.

       positionCallback (Class Callback)
               Allows  installation  of  a  callback to be called every time the
               cursor is moved, and/or the file changes its size.  The  callback
               is  called with a pointer to a structure containing the following
               data:
               typedef struct {
                   int line_number;
                   int column_number;
                   XawTextPosition insert_position;
                   XawTextPosition last_position;
                   Boolean overwrite_mode;
               } XawTextPositionInfo;
               This callback is intended to help programmers write text  editors
               based on the Xaw widget set.

       resize (Class Resize)
               No  longer  supported,  but recognized for backward compatibility
               with resource specifications written for the Xaw6 Text widget.

       rightColumn (Class Column)
               Specifies the right column at which to break  text.   Text  lines
               started  with an alphanumeric character will automatically end at
               this column.

       scrollHorizontal (Class Scroll)
       scrollVertical (Class Scroll)
               These resources control the placement of scrollbars on  the  left
               and bottom edges of the Text widget.  They accept the values Xaw&#8208;
               textScrollAlways and XawtextScrollNever.  A converter  is  regis&#8208;
               tered  for this resource that will convert the following strings:
               always and never.  The value XawtextScrollWhenNeeded  (and  when&#8208;
               Needed,  recognized  by the converter), is accepted for backwards
               compatibility with resource specifications written for  the  Xaw6
               Text  widget, but ignored (effectively treated as XawtextScrollN&#8208;
               ever).

TEXT SOURCE OBJECT
       The textSrcObject allows display of its contents to more than one window,
       and also stores undo information. The new resources for the textSrcObject
       are:

       callback (Class Callback)
               Previous versions of Xaw had this resource in subclasses  of  the
               TextSource  object.  This was changed to make it possible to tell
               the callback the state of the text when undo is enabled.

       enableUndo (Class Undo)
               A boolean resource that enables or disables  the  undo  function.
               The default value is False.

       sourceChanged (Class Changed)
               Like  the callback resource, this resource was previously in sub&#8208;
               classes of the TextSource object.  It is now in the textSrcObject
               to control the changed/unchanged state when undo is enabled.

TEXT SINK OBJECT
       The  textSinkObject  subclasses  asciiSinkObject and multiSinkObject have
       been changed slightly to use a new cursor shape (no longer a caret at the
       baseline)  that  indicates  the input focus of the text widget, and allow
       specification of the cursor color.  The new resource is:

       cursorColor (Class Color)
               Sets the cursor color of the text.  This color is  also  used  to
               draw selected text.

SIMPLE MENU WIDGET
       The  simpleMenuWidget  algorithm to lay out menu entries has been changed
       to enable multiple columns when a single  column  does  not  fit  on  the
       screen.  It was also modified to enable submenus.

SME BSB OBJECT
       A  new  resource has been added to the smeBSBObject to allow binding sub&#8208;
       menus to it.  The new resource is:

       menuName (Class MenuName)
               Specifies the name of the popup widget to be popped up  when  the
               pointer  is  over  the  menu entry, or NULL.  Note that the named
               menu must be a child of the popup parent of the smeBSBObject.
