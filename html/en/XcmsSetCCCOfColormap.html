XcmsCCCOfColormap(3)             XLIB FUNCTIONS             XcmsCCCOfColormap(3)



NAME
       XcmsCCCOfColormap, XcmsSetCCCOfColormap - query and modify CCC of a col&#8208;
       ormap

SYNTAX
       XcmsCCC XcmsCCCOfColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap);

       XcmsCCC XcmsSetCCCOfColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XcmsCCC
              ccc);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       ccc       Specifies the CCC.

       colormap  Specifies the colormap.

DESCRIPTION
       The XcmsCCCOfColormap function returns the CCC associated with the speci&#8208;
       fied colormap.  Once obtained, the CCC attributes can be queried or modi&#8208;
       fied.  Unless the CCC associated with the specified colormap is changed
       with XcmsSetCCCOfColormap, this CCC is used when the specified colormap
       is used as an argument to color functions.

       The XcmsSetCCCOfColormap function changes the CCC associated with the
       specified colormap.  It returns the CCC previously associated with the
       colormap.  If they are not used again in the application, CCCs should be
       freed by calling XcmsFreeCCC.  Several colormaps may share the same CCC
       without restriction; this includes the CCCs generated by Xlib with each
       colormap.  Xlib, however, creates a new CCC with each new colormap.
