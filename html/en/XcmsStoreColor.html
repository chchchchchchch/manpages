XcmsStoreColor(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XcmsStoreColor(3)



NAME
       XcmsStoreColor, XcmsStoreColors - set colors

SYNTAX
       Status XcmsStoreColor(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XcmsColor
              *color);

       Status XcmsStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XcmsColor
              colors[], int ncolors, Bool compression_flags_return[]);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       color     Specifies the color cell and the color to store.  Values speci&#8208;
                 fied in this XcmsColor structure remain unchanged on return.

       colors    Specifies the color specification array of XcmsColor struc&#8208;
                 tures, each specifying a color cell and the color to store in
                 that cell.  Values specified in the array remain unchanged upon
                 return.

       colormap  Specifies the colormap.

       compression_flags_return
                 Returns an array of Boolean values indicating compression sta&#8208;
                 tus.  If a non-NULL pointer is supplied, each element of the
                 array is set to True if the corresponding color was compressed
                 and False otherwise.  Pass NULL if the compression status is
                 not useful.

       ncolors   Specifies the number of XcmsColor structures in the color-spec&#8208;
                 ification array.

DESCRIPTION
       The XcmsStoreColor function converts the color specified in the XcmsColor
       structure into RGB values.  It then uses this RGB specification in an
       XColor structure, whose three flags (DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue) are set,
       in a call to XStoreColor to change the color cell specified by the pixel
       member of the XcmsColor structure.  This pixel value must be a valid
       index for the specified colormap, and the color cell specified by the
       pixel value must be a read/write cell.  If the pixel value is not a valid
       index, a BadValue error results.  If the color cell is unallocated or is
       allocated read-only, a BadAccess error results.  If the colormap is an
       installed map for its screen, the changes are visible immediately.

       Note that XStoreColor has no return value; therefore, an XcmsSuccess
       return value from this function indicates that the conversion to RGB suc&#8208;
       ceeded and the call to XStoreColor was made.  To obtain the actual color
       stored, use XcmsQueryColor.  Because of the screen&apos;s hardware limitations
       or gamut compression, the color stored in the colormap may not be identi&#8208;
       cal to the color specified.

       XcmsStoreColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

       The XcmsStoreColors function converts the colors specified in the array
       of XcmsColor structures into RGB values and then uses these RGB specifi&#8208;
       cations in XColor structures, whose three flags (DoRed, DoGreen, and
       DoBlue) are set, in a call to XStoreColors to change the color cells
       specified by the pixel member of the corresponding XcmsColor structure.
       Each pixel value must be a valid index for the specified colormap, and
       the color cell specified by each pixel value must be a read/write cell.
       If a pixel value is not a valid index, a BadValue error results.  If a
       color cell is unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error
       results.  If more than one pixel is in error, the one that gets reported
       is arbitrary.  If the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the
       changes are visible immediately.

       Note that XStoreColors has no return value; therefore, an XcmsSuccess
       return value from this function indicates that conversions to RGB suc&#8208;
       ceeded and the call to XStoreColors was made.  To obtain the actual col&#8208;
       ors stored, use XcmsQueryColors.  Because of the screen&apos;s hardware limi&#8208;
       tations or gamut compression, the colors stored in the colormap may not
       be identical to the colors specified.

       XcmsStoreColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not
                 already allocate.

       BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.

       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Col&#8208;
                 ormap.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
                 by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
                 argument, the full range defined by the argument&apos;s type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
                 generate this error.
