NAME
       XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxC, XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV, XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxVC, Xcm&#8208;
       sTekHVCQueryMaxVSamples, XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV - obtain the TekHVC coordi&#8208;
       nates

SYNTAX
       Status XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxC(XcmsCCC ccc, XcmsFloat hue, XcmsFloat value,
              XcmsColor *color_return);

       Status XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV(XcmsCCC ccc, XcmsFloat hue, XcmsFloat chroma,
              XcmsColor *color_return);

       Status XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxVC(XcmsCCC ccc, XcmsFloat hue, XcmsColor
              *color_return);

       Status XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxVSamples(XcmsCCC ccc, XcmsFloat hue, XcmsColor
              colors_return[], unsigned int nsamples);

       Status XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV(XcmsCCC ccc, XcmsFloat hue, XcmsFloat chroma,
              XcmsColor *color_return);

ARGUMENTS
       ccc       Specifies the CCC.  Note that the CCC&apos;s Client White Point and
                 White Point Adjustment procedures are ignored.

       chroma    Specifies the chroma at which to find maximum Value (MaxV).

       colors_return
                 Returns nsamples of color specifications in XcmsTekHVC such
                 that the Chroma is the maximum attainable for the Value and
                 Hue.  The white point associated with the returned color speci&#8208;
                 fication is the Screen White Point.  The value returned in the
                 pixel member is undefined.

       color_return
                 Returns the maximum Chroma along with the actual Hue and Value
                 (MaxC), maximum Value along with the Hue and Chroma (MaxV),
                 color specification in XcmsTekHVC for the maximum Chroma, the
                 Value at which that maximum Chroma is reached and actual Hue
                 (MaxVC) or minimum Value and the actual Hue and Chroma (MinL)
                 at which the maximum Chroma (MaxC and MaxVC), maximum Value
                 (MaxV), or minimum Value (MinL) was found.  The white point
                 associated with the returned color specification is the Screen
                 White Point.  The value returned in the pixel member is unde&#8208;
                 fined.

       hue       Specifies the Hue in which to find the maximum Chroma (MaxC and
                 MaxVC), maximum Value (MaxV), the maximum Chroma/Value samples
                 (MaxVSamples), or the minimum Value (MinL).

       nsamples  Specifies the number of samples.

       value     Specifies the Value in which to find the maximum Chroma (MaxC)
                 or minimum Value (MinL).

DESCRIPTION
       The XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxC function, given a Hue and Value, determines the
       maximum Chroma in TekHVC color space displayable by the screen.  It
       returns the maximum Chroma along with the actual Hue and Value at which
       the maximum Chroma was found.

       The XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV function, given a Hue and Chroma, determines the
       maximum Value in TekHVC color space displayable by the screen.  It
       returns the maximum Value and the actual Hue and Chroma at which the max&#8208;
       imum Value was found.

       The XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxVC function, given a Hue, determines the maximum
       Chroma in TekHVC color space displayable by the screen and the Value at
       which that maximum Chroma is reached.  It returns the maximum Chroma, the
       Value at which that maximum Chroma is reached, and the actual Hue for
       which the maximum Chroma was found.

       The XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxVSamples returns nsamples of maximum Value, the
       Chroma at which that maximum Value is reached, and the actual Hue for
       which the maximum Chroma was found.  These sample points may then be used
       to plot the maximum Value/Chroma boundary of the screen&apos;s color gamut for
       the specified Hue in TekHVC color space.

       The XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV function, given a Hue and Chroma, determines the
       minimum Value in TekHVC color space displayable by the screen.  It
       returns the minimum Value and the actual Hue and Chroma at which the min&#8208;
       imum Value was found.
