DESCRIPTION
       The composite extension provides several related mechanisms:

       Per-hierarchy storage
              The rendering of an entire hierarchy of windows is redirected to
              off-screen storage. The pixels of that hierarchy are available
              whenever it is viewable. Storage is automatically reallocated when
              the top level window changes size. Contents beyond the geometry of
              the top window are not preserved.

       Automatic shadow update
              When a hierarchy is rendered off-screen, the X server provides an
              automatic mechanism for presenting those contents within the
              parent window. The implementation is free to make this update lag
              behind actual rendering operations by an unspecified amount of
              time. This automatic update mechanism may be disabled so that the
              parent window contents can be completely determined by an external
              application.

       Composite Overlay Window
              Version 0.3 of the protocol adds the Composite Overlay Window,
              which provides compositing managers with a surface on which to
              draw without interference. This window is always above normal
              windows and is always below the screen saver window. It is an
              InputOutput window whose width and height are the screen
              dimensions. Its visual is the root visual and its border width is
              zero. Attempts to redirect it using the composite extension are
              ignored. This window does not appear in the reply of the QueryTree
              request. It is also an override redirect window. These last two
              features make it invisible to window managers and other X11
              clients. The only way to access the XID of this window is via the
              CompositeGetOverlayWindow request. Initially, the Composite
              Overlay Window is unmapped.

       Parent window clipping
              Version 0.4 of the protocol modifies the semantics of parent
              window clipping in the presence of manual redirected children.
              With this version, the area in the parent covered by manual
              redirected children is left in the parent clip list instead of
              being removed as in older versions.

       Per-hierarchy storage may be created for individual windows or for all
       children of a window. Manual shadow update may be selected by only a
       single application for each window; manual update may also be selected on
       a per-window basis or for each child of a window. Detecting when to
       update may be done with the Damage extension.

       The off-screen storage includes the window contents, its borders and the
       contents of all descendants.

ARGUMENTS
       display
              Pointer to the Display structure returned from XOpenDisplay for
              the connection to the X server.

       event_base_return
              Pointer to integer where the base value for Composite Extension
              events will be stored.

       error_base_return
              Pointer to integer where the base value for Composite Extension
              errors will be stored.

       major_version_return
              Pointer to integer where the major version of the Composite
              Extension supported by the X server will be stored.

       minor_version_return
              Pointer to integer where the minor version of the Composite
              Extension supported by the X server will be stored.

       window Specifies the window ID to operate on.

       update Specifies the mode for updating the window contents. Must be
              either CompositeRedirectAutomatic or CompositeRedirectManual.

FUNCTIONS
       XCompositeQueryExtension
              XCompositeQueryExtension determines if the Composite Extension is
              available on the given display. It returns True if the extension
              is supported, otherwise False. If the extension is present, the
              base values for events and errors are returned, and can be used to
              decode incoming event and error values.

       XCompositeQueryVersion
              XCompositeQueryVersion determines if the X Server supports a
              version of the X Composite Extension which is compatible with the
              client library. A non-zero Status is returned if a compatible
              version of the extension is supported, otherwise a zero Status is
              returned. If the extension is supported, the major and minor
              version numbers are returned to indicate the level of Composite
              Extension support. No other XComposite functions (except
              XCompositeQueryExtension) may be called before this function. If a
              client violates this rule, the effects of all subsequent
              XComposite calls that it makes are undefined.

       XCompositeVersion
              XCompositeVersion returns the version of the X Composite library.
              The version number is encoded as: (major * 10000) + (minor * 100)
              + revision

              For example, version 1.4.6 would be encoded as the integer 10406.

       XCompositeRedirectWindow
              XCompositeRedirectWindow requests the X server to direct the
              hierarchy starting at window to off-screen storage. The update
              argument specifies whether the contents are mirrored to the parent
              window automatically or not. Only one client at a time may specify
              an update type of CompositeRedirectManual, another attempt will
              result in a BadAccess error. When all clients enabling redirection
              terminate, the redirection will automatically be disabled.

              The root window may not be redirected. Doing so results in a
              BadMatch error. Specifying an invalid window id will result in a
              BadWindow error.

       XCompositeRedirectSubwindows
              XCompositeRedirectSubwindows requests the X server to redirect
              hierarchies starting at all current and future children of window
              as in XCompositeRedirectWindow. If update is
              CompositeRedirectManual, then painting of the window background
              during window manipulation and ClearArea requests is inhibited.

       XCompositeUnredirectWindow
              XCompositeUnredirectWindow requests the X server to terminate
              redirection of window. If the specified window was not selected
              for redirection by the current client, a BadValue error results.

       XCompositeUnredirectSubwindows
              XCompositeUnredirectWindow requests the X server to terminate
              redirection of all children of window. If the specified window was
              not selected for sub-redirection by the current client, a BadValue
              error results.

       XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip
              XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip creates a region containing
              the &quot;usual&quot; border clip value; that is the area of the window
              clipped against siblings and the parent. This region can be used
              to restrict rendering to suitable areas while updating only a
              single window. The region is copied at the moment the request is
              executed; future changes to the window hierarchy will not be
              reflected in this region.

       XCompositeNameWindowPixmap
              XCompositeNameWindowPixmap creates and returns a pixmap id that
              serves as a reference to the off-screen storage for window. This
              pixmap will remain allocated until freed, even if the window is
              unmapped, reconfigured or destroyed. However, the window will get
              a new pixmap allocated each time it is mapped or resized, so this
              function will need to be reinvoked for the client to continue to
              refer to the storage holding the current window contents.
              Generates a BadMatch error if window is not redirected or is not
              visible.

              The X server must support at least version 0.2 of the Composite
              Extension for XCompositeNameWindowPixmap.

       XCompositeGetOverlayWindow
              XCompositeGetOverlayWindow returns the window ID of the Composite
              Overlay Window for the screen specified by the argument window.
              This function notifies the X server that the client wishes to use
              the Composite Overlay Window of this screen. If this Composite
              Overlay Window has not yet been mapped, it is mapped by this
              request.

              The Composite Overlay Window for a particular screen will be
              unmapped when all clients who have called this function have
              either called XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow for that screen, or
              terminated their connection to the X server.

              The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the Composite
              Extension for XCompositeGetOverlayWindow.

       XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow
              This request specifies that the client is no longer using the
              Composite Overlay Window on the screen specified by the argument
              window. A screen&apos;s Composite Overlay Window is unmapped when there
              are no longer any clients using it.

              The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the Composite
              Extension for XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow.
