XCUP(3)                            X FUNCTIONS                           XCUP(3)



NAME
       XcupGetReservedColormapEntries  -  list  colormap entries reserved by the
       system

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xcup.h&gt;

       Status XcupGetReservedColormapEntries(Display *display,
              int screen, XColor **colors_out, int *ncolors);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       screen    Screen number on the host server.

       colors_out
                 Returns the values reserved by the server.

       ncolors   Returns the number of items in colors_out.

DESCRIPTION
       The XcupGetReservedColormapEntries function returns a  list  of  colormap
       entries  (pixels)  that  are reserved by the system. This list will, at a
       minimum, contain entries for the BlackPixel and WhitePixel of the  speci&#8208;
       fied screen. Use XFree to free colors_out.

       To minimize colormap flash, an application which installs its own private
       colormap should query the special colors by  calling  XCupGetReservedCol&#8208;
       ormapEntries,  and  can then store those entries (in the proper location)
       in its private colormap using XCupStoreColors.
