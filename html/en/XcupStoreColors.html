XcupStoreColors(3)                 X FUNCTIONS                XcupStoreColors(3)



NAME
       XcupStoreColors - initialize shareable colormap entries at specific loca&#8208;
       tions

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xcup.h&gt;

       Status XcupStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap colormap,
              XColor *colors_in_out, int ncolors);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server

       colormap  Specifies the colormap

       colors_in_out
                 Specifies and returns the values actually used in the colormap

       ncolors   Specifies the number of items in colors_in_out

DESCRIPTION
       The XcupStoreColors function changes the colormap entries  of  the  pixel
       values  in  the  pixel  members  of  the  XColor structures. The colormap
       entries are allocated as if an AllocColor has been used instead, i.e. the
       colors  are read-only (shareable).  XcupStoreColors returns the number of
       colors that were successfully allocated in the colormap.

       A Value error is generated if a pixel is not a valid index into the  col&#8208;
       ormap. A BadMatch error is generated if the colormap does not belong to a
       GrayScale, PseudoColor, or DirectColor visual.

       Applications which allocate many colors in a screen&apos;s  default  colormap,
       e.g.   a  color-cube or a gray-ramp, should allocate them with XCupStore&#8208;
       Colors.  By using XCupStoreColors the colors will be  allocated  sharable
       (read-only) and any other application which allocates the same color will
       share that color cell.
