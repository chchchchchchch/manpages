XdbeSwapBuffers(3)                 X FUNCTIONS                XdbeSwapBuffers(3)



NAME
       XdbeSwapBuffers - swaps front and back DBE buffers.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xdbe.h&gt;

       Status XdbeSwapBuffers(
           Display      *dpy,
           XdbeSwapInfo *swap_info,
           int          num_windows)

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  swaps  the  front and back buffers for a list of windows.
       The argument num_windows specifies how many windows  are  to  have  their
       buffers  swapped;  it  is  the number of elements in the swap_info array.
       The argument swap_info specifies the information needed per window to  do
       the swap.

       The XdbeSwapInfo structure has the following fields:

            Window            swap_window
            XdbeSwapAction    swap_action

       swap_window  specifies the window for which to swap buffers.  swap_action
       specifies the swap action to use for this swap_window.

       swap_action determines what will happen to the new  back  buffer  of  the
       swap_window  it  is paired with in the list in addition to making the old
       back buffer become visible.  The defined actions are as follows:


       XdbeUndefined
              The contents of the new back buffer become undefined.  This may be
              the  most  efficient  action since it allows the implementation to
              discard the contents of the buffer if it needs to.

       XdbeBackground
              The unobscured region of the new back buffer will  be  tiled  with
              the  window  background.   The background action allows devices to
              use a fast clear capability during a swap.

       XdbeUntouched
              The unobscured region of the new back buffer will be unmodified by
              the swap.

       XdbeCopied
              The  unobscured region of the new back buffer will be the contents
              of the old back buffer

ERRORS
       BadMatch
              A non-double-buffered window was specified or a window was  speci&#8208;
              fied twice.

       BadWindow
              An invalid window was specified.

       BadValue
              An invalid swap action was specified.
