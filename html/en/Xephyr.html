Xephyr(1)                                                              Xephyr(1)



NAME
       Xephyr - X server outputting to a window on a pre-existing X display

SYNOPSIS
       Xephyr [:display] [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xephyr  is  a  kdrive  server  that outputs to a window on a pre-existing
       &quot;host&quot; X display.  Think Xnest but with  support  for  modern  extensions
       like composite, damage and randr.

       Unlike  Xnest  which  is an X proxy, i.e.  limited to the capabilities of
       the host X server, Xephyr is a real X server which uses the host X server
       window as &quot;framebuffer&quot; via fast SHM XImages.

       It also has support for &quot;visually&quot; debugging what the server is painting.

OPTIONS
       The server accepts all the standard options of Xserver(1) and the follow&#8208;
       ing additional options:

       -screen widthxheight
               sets the screen size.

       -parent id
               uses exiting window id .  If a -screen argument follows a -parent
               argument, this screen is embedded into the given window.

       -host-cursor
               set  &apos;cursor  acceleration&apos;: The host&apos;s cursor is reused. This is
               only really there to aid debugging by avoiding server paints  for
               the cursor. Performance improvement is negligible.

SIGNALS
       Send  a  SIGUSR1  to  the  server (e.g. pkill -USR1 Xephyr) to toggle the
       debugging mode.  In this mode red rectangles are painted to screen  areas
       getting  painted  before  painting the actual content.  The delay between
       this can be altered by setting a XEPHYR_PAUSE env var to a value in micro
       seconds.

CAVEATS
       &#183; Rotated  displays  are currently updated via full blits. This is slower
         than a normal orientated display. Debug mode will therefore not  be  of
         much use rotated.

       &#183; The &apos;-host-cursor&apos; cursor is static in its appearance.

       &#183; The  build  gets  a warning about &apos;nanosleep&apos;. I think the various &apos;-D&apos;
         build flags are causing this. I haven&apos;t figured  as  yet  how  to  work
         round it. It doesn&apos;t appear to break anything however.

       &#183; Keyboard handling is basic but works.

       &#183; Mouse button 5 probably won&apos;t work.
