Xft(3)                                                                    Xft(3)



NAME
        Xft - X FreeType interface library

DESCRIPTION
       Xft  is  a  simple  library designed to interface the FreeType rasterizer
       with the X Rendering Extension.  This manual page  barely  scratches  the
       surface of this library.

HEADER FILE
       #include &lt;X11/Xft/Xft.h&gt;

CONSTANTS
       XFT_MAJOR
              is the major version number of Xft.

       XFT_MINOR
              is the minor version number of Xft.

       XFT_REVISION
              is the revision number of Xft.

       XFT_VERSION
              is XFT_MAJOR times 10000 (ten thousand), plus XFT_MINOR times 100,
              plus XFT_REVISION.

       XftVersion
              is an alias for XFT_VERSION.

       The following example illustrates how Xft&apos;s version  constants  might  be
       used:
           #if (XFT_VERSION &gt;= 20107)
           (void) puts(&quot;Version 2.1.7 or later of the Xft library is in&quot;
                       &quot; use.&quot;);
           #else
           (void) printf(&quot;Insufficient version of Xft (%d.%d.%d) installed;
                         &quot; need at least version 2.1.7.\n&quot;, XFT_MAJOR,
                         XFT_MINOR,
                         XFT_REVISION);
           #endif

DATA TYPES
       XftFont
              typedef struct _XftFont {
                  int         ascent;
                  int         descent;
                  int         height;
                  int         max_advance_width;
                  FcCharSet   *charset;
                  FcPattern   *pattern;
              } XftFont;
              An  XftFont  is the primary data structure of interest to program&#8208;
              mers using Xft; it contains general font metrics and  pointers  to
              the Fontconfig character set and pattern associated with the font.
              The FcCharSet and FcPattern data types are defined by the Fontcon&#8208;
              fig library.

              XftFonts  are  populated  with  any of XftFontOpen(), XftFontOpen&#8208;
              Name(), XftFontOpenXlfd(), XftFontOpenInfo(),  or  XftFontOpenPat&#8208;
              tern().  XftFontCopy() is used to duplicate XftFonts, and XftFont&#8208;
              Close() is used to mark an XftFont as unused.  XftFonts are inter&#8208;
              nally allocated, reference-counted, and freed by Xft; the program&#8208;
              mer does not ordinarily need to allocate or free storage for them.

              XftDrawGlyphs(), the XftDrawString*()  family,  XftDrawCharSpec(),
              and  XftDrawGlyphSpec()  use XftFonts to render text to an XftDraw
              object, which may correspond to either a core X drawable or  an  X
              Rendering Extension drawable.

              XftGlyphExtents()  and  the  XftTextExtents*()  family are used to
              determine the extents (maximum dimensions) of an XftFont.

              An XftFont&apos;s glyph or character coverage can  be  determined  with
              XftFontCheckGlyph()  or  XftCharExists().   XftCharIndex() returns
              the XftFont-specific character index corresponding to a given Uni&#8208;
              code codepoint.

              XftGlyphRender(),  XftGlyphSpecRender(),  XftCharSpecRender(), and
              the XftTextRender*() family use XftFonts to draw into X  Rendering
              Extension Picture structures.  Note: XftDrawGlyphs(), the XftDraw&#8208;
              String*() family, XftDrawCharSpec(), and  XftDrawGlyphSpec()  pro&#8208;
              vide  a means of rendering fonts that is independent of the avail&#8208;
              ability of the X Rendering Extension on the X server.

       XftFontInfo
              is an opaque object that stores information about  a  font.   Xft&#8208;
              FontInfo  structures  are  created with XftFontInfoCreate(), freed
              with XftFontInfoDestroy(), and compared  with  XftFontInfoEqual().
              XftFontInfo objects are internally allocated and freed by Xft; the
              programmer does not ordinarily need to allocate  or  free  storage
              for them.

              Each  XftFontInfo  structure  in  use  is associated with a unique
              identifier, which can be  retrieved  with  XftFontInfoHash().   An
              XftFont  can be opened based on XftFontInfo data with XftFontOpen&#8208;
              Info().

       XftColor
              typedef struct _XftColor {
                  unsigned long   pixel;
                  XRenderColor    color;
              } XftColor;
              An XftColor object permits text and other items to be rendered  in
              a  particular color (or the closest approximation offered by the X
              visual in use).  The XRenderColor data type is defined  by  the  X
              Render Extension library.

              XftColorAllocName() and XftColorAllocValue() request a color allo&#8208;
              cation from the X server (if necessary) and initialize the members
              of  XftColor.   XftColorFree()  instructs the X server to free the
              color currently allocated for an XftColor.

              One an XftColor has been  initialized,  XftDrawSrcPicture(),  Xft&#8208;
              DrawGlyphs(), the XftDrawString*() family, XftDrawCharSpec(), Xft&#8208;
              DrawCharFontSpec(),  XftDrawGlyphSpec(),   XftDrawGlyphFontSpec(),
              and XftDrawRect() may be used to draw various objects using it.

       XftDraw
              is an opaque object which holds information used to render to an X
              drawable using either the core protocol or the X Rendering  exten&#8208;
              sion.

              XftDraw objects are created with any of XftDrawCreate() (which as&#8208;
              sociates an XftDraw with  an  existing  X  drawable),  XftDrawCre&#8208;
              ateBitmap(),  or  XftDrawCreateAlpha(),  and  destroyed  with Xft&#8208;
              DrawDestroy().  The X drawable associated with an XftDraw  can  be
              changed  with  XftDrawChange().  XftDraws are internally allocated
              and freed by Xft; the programmer does not ordinarily need to allo&#8208;
              cate or free storage for them.

              The X Display, Drawable, Colormap, and Visual of an XftDraw can be
              queried  with  XftDrawDisplay(),  XftDrawDrawable(),   XftDrawCol&#8208;
              ormap(),  and  XftDrawVisual(),  respectively.   The  X  Rendering
              Extension Picture associated with an XftDraw is returned  by  Xft&#8208;
              DrawPicture().

       XftCharSpec
              typedef struct _XftCharSpec {
                  FcChar32    ucs4;
                  short       x;
                  short       y;
              } XftCharSpec;

              The FcChar32 data type is defined by the Fontconfig library.

       XftCharFontSpec
              typedef struct _XftCharFontSpec {
                  XftFont     *font;
                  FcChar32    ucs4;
                  short       x;
                  short       y;
              } XftCharFontSpec;

              The FcChar32 data type is defined by the Fontconfig library.

       XftGlyphSpec
              typedef struct _XftGlyphSpec {
                  FT_UInt     glyph;
                  short       x;
                  short       y;
              } XftGlyphSpec;

              The FT_UInt data type is defined by the FreeType library.

       XftGlyphFontSpec
              typedef struct _XftGlyphFontSpec {
                  XftFont     *font;
                  FT_UInt     glyph;
                  short       x;
                  short       y;
              } XftGlyphFontSpec;

              The FT_UInt data type is defined by the FreeType library.

FUNCTIONS
   Opening and Matching Fonts
       XftFont *
       XftFontOpen (Display *dpy,
                    int     screen,
                    ...);
       XftFontOpen  takes  a  list of pattern element triples of the form field,
       type, value (terminated with a NULL), matches that  pattern  against  the
       available  fonts,  and  opens  the matching font, sizing it correctly for
       screen number screen on display dpy.  The Display data type is defined by
       the X11 library.  Returns NULL if no match is found.

       Example:
           font = XftFontOpen (dpy, screen,
                               XFT_FAMILY, XftTypeString, &quot;charter&quot;,
                               XFT_SIZE, XftTypeDouble, 12.0,
                               NULL);
       This  opens the &#8220;charter&#8221; font at 12 points.  The point size is automati&#8208;
       cally converted to the correct pixel size based on the resolution of  the
       monitor.
&#12;       XftFont *
       XftFontOpenName (Display       *dpy,
                        int           screen,
                        unsigned char *name);
       XftFontOpenName behaves as XftFontOpen does, except that it takes a Font&#8208;
       config pattern string  (which  is  passed  to  the  Fontconfig  library&apos;s
       FcNameParse() function).

       XftFont *
       XftFontOpenXlfd (Display       *dpy,
                        int           screen,
                        unsigned char *xlfd)
       XftFontOpenXlfd  behaves  as  XftFontOpen  does,  except  that it takes a
       string containing an X Logical Font Description (XLFD).

       FcPattern *
       XftFontMatch (Display   *dpy,
                     int       screen,
                     FcPattern *pattern,
                     FcResult  *result);
       Also used internally by the XftFontOpen* functions, XftFontMatch can also
       be  used directly to determine the Fontconfig font pattern resulting from
       an Xft font open request.  The FcPattern  and  FcResult  data  types  are
       defined by the Fontconfig library.

   Determining the Pixel Extents of a Text String
       void
       XftTextExtents8 (Display    *dpy,
                        XftFont    *font,
                        FcChar8    *string,
                        int        len,
                        XGlyphInfo *extents);
       XftTextExtents8 computes the pixel extents on display dpy of no more than
       len glyphs of a string consisting of eight-bit characters when drawn with
       font,  storing  them in extents.  The FcChar8 data type is defined by the
       Fontconfig library, and the XGlyphInfo data type is defined by the X Ren&#8208;
       dering Extension library.

       void

                         int        len,
                         XGlyphInfo *extents);
       XftTextExtents16  computes  the  pixel  extents on display dpy of no more
       than len glyphs of a string consisting  of  sixteen-bit  characters  when
       drawn  with  font,  storing  them  in extents.  The FcChar16 data type is
       defined by the Fontconfig  library,  and  the  XGlyphInfo  data  type  is
       defined by the X Rendering Extension library.

                         int        len,
                         XGlyphInfo *extents);
       XftTextExtents32  computes  the  pixel  extents on display dpy of no more
       than len glyphs of a string consisting of thirty-two-bit characters  when
       drawn  with  font,  storing  them  in extents.  The FcChar32 data type is
       defined by the Fontconfig  library,  and  the  XGlyphInfo  data  type  is
       defined by the X Rendering Extension library.

       void

                           int        len,
                           XGlyphInfo *extents);
       XftTextExtentsUtf8  computes  the pixel extents on display dpy of no more
       than len bytes of a UTF-8 encoded string when drawn  with  font,  storing
       them  in extents.  The XGlyphInfo data type is defined by the X Rendering
       Extension library.

       void
       XftTextExtentsUtf16 (Display    *dpy,
                            XftFont    *font,
                            FcChar8    *string,
                            FcEndian   endian,
                            int        len,
                            XGlyphInfo *extents);
       XftTextExtentsUtf16 computes the pixel extents on display dpy of no  more
       than  len bytes of a UTF-16LE- or UTF-16BE-encoded string when drawn with
       font, storing them in extents.  The endianness of string must  be  speci&#8208;
       fied  in  endian.   The  FcEndian  data type is defined by the Fontconfig
       library, and the XGlyphInfo data type  is  defined  by  the  X  Rendering
       Extension library.

       void
       XftGlyphExtents (Display    *dpy,
                        XftFont    *font,
                        FT_UInt    *glyphs,
                        int        nglyphs,
                        XGlyphInfo *extents);
       Also  used  internally  by the XftTextExtents* functions, XftGlyphExtents
       computes the pixel extents on display dpy of no more than nglyphs in  the
       array  glyphs drawn with font, storing them in extents.  The FT_UInt data
       type is defined by the FreeType library, and the XGlyphInfo data type  is
       defined by the X Rendering Extension library.

   Drawing Strings (and Other Things)
       XftDraw *
       XftDrawCreate (Display  *dpy,
                      Drawable drawable,
                      Visual   *visual,
                      Colormap colormap);
       XftDrawCreate  creates  a  structure  that can be used to render text and
       rectangles using the specified drawable, visual, and colormap on display.
       The  Drawable,  Visual,  and  Colormap  data types are defined by the X11
       library.

       XftDraw *
       XftDrawCreateBitmap (Display *dpy,
                            Pixmap  bitmap);
       XftDrawCreateBitmap behaves as XftDrawCreate, except it uses an X  pixmap
       of  color  depth  1  instead  of  an X drawable.  The Pixmap data type is
       defined by the X11 library.

       XftDraw *
       XftDrawCreateAlpha (Display *dpy,
                           Pixmap  pixmap,
                           int     depth);
       XftDrawCreateAlpha behaves as XftDrawCreate, except it uses an  X  pixmap
       of  color  depth depth instead of an X drawable.  The Pixmap data type is
       defined by the X11 library.

       void
       XftDrawChange (XftDraw  *draw,
                      Drawable drawable);

       object draw from its current value to drawable.

       Display *
       XftDrawDisplay (XftDraw *draw);
       XftDrawDisplay  returns  a pointer to the display associated with the Xft
       draw object draw.

       Drawable
       XftDrawDrawable (XftDraw *draw);
       XftDrawDrawable returns the X  drawable  associated  with  the  Xft  draw
       object draw.

       Colormap
       XftDrawColormap (XftDraw *draw);
       XftDrawColormap returns the colormap associatied with the Xft draw object
       draw.

       Visual *
       XftDrawVisual (XftDraw *draw);
       XftDrawVisual returns a pointer to the visual  associated  with  the  Xft
       draw object draw.

       Picture
       XftDrawPicture (XftDraw *draw);
       XftDrawPicture  returns  the  picture associated with the Xft draw object
       draw.  If the the X server does not support the X Rendering Extension,  0
       is returned.

       Picture
       XftDrawSrcPicture (XftDraw *draw,
                          XftColor *color);
       This  function is never called if the X server doesn&apos;t support the X Ren&#8208;

                       unsigned char   *string,
                       int             len);
       XftDrawString8  draws no more than len glyphs of string to Xft drawable d
       using font in color at position x, y.   The  XRenderColor  data  type  is
       defined by the X Rendering Extension library.

       void
       XftDrawRect (XftDraw        *d,
                    XRenderColor   *color,
                    int            x,
                    int            y,
                    unsigned int   width,
                    unsigned int   height);
       XftDrawRect  draws  a  solid rectangle of the specified color, width, and
       height at position x, y to Xft drawable d.

COMPATIBILITY
       As of version 2, Xft has become relatively  stable  and  is  expected  to
       retain source and binary compatibility in future releases.

       Xft does provide a compatibility interface to its previous major version,
       Xft 1.x, described below.

   Xft 1.x Compatibility Header File
       #include &lt;X11/Xft/XftCompat.h&gt;
&#12;   Xft 1.x Compatibility Data Types
       XftPattern
              holds a set of names with associated value lists; each name refers
              to  a  property  of a font.  XftPatterns are used as inputs to the
              matching code as well as holding information about specific fonts.

       XftFontSet
              contains a list of XftPatterns.  Internally, Xft  uses  this  data
              structure  to  hold  sets  of  fonts.  Externally, Xft returns the
              results of listing fonts in this format.

       XftObjectSet
              holds a set of names and is used  to  specify  which  fields  from
              fonts are placed in the the list of returned patterns when listing
              fonts.
