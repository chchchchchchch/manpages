XkbActionCtrls(3)                 XKB FUNCTIONS                XkbActionCtrls(3)



NAME
       XkbActionCtrls - Returns the ctrls fields of act converted to an unsigned
       int

SYNOPSIS
       unsigned int XkbActionCtrls (XkbCtrlsAction act);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action from which to extract controls

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbCtrlsAction structure change the state  of
       the boolean controls.

       The type field can have any one of the values shown in Table 1.


       c  s  l  l  l  lw(4i).   Table  1  Controls  Action Types _ Type Effect _
       XkbSA_SetControls   T{ A key press enables any boolean controls specified
       in  the ctrls fields that were not already enabled at the time of the key
       press.  A key release disables any controls enabled  by  the  key  press.
       This  action  can  cause  XkbControlsNotify  events.   T}  XkbSA_LockCon&#8208;
       trols  T{ If the XkbSA_LockNoLock bit is not set in the  flags  field,  a
       key  press  enables  any controls specified in the ctrls fields that were
       not already enabled at the time of the key press.
       If the XkbSA_LockNoUnlock bit is not  set  in  the  flags  field,  a  key
       release disables any controls specified in the ctrls fields that were not
       already disabled at the time of the key press.
       This action can cause XkbControlsNotify events.  T}

       The flags field is composed of the bitwise  inclusive  OR  of  the  masks
       shown in Table 2.


       c  s  l  l  l  lw(4i).   Table  2  Control  Action Flags _ Flag Meaning _
       XkbSA_LockNoLock    T{ If set, and the action type is XkbSA_LockControls,
       the server only disables controls.  T} XkbSA_LockNoUnlock  T{ If set, and
       the action type is XkbSA_LockControls, the server only enables  controls.
       T}

       The XkbSA_SetControls action implements a key that enables a boolean con&#8208;
       trol when pressed and disables it when released.  The  XkbSA_LockControls
       action  is  used  to  implement a key that toggles the state of a boolean
       control each time it is pressed and released.  The  XkbSA_LockNoLock  and
       XkbSA_LockNoUnlock  flags  allow  modifying the toggling behavior to only
       unlock or only lock the boolean control.

       The ctrls0, ctrls1, ctrls2, and ctrls3 fields represent the boolean  con&#8208;
       trols  in  the enabled_ctrls field of the controls structure. Xkb macros,
       to convert between the two formats.

       XkbActionCtrls returns the ctrls fields of act converted to  an  unsigned
       int.
