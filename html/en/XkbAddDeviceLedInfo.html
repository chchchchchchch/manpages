XkbAddDeviceLedInfo(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbAddDeviceLedInfo(3)



NAME
       XkbAddDeviceLedInfo - Initialize an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  XkbAddDeviceLedInfo  (XkbDeviceInfoPtr  device_info,
              unsigned int led_class, unsigned int led_id);

ARGUMENTS
       - device_info
              structure in which to add LED info

       - led_class
              input extension class for LED device of interest

       - led_id
              input extension ID for LED device of interest

DESCRIPTION
       XkbAddDeviceLedInfo  first  checks  to  see  whether  an  entry  matching
       led_class and led_id already exists in the device_info-&gt;leds array. If it
       finds a matching entry, it returns a pointer to that entry. Otherwise, it
       checks  to be sure there is at least one empty entry in device_info-&gt;leds
       and  extends  it  if  there  is  not  enough  room.  It  then  increments
       device_info-&gt;num_leds   and   fills   in  the  next  available  entry  in
       device_info-&gt;leds with led_class and led_id.

       If successful, XkbAddDeviceLedInfo returns a pointer to the XkbDeviceLed&#8208;
       InfoRec  structure that was initialized. If unable to allocate sufficient
       storage, or if device_info points to an invalid  XkbDeviceInfoRec  struc&#8208;
       ture,  or  if  led_class or led_id are inappropriate, XkbAddDeviceLedInfo
       returns NULL.

       To allocate additional space for button actions  in  an  XkbDeviceInfoRec
       structure, use XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions.


STRUCTURES
       Information  about  X  Input  Extension  devices is transferred between a
       client program and the Xkb extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:

           typedef struct {
               char *               name;          /&#8727; name for device */
               Atom                 type;          /&#8727; name for class of devices */
               unsigned short       device_spec;   /&#8727; device of interest */
               Bool                 has_own_state; /&#8727; True=&gt;this device has its own state */
               unsigned short       supported;     /&#8727; bits indicating supported capabilities */
               unsigned short       unsupported;   /&#8727; bits indicating unsupported capabilities */
               unsigned short       num_btns;      /&#8727; number of entries in btn_acts */
               XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /&#8727; button actions */
               unsigned short       sz_leds;       /&#8727; total number of entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       num_leds;      /&#8727; number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
               unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
               XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /&#8727; LED descriptions */
           } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;

               unsigned int        maps_present;     /&#8727; bits for which LEDs have maps in maps */
               unsigned int        names_present;    /&#8727; bits for which LEDs are in names */
               unsigned int        state;            /&#8727; 1 bit =&gt; corresponding LED is on */
               Atom                names[XkbNumIndicators];   /&#8727; names for LEDs */
               XkbIndicatorMapRec  maps;             /&#8727; indicator maps for each LED */
           } XkbDeviceLedInfoRec, *XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr;
