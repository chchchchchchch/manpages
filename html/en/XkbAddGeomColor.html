XkbAddGeomColor(3)                XKB FUNCTIONS               XkbAddGeomColor(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomColor  -   Add  one color name to an existing keyboard geometry
       description

SYNOPSIS
       XkbColorPtr XkbAddGeomColor (XkbGeometryPtr geom,  char  *spec,  unsigned
              int pixel);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to be updated

       - spec color to be added

       - pixel
              color to be added

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomColor adds the specified color name and pixel to the  specified
       geometry  geom.  The top-level geometry description includes a list of up
       to MaxColors (32) color names.  A color name is a string whose  interpre&#8208;
       tation is not specified by Xkb and neither is the pixel value&apos;s interpre&#8208;
       tation. All other geometry data structures refer to  colors  using  their
       indices  in  this global list or pointers to colors in this list.  XkbAd&#8208;
       dGeomColor returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or  if  it  was
       not  able to allocate space for the color. To allocate space for an arbi&#8208;
       trary number of colors to a geometry, use  the  XkbAllocGeomColors  func&#8208;
       tion.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbColor {
               unsigned int    pixel;      /&#8727; color */
               char *          spec;       /&#8727; color name */
           } XkbColorRec,*XkbColorPtr;
