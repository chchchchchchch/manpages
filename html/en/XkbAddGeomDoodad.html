XkbAddGeomDoodad(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbAddGeomDoodad(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomDoodad  - Add one doodad to a section of a keyboard geometry or
       to the top-level geometry

SYNOPSIS
       XkbDoodadPtr XkbAddGeomDoodad (XkbGeometryPtr  geom,  XkbSectionPtr  sec&#8208;
              tion, Atom name);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to which the doodad is added

       - section
              section, if any, to which the doodad is added

       - name name of the new doodad

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       A doodad describes some visible aspect of the keyboard that is not a  key
       and is not a section.  XkbAddGeomDoodad adds a doodad with name specified
       by name to the geometry geom if section is NULL or to the section of  the
       geometry  specified  by section if section is not NULL.  XkbAddGeomDoodad
       returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not  able  to
       allocate space for the doodad. If there is already a doodad with the name
       name in the doodad array for the geometry (if section  is  NULL)  or  the
       section  (if  section is non-NULL), a pointer to that doodad is returned.
       To allocate space for an arbitrary number of doodads to  a  section,  use
       the  XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads  function. To allocate space for an arbi&#8208;
       trary number of doodads to a keyboard geometry, use the  XkbAllocGeomDoo&#8208;
       dads function.
