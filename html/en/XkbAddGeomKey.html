XkbAddGeomKey(3)                  XKB FUNCTIONS                 XkbAddGeomKey(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomKey - Add one key at the end of an existing row of keys

SYNOPSIS
       XkbKeyPtr XkbAddGeomKey (XkbRowPtr row);

ARGUMENTS
       - row  row to be updated

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       Keys are grouped into rows.  XkbAddGeomKey adds one key to the end of the
       specified  row.   The key is allocated and zeroed.  XkbAddGeomKey returns
       NULL if row is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the key.
       To allocate space for an arbitrary number of keys to a row, use XkbAlloc&#8208;
       GeomKeys.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbKey {              /&#8727; key in a row */
               XkbKeyNameRec   name;             /&#8727; key name */
               short           gap;              /&#8727; gap in mm/10 from previous key in row */
               unsigned char   shape_ndx;        /&#8727; index of shape for key */
               unsigned char   color_ndx;        /&#8727; index of color for key body */
           } XkbKeyRec, *XkbKeyPtr;
