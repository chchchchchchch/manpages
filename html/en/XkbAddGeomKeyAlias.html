XkbAddGeomKeyAlias(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAddGeomKeyAlias(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomKeyAlias  -  Add one key alias to an existing keyboard geometry
       description

SYNOPSIS
       XkbKeyAliasPtr XkbAddGeomKeyAlias (XkbGeometryPtr geom, char *alias, char
              *real);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to be updated

       - alias
              alias to be added

       - real real name to be bound to the new alias

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomKeyAlias adds one key alias with the value alias to the  geome&#8208;
       try  geom, and associates it with the key whose real name is real. XkbAd&#8208;
       dGeomKeyAlias returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was
       not  able to allocate space for the alias. To allocate space for an arbi&#8208;
       trary number of aliases, use the XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases function.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct {
               char            real[XkbKeyNameLength];   /&#8727; this key name must be in the keys array */
               char            alias[XkbKeyNameLength];  /&#8727; symbolic key name as alias for the key */
           } XkbKeyAliasRec,*XkbKeyAliasPtr;
