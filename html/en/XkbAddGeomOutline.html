XkbAddGeomOutline(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbAddGeomOutline(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomOutline - Add one outline to an existing shape

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOutlinePtr XkbAddGeomOutline (XkbShapePtr shape, int sz_points);

ARGUMENTS
       - shape
              shape to be updated

       - sz_points
              number of points to be reserved

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       An outline consists of an arbitrary number of points.   XkbAddGeomOutline
       adds  an outline to the specified shape by reserving sz_points points for
       it. The new outline is allocated and zeroed.   XkbAddGeomOutline  returns
       NULL  if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate
       space. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of outlines to a  shape,
       use XkbAllocGeomOutlines.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOutline {
               unsigned short    num_points;      /&#8727; number of points in the outline */
               unsigned short    sz_points;       /&#8727; size of the points array */
               unsigned short    corner_radius;   /&#8727; draw corners as circles with this radius */
               XkbPointPtr       points;          /&#8727; array of points defining the outline */
           } XkbOutlineRec, *XkbOutlinePtr;
