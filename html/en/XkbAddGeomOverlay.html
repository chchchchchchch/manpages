XkbAddGeomOverlay(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbAddGeomOverlay(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomOverlay - Add one overlay to a section

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOverlayPtr  XkbAddGeomOverlay  (XkbSectionPtr  section, Atom name, int
              sz_rows);

ARGUMENTS
       - section
              section to which an overlay will be added

       - name name of the overlay

       - sz_rows
              number of rows to reserve in the overlay

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level  key&#8208;
       board  geometry.  In  each  case  the  num_ * fields of the corresponding
       structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_*  unless
       there  is  no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
       values of the element&apos;s structure from the  arguments.  For  other  func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The  top-level  geometry  description includes a list of geometry proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary  name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geome&#8208;
       try properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by  Xkb.  No  other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomOverlay  adds  an overlay with the specified name to the speci&#8208;
       fied section.  The new  overlay  is  created  with  space  allocated  for
       sz_rows rows. If an overlay with name name already exists in the section,
       a pointer to the existing overlay is returned.  XkbAddGeomOverlay returns
       NULL  if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate
       space for the overlay. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of over&#8208;
       lays to a section, use the XkbAllocGeomOverlay function.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOverlayRec {
               Atom                  name;            /&#8727; overlay name */
               XkbSectionPtr         section_under;   /&#8727; the section under this overlay */
               unsigned short        num_rows;        /&#8727; number of rows in the rows array */
               unsigned short        sz_rows;         /&#8727; size of the rows array */
               XkbOverlayRowPtr      rows;            /&#8727; array of rows in the overlay */
               XkbBoundsPtr          bounds;          /&#8727; bounding box for the overlay */
           } XkbOverlayRec,*XkbOverlayPtr;
