XkbAddGeomOverlayKey(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbAddGeomOverlayKey(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomOverlayKey - Add a key to an existing overlay row

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOverlayKeyPtr  XkbAddGeomOverlayKey  (XkbOverlayPtr overlay, XkbRowPtr
              row, char *under);

ARGUMENTS
       - overlay
              overlay to be updated

       - row  row in overlay to be updated

       - under
              primary name of the key to be considered

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level  key&#8208;
       board  geometry.  In  each  case  the  num_ * fields of the corresponding
       structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_*  unless
       there  is  no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
       values of the element&apos;s structure from the  arguments.  For  other  func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The  top-level  geometry  description includes a list of geometry proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary  name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geome&#8208;
       try properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by  Xkb.  No  other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomOverlayKey adds one key to the row in the overlay.  If there is
       no key named under in the row of the underlying section,  XkbAddGeomOver&#8208;
       layKey returns NULL.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOverlayKey {
               XkbKeyNameRec           over;      /&#8727; name of this overlay key */
               XkbKeyNameRec           under;     /&#8727; name of the key under this overlay key */
           } XkbOverlayKeyRec,*XkbOverlayKeyPtr;
