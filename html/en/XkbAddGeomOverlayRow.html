XkbAddGeomOverlayRow(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbAddGeomOverlayRow(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomOverlayRow - Add a row to an existing overlay

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOverlayRowPtr  XkbAddGeomOverlayRow  (XkbOverlayPtr overlay, XkbRowPtr
              row_under, int sz_keys);

ARGUMENTS
       - overlay
              overlay to be updated

       - row_under
              row to be overlayed in the section overlay overlays

       - sz_keys
              number of keys to reserve in the row

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level  key&#8208;
       board  geometry.  In  each  case  the  num_ * fields of the corresponding
       structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_*  unless
       there  is  no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
       values of the element&apos;s structure from the  arguments.  For  other  func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The  top-level  geometry  description includes a list of geometry proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary  name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geome&#8208;
       try properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by  Xkb.  No  other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomOverlayRow  adds  one row to the overlay.  The new row contains
       space for sz_keys keys. If row_under specifies a row that  doesn&apos;t  exist
       on  the underlying section, XkbAddGeomOverlayRow returns NULL and doesn&apos;t
       change the overlay.  XkbAddGeomOverlayRow returns  NULL  if  any  of  the
       parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the over&#8208;
       lay.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOverlayRow {
               unsigned short      row_under;    /&#8727; index into the row under this overlay row */
               unsigned short      num_keys;     /&#8727; number of keys in the keys array */
               unsigned short      sz_keys;      /&#8727; size of the keys array */
               XkbOverlayKeyPtr    keys;         /&#8727; array of keys in the overlay row */
           } XkbOverlayRowRec,*XkbOverlayRowPtr;
