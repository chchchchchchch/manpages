XkbAddGeomProperty(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAddGeomProperty(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomProperty  -  Add  one property to an existing keyboard geometry
       description

SYNOPSIS
       XkbPropertyPtr XkbAddGeomProperty (XkbGeometryPtr geom, char *name,  char
              *value);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to be updated

       - name name of the new property

       - value
              value for the new property

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomProperty adds one property with the specified name and value to
       the  keyboard geometry specified by geom. XkbAddGeomProperty returns NULL
       if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space
       for  the  property.  To allocate space for an arbitrary number of proper&#8208;
       ties, use the XkbAllocGeomProps function.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbProperty {
               char *         name;       /&#8727; property name */
               char *         value;      /&#8727; property value */
           } XkbPropertyRec,*XkbPropertyPtr;
