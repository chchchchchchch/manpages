XkbAddGeomRow(3)                  XKB FUNCTIONS                 XkbAddGeomRow(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomRow - Add a row to a section

SYNOPSIS
       XkbRowPtr XkbAddGeomRow (XkbSectionPtr section, int sz_keys);

ARGUMENTS
       - section
              section to be updated

       - sz_keys
              number of keys to be reserved

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level key&#8208;
       board geometry. In each case the  num_  *  fields  of  the  corresponding
       structure  is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless
       there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill  in  the
       values  of  the  element&apos;s  structure from the arguments. For other func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list  of  geometry  proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use  geome&#8208;
       try  properties  as  hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       One of the components of a keyboard geometry section is one or more  rows
       of keys.  XkbAddGeomRow adds one row to the specified section.  The newly
       created row contains space for the number of keys specified  in  sz_keys.
       They  are allocated and zeroed, but otherwise uninitialized.  XkbAddGeom&#8208;
       Row returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not  able
       to  allocate space for the row. To allocate space for an arbitrary number
       of rows to a section, use the XkbAllocGeomRows function.

STRUCTURES
       typedef struct _XkbRow {
               short           top;
               short           left;
               unsigned short  num_keys;
               unsigned short  sz_keys;
               int             vertical;
               XkbKeyPtr       keys;
               XkbBoundsRec    bounds;
       } XkbRowRec, *XkbRowPtr;
