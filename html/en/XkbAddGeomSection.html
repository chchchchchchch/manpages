XkbAddGeomSection(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbAddGeomSection(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomSection - Add one section to an existing keyboard geometry

SYNOPSIS
       XkbSectionPtr  XkbAddGeomSection  (XkbGeometryPtr  geom,  Atom  name, int
              sz_rows, int sz_doodads, int sz_overlays);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to be updated

       - name name of the new section

       - sz_rows
              number of rows to reserve in the section

       - sz_doodads
              number of doodads to reserve in the section

       - sz_overlays
              number of overlays to reserve in the section

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level  key&#8208;
       board  geometry.  In  each  case  the  num_ * fields of the corresponding
       structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_*  unless
       there  is  no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
       values of the element&apos;s structure from the  arguments.  For  other  func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The  top-level  geometry  description includes a list of geometry proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary  name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geome&#8208;
       try properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by  Xkb.  No  other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       A  keyboard geometry contains an arbitrary number of sections.  XkbAddGe&#8208;
       omSection adds one section to an existing keyboard  geometry  geom.   The
       new  section contains space for the number of rows, doodads, and overlays
       specified by sz_rows, sz_doodads, and sz_overlays.  The  new  section  is
       allocated  and zeroed and given the name specified by name.  If a section
       with name name already exists in the geometry, a pointer to the  existing
       section is returned.  XkbAddGeomSection returns NULL if any of the param&#8208;
       eters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for  the  section.
       To  allocate space for an arbitrary number of sections to a geometry, use
       XkbAllocGeomSections.

       } XkbSectionRec, *XkbSectionPtr;

       top and left are the origin of the section, relative to the origin of the
       keyboard, in mm/10. angle is in 1/10 degrees.
