XkbAddGeomShape(3)                XKB FUNCTIONS               XkbAddGeomShape(3)



NAME
       XkbAddGeomShape - Add a shape to a keyboard geometry

SYNOPSIS
       XkbShapePtr  XkbAddGeomShape (XkbGeometryPtr geom, Atom name, int sz_out&#8208;
              lines);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry to be updated

       - name name of the new shape

       - sz_outlines
              number of outlines to be reserved

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level  key&#8208;
       board  geometry.  In  each  case  the  num_ * fields of the corresponding
       structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change sz_*  unless
       there  is  no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
       values of the element&apos;s structure from the  arguments.  For  other  func&#8208;
       tions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure&apos;s elements.

       The  top-level  geometry  description includes a list of geometry proper&#8208;
       ties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary  name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geome&#8208;
       try properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by  Xkb.  No  other
       geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       A  geometry contains an arbitrary number of shapes, each of which is made
       up of an arbitrary number of outlines.  XkbAddGeomShape adds a shape to a
       geometry  geom  by  allocating  space for sz_outlines outlines for it and
       giving it the name specified by name.  If a shape with name name  already
       exists  in  the  geometry,  a  pointer to the existing shape is returned.
       XkbAddGeomShape returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or  if  it
       was not able to allocate space. To allocate space for an arbitrary number
       of geometry shapes, use XkbAllocGeomShapes.

               unsigned short    num_outlines;   /&#8727; number of outlines for the shape */
               unsigned short    sz_outlines;    /&#8727; size of the outlines array */
               XkbOutlinePtr     outlines;       /&#8727; array of outlines for the shape */
               XkbOutlinePtr     approx;         /&#8727; pointer into the array to the approximating outline */
               XkbOutlinePtr     primary;        /&#8727; pointer into the array to the primary outline */
               XkbBoundsRec      bounds;         /&#8727; bounding box for the shape; encompasses all outlines */
           } XkbShapeRec, *XkbShapePtr;
