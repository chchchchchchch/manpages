XkbAllocClientMap(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbAllocClientMap(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocClientMap  - Allocate and initialize an empty client map descrip&#8208;
       tion record

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocClientMap (XkbDescPtr xkb, unsigned  int  which,  unsigned
              int type_count);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  keyboard description in which to allocate client map

       - which
              mask selecting map components to allocate

       - type_count
              value of num_types field in map to be allocated

DESCRIPTION
       Calling  XkbGetMap  should  be  sufficient  for  most applications to get
       client and server maps. As a result, most applications  do  not  need  to
       directly allocate client and server maps.

       If you change the number of key types or construct map components without
       loading the necessary components from the X server, do not  allocate  any
       map  components  directly  using malloc or Xmalloc.  Instead, use the Xkb
       allocators, XkbAllocClientMap, and XkbAllocServerMap.

       Similarly,   use   the    Xkb    destructors,    XkbFreeClientMap,    and
       XkbFreeServerMap instead of free or Xfree.

       XkbAllocClientMap  allocates  and  initializes an empty client map in the
       map field of the keyboard description specified by xkb.  The which param&#8208;
       eter  specifies  the particular components of the client map structure to
       allocate and is a mask composed by a bitwise inclusive OR of one or  more
       of the masks shown in Table 1.

       c  s  l  l  l  lw(4i).   Table  1 XkbAllocClientMap Masks _ Mask Effect _
       XkbKeyTypesMask     T{ The  type_count  field  specifies  the  number  of
       entries  to  preallocate  for  the  types field of the client map. If the
       type_count field is less than XkbNumRequiredTypes returns BadValue.  T}

       XkbKeySymsMask T{ The min_key_code and max_key_code  fields  of  the  xkb
       parameter  are  used  to  allocate the syms and key_sym_map fields of the
       client map. The fields are allocated to contain  the  maximum  number  of
       entries necessary for max_key_code - min_key_code + 1 keys.  T}

       XkbModifierMapMask  T{  The  min_key_code  and max_key_code fields of the
       xkb parameter are used to allocate the modmap field of  the  client  map.
       The field is allocated to contain the maximum number of entries necessary
       for max_key_code - min_key_code + 1 keys.  T}

       NOTE: The min_key_code and max_key_code fields of the xkb parameter  must
       be legal values if the XkbKeySymsMask or XkbModifierMapMask masks are set
       in the which parameter. If they are not valid, XkbAllocClientMap  returns
       BadValue.

       If the client map of the keyboard description is not NULL, and any fields
       are already allocated in the client map, XkbAllocClientMap does not over&#8208;
       write  the  existing  values; it simply ignores that part of the request.
       The only exception is the types array. If type_count is greater than  the
       current  num_types field of the client map, XkbAllocClientMap resizes the
       types array and resets the num_types field accordingly.

       If XkbAllocClientMap is successful, it returns Success. Otherwise, it can
       return either BadMatch, BadAlloc, or BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb  was  not available in the
                      server or an argument has correct type and range,  but  is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
