XkbAllocDeviceInfo(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAllocDeviceInfo(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocDeviceInfo - Obtain an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       XkbDeviceInfoPtr  XkbAllocDeviceInfo  (unsigned int device_spec, unsigned
              int n_buttons, unsigned int sz_leds);

ARGUMENTS
       - device_spec
              device ID with which structure will be used

       - n_buttons
              number of button actions to allocate space for

       - sz_leds
              number of LED feedbacks to allocate space for

DESCRIPTION
       XkbAllocDeviceInfo allocates space for an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure  and
       initializes  that structure&apos;s device_spec field with the device ID speci&#8208;
       fied by device_spec.  If n_buttons is nonzero, n_buttons  XkbActions  are
       linked  into  the  XkbDeviceInfoRec structure and initialized to zero. If
       sz_leds is nonzero, sz_leds XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures are also allo&#8208;
       cated and linked into the XkbDeviceInfoRec structure. If you request Xkb&#8208;
       DeviceLedInfoRec structures be allocated using  this  request,  you  must
       initialize them explicitly.

       To obtain an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure, use XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo.

STRUCTURES
       Information  about  X  Input  Extension  devices is transferred between a
       client program and the Xkb extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:

           typedef struct {
               char *               name;          /&#8727; name for device */
               Atom                 type;          /&#8727; name for class of devices */
               unsigned short       device_spec;   /&#8727; device of interest */
               Bool                 has_own_state; /&#8727; True=&gt;this device has its own state */

               XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /&#8727; button actions */
               unsigned short       sz_leds;       /&#8727; total number of entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       num_leds;      /&#8727; number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
               unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
               XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /&#8727; LED descriptions */
           } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;

               unsigned int        phys_indicators;  /&#8727; bits for which LEDs physically present */
               unsigned int        maps_present;     /&#8727; bits for which LEDs have maps in maps */
               unsigned int        names_present;    /&#8727; bits for which LEDs are in names */
               unsigned int        state;            /&#8727; 1 bit =&gt; corresponding LED is on */
               Atom                names[XkbNumIndicators];   /&#8727; names for LEDs */
               XkbIndicatorMapRec  maps;             /&#8727; indicator maps for each LED */
           } XkbDeviceLedInfoRec, *XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr;
