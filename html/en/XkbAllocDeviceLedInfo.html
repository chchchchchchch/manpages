XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo(3)          XKB FUNCTIONS         XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo - Obtain an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       Status    XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo    (XkbDeviceInfoPtr   device_info,   int
              num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - device_info
              structure in which to allocate LED space

       - num_needed
              number of indicators to allocate space for

DESCRIPTION
       XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo allocates  space  for  an  XkbDeviceLedInfoRec  and
       places  it in device_info.  If num_needed is nonzero, num_needed XkbIndi&#8208;
       catorMapRec structures are also allocated  and  linked  into  the  XkbDe&#8208;
       viceLedInfoRec structure. If you request XkbIndicatorMapRec structures be
       allocated using this request, you must initialize  them  explicitly.  All
       other fields are initialized to zero.

       To initialize an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure, use XkbAddDeviceLedInfo.

STRUCTURES
       Information  about  X  Input  Extension  devices is transferred between a
       client program and the Xkb extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:

           typedef struct {
               char *               name;          /&#8727; name for device */
               Atom                 type;          /&#8727; name for class of devices */
               unsigned short       device_spec;   /&#8727; device of interest */
               Bool                 has_own_state; /&#8727; True=&gt;this device has its own state */
               unsigned short       supported;     /&#8727; bits indicating supported capabilities */
               unsigned short       unsupported;   /&#8727; bits indicating unsupported capabilities */
               unsigned short       num_btns;      /&#8727; number of entries in btn_acts */
               XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /&#8727; button actions */
               unsigned short       sz_leds;       /&#8727; total number of entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       num_leds;      /&#8727; number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
               unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
               XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /&#8727; LED descriptions */
           } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;


           typedef struct {
               unsigned short      led_class;        /&#8727; class for this LED device*/
               unsigned short      led_id;           /&#8727; ID for this LED device */
               unsigned int        phys_indicators;  /&#8727; bits for which LEDs physically present */
               unsigned int        maps_present;     /&#8727; bits for which LEDs have maps in maps */
               unsigned int        names_present;    /&#8727; bits for which LEDs are in names */
               unsigned int        state;            /&#8727; 1 bit =&gt; corresponding LED is on */
               Atom                names[XkbNumIndicators];   /&#8727; names for LEDs */
               XkbIndicatorMapRec  maps;             /&#8727; indicator maps for each LED */
           } XkbDeviceLedInfoRec, *XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr;

       Each indicator has its own set of attributes that specify whether clients
       can  explicitly  set  its state and whether it tracks the keyboard state.
       The attributes of each indicator are held in the maps array, which is  an
       array of XkbIndicatorRec structures:

           typedef struct {
               unsigned char   flags;            /&#8727; how the indicator can be changed */
               unsigned char   which_groups;     /&#8727; match criteria for groups */
               unsigned char   groups;           /&#8727; which keyboard groups the indicator watches */
               unsigned char   which_mods;       /&#8727; match criteria for modifiers */
               XkbModsRec      mods;             /&#8727; which modifiers the indicator watches */
               unsigned int    ctrls;            /&#8727; which controls the indicator watches */
           } XkbIndicatorMapRec, *XkbIndicatorMapPtr;

       This indicator map specifies for each indicator:


       &#183;    The  conditions  under which the keyboard modifier state affects the
            indicator

       &#183;    The conditions under which the  keyboard  group  state  affects  the
            indicator

       &#183;    The conditions under which the state of the boolean controls affects
            the indicator

       &#183;    The effect (if any) of attempts to explicitly change  the  state  of
            the indicator using the functions XkbSetControls or XChangeKeyboard&#8208;
            Control
