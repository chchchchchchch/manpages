XkbAllocGeomColors(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAllocGeomColors(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomColors - Allocate geometry colors

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomColors (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry for which colors should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new colors required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomColors allocates space for num_needed colors and adds them to
       the specified geometry geom.  A color name is a string whose  interpreta&#8208;
       tion is not specified by Xkb. All other geometry data structures refer to
       colors using their indices in this global list or pointers to  colors  in
       this list.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
