XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases(3)         XKB FUNCTIONS        XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases - Allocate geometry key aliases

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry for which key aliases should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new key aliases required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases  allocates  space  for  num_needed key aliases and
       adds them to the specified geometry geom.  A  key  alias  is  a  pair  of
       strings  that  associates  an alternate name for a key with the real name
       for that key.

       To free geometry key aliases, use XkbFreeGeomKeyAliases.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
