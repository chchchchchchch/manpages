XkbAllocGeomKeys(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbAllocGeomKeys(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomKeys  -  Allocate  space for an arbitrary number of keys to a
       row

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomKeys (XkbRowPtr row, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - row  row to which keys should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new keys required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomKeys allocates num_needed keys and adds them to the row.   No
       initialization of the keys is done.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
