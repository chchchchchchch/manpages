XkbAllocGeomOutlines(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbAllocGeomOutlines(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomOutlines - Allocate space for an arbitrary number of outlines
       to a shape

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomOutlines (XkbShapePtr shape, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - shape
              shape for which outlines should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new outlines required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomOutlines allocates space for num_needed outlines in the spec&#8208;
       ified shape.  The outlines are not initialized.

       To free geometry outlines, use XkbFreeGeomOutlines.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
