XkbAllocGeomPoints(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAllocGeomPoints(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomPoints - Allocate points in an outline

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomPoints (XkbOutlinePtr outline, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - outline
              outline for which points should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new points required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomPoints allocates space for num_needed points in the specified
       outline.  The points are not initialized.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
