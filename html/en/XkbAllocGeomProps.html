XkbAllocGeomProps(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbAllocGeomProps(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomProps - Allocate geometry properties

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomProps (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom _summary_

       - num_needed
              _summary_

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomProps allocates space for num_needed properties and adds them
       to the specified geometry geom.  No initialization of the  properties  is
       done.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
       arbitrary name. Geometry properties can be used to provide hints to  pro&#8208;
       grams  that  display images of keyboards, but they are not interpreted by
       Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
