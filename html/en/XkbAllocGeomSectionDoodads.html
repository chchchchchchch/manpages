XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads(3)     XKB FUNCTIONS    XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads - Allocate doodads that are specific to a sec&#8208;
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       Status    XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads    (XkbSectionPtr    section,    int
              num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - section
              section for which doodads should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new doodads required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads  allocates num_needed doodads and adds them to
       the specified section.  No initialization of the doodads is done.

       To free geometry doodads, use XkbFreeGeomDoodads.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
