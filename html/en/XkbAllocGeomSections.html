XkbAllocGeomSections(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbAllocGeomSections(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomSections - Allocate geometry sections

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomSections (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry for which sections should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new sections required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomSections  allocates  num_needed sections and adds them to the
       geometry geom.  No initialization of the sections is done.

       To free geometry sections, use XkbFreeGeomSections.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
