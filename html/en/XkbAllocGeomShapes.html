XkbAllocGeomShapes(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbAllocGeomShapes(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeomShapes  -  Allocate space for an arbitrary number of geometry
       shapes

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomShapes (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry for which shapes should be allocated

       - num_needed
              number of new shapes required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomShapes allocates space for num_needed shapes in the specified
       geometry geom.  The shapes are not initialized.

       To free geometry shapes, use XkbFreeGeomShapes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
