XkbAllocGeometry(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbAllocGeometry(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocGeometry - Allocate an entire geometry

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeometry (XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbGeometrySizesPtr sizes);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  keyboard description for which geometry is to be allocated

       - sizes
              initial sizes for all geometry components

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of
       a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to  create  or  modify  keyboard
       geometries.   Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
       element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in  your
       code.  These  allocation  functions  increase  sz_* but never touch num_*
       (unless there is an allocation failure, in which  case  they  reset  both
       sz_*  and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       XkbAllocGeometry  allocates  a  keyboard geometry and adds it to the key&#8208;
       board description specified by xkb.  The keyboard description  should  be
       obtained  via the XkbGetKeyboard or XkbAllocKeyboard functions. The sizes
       parameter specifies the number of elements to be reserved for the subcom&#8208;
       ponents of the keyboard geometry and can be zero or more. These subcompo&#8208;
       nents include the properties, colors, shapes, sections, and doodads.

       To free an entire geometry, use XkbFreeGeometry.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
