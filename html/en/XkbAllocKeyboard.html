XkbAllocKeyboard(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbAllocKeyboard(3)



NAME
       XkbAllocKeyboard -  Creates a keyboard description from scratch

SYNOPSIS
       XkbDescRec XkbAllocKeyboard (void);

DESCRIPTION
       Applications  seldom  need  to  directly allocate a keyboard description;
       calling XkbGetKeyboard usually suffices. In the event you need to  create
       a keyboard description from scratch, however, use XkbAllocKeyboard rather
       than directly calling malloc.

       If XkbAllocKeyboard  fails  to  allocate  the  keyboard  description,  it
       returns  NULL.   Otherwise,  it  returns  a  pointer to an empty keyboard
       description structure. The device_spec field will have  been  initialized
       to XkbUseCoreKbd. You may then either fill in the structure components or
       use Xkb functions to obtain values for the structure  components  from  a
       keyboard device.
