              changes);

DESCRIPTION
       XkbApplyCompatMapToKey  essentially  performs  the operation described in
       Core Keyboard Mapping to Xkb Keyboard Mapping Transformation  to  a  spe&#8208;
       cific key. This updates the behavior, actions, repeat status, and virtual
       modifier bindings of the key.

       Core Keyboard Mapping to Xkb Keyboard Mapping Transformation

       When a core protocol keyboard mapping request is received by the  server,
       the  server&apos;s  core  keyboard  map is updated, and then the Xkb map main&#8208;
       tained by the server is updated. Because a  client  may  have  explicitly
       configured some of the Xkb keyboard mapping in the server, this automatic
       regeneration of the Xkb keyboard mapping from the core protocol  keyboard
       mapping should not modify any components of the Xkb keyboard mapping that
       were explicitly set by a client. The client must  set  explicit  override
       controls to prevent this from happening (see Explicit Components-Avoiding
       Automatic Remapping by the Server). The core-to-Xkb mapping  is  done  as
       follows:

       Explicit Components-Avoiding Automatic Remapping by the Server

       Whenever  a  client remaps the keyboard using core protocol requests, Xkb
       examines the map to determine likely default values  for  the  components
       that cannot be specified using the core protocol.

       This  automatic  remapping might replace definitions explicitly requested
       by an application, so the Xkb keyboard description  defines  an  explicit
       components  mask  for  each  key.  Any aspects of the automatic remapping
       listed in the explicit components mask for a key are not changed  by  the
       automatic keyboard mapping.

       The  explicit  components  masks  are  held  in the explicit field of the
       server map, which is an array indexed by  keycode.  Each  entry  in  this
       array is a mask that is a bitwise inclusive OR of the values shown in Ta&#8208;
       ble 1.

       1.  Map the symbols from the keys in the core keyboard map to groups  and
           symbols on keys in the Xkb keyboard map. The core keyboard mapping is
           of fixed width, so each key in the core mapping has the  same  number
           of  symbols  associated  with it.  The Xkb mapping allows a different
           number of symbols to be associated with each key; those  symbols  may
           be  divided into a different number of groups (1-4) for each key. For
           each key, this process therefore involves partitioning the fixed num&#8208;
           ber  of  symbols  from the core mapping into a set of variable-length
           groups with a variable number of symbols in each group. For  example,
           if  the core protocol map is of width five, the partition for one key
           might result in one group with two symbols  and  another  with  three
           symbols.  A different key might result in two groups with two symbols
           plus a third group with one symbol. The core protocol map requires at
           least two symbols in each of the first two groups.

       1a. For  each  changed key, determine the number of groups represented in
           the new core keyboard map. This results in a  tentative  group  count
           for each key in the Xkb map.

       1b. For  each changed key, determine the number of symbols in each of the
           groups found in step 1a. There is one explicit override control asso&#8208;
           ciated  with  each  of  the  four  possible  groups for each Xkb key,
           ExplicitKeyType1 through ExplicitKeyType4. If  no  explicit  override
           control is set for a group, the number of symbols used for that group
           from the core map is two.  If the explicit override  control  is  set
           for a group on the key, the number of symbols used for that Xkb group
           from the core map is the width of the Xkb group with  one  exception:
           because  of the core protocol requirement for at least two symbols in
           each of groups one and two, the number of symbols used for groups one
           and two is the maximum of 2 or the width of the Xkb group.

       1c. For  each  changed  key,  assign  the  symbols in the core map to the
           appropriate group on the key. If the total number of symbols required
           by  the Xkb map for a particular key needs more symbols than the core
           protocol map contains, the additional symbols are taken to be  NoSym&#8208;
           bol keysyms appended to the end of the core set. If the core map con&#8208;
           tains more symbols than are needed by the Xkb map,  trailing  symbols
           in the core map are discarded. In the absence of an explicit override
           for group one or two, symbols are assigned in  order  by  group;  the
           first  symbols  in  the core map are assigned to group one, in order,
           followed by group two, and so on. For example, if the core  map  con&#8208;
           tained  eight  symbols  per key, and a particular Xkb map contained 2
           symbols for G1 and G2 and three for G3, the symbols would be assigned
           as (G is group, L is shift level):

                         G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3

           If an explicit override control is set for group one or two, the sym&#8208;
           bols are taken from the core set in a somewhat different  order.  The
           first  four  symbols  from  the  core set are assigned to G1L1, G1L2,
           G2L1, G2L2, respectively. If group one requires  more  symbols,  they
           are  taken next, and then any additional symbols needed by group two.
           Group three and four symbols are taken  in  complete  sequence  after
           group  two.  For example, a key with four groups and three symbols in
           each group would take symbols from the  core  set  in  the  following
           order:
&#12;              G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G1L3 G2L3 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3 G4L1 G4L2 G4L3

           As previously noted, the core protocol map requires at lease two sym&#8208;
           bols in groups one and two. Because of this, if an explicit  override
           control  for an Xkb key is set and group one and / or group two is of
           width one, it is not possible to generate the symbols taken from  the
           core protocol set and assigned to position G1L2 and / or G2L2.

       1d. For each group on each changed key, assign a key type appropriate for
           the symbols in the group.

       1e. For each changed key, remove any empty or redundant groups.

           At this point, the groups and  their  associated  symbols  have  been
           assigned to the corresponding key definitions in the Xkb map.

       2.  Apply  symbol  interpretations to modify key operation. This phase is
           completely skipped if the  ExplicitInterpret override control bit  is
           set  in the explicit controls mask for the Xkb key (see Explicit Com&#8208;
           ponents-Avoiding Automatic Remapping by the Server).

       2a. For each symbol on each changed key, attempt to match the symbol  and
           modifiers  from the Xkb map to a symbol interpretation describing how
           to generate the symbol.

       2b. When a match is found in step 2a, apply the symbol interpretation  to
           change  the  semantics associated with the symbol in the Xkb key map.
           If no match is found, apply a default interpretation.

       The symbol interpretations used in step 2 are  configurable  and  may  be
       specified   using   XkbSymInterpretRec   structures   referenced  by  the
       sym_interpret field of an XkbCompatMapRec.

       Symbol Interpretations - the XkbSymInterpretRec Structure

       Symbol interpretations are used to guide the X server  when  it  modifies
       the  Xkb  keymap  in  step 2. An initial set of symbol interpretations is
       loaded by the server when it starts. A client may add new ones using Xkb&#8208;
       SetCompatMap.

       Symbol  interpretations  result in key semantics being set. When a symbol
       interpretation is applied, the following components of server  key  event
       processing may be modified for the particular key involved:

           Virtual modifier map
           Auto repeat
           Key behavior (may be set to XkbKB_Lock)
           Key action

       The XkbSymInterpretRec structure specifies a symbol interpretation:

       typedef struct {
           KeySym        sym;         /&#8727; keysym of interest or NULL */
           unsigned char flags;       /&#8727; XkbSI_AutoRepeat, XkbSI_LockingKey */
           unsigned char match;       /&#8727; specifies how mods is interpreted */
           unsigned char mods;        /&#8727; modifier bits, correspond to eight real modifiers */
           unsigned char virtual_mod; /&#8727; 1 modifier to add to key virtual mod map */
           XkbAnyAction  act;         /&#8727; action to bind to symbol position on key */
       } XkbSymInterpretRec,*XkbSymInterpretPtr;

       If  sym is not NULL, it limits the symbol interpretation to keys on which
       that particular keysym is selected by the modifiers matching the criteria
       specified  by  mods and match.  If sym is NULL, the interpretation may be
       applied to any symbol selected on a key when the modifiers match the cri&#8208;
       teria specified by mods and match.
&#12;       match  must  be  one of the values shown in Table 2 and specifies how the
       real modifiers specified in mods are to be interpreted.


       c s s l l l l l lw(3i).  Table 2 Symbol Interpretation Match  Criteria  _
       Match  Criteria     Value     Effect _ XkbSI_NoneOf   (0)  T{ None of the
       bits that are on in  mods  can  be  set,  but  other  bits  can  be.   T}
       XkbSI_AnyOfOrNone   (1)  T{  Zero or more of the bits that are on in mods
       can be set, as well as others.  T} XkbSI_AnyOf    (2)  T{ One or more  of
       the  bits  that  are  on  in  mods can be set, as well as any others.  T}
       XkbSI_AllOf    (3)  T{ All of the bits that are on in mods must  be  set,
       but others may be set as well.  T} XkbSI_Exactly  (4)  T{ All of the bits
       that are on in mods must be set, and no other bits may be set.  T}

       In addition to the above bits, match may contain  the  XkbSI_LevelOneOnly
       bit,  in  which  case  the  modifier match criteria specified by mods and
       match applies only if sym is in level one of its group;  otherwise,  mods
       and  match  are ignored and the symbol matches a condition where no modi&#8208;
       fiers are set.

       #define XkbSI_LevelOneOnly  (0x80)  /&#8727; use mods + match only if sym is level 1 */

       If no matching symbol interpretation is found, the server uses a  default
       interpretation where:

           sym =           0
           flags =         XkbSI_AutoRepeat
           match =         XkbSI_AnyOfOrNone
           mods =          0
           virtual_mod =   XkbNoModifier
           act =           SA_NoAction

       When  a matching symbol interpretation is found in step 2a, the interpre&#8208;
       tation is applied to modify the Xkb map as follows.

       The act field specifies a single action to be bound to the  symbol  posi&#8208;
       tion;  any  key  event  that  selects  the symbol causes the action to be
       taken. Valid actions are defined in Key Actions.

       If the Xkb keyboard map for the key does  not  have  its  ExplicitVModMap
       control set, the XkbSI_LevelOneOnly bit and symbol position are examined.
       If the XkbSI_LevelOneOnly bit is not set in match or  the  symbol  is  in
       position  G1L1,  the virtual_mod field is examined. If virtual_mod is not
       XkbNoModifier, virtual_mod specifies a  single  virtual  modifier  to  be
       added  to the virtual modifier map for the key.  virtual_mod is specified
       as an index in the range [0..15].

       If the matching symbol is in position G1L1 of the key, two  bits  in  the
       flags field potentially specify additional behavior modifications:

       #define  XkbSI_AutoRepeat  (1&lt;&lt;0)  /&#8727; key repeats if sym is in position G1L1 */
       #define  XkbSI_LockingKey  (1&lt;&lt;1)  /&#8727; set KB_Lock behavior if sym is in psn G1L1 */

       If  the Xkb keyboard map for the key does not have its ExplicitAutoRepeat
       control set, its auto repeat behavior is set based on the  value  of  the
       XkbSI_AutoRepeat bit. If the XkbSI_AutoRepeat bit is set, the auto-repeat
       behavior of the key is turned on; otherwise, it is turned off.

       If the Xkb keyboard map for the key does not  have  its  ExplicitBehavior
       control  set,  its  locking  behavior  is  set  based on the value of the
       XkbSI_LockingKey bit. If XkbSI_LockingKey is set, the key behavior is set
       to KB_Lock; otherwise, it is turned off.
