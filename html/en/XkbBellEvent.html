XkbBellEvent(3)                   XKB FUNCTIONS                  XkbBellEvent(3)



NAME
       XkbBellEvent  -  Provides  a function that initiates a bell event for the
       keyboard without ringing the bell

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbBellEvent (Display *display, Window  window,  int  percent,  Atom
              name);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to the X server

       - window
              the event window, or None

       - percent,
              relative volume, which can range from -100 to 100 inclusive

       - name a bell name, or NULL

DESCRIPTION
       The core X protocol allows only applications to explicitly sound the sys&#8208;
       tem bell with a given duration, pitch, and volume. Xkb extends this capa&#8208;
       bility  by  allowing  clients  to attach symbolic names to bells, disable
       audible bells, and receive an event whenever the keyboard bell  is  rung.
       For  the purposes of this document, the audible bell is defined to be the
       system bell, or the default keyboard bell, as opposed to any other  audi&#8208;
       ble  sound  generated  elsewhere  in  the system.  You can ask to receive
       XkbBellNotify events when any client rings any one of the following:


       &#183;    The default bell

       &#183;    Any bell on an input device that can be specified  by  a  bell_class
            and bell_id pair

       &#183;    Any  bell  specified  only  by an arbitrary name. (This is, from the
            server&apos;s point of view, merely a name, and not  connected  with  any
            physical  sound-generating device. Some client application must gen&#8208;
            erate the sound, or visual feedback, if any, that is associated with
            the name.)

            You  can  also  ask  to receive XkbBellNotify events when the server
            rings the default bell or if any client has  requested  events  only
            (without  the  bell  sounding)  for any of the bell types previously
            listed.

            You can disable audible bells on a  global  basis.  For  example,  a
            client  that  replaces the keyboard bell with some other audible cue
            might want to turn off the AudibleBell control to prevent the server
            from  also  generating  a  sound and avoid cacophony. If you disable
            audible bells and request to receive XkbBellNotify events,  you  can
            generate feedback different from the default bell.

            You can, however, override the AudibleBell control by calling one of
            the functions that force the ringing of a bell in spite of the  set&#8208;
            ting  of  the  AudibleBell control - XkbForceDeviceBell or XkbForce&#8208;
            Bell.  In this case the server does not generate a bell event.

            Just as some keyboards can produce keyclicks to indicate when a  key
            is  pressed  or repeating, Xkb can provide feedback for the controls
            by using special beep codes. The AccessXFeedback control is used  to
            configure the specific types of operations that generate feedback.

            Bell Names

            You  can  associate a name to an act of ringing a bell by converting
            the name to an Atom and then using this name when you call the func&#8208;
            tions  listed in this chapter. If an event is generated as a result,
            the name is then passed to all other clients interested in receiving
            XkbBellNotify  events.  Note that these are arbitrary names and that
            there is no binding to any sounds. Any sounds or other effects (such
            as  visual bells on the screen) must be generated by a client appli&#8208;
            cation upon receipt of the bell event containing the name. There  is
            no  default name for the default keyboard bell. The server does gen&#8208;
            erate some predefined bells for the AccessX  controls.  These  named
            bells  are  shown in Table 1; the name is included in any bell event
            sent to clients that have requested to receive XkbBellNotify events.

            Audible Bells

            Using Xkb you can generate bell events that do not necessarily  ring
            the  system  bell. This is useful if you need to use an audio server
            instead of the system  beep.  For  example,  when  an  audio  client
            starts, it could disable the audible bell (the system bell) and then
            listen for XkbBellNotify events. When it  receives  a  XkbBellNotify
            event, the audio client could then send a request to an audio server
            to play a sound.

            You can control the audible bells feature by passing the XkbAudible&#8208;
            BellMask to XkbChangeEnabledControls.  If you set XkbAudibleBellMask
            on, the server rings the system bell when a bell event occurs.  This
            is  the  default. If you set XkbAudibleBellMask off and a bell event
            occurs, the server does not ring the system  bell  unless  you  call
            XkbForceDeviceBell or XkbForceBell.

            Audible bells are also part of the per-client auto-reset controls.

            Bell Functions

            Use  the  functions  described  in this section to ring bells and to
            generate bell events.

            The input extension has two types of  feedbacks  that  can  generate
            bells  -  bell feedback and keyboard feedback. Some of the functions
            in this section have bell_class and bell_id parameters; set them  as
            follows:  Set bell_class to BellFeedbackClass or KbdFeedbackClass. A
            device can have more than one feedback of each type; set bell_id  to
            the particular bell feedback of bell_class type.

            Table  2  shows  the  conditions  that  cause  a bell to sound or an
            XkbBellNotifyEvent to be generated when a bell function is called.
&#12;
            c s s s l l l l l l l l.  Table 2 Bell Sounding and Bell Event  Gen&#8208;
            erating   _   Function   called     AudibleBell    Server  sounds  a
            bell     Server   sends   an   XkbBellNotifyEvent    _    XkbDevice&#8208;
            Bell  On   Yes  Yes                     XkbDeviceBell  Off  No   Yes
            XkbBell   On   Yes  Yes      XkbBell   Off  No   Yes      XkbDevice&#8208;

            XkbDeviceForceBell  On   or   Off Yes  No    XkbForceBell   On    or
            Off Yes  No

            If  a  compatible  keyboard extension isn&apos;t present in the X server,
            XkbBellEvent  immediately  returns  False.  Otherwise,  XkbBellEvent
            calls  XkbDeviceBellEvent  with  the specified display, window, per&#8208;
            cent, and name, a device_spec  of  XkbUseCoreKbd,  a  bell_class  of
            XkbDfltXIClass,  and a bell_id of XkbDfltXIId, and returns what Xkb&#8208;
            DeviceBellEvent returns.

            XkbBellEvent generates a XkbBellNotify event.

            You can call XkbBellEvent without first  initializing  the  keyboard
            extension.

RETURN VALUES
       False          The  XkbBellEvent immediately returns False, if a compati&#8208;
                      ble keyboard extension isn&apos;t present in the X server.

STRUCTURES
       Xkb generates XkbBellNotify events for all bells except for those result&#8208;
       ing  from  calls  to  XkbForceDeviceBell  and  XkbForceBell.   To receive
       XkbBellNotify events under all possible conditions,  pass  XkbBellNotify&#8208;
       Mask  in both the bits_to_change and values_for_bits parameters to XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEvents.

       The XkbBellNotify event has no event details. It is either selected or it
       is  not.  However, you can call XkbSelectEventDetails using XkbBellNotify
       as the event_type and specifying XkbAllBellNotifyMask  in  bits_to_change
       and  values_for_bits.   This  has  the  same  effect  as a call to XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEvents.

       The structure for the XkbBellNotify event type contains:

          typedef struct _XkbBellNotify {
              int            type;        /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
              unsigned long  serial;      /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
              Bool           send_event;  /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
              Display *      display;     /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
              Time           time;        /&#8727; server time when event generated */
              int            xkb_type;    /&#8727; XkbBellNotify */
              unsigned int   device;      /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd
       */
              int            percent;     /&#8727; requested volume as % of max */
              int            pitch;       /&#8727; requested pitch in Hz */
              int            duration;    /&#8727; requested duration in microseconds */
              unsigned int   bell_class;  /&#8727; X input extension feedback class */
              unsigned int   bell_id;     /&#8727; X input extension feedback ID */
              Atom           name;        /&#8727; &quot;name&quot; of requested bell */
              Window         window;      /&#8727; window associated with event */
              Bool           event_only;  /&#8727; False -&gt; the server did not produce a beep
       */
          } XkbBellNotifyEvent;

       If your application needs to generate visual bell feedback on the  screen
       when  it  receives  a  bell  event, use the window ID in the XkbBellNoti&#8208;
       fyEvent, if present.
