XkbChangeDeviceInfo(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbChangeDeviceInfo(3)



NAME
       XkbChangeDeviceInfo  -  Update  the server&apos;s description of a device with
       the changes noted in an XkbDeviceChangesRec

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbChangeDeviceInfo  (Display  *dpy,  XkbDeviceInfoPtr  device_info,
              XkbDeviceChangesPtr changes);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - device_info
              local copy of device state and configuration

       - changes
              note specifying changes in device_info

DESCRIPTION
       XkbChangeDeviceInfo updates the server&apos;s description of the device speci&#8208;
       fied in device_info-&gt;device_spec with the changes  specified  in  changes
       and  contained in device_info.  The update is made by an XkbSetDeviceInfo
       request.

STRUCTURES
       Changes to an Xkb extension device may be tracked by listening to  XkbDe&#8208;
       viceExtensionNotify  events  and  accumulating  the  changes in an XkbDe&#8208;
       viceChangesRec structure. The changes noted in the structure may then  be
       used  in subsequent operations to update either a server configuration or
       a local copy of an Xkb extension device configuration. The changes struc&#8208;
       ture is defined as follows:

       typedef struct _XkbDeviceChanges {
           unsigned int         changed;        /&#8727; bits indicating what has changed */
           unsigned short       first_btn;      /&#8727; number of first button which changed, if any */
           unsigned short       num_btns;       /&#8727; number of buttons that have changed */
           XkbDeviceLedChangesRec leds;
       } XkbDeviceChangesRec,*XkbDeviceChangesPtr;
