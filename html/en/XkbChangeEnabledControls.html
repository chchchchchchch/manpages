XkbChangeEnabledControls(3)       XKB FUNCTIONS      XkbChangeEnabledControls(3)



NAME
       XkbChangeEnabledControls - Manipulates the EnabledControls control

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbChangeEnabledControls  (Display  *dpy, unsigned int device_spec,
              unsigned int mask, unsigned int values);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - device_spec
               keyboard device to modify

       - mask 1 bit -&gt; controls to enable / disable

       - values
              1 bit =&gt; enable, 0 bit =&gt; disable

DESCRIPTION
       The EnabledControls control is a bit mask where each bit that  is  turned
       on  means the corresponding control is enabled, and when turned off, dis&#8208;
       abled. It corresponds to the enabled_ctrls  field  of  an  XkbControlsRec
       structure (see STRUCTURES). The bits describing which controls are turned
       on or off are defined in Table 1.

       Table 1 shows the actual values for the  individual  mask  bits  used  to
       select  controls  for modification and to enable and disable the control.
       Note that the same mask bit is used to specify general  modifications  to
       the  parameters  used to configure the control (which), and to enable and
       disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no  &quot;ok&quot;
       in column) are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for
       controls that are not boolean controls and therefore cannot be enabled or
       disabled.

       Mask        ok   (0x00001FFF) XkbAllControlsMask  ok        (0xF8001FFF)

       The  mask  parameter specifies the boolean controls to be enabled or dis&#8208;
       abled, and the values mask specifies the new state  for  those  controls.
       Valid  values for both of these masks are composed of a bitwise inclusive
       OR of bits taken from the set of mask bits in Table 1, using  only  those
       masks with &quot;ok&quot; in the enabled_ctrls column.

       If  the  X server does not support a compatible version of Xkb or the Xkb
       extension has not  been  properly  initialized,  XkbChangeEnabledControls
       returns  False;  otherwise,  it  sends  the  request  to the X server and
       returns True.

       Note that the EnabledControls control only enables and disables controls;
       it  does  not configure them. Some controls, such as the AudibleBell con&#8208;
       trol, have no configuration  attributes  and  are  therefore  manipulated
       solely  by  enabling and disabling them. Others, however, have additional
       attributes to configure their behavior. For  example,  the  RepeatControl
       control uses repeat_delay and repeat_interval fields to describe the tim&#8208;
       ing behavior of keys that repeat. The RepeatControl behavior is turned on
       or  off depending on the value of the XkbRepeatKeysMask bit, but you must
       use other means, as described in this chapter, to configure its  behavior
       in detail.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The X server supports a compatible version of Xkb.

       False          The  X server does not support a compatible version of Xkb
                      or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized.

STRUCTURES
       The XkbControlsRec structure is defined as follows:

           #define XkbMaxLegalKeyCode     255
           #define XkbPerKeyBitArraySize  ((XkbMaxLegalKeyCode+1)/8)
