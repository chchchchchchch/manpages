XkbChangeIndicators(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbChangeIndicators(3)



NAME
       XkbChangeIndicators - Changes indicator maps or state without passing the
       entire keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbChangeIndicators (Display  *dpy,  XkbDescPtr  xkb,  XkbIndicator&#8208;
              ChangesPtr changes, unsigned int state);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - xkb  keyboard description from which names are to be taken.

       - changes
              indicators to be updated on the server

       - state
              new state of indicators listed in changes-&gt;state_changes

DESCRIPTION
       The  XkbIndicatorChangesRec identifies small modifications to the indica&#8208;
       tor map.  Use it with the  function  XkbChangeIndicators  to  reduce  the
       amount of traffic sent to the server (see STRUCTURES).

       The state_changes field is a mask that specifies the indicators that have
       changed state, and map_changes is a mask that  specifies  the  indicators
       whose maps have changed.

       XkbChangeIndicators  copies  any  maps specified by changes from the key&#8208;
       board description, xkb, to the server specified by dpy.  If any bits  are
       set  in the state_changes field of changes, XkbChangeIndicators also sets
       the state of those indicators to the values specified in the state  mask.
       A  1  bit in state turns the corresponding indicator on, a 0 bit turns it
       off.

       In addition, it can also generate XkbIndicatorStateNotify and  XkbIndica&#8208;
       torMapNotify events.

       Whenever   an  indicator  changes  state,  the  server  sends  XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotify events to all interested clients. Similarly,  whenever  an
       indicator&apos;s map changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to
       all interested clients.

       To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with  both
       the  bits_to_change  and values_for_bits parameters containing XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotifyMask. To receive XkbIndicatorMapNotify events,  use  XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEvents with XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.

       To  receive  events  for  only specific indicators, use XkbSelectEventDe&#8208;
       tails.   Set  the  event_type  parameter  to  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or
       XkbIndicatorMapNotify,   and   set   both  the  bits_to_change  and  val&#8208;
       ues_for_bits detail parameters to a mask where  each  bit  specifies  one
       indicator,  turning  on  those bits that specify the indicators for which
       you want to receive events.

       xkb_type  is  either  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or  XkbIndicatorMapNotify,
       depending  on  whether  the  event  is  a kbIndicatorStateNotify event or
       kbIndicatorMapNotify event.

       The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise inclusive OR  of  the
       indicators  that have changed. If the event is of type XkbIndicatorMapNo&#8208;
       tify, changed reports the maps that changed. If  the  event  is  of  type
       XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that have changed
       state.  state is a mask that specifies the current state of  all  indica&#8208;
       tors,  whether they have changed or not, for both XkbIndicatorStateNotify
       and IndicatorMapNotify events.

STRUCTURES
            typedef struct _XkbIndicatorChanges {
                unsigned int          state_changes;
                unsigned int           map_changes;
            }XkbIndicatorChangesRec,*XkbIndicatorChangesPtr;

       Both types of indicator events use the same structure:

           typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify {
               int            type;        /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
               unsigned long  serial;      /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
               Bool           send_event;  /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
               Display *      display;     /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
               Time           time;        /&#8727; server time when event generated */
               int            xkb_type;    /&#8727; specifies state or map notify */
               int            device;      /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd*/
               unsigned int   changed;     /&#8727; mask of indicators with new state or map */
               unsigned int   state;       /&#8727; current state of all indicators */
           } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;
