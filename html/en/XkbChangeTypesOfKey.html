XkbChangeTypesOfKey(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbChangeTypesOfKey(3)



NAME
       XkbChangeTypesOfKey  -  Obtain  the behaviors (the behaviors array) for a
       subset of the keys in a keyboard description from the server

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbChangeTypesOfKey (Display *dpy, unsigned  int  first,  unsigned
              int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to server

       - first
              keycode of first key to get

       - num  number of keys for which behaviors are desired

       - xkb  Xkb description to contain the result

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyBehaviors  sends a request to the server to obtain the behaviors
       for num keys on the keyboard starting  with  the  key  whose  keycode  is
       first.    It  waits  for  a  reply  and  returns  the  behaviors  in  the
       server-&gt;behaviors  field  of  xkb.   If  successful,   XkbGetKeyBehaviors
       returns Success.

       If the server map in the xkb parameter has not been allocated, XkbGetKey&#8208;
       Behaviors allocates and initializes it before obtaining the actions.

       If the server does not have a compatible  version  of  Xkb,  or  the  Xkb
       extension  has  not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns
       BadAccess. If  num  is  less  than  1  or  greater  than  XkbMaxKeyCount,
       XkbGetKeyBehaviors  returns  BadValue.  If  any  allocation errors occur,
       XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
