XkbComputeSectionBounds(3)        XKB FUNCTIONS       XkbComputeSectionBounds(3)



NAME
       XkbComputeSectionBounds - Update the bounding box of a section

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbComputeSectionBounds  (XkbGeometryPtr  geom,  XkbSectionPtr sec&#8208;
              tion);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry that contains the section

       - section
              section to be examined and updated

DESCRIPTION
        If you add or delete a row to or from a section, or if  you  change  the
       geometry  of  any of the rows in that section, you may need to update the
       bounding box for that section.

       XkbComputeSectionBounds examines all the rows of the section and  updates
       the  bounding  box of that section so that it contains all rows.  XkbCom&#8208;
       puteSectionBounds returns False if any of the arguments is  NULL;  other&#8208;
       wise, it returns True.
