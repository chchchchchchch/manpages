XkbComputeShapeBounds(3)          XKB FUNCTIONS         XkbComputeShapeBounds(3)



NAME
       XkbComputeShapeBounds - Updates the bounding box of a shape

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbComputeShapeBounds (XkbShapePtr shape);

ARGUMENTS
       - shape
              shape to be examined

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  a  number  of convenience functions to help use a keyboard
       geometry. These include functions to return the bounding box of a shape&apos;s
       top surface and to update the bounding box of a shape row or section.

       A  shape  is  made  up of a number of outlines. Each outline is a polygon
       made up of a number of points. The bounding box of a shape is a rectangle
       that contains all the outlines of that shape.

       A  ShapeRec  contains a BoundsRec that describes the bounds of the shape.
       If you add or delete an outline to or from a shape, the bounding box must
       be updated.

       XkbComputeShapeBounds  updates  the  BoundsRec  contained in the shape by
       examining all the outlines of the shape and setting the BoundsRec to  the
       minimum  x  and  minimum  y,  and maximum x and maximum y values found in
       those outlines.  XkbComputeShapeBounds returns False if shape is NULL  or
       if there are no outlines for the shape; otherwise, it returns True.

       If  you  add or delete a key to or from a row, or if you update the shape
       of one of the keys in that row, you may need to update the  bounding  box
       of  that  row.  To  update  the bounding box of a row, use XkbComputeRow&#8208;
       Bounds.
