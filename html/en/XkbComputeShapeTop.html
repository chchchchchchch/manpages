XkbComputeShapeTop(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbComputeShapeTop(3)



NAME
       XkbComputeShapeTop  - Determines the bounding box of the top surface of a
       shape

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbComputeShapeTop (XkbShapePtr shape, XkbBoundsPtr bounds_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - shape
              shape to be examined

       - bounds_rtrn
              backfilled with the bounding box for the shape

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of convenience functions to  help  use  a  keyboard
       geometry.   These  include  functions  to  return  the  bounding box of a
       shape&apos;s top surface and to update the bounding box of a shape row or sec&#8208;
       tion.

       A  shape  is  made  up of a number of outlines. Each outline is a polygon
       made up of a number of points. The bounding box of a shape is a rectangle
       that contains all the outlines of that shape.

       XkbComputeShapeTop  returns a BoundsRec that contains two x and y coordi&#8208;
       nates. These coordinates describe the corners of a  rectangle  that  con&#8208;
       tains  the  outline  that describes the top surface of the shape. The top
       surface is defined to be the approximating outline if the approx field of
       shape  is  not NULL. If approx is NULL, the top surface is defined as the
       last outline  in  the  shape&apos;s  array  of  outlines.   XkbComputeShapeTop
       returns False if shape is NULL or if there are no outlines for the shape;
       otherwise, it returns True.

STRUCTURES
       typedef struct _XkbBounds {
            short     x1,y1;    /&#8727; upper left corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */
            short     x2,y2;    /&#8727; lower right corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */
       } XkbBoundsRec, *XkbBoundsPtr;
