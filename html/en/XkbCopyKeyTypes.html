XkbCopyKeyTypes(3)                XKB FUNCTIONS               XkbCopyKeyTypes(3)



NAME
       XkbCopyKeyTypes - Copy more than one XkbKeyTypeRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       Status  XkbCopyKeyTypes  (XkbKeyTypePtr  from,  XkbKeyTypePtr  into,  int
              num_types);

ARGUMENTS
       - from pointer to array of XkbKeyTypeRecs to copy

       - into pointer to array of XkbKeyTypeRecs to change

       - num_types
              number of types to copy

DESCRIPTION
       XkbCopyKeyTypes copies num_types XkbKeyTypeRec structures from the  array
       specified  by  from into the array specified by into.  It is intended for
       copying between, rather than within, keyboard descriptions, so it doesn&apos;t
       check for overlaps. The same rules that apply to the from and into param&#8208;
       eters in XkbCopyKeyType apply to each entry of the from and  into  arrays
       of XkbCopyKeyTypes.  If any allocation errors occur while copying from to
       into, XkbCopyKeyTypes returns BadAlloc. Otherwise, XkbCopyKeyTypes copies
       from to into and returns Success.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The  XkbCopyKeyTypes  function  returns Success when there
                      are no allocation errors.

STRUCTURES
       Key types are used to determine the shift level of a key given  the  cur&#8208;
       rent state of the keyboard. The set of all possible key types for the Xkb
       keyboard description are held in the types field of the client map, whose
       total  size  is  stored  in  size_types,  and whose total number of valid
       entries is stored in num_types.  Key types are defined using the  follow&#8208;
       ing structure:

       typedef struct {                   /&#8727; Key Type */
           XkbModsRec        mods;        /&#8727; modifiers used to compute shift level */
           unsigned char     num_levels;  /&#8727; total # shift levels, do not modify
       directly */
           unsigned char     map_count;   /&#8727; # entries in map, preserve (if non-NULL)
       */
           XkbKTMapEntryPtr  map;         /&#8727; vector of modifiers for each shift level
       */
           XkbModsPtr        preserve;    /&#8727; mods to preserve for corresponding map
       entry */
           Atom              name;        /&#8727; name of key type */
           Atom *            level_names; /&#8727; array of names of each shift level */
       } XkbKeyTypeRec, *XkbKeyTypePtr;

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage
