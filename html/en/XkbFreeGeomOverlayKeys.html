XkbFreeGeomOverlayKeys(3)         XKB FUNCTIONS        XkbFreeGeomOverlayKeys(3)



NAME
       XkbFreeGeomOverlayKeys - Free keys in an overlay row

SYNOPSIS
       void  XkbFreeGeomOverlayKeys  (XkbRowPtr  row, int first, int count, Bool
              free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       - row  row in which keys should be freed

       - first
              first key to be freed

       - count
              number of keys to be freed

       - free_all
              True =&gt; all keys are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       If free_all is True, all keys are freed regardless of the value of  first
       and  count.   Otherwise, the number of keys specified by count are freed,
       beginning with the key specified by first in the specified row.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomOverlayKeys  function  returns  Success  if
                      there are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
