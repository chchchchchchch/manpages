XkbFreeGeomOverlays(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbFreeGeomOverlays(3)



NAME
       XkbFreeGeomOverlays - Free rows in a section

SYNOPSIS
       void  XkbFreeGeomOverlays  (XkbSectionPtr  section, int first, int count,
              Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       - section
              section in which overlays should be freed

       - first
              first overlay to be freed

       - count
              number of overlays to be freed

       - free_all
              True =&gt; all overlays are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       If free_all is True, all overlays are freed regardless of  the  value  of
       first  and  count.   Otherwise, the number of overlays specified by count
       are freed, beginning with the overlay specified by first in the specified
       section.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomOverlays functions returns Success if there
                      are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
