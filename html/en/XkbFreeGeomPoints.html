XkbFreeGeomPoints(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbFreeGeomPoints(3)



NAME
       XkbFreeGeomPoints - Free points in a outline

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomPoints (XkbOutlinePtr outline, int first, int count, Bool
              free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       - outline
              outline in which points should be freed

       - first
              first point to be freed

       - count
              number of points to be freed

       - free_all
              True =&gt; all points are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       If free_all is True, all points are freed regardless of the value  of  &gt;i
       first  and count.  Otherwise, the number of points specified by count are
       freed, beginning with the point specified by first in the specified  out&#8208;
       line.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The  XkbFreeGeomPoints function returns Success when there
                      are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
