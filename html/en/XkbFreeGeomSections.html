XkbFreeGeomSections(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbFreeGeomSections(3)



NAME
       XkbFreeGeomSections - Free geometry sections

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomSections (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int first, int count, Bool
              free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       - geom geometry in which sections should be freed

       - first
              first section to be freed

       - count
              number of sections to be freed

       - free_all
              True =&gt; all sections are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents  of
       a  keyboard  geometry.  Use  these functions to create or modify keyboard
       geometries.  Note that these functions merely allocate space for the  new
       element(s),  and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your
       code. These allocation functions increase  sz_*  but  never  touch  num_*
       (unless  there  is  an  allocation failure, in which case they reset both
       sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they  succeed,
       BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parame&#8208;
       ter is not as expected.

       If free_all is True, all sections are freed regardless of  the  value  of
       first  and  count.   Otherwise, the number of sections specified by count
       are freed, beginning with the section specified by first in the specified
       geometry.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The  XkbFreeGeomSections  function  returns  Success  when
                      there are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
