XkbGetAccessXTimeout(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbGetAccessXTimeout(3)



NAME
       XkbGetAccessXTimeout  -  Queries the current AccessXTimeout options for a
       keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetAccessXTimeout (Display *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned   short  *timeout_rtrn,  unsigned  int  *ctrls_mask_rtrn,
              unsigned     int      *ctrls_values_rtrn,      unsigned      short
              *options_mask_rtrn, unsigned short *options_values_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              unsigned short

       - device_spec
              device to query, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - timeout_rtrn
              delay until AccessXTimeout, seconds

       - ctrls_mask_rtrn
              backfilled with controls to modify

       - ctrls_values_rtrn
              backfilled with on/off status for controls

       - options_mask_rtrn
              backfilled with ax_options to modify

       - options_values_rtrn
              backfilled with values for ax_options

DESCRIPTION
       In  environments  where  computers  are shared, features such as SlowKeys
       present a problem: if SlowKeys is on, the keyboard can appear to be unre&#8208;
       sponsive  because keys are not accepted until they are held for a certain
       period of time. To help solve this problem, Xkb provides an  AccessXTime&#8208;
       out  control  to  automatically  change the enabled/disabled state of any
       boolean  controls  and  to  change  the  value  of  the  AccessXKeys  and
       AccessXFeedback  control  attributes if the keyboard is idle for a speci&#8208;
       fied period of time.

       When a timeout as specified by AccessXTimeout occurs  and  a  control  is
       consequently modified, Xkb generates an XkbControlsNotify event.

       XkbGetAccessXTimeout  sends  a request to the X server to obtain the cur&#8208;
       rent values for the AccessXTimeout attributes, waits  for  a  reply,  and
       backfills  the  values  into  the  appropriate  arguments. The parameters
       options_mask_rtrn and options_values_rtrn are backfilled with the options
       to  modify and the values for ax_options, which is a field in the XkbCon&#8208;
       trolsRec structure.  XkbGetAccessXTimeout returns True if successful;  if
       a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server,
       XkbGetAccessXTimeout returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetAccessXTimeout returns True when it successfully
                      sends a request to the X server to obtain the current val&#8208;
                      ues for the AccessXTimeout attributes, waits for a  reply,
                      and backfills the values into the appropriate arguments.

       False          The  XkbGetAccessXTimeout  funtion returns False if a com&#8208;
                      patible version of the Xkb extension is not  available  in
                      the server.
