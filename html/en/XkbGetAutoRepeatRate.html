XkbGetAutoRepeatRate(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbGetAutoRepeatRate(3)



NAME
       XkbGetAutoRepeatRate - Gets the current attributes of the RepeatKeys con&#8208;
       trol for a keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetAutoRepeatRate (Display *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned int *timeout_rtrn, unsigned int *interval_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - device_spec
              desired device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - timeout_rtrn
              backfilled with initial repeat delay, ms

       - interval_rtrn
              backfilled with subsequent repeat delay, ms

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire key&#8208;
       board or individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is
       a boolean control that extends this capability by adding control over the
       delay until a key begins to repeat and the  rate  at  which  it  repeats.
       RepeatKeys  is coupled with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys
       is enabled or disabled, the core auto-repeat is enabled or  disabled  and
       vice versa.

       Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, timeout,
       is the delay after the initial press of an  auto-repeating  key  and  the
       first  generated repeat event. The second, interval, is the delay between
       all subsequent generated repeat events. As  with  all  boolean  controls,
       configuring  the  attributes that determine how the control operates does
       not automatically enable the control as a whole.

       XkbGetAutoRepeatRate queries the server for the  current  values  of  the
       RepeatControls  control  attributes,  backfills  timeout_rtrn  and inter&#8208;
       val_rtrn with them, and returns True. If a compatible version of the  Xkb
       extension  is  not  available  in the server XkbGetAutoRepeatRate returns
       False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns True if  a  com&#8208;
                      patible  version  of the Xkb extension is available in the
                      server.

       False          The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns False if a  com&#8208;
                      patible  version  of the Xkb extension is not available in
                      the server.
