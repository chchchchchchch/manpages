XkbGetAutoResetControls(3)        XKB FUNCTIONS       XkbGetAutoResetControls(3)



NAME
       XkbGetAutoResetControls  - Gets the current values of the auto-reset con&#8208;
       trols

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetAutoResetControls (Display *dpy,  unsigned  int   *auto_ctrls,
              unsigned int  *auto_values);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy
               connection to X server

       - auto_ctrls
               specifies which bits in auto_values are relevant

       - auto_values
              1 bit =&gt; corresponding control has auto-reset on

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  configure  the  boolean controls to automatically be enabled or
       disabled when a program exits. This  capability  is  controlled  via  two
       masks  maintained  in  the  X  server  on a per-client basis. There is no
       client-side Xkb data structure corresponding to these masks. Whenever the
       client  exits for any reason, any boolean controls specified in the auto-
       reset mask are set to the corresponding value from the auto-reset  values
       mask.  This  makes it possible for clients to &quot;clean up after themselves&quot;
       automatically, even if abnormally terminated. The bits used in the  masks
       correspond to the EnabledControls control bits.

       For  example,  a  client  that replaces the keyboard bell with some other
       audible cue might want to turn off the AudibleBell control to prevent the
       server  from  also  generating a sound and avoid cacophony. If the client
       were to exit without resetting the AudibleBell control, the user would be
       left  without  any feedback at all. Setting AudibleBell in both the auto-
       reset mask and auto-reset values guarantees that the audible bell will be
       turned back on when the client exits.

       XkbGetAutoResetControls  backfills  auto_ctrls  and  auto_values with the
       AutoReset control attributes for this particular client. It returns  True
       if successful, and False otherwise.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbGetAutoResetControls function returns True when it
                      successfully backfills auto_ctrls and auto_values with the
                      AutoReset control attributes for this particular client.

       False          The XkbGetAutoResetControls function returns False when it
                      does not successfully backfill auto_ctrls and  auto_values
                      with  the AutoReset control attributes for this particular
                      client.
