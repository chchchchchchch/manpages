XkbGetCompatMap(3)                XKB FUNCTIONS               XkbGetCompatMap(3)



NAME
       XkbGetCompatMap  - Fetch any combination of the current compatibility map
       components from the server

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetCompatMap (Display *display, unsigned int which,  XkbDescRec
              *xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to server

       - which
              mask of compatibility map components to fetch

       - xkb  keyboard description where results placed

DESCRIPTION
       When  another  client modifies the compatibility map, you are notified if
       you have selected for XkbCompatMapNotify events.  XkbGetCompatMap is par&#8208;
       ticularly useful when you receive an event of this type, as it allows you
       to update your program&apos;s version of the compatibility map  to  match  the
       modified  version now in the server. If your program is dealing with mul&#8208;
       tiple servers and needs to configure them all in a  similar  manner,  the
       updated compatibility map may be used to reconfigure other servers.

       XkbGetCompatMap fetches the components of the compatibility map specified
       in which from the server specified by display and places them in the com&#8208;
       pat  structure  of  the keyboard description xkb.  Valid values for which
       are an inclusive OR of the values shown in Table 1.


       c s s l l l  l  l  l.   Table  1  Compatibility  Map  Component  Masks  _
       Mask Value     Affecting _ XkbSymInterpMask    (1&lt;&lt;0)    Symbol interpre&#8208;
       tations    XkbGroupCompatMask  (1&lt;&lt;1)    Group     maps     XkbAllCompat&#8208;
       Mask    (0x3)     All compatibility map components

       If no compatibility map structure is allocated in xkb upon entry, XkbGet&#8208;
       CompatMap allocates one. If one already exists, its  contents  are  over&#8208;
       written with the returned results.

       XkbGetCompatMap  fetches  compatibility  map  information  for the device
       specified by the device_spec field of xkb.  Unless you have  specifically
       modified  this field, it is the default keyboard device.  XkbGetCompatMap
       returns Success if successful, BadAlloc if it is unable to obtain  neces&#8208;
       sary  storage for either the return values or work space, BadMatch if the
       dpy field of the xkb argument is non-NULL and does not match the  display
       argument,  and BadLength under certain conditions caused by server or Xkb
       implementation errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadLength      The length of a request is shorter  or  longer  than  that
                      required to minimally contain the arguments

       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb  was  not available in the
                      server or an argument has correct type and range,  but  is
                      otherwise invalid
