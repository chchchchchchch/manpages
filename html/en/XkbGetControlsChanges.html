XkbGetControlsChanges(3)          XKB FUNCTIONS         XkbGetControlsChanges(3)



NAME
       XkbGetControlsChanges  -  Updates  a local copy of a keyboard description
       with the changes previously noted by one or  more  calls  to  XkbNoteCon&#8208;
       trolsChanges

SYNOPSIS
       XkbGetControlsChanges  (Display  *dpy,  XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbNameChangesPtr
              changes);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - xkb  xkb-&gt;ctrls will be updated

       - changes
              indicates which parts of xkb-&gt;ctrls to update

DESCRIPTION
       Whenever a field in the controls structure changes in the  server&apos;s  key&#8208;
       board  description,  the  server  sends an XkbControlsNotify event to all
       interested clients.To receive XkbControlsNotify events under all possible
       conditions,  use  XkbSelectEvents  and pass XkbControlsNotifyMask in both
       bits_to_change and values_for_bits.

       To receive XkbControlsNotify events only under  certain  conditions,  use
       XkbSelectEventDetails using XkbControlsNotify as the event_type and spec&#8208;
       ifying the desired state changes in  bits_to_change  and  values_for_bits
       using mask bits from Table 1.

       Table  1  shows  the  actual  values for the individual mask bits used to
       select controls for modification and to enable and disable  the  control.
       Note  that  the same mask bit is used to specify general modifications to
       the parameters used to configure the control (which), and to  enable  and
       disable  the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no &quot;ok&quot;
       in column) are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for
       controls that are not boolean controls and therefore cannot be enabled or
       disabled.

       Mask  ok        (0xF8001FFF)

       The changed_ctrls field  specifies  the  controls  components  that  have
       changed  and  consists of bits taken from the masks defined in Table 10.7
       with &quot;ok&quot; in the changed_ctrls column.

       The controls  currently  enabled  in  the  server  are  reported  in  the
       enabled_ctrls  field. If any controls were just enabled or disabled (that
       is, the contents of the enabled_ctrls field changed), they are flagged in
       the  enabled_ctrl_changes  field. The valid bits for these fields are the
       masks listed in Table 10.7 with &quot;ok&quot; in  the  enabled_ctrls  column.  The
       num_groups  field reports the number of groups bound to the key belonging
       to the most number of groups and is automatically updated when  the  key&#8208;
       board mapping changes.

       If  the  change  was  caused  by a request from a client, the keycode and
       event_type fields are set to zero and the req_major and req_minor  fields
       identify the request. The req_major value is the same as the major exten&#8208;
       sion opcode. Otherwise, event_type is set  to  the  type  of  event  that
       caused   the   change   (one  of  KeyPress,  KeyRelease,  DeviceKeyPress,
       DeviceKeyRelease,  ButtonPress  or  ButtonRelease),  and  req_major   and
       req_minor   are   undefined.   If  event_type  is  KeyPress,  KeyRelease,
       DeviceKeyPress, or DeviceKeyRelease, the keycode field is set to the  key
       that  caused  the  change. If event_type is ButtonPress or ButtonRelease,
       keycode contains the button number.

       When a client receives  an  XkbControlsNotify  event,  it  can  note  the
       changes in a changes structure using XkbNoteControlsChanges.

       XkbGetControlsChanges  examines the changes parameter, queries the server
       for the necessary information, and copies the results into the xkb-&gt;ctrls
       keyboard  description.  If  the  ctrls  field  of xkb is NULL, XkbGetCon&#8208;
       trolsChanges allocates and initializes it. To free the ctrls  field,  use
       XkbFreeControls.

       XkbGetControlsChanges  returns  Success  if  successful  and can generate
       BadAlloc, BadImplementation, and BadMatch errors.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbGetControlsChanges function returns Success if  the
                      query of the server was successful.

STRUCTURES
       The structure for the XkbControlsNotify event is defined as follows:

       typedef struct {
           int           type;          /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
           unsigned long serial;        /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
           Bool          send_event;    /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
           Display *     display;       /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
           Time          time;          /&#8727; server time when event generated */
           int           xkb_type;      /&#8727; XkbCompatMapNotify */
           int           device;        /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */
           unsigned int  changed_ctrls; /&#8727; bits indicating which controls data have
       changed*/
           unsigned int  enabled_ctrls; /&#8727; controls currently enabled in server */
           unsigned int  enabled_ctrl_changes; /&#8727; bits indicating enabled/disabled
       controls */
           int           num_groups;    /&#8727; current number of keyboard groups */
           KeyCode       keycode;       /&#8727; != 0 =&gt; keycode of key causing change */
           char          event_type;    /&#8727; Type of event causing change */
           char          req_major;     /&#8727; major event code of event causing change */
           char          req_minor;     /&#8727; minor event code of event causing change */
       } XkbControlsNotifyEvent;

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server

       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb  was  not available in the
                      server or an argument has correct type and range,  but  is
                      otherwise invalid
