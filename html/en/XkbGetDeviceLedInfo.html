XkbGetDeviceLedInfo(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbGetDeviceLedInfo(3)



NAME
       XkbGetDeviceLedInfo  - Query the indicator names, maps, and state associ&#8208;
       ated with an LED feedback of an input extension device

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetDeviceLedInfo (Display *dpy,  XkbDeviceInfoPtr  device_info,
              unsigned int led_class, unsigned int led_id, unsigned int which);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - device_info
              structure to update with results

       - led_class
              LED feedback class assigned by input extension

       - led_id
              LED feedback ID assigned by input extension

       - which
              mask indicating desired information

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetDeviceLedInfo  queries  the  server for the desired LED information
       for the feedback specified by led_class and led_id for the X input exten&#8208;
       sion  device indicated by device_spec-&gt;device_info and waits for a reply.
       If successful,  XkbGetDeviceLedInfo  backfills  the  relevant  fields  of
       device_info  as determined by which with the results and returns Success.
       Valid values for which are the inclusive OR of  any  of  XkbXI_Indicator&#8208;
       NamesMask, XkbXI_IndicatorMapsMask, and XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask.

       The  fields  of device_info that are filled in when this request succeeds
       are name, type, supported, and unsupported,  and  portions  of  the  leds
       structure  corresponding to led_class and led_id as indicated by the bits
       set in which.  The device_info-&gt;leds vector is allocated if necessary and
       sz_leds and num_leds filled in. The led_class, led_id and phys_indicators
       fields of the device_info-&gt;leds  entry  corresponding  to  led_class  and
       led_id are always filled in.

       If  which  contains XkbXI_IndicatorNamesMask, the names_present and names
       fields of the device_info-&gt;leds structure corresponding to led_class  and
       led_id  are updated, if which contains XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask, the cor&#8208;
       responding state field is updated, and if  which  contains  XkbXI_Indica&#8208;
       torMapsMask, the maps_present and maps fields are updated.

       If  a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb
       extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetDeviceLedInfo  returns
       BadAccess.  If allocation errors occur, a BadAlloc status is returned. If
       the device has no indicators, a BadMatch error is returned.  If  ledClass
       or  ledID have illegal values, a BadValue error is returned. If they have
       legal values but do not specify a feedback  that  contains  LEDs  and  is
       associated with the specified device, a BadMatch error is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb  was  not available in the
                      server or an argument has correct type and range,  but  is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
