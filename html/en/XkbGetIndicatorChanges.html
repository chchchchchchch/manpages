XkbGetIndicatorChanges(3)         XKB FUNCTIONS        XkbGetIndicatorChanges(3)



NAME
       XkbGetIndicatorChanges - Updates a local copy of the keyboard description
       with the actual values of one or more calls to XkbNoteIndicatorChanges

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetIndicatorChanges (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr  xkb,  XkbIndica&#8208;
              torChangesPtr changes, unsigned int state);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - xkb  keyboard description to hold the new values

       - changes
              indicator maps/state to be obtained from the server

       - state
              backfilled with the state of the indicators

DESCRIPTION
       Whenever   an  indicator  changes  state,  the  server  sends  XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotify events to all interested clients. Similarly,  whenever  an
       indicator&apos;s map changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to
       all interested clients.

       To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with  both
       the  bits_to_change  and values_for_bits parameters containing XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotifyMask. To receive XkbIndicatorMapNotify events,  use  XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEvents with XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.

       To  receive  events  for  only specific indicators, use XkbSelectEventDe&#8208;
       tails.   Set  the  event_type  parameter  to  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or
       XkbIndicatorMapNotify,   and   set   both  the  bits_to_change  and  val&#8208;
       ues_for_bits detail parameters to a mask where  each  bit  specifies  one
       indicator,  turning  on  those bits that specify the indicators for which
       you want to receive events.

       Both types of indicator events use the same structure:

       typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify {
         int            type;       /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
         unsigned long  serial;     /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
         Bool           send_event; /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
         Display *      display;    /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
         Time           time;       /&#8727; server time when event generated */
         int            xkb_type;   /&#8727; specifies state or map notify */
         int            device;     /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */
         unsigned int   changed;    /&#8727; mask of indicators with new state or map */
         unsigned int   state;      /&#8727; current state of all indicators */
       } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;

       xkb_type  is  either  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or  XkbIndicatorMapNotify,
       depending  on  whether  the  event  is  a kbIndicatorStateNotify event or
       kbIndicatorMapNotify event.

       The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise inclusive OR  of  the
       indicators  that have changed. If the event is of type XkbIndicatorMapNo&#8208;
       tify, changed reports the maps that changed. If  the  event  is  of  type
       XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that have changed
       state.  state is a mask that specifies the current state of  all  indica&#8208;
       tors,  whether they have changed or not, for both XkbIndicatorStateNotify
       and IndicatorMapNotify events.

       When your client application receives  either  a  XkbIndicatorStateNotify
       event  or  XkbIndicatorMapNotify  event,  you  can  note the changes in a
       changes structure by calling XkbNoteIndicatorChanges.

       XkbGetIndicatorChanges examines the changes  parameter,  pulls  over  the
       necessary  information  from  the server, and copies the results into the
       xkb keyboard description. If any bits are set in the state_changes  field
       of changes, XkbGetIndicatorChanges also places the state of those indica&#8208;
       tors in state.  If the indicators field of xkb is NULL,  XkbGetIndicator&#8208;
       Changes  allocates  and initializes it. To free the indicators field, use
       XkbFreeIndicators.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid
