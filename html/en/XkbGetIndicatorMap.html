XkbGetIndicatorMap(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbGetIndicatorMap(3)



NAME
       XkbGetIndicatorMap  -  Gets  the  map for one or more indicators, using a
       mask to specify the indicators

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetIndicatorMap (Display *dpy, unsigned int  which,  XkbDescPtr
              desc);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - which
              mask of indicators for which maps should be returned

       - desc keyboard description to be updated

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  allows applications to obtain information about indicators using two
       different methods. The first method, which  is  similar  to  the  core  X
       implementation, uses a mask to specify the indicators. The second method,
       which is more suitable for applications concerned with  interoperability,
       uses  indicator  names. The correspondence between the indicator name and
       the bit position in masks is as follows: one of the  parameters  returned
       from XkbGetNamedIndicators is an index that is the bit position to use in
       any function call that requires a mask of indicator bits, as well as  the
       indicator&apos;s index into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.


       XkbGetIndicatorMap  obtains the maps from the server for only those indi&#8208;
       cators specified by the which mask and copies the values  into  the  key&#8208;
       board description specified by desc.  If the indicators field of the desc
       parameter is NULL, XkbGetIndicatorMap allocates and initializes it.

       To free the indicator maps, use XkbFreeIndicatorMaps.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server
