XkbGetIndicatorState(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbGetIndicatorState(3)



NAME
       XkbGetIndicatorState  - Obtains the current state of the keyboard indica&#8208;
       tors

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetIndicatorState (Display *display, unsigned int  device_spec,
              unsigned int state_return);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to the X server

       - device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - state_return
              backfilled with a mask of the indicator state

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  allows applications to obtain information about indicators using two
       different methods. The first method, which  is  similar  to  the  core  X
       implementation, uses a mask to specify the indicators. The second method,
       which is more suitable for applications concerned with  interoperability,
       uses  indicator  names. The correspondence between the indicator name and
       the bit position in masks is as follows: one of the  parameters  returned
       from XkbGetNamedIndicators is an index that is the bit position to use in
       any function call that requires a mask of indicator bits, as well as  the
       indicator&apos;s index into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.

       XkbGetIndicatorState  queries the display for the state of the indicators
       on the device specified by the device_spec.  For each indicator  that  is
       &quot;turned on&quot; on the device, the associated bit is set in state_return.  If
       a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server,
       XkbGetIndicatorState  returns  a  BadMatch error. Otherwise, it sends the
       request to the  X  server,  places  the  state  of  the  indicators  into
       state_return, and returns Success. Thus the value reported by XkbGetIndi&#8208;
       catorState is identical to the value reported by the core protocol.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid
