XkbGetKeyActions(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbGetKeyActions(3)



NAME
       XkbGetKeyActions  -  Update the actions (the key_acts array) for a subset
       of the keys in a keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyActions (Display *dpy, unsigned int first,  unsigned  int
              num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - first
              keycode of first key of interest

       - num  number of keys desired

       - xkb  pointer to keyboard description where result is stored

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyActions  sends a request to the server to obtain the actions for
       num keys on the keyboard starting with key first.  It waits for  a  reply
       and  returns  the  actions in the server-&gt;key_acts field of xkb.  If suc&#8208;
       cessful, XkbGetKeyActions returns Success. The xkb parameter  must  be  a
       pointer to a valid Xkb keyboard description.

       If  the  server  map,  in  the  xkb  parameter,  has  not been allocated,
       XkbGetKeyActions  allocates  and  initializes  it  before  obtaining  the
       actions.

       If  the  server  does  not  have  a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb
       extension has not been  properly  initialized,  XkbGetKeyActions  returns
       BadAccess.  If  num  is  less  than  1  or  greater  than XkbMaxKeyCount,
       XkbGetKeyActions  returns  BadValue.  If  any  allocation  errors  occur,
       XkbGetKeyActions returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
