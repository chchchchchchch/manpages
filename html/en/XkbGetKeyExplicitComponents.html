XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents(3)    XKB FUNCTION    XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents(3)



NAME
       XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents   -   Obtain  the  explicit  components  (the
       explicit array) for a subset of the keys in a keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents (Display  *dpy,  unsigned  int  first,
              unsigned int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to server

       - first
              keycode of first key to fetch

       - num  number of keys for which to get explicit info

       - xkb  Xkb description in which to put results

DESCRIPTION
       Whenever  a  client remaps the keyboard using core protocol requests, Xkb
       examines the map to determine likely default values  for  the  components
       that  cannot be specified using the core protocol (see Core Keyboard Map&#8208;
       ping to Xkb Keyboard Mapping Transformation for more information  on  how
       Xkb chooses the default values).

       DO  THE  FOUR  PAGES  OF  &quot;CORE  KEYBOARD MAPPING TO XKB KEYBOARD MAPPING
       TRANSFORMATION&quot; NEED TO BE ADDED HERE?

       This automatic remapping might replace definitions  explicitly  requested
       by  an  application,  so the Xkb keyboard description defines an explicit
       components mask for each key. Any  aspects  of  the  automatic  remapping
       listed  in  the explicit components mask for a key are not changed by the
       automatic keyboard mapping.

       The explicit components masks are held  in  the  explicit  field  of  the
       server  map,  which  is  an  array indexed by keycode. Each entry in this
       array is a mask that is a bitwise inclusive OR of the values shown in Ta&#8208;
       ble 1.

       with Group3.  T} ExplicitKeyType4    (1&lt;&lt;3)    T{ Automatic determination

       Automatic  determination  of auto-repeat status for the key, as specified
       in a symbol interpretation.   T}  ExplicitBehavior    (1&lt;&lt;6)    T{  Auto&#8208;
       matic   assignment  of  the  XkbKB_Lock  behavior  to  the  key,  if  the
       XkbSI_LockingKey flag is set in a symbol interpretation.   T}  ExplicitV&#8208;
       ModMap     (1&lt;&lt;7)    T{  Automatic  determination of the virtual modifier
       map for the key based on the actions assigned to the key and  the  symbol
       interpretations that match the key.  T}

       XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents  sends  a request to the server to obtain the
       explicit components for num keys on the keyboard starting with key first.
       It  waits  for  a  reply  and  returns  the  explicit  components  in the
       server-&gt;explicit array of xkb.   If  successful,  XkbGetKeyExplicitCompo&#8208;
       nents returns Success. The xkb parameter must be a pointer to a valid Xkb
       keyboard description.

       If the server map in the xkb parameter has not been allocated, XkbGetKey&#8208;
       ExplicitComponents  allocates  and  initializes  it  before obtaining the
       actions.

       If the server does not have a compatible  version  of  Xkb,  or  the  Xkb
       extension  has not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents
       returns BadMatch. If num is less than 1 or greater  than  XkbMaxKeyCount,
       XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents  returns  BadValue.  If any allocation errors
       occur, XkbGetKeyExplicitComponents returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
