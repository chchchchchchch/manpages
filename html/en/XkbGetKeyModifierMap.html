XkbGetKeyModifierMap(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbGetKeyModifierMap(3)



NAME
       XkbGetKeyModifierMap  -  Update  the  modifier map for one or more of the
       keys in a keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyModifierMap (Display *dpy, unsigned int  first,  unsigned
              int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - first
              keycode of first key to get

       - num  number of keys for which information is desired

       - xkb  keyboard description to update

DESCRIPTION
       The modmap entry of the client map is an array, indexed by keycode, spec&#8208;
       ifying the real modifiers bound to a key. Each entry is a  mask  composed
       of  a  bitwise inclusive OR of the legal real modifiers: ShiftMask, Lock&#8208;
       Mask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, and  Mod5Mask.
       If a bit is set in a modmap entry, the corresponding key is bound to that
       modifier.

       Pressing or releasing the key bound to a modifier  changes  the  modifier
       set  and unset state. The particular manner in which the modifier set and
       unset state changes is determined by the behavior and actions assigned to
       the key.

       XkbGetKeyModifierMap  sends a request to the server for the modifier map&#8208;
       pings for num keys starting with the key  whose  keycode  is  first.   It
       waits  for  a reply and places the results in the xkb-&gt;map-&gt;modmap array.
       If successful, XkbGetKeyModifier returns Success.

       If the map component  of  the  xkb  parameter  has  not  been  allocated,
       XkbGetKeyModifierMap allocates and initializes it.

       If  a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb
       extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeySyms returns BadAc&#8208;
       cess.  If  any  allocation errors occur while obtaining the modifier map,
       XkbGetKeyModifierMap returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage
