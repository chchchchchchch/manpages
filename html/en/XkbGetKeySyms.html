XkbGetKeySyms(3)                  XKB FUNCTIONS                 XkbGetKeySyms(3)



NAME
       XkbGetKeySyms - Obtain the symbols for a subset of the keys in a keyboard
       description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeySyms (Display *dpy, unsigned int first, unsigned int num,
              XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - first
              keycode of first key to get

       - num  number of keycodes for which syms desired

       - xkb  Xkb description to be updated

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeySyms  sends a request to the server to obtain the set of keysyms
       bound to num keys starting with the key whose keycode is first.  It waits
       for  a  reply  and  returns the keysyms in the map.syms field of xkb.  If
       successful, XkbGetKeySyms returns Success. The xkb parameter  must  be  a
       pointer to a valid Xkb keyboard description.

       If  the  client  map  in  the  xkb  parameter  has  not  been  allocated,
       XkbGetKeySyms allocates and initializes it before obtaining the symbols.

       If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the  Xkb
       extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeySyms returns BadAc&#8208;
       cess. If num is less than 1 or greater than XkbMaxKeyCount, XkbGetKeySyms
       returns  BadValue.  If any allocation errors occur, XkbGetKeySyms returns
       BadAlloc.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbGetKeySyms function returns Success if  it  gets  a
                      reply  to  a  request  to  the server to obtain the set of
                      keysyms bound to num keys starting with the key whose key&#8208;
                      code is first.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
