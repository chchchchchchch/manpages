NAME
       XkbGetKeyTypes  -  Obtain the list of available key types in the server&apos;s
       keyboard mapping

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyTypes (Display *dpy, unsigned  int  first,  unsigned  int
              num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - first
              index to first type to get, 0 =&gt; 1st type

       - num  number of key types to be returned

       - xkb  keyboard description containing client map to update

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyTypes  queries  the  server  for  the desired types, waits for a
       reply, and returns the desired types in the xkb-&gt;map-&gt;types.  If success&#8208;
       ful, it returns Success.

       XkbGetKeyTypes  returns BadAccess if the Xkb extension has not been prop&#8208;
       erly initialized and BadValue if the combination of first and num results
       in numbers out of valid range.

       NOTE:  XkbGetKeyTypes  is  used  to  obtain descriptions of the key types
       themselves, not the key types bound to individual keys. To obtain the key
       types  bound  to an individual key, refer to the key_sym_map field of the
       client map.

DIAGNOSTICS
