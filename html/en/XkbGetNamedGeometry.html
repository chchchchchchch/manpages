XkbGetNamedGeometry(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbGetNamedGeometry(3)



NAME
       XkbGetNamedGeometry  -  Loads  a  keyboard geometry description from this
       database by name

SYNTAX
       Status XkbGetNamedGeometry (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb, Atom name);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - xkb  keyboard description into which the geometry should be loaded

       - name name of the geometry to be loaded

DESCRIPTION
       It is also possible to load a keyboard geometry by  name.  The  X  server
       maintains a database of keyboard components (see below).

       XkbGetNamedGeometry can return BadName if the name cannot be found.

       The  X  server maintains a database of keyboard components, identified by
       component type.  The database contains all the information  necessary  to
       build a complete keyboard description for a particular device, as well as
       to assemble partial descriptions. Table 1 identifies the component  types
       and the type of information they contain.

       While a keymap is a database entry for a complete  keyboard  description,
       and  therefore logically different from the individual component database
       entries, the rules for processing keymap entries are identical  to  those
       for  the individual components.  In the discussion that follows, the term
       component is used to refer to either individual components or a keymap.
&#12;       There may be multiple entries for each of the component types.  An  entry
       may be either complete or partial.  Partial entries describe only a piece
       of the corresponding keyboard component and are designed to  be  combined
       with other entries of the same type to form a complete entry.

       For example, a partial symbols map might describe the differences between
       a common ASCII keyboard and some national layout. Such a partial  map  is
       not  useful on its own because it does not include those symbols that are
       the same on both the ASCII and national layouts (such as function  keys).
       On  the  other  hand, this partial map can be used to configure any ASCII
       keyboard to use a national layout.

       When a keyboard description is built, the components are processed in the
       order in which they appear in Table 1; later definitions override earlier
       ones.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadName        A font or color of the specified name does not exist.
