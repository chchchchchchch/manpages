XkbGetNamedIndicator(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbGetNamedIndicator(3)



NAME
       XkbGetNamedIndicator  -  Look  up the indicator map and other information
       for an indicator by name

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetNamedIndicator (Display  *dpy,  unsigned  int  dev_spec,  Atom
              name,   int   *ndx_rtrn,   Bool   *state_rtrn,  XkbIndicatorMapPtr
              map_rtrn, Bool *real_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - dev_spec
              keyboard device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - name name of the indicator to be retrieved

       - ndx_rtrn
              backfilled with the index of the retrieved indicator

       - state_rtrn
              backfilled with the current state of the retrieved indicator

       - map_rtrn
               backfilled with the mapping for the retrieved indicator

       - real_rtrn
              backfilled with True if the named indicator is real (physical)

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb also allows applications to refer to indicators by name. Use  XkbGet&#8208;
       Names  to  get  the  indicator names. Using names eliminates the need for
       hard-coding bitmask values for particular keyboards. For example, instead
       of  using  vendor-specific  constants  such as WSKBLed_ScrollLock mask on
       Digital workstations or XLED_SCROLL_LOCK on  Sun  workstations,  you  can
       instead  use XkbGetNamedIndicator to look up information on the indicator
       named &quot;Scroll Lock.&quot;

       If the device specified by  device_spec  has  an  indicator  named  name,
       XkbGetNamedIndicator  returns  True and populates the rest of the parame&#8208;
       ters with information about the indicator. Otherwise,  XkbGetNamedIndica&#8208;
       tor returns False.

       The  ndx_rtrn  field returns the zero-based index of the named indicator.
       This index is the bit position to use in any function call that  requires
       a  mask  of  indicator  bits,  as  well as the indicator&apos;s index into the
       XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.  state_rtrn returns the  current
       state  of the named indicator (True = on, False = off).  map_rtrn returns
       the indicator map for the named indicator. In addition, if the  indicator
       is mapped to a physical LED, the real_rtrn parameter is set to True.

       Each  of  the  &quot; _rtrn &quot; arguments is optional; you can pass NULL for any
       unneeded &quot; _rtrn &quot; arguments.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetNamedIndicator  function  returns  True  if  the
                      device  specified  by  device_spec  has an indicator named
                      name.

       False          The XkbGetNamedIndicator function  returns  False  if  the
                      device specified by device_spec does not have an indicator
                      named name.
