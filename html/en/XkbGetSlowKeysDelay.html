XkbGetSlowKeysDelay(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbGetSlowKeysDelay(3)



NAME
       XkbGetSlowKeysDelay  -  Gets the SlowKeys acceptance delay for a keyboard
       device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetSlowKeysDelay (Display  *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned int *delay_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - delay_rtrn
              backfilled with SlowKeys delay, ms

DESCRIPTION
       Some users may accidentally bump keys while moving a hand or typing stick
       toward the key they want. Usually, the keys that are accidentally  bumped
       are  just hit for a very short period of time. The SlowKeys control helps
       filter these accidental bumps by telling the server to wait  a  specified
       period,  called  the  SlowKeys  acceptance  delay,  before delivering key
       events. If the key is released before this period elapses, no key  events
       are generated. Users can then bump any number of keys on their way to the
       one they want without accidentally getting those  characters.  Once  they
       have  reached  the key they want, they can then hold the desired key long
       enough for the computer to accept it. SlowKeys is a boolean control  with
       one configurable attribute.

       When  the  SlowKeys control is active, the server reports the initial key
       press, subsequent acceptance or rejection, and  release  of  any  key  to
       interested  clients  by  sending  an appropriate AccessXNotify event (see
       section 10.6.4).

       The server can generate XkbAccessXNotify events for some  of  the  global
       keyboard  controls.   The  detail field describes what AccessX event just
       occurred and can be any of the values in Table 1.  The server can  gener&#8208;
       ate  XkbAccessXNotify  events  for  some of the global keyboard controls.
       The detail field describes what AccessX event just occurred  and  can  be
       any of the values in Table 1.


       c  s  l  l  l  lw(4i).  Table 1 AccessXNotify Events _ detail    Reason _
       XkbAXN_SKPress T{ A key  was  pressed  when  SlowKeys  was  enabled.   T}
       XkbAXN_SKAccept     T{  A key was accepted (held longer than the SlowKeys
       delay).  T} XkbAXN_SKRelease    T{ An accepted SlowKeys key was released.
       T}  XkbAXN_SKReject     T{  A  key  was  rejected  (released  before  the
       SlowKeys delay expired).  T} XkbAXN_BKAccept     T{ A key was accepted by
       BounceKeys.  T} XkbAXN_BKReject     T{ A key was rejected (pressed before
       the BounceKeys delay expired).  T} XkbAXN_AXKWarning   T{ AccessXKeys  is
       about to turn on/off StickyKeys or BounceKeys.  T}


       The  keycode  field  reports  the  keycode of the key for which the event
       occurred. If the action is related to SlowKeys, the  slowKeysDelay  field
       contains  the current SlowKeys acceptance delay. If the action is related
       to BounceKeys, the debounceDelay field contains  the  current  BounceKeys
       debounce delay.

       Selecting for AccessX Events

       To  receive  XkbAccessXNotify  events  under all possible conditions, use
       XkbSelectEvents and pass XkbAccesXNotifyMask in both  bits_to_change  and
       values_for_bits.

       To receive XkbStateNotify events only under certain conditions, use XkbS&#8208;
       electEventDetails using XkbAccessXNotify as the event_type and specifying
       the  desired  state  changes  in bits_to_change and values_for_bits using
       mask bits from Table 2.


       c s s l l l l l lw(3i).  Table 2 AccessXNotify  Event  Details  _  XkbAc&#8208;
       cessXNotify  Event  Details     Value     Circumstances _ XkbAXN_SKPress&#8208;
       Mask  (1&lt;&lt;0)    T{ Slow key press notification wanted T} XkbAXN_SKAccept&#8208;
       Mask (1&lt;&lt;1)    T{ Slow key accept notification wanted T} XkbAXN_SKReject&#8208;
       Mask (1&lt;&lt;2)    T{ Slow key reject  notification  wanted  T}  XkbAXN_SKRe&#8208;
       leaseMask     (1&lt;&lt;3)    T{   Slow  key  release  notification  wanted  T}
       XkbAXN_BKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;4)    T{ Bounce key accept notification wanted T}
       XkbAXN_BKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;5)    T{ Bounce key reject notification wanted T}
       XkbAXN_AXKWarningMask    (1&lt;&lt;6)    T{ AccessX warning notification wanted
       T}  XkbAllAccessXEventsMask  (0x7f)    T{  All AccessX features notifica&#8208;
       tions wanted T}

       XkbGetSlowKeysDelay requests the attributes of the SlowKeys control  from
       the  server, waits for a reply and backfills delay_rtrn with the SlowKeys
       delay attribute.   XkbGetSlowKeysDelay  returns  True  if  successful;  ,
       XkbGetSlowKeysDelay returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbGetSlowKeysDelay  function  returns  True  if  the
                      request of the Slowkeys control from the server  was  suc&#8208;
                      cessful.

       False          The  XkbGetSlowKeysDelay  function returns False if a com&#8208;
                      patible version of the Xkb extension is not  available  in
                      the server.

STRUCTURES
       The structure for the XkbAccessXNotify event type is as follows:

       typedef struct {
           int            type;           /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
           unsigned long  serial;         /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
           Bool           send_event;     /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
           Display *      display;        /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
           Time           time;           /&#8727; server time when event generated */
           int            xkb_type;       /&#8727; XkbAccessXNotify */
           int            device;         /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd
