XkbIgnoreExtension(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbIgnoreExtension(3)



NAME
       XkbIgnoreExtension  -   Prevents  core  X library keyboard functions from
       using the X Keyboard Extension

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbIgnoreExtension (Bool *ignore);

ARGUMENTS
       ignore True means ignore the extension

DESCRIPTION
       If a server supports the Xkb extension, the X library normally implements
       preXkb  keyboard  functions using the Xkb keyboard description and state.
       The server Xkb keyboard state may differ from the preXkb keyboard  state.
       This  difference  does not affect most clients, but there are exceptions.
       To allow these clients to work properly, you may instruct  the  extension
       not to use Xkb functionality.

       Call XkbIgnoreExtension to prevent core X library keyboard functions from
       using the X Keyboard Extension. You must call  XkbIgnoreExtension  before
       you  open  a  server  connection; Xkb does not provide a way to enable or
       disable use of the extension once a connection is established.

       XkbIgnoreExtension tells the X library whether  to  use  the  X  Keyboard
       Extension  on any subsequently opened X display connections. If ignore is
       True, the library does not initialize the Xkb extension when it  opens  a
       new  display. This forces the X server to use compatibility mode and com&#8208;
       municate with the client using only core protocol requests and events. If
       ignore is False, the library treats subsequent calls to XOpenDisplay nor&#8208;
       mally and uses Xkb extension requests, events, and state. Do not  explic&#8208;
       itly  use  Xkb on a connection for which it is disabled.  XkbIgnoreExten&#8208;
       sion returns False if it was unable to apply the ignore request.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbIgnoreExtension returns True if

       False          The XkbIgnoreExtension function returns False  if  it  was
                      unable to apply the ignore request.
