XkbKeyAction(3)                   XKB FUNCTIONS                  XkbKeyAction(3)



NAME
       XkbKeyAction -  Returns the key action

SYNOPSIS
       XkbAction XkbKeyAction (XkbDescPtr xkb, KeyCode keycode, int idx);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  Xkb description of interest

       - keycode
              keycode of interest

       - idx  index for group and shift level

DESCRIPTION
       A  key  action  defines  the  effect key presses and releases have on the
       internal state of the server. For example, the expected key action  asso&#8208;
       ciated  with  pressing the Shift key is to set the Shift modifier.  There
       is zero or one key action associated with each keysym bound to each key.

       Just as the entire list of key symbols for the keyboard mapping  is  held
       in  the  syms field of the client map, the entire list of key actions for
       the keyboard mapping is held in the acts array of  the  server  map.  The
       total  size  of acts is specified by size_acts, and the number of entries
       is specified by num_acts.

       The key_acts array, indexed by keycode, describes the actions  associated
       with  a  key.  The  key_acts array has min_key_code unused entries at the
       start to allow direct indexing using a keycode. If a  key_acts  entry  is
       zero,  it  means the key does not have any actions associated with it. If
       an entry is not zero, the entry represents an index into the  acts  field
       of  the  server map, much as the offset field of a KeySymMapRec structure
       is an index into the syms field of the client map.

       The reason the acts field is a linear list of XkbActions is to reduce the
       memory consumption associated with a keymap.  Because Xkb allows individ&#8208;
       ual keys to have multiple shift levels and a different number  of  groups
       per  key,  a single two-dimensional array of KeySyms would potentially be
       very large and sparse. Instead,  Xkb  provides  a  small  two-dimensional
       array  of  XkbActions  for  each  key.  To  store all of these individual
       arrays, Xkb concatenates each array together in the  acts  field  of  the
       server map.

       The key action structures consist only of fields of type char or unsigned
       char.  This is done to optimize data transfer when the server sends bytes
       over  the  wire.  If the fields are anything but bytes, the server has to
       sift through all of the actions and swap  any  nonbyte  fields.   Because
       they consist of nothing but bytes, it can just copy them out.

       XkbKeyAction returns the key action indexed by idx in the two-dimensional
       array of key actions associated with the key corresponding to keycode.idx
       may be computed from the group and shift level of interest as follows:

           idx = group_index * key_width + shift_level

STRUCTURES
       The KeySymMapRec structure is defined as follows:

           #define XkbNumKbdGroups             4
           #define XkbMaxKbdGroup              (XkbNumKbdGroups-1)

           typedef struct {                    /&#8727; map to keysyms for a single keycode
       */
               unsigned char       kt_index[XkbNumKbdGroups];  /&#8727; key type index for
       each group */
               unsigned char       group_info; /&#8727; # of groups and out of range group
       handling */
               unsigned char       width;      /&#8727; max # of shift levels for key */
               unsigned short      offset;     /&#8727; index to keysym table in syms array
       */
       } XkbSymMapRec, *XkbSymMapPtr;
