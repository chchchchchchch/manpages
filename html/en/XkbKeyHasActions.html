XkbKeyHasActions(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbKeyHasActions(3)



NAME
       XkbKeyHasActions - Determines if the key corresponding to keycode has any
       actions associated with it

SYNOPSIS
       int XkbKeyHasActions (XkbDescPtr xkb, KeyCode keycode);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  Xkb description of interest

       - keycode
              keycode of interest

DESCRIPTION
       A key action defines the effect key presses  and  releases  have  on  the
       internal  state of the server. For example, the expected key action asso&#8208;
       ciated with pressing the Shift key is to set the Shift modifier. There is
       zero or one key action associated with each keysym bound to each key.

       Just  as  the entire list of key symbols for the keyboard mapping is held
       in the syms field of the client map, the entire list of key  actions  for
       the  keyboard  mapping  is  held in the acts array of the server map. The
       total size of acts is specified by size_acts, and the number  of  entries
       is specified by num_acts.

       The  key_acts array, indexed by keycode, describes the actions associated
       with a key. The key_acts array has min_key_code  unused  entries  at  the
       start  to  allow  direct indexing using a keycode. If a key_acts entry is
       zero, it means the key does not have any actions associated with  it.  If
       an  entry  is not zero, the entry represents an index into the acts field
       of the server map, much as the offset field of a  KeySymMapRec  structure
       is an index into the syms field of the client map.

       The reason the acts field is a linear list of XkbActions is to reduce the
       memory consumption associated with a keymap. Because Xkb allows  individ&#8208;
       ual  keys  to have multiple shift levels and a different number of groups
       per key, a single two-dimensional array of KeySyms would  potentially  be
       very  large  and  sparse.  Instead,  Xkb provides a small two-dimensional
       array of XkbActions for each  key.  To  store  all  of  these  individual
       arrays,  Xkb  concatenates  each  array together in the acts field of the
       server map.

       The key action structures consist only of fields of type char or unsigned
       char.  This is done to optimize data transfer when the server sends bytes
       over the wire. If the fields are anything but bytes, the  server  has  to
       sift through all of the actions and swap any nonbyte fields. Because they
       consist of nothing but bytes, it can just copy them out.

       XkbKeyHasActions returns True if the key corresponding to keycode has any
       actions associated with it; otherwise, it returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbKeyHasActions function will return True if the key
                      corresponding to keycode has any actions  associated  with
                      it.

       False          The XkbKeyHasActions function will return False if the key
                      corresponding to keycode does not have any actions associ&#8208;
                      ated with it.

STRUCTURES
       The KeySymMapRec structure is defined as follows:
&#12;           #define XkbNumKbdGroups             4
           #define XkbMaxKbdGroup              (XkbNumKbdGroups-1)

           typedef struct {                    /&#8727; map to keysyms for a single keycode */
               unsigned char       kt_index[XkbNumKbdGroups];  /&#8727; key type index for each group */
               unsigned char       group_info; /&#8727; # of groups and out of range group handling */
               unsigned char       width;      /&#8727; max # of shift levels for key */
               unsigned short      offset;     /&#8727; index to keysym table in syms array */
       } XkbSymMapRec, *XkbSymMapPtr;
