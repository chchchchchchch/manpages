XkbKeyNumSyms(3)                  XKB FUNCTIONS                 XkbKeyNumSyms(3)



NAME
       XkbKeyNumSyms  -  Returns  the total number of keysyms for the key corre&#8208;
       sponding to keycode

SYNOPSIS
       int XkbKeyNumSyms (XkbDescPtr xkb, KeyCode keycode);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  Xkb description of interest

       - keycode
              keycode of interest

DESCRIPTION
       The key width and number of groups associated with a key are used to form
       a  small  two-dimensional  array  of KeySyms for a key. This array may be
       different sizes for different keys. The array for a single key is  stored
       as  a linear list, in row-major order. The arrays for all of the keys are
       stored in the syms field of the client map. There is  one  row  for  each
       group associated with a key and one column for each level. The index cor&#8208;
       responding to a given group and shift level is computed as:

            idx = group_index * key_width + shift_level

       The offset field of the key_sym_map entry for a key is used to access the
       beginning of the array.

       XkbKeyNumSyms returns the total number of keysyms for the key correspond&#8208;
       ing to keycode.
