XkbLibraryVersion(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbLibraryVersion(3)



NAME
       XkbLibraryVersion  -   Determines  the compatibility of a library at run&#8208;
       time.

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbLibraryVersion (int *lib_major_in_out, int *lib_minor_in_out);

ARGUMENTS
       lib_major_in_out
              Specifies and returns the major Xkb library version.

       lib_minor_in_out
              Specifies and returns the minor Xkb library version.

DESCRIPTION
       If an application is dynamically  linked,  both  the  X  server  and  the
       client-side  X  library  must  contain the Xkb extension in order for the
       client to use the Xkb extension  capabilities.  Therefore  a  dynamically
       linked application must check both the library and the server for compat&#8208;
       ibility before using Xkb function calls. A properly written program  must
       check  for  compatibility  between the version of the Xkb library that is
       dynamically loaded and the one used when the application  was  built.  It
       must  then check the server version for compatibility with the version of
       Xkb in the library.

       If your application is statically linked, you must still check for server
       compatibility  and  may  check  library compatibility. (It is possible to
       compile against one set of header files and  link  against  a  different,
       incompatible,  version  of the library, although this should not normally
       occur.)

       Pass the symbolic value XkbMajorVersion in  lib_major_in_out  and  XkbMi&#8208;
       norVersion in lib_minor_in_out.  These arguments represent the version of
       the library used at compile time. The  XkbLibraryVersion  function  back&#8208;
       fills the major and minor version numbers of the library used at run time
       in lib_major_in_out and lib_minor_in_out.  If the versions of the compile
       time  and  run  time  libraries are compatible, XkbLibraryVersion returns
       True, otherwise, it returns False.

       In addition, in order to use the Xkb extension, you must ensure that  the
       extension  is present in the server and that the server supports the ver&#8208;
       sion of the extension expected by the client. Use XkbQueryExtension to do
       this, as described in the next section.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbLibraryVersion returns True if the versions of the
                      compile time and run time libraries are compatible.

       False          The XkbLibraryVersion returns False if the versions of the
                      compile time and run time libraries are not compatible.
