NAME
       XkbLockModifiers -  Locks and unlocks any of the eight real keyboard mod&#8208;
       ifiers

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbLockModifiers  (Display  *display,  unsigned  int   device_spec,
              unsigned int affect, unsigned int values);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       affect mask of real modifiers whose lock state is to change

       values 1 =&gt; lock, 0 =&gt; unlock; only for modifiers selected by affect

DESCRIPTION
       XkbLockModifiers sends a request to the server to lock the real modifiers
       selected by both affect and values  and  to  unlock  the  real  modifiers
       selected by affect, but not selected by values. XkbLockModifiers does not
       wait for a reply from the server. It returns  True  if  the  request  was
       sent, and False otherwise.

       The functions in this section that change the use of modifiers use a mask
       in the parameter affect. It is a bitwise inclusive OR of the legal  modi&#8208;
       fier masks:

                      sent  to the server to lock the real modifiers selected by
                      both affect and values and to unlock  the  real  modifiers
                      selected by affect, but not selected by values.

       False          The XkbLockModifiers function returns False if the request
                      was not sent.
