XkbLookupKeyBinding(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbLookupKeyBinding(3)



NAME
       XkbLookupKeyBinding - Find the string bound to a key by XRebindKeySym

SYNOPSIS
       int  XkbLookupKeyBinding  (Display  *dpy, KeySym sym, unsigned int state,
              char *buf, int nbytes, int *extra_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to server

       - sym  connection to server

       - state
              state for which string is to be looked up

       - buf  buffer into which returned string is written

       - nbytes
              size of buffer in bytes

       - extra_rtrn
              backfilled with number bytes overflow

DESCRIPTION
       XkbLookupKeyBinding is the equivalent of the core XLookupString function.

       XRebindKeysym binds an ASCII string to a specified keysym,  so  that  the
       string  and  keysym  are returned when the key is pressed and a specified
       list of modifiers are also being held down.  XkbLookupKeyBinding  returns
       in  buf  the  string  associated  with  the keysym sym and modifier state
       state. buf is NULL terminated unless there&apos;s an overflow. If  the  string
       returned  is  larger than nbytes, a count of bytes that does not fit into
       the buffer is returned in  extra_rtrn.   XkbTranslateKeySym  returns  the
       number of bytes that it placed into buf.
