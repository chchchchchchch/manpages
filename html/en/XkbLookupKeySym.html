XkbLookupKeySym(3)                XKB FUNCTIONS               XkbLookupKeySym(3)



NAME
       XkbLookupKeySym  - Find the symbol associated with a key for a particular
       state

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbLookupKeySym (Display *dpy,  KeyCode  key,  unsigned  int  state,
              unsigned int *mods_rtrn, KeySym *sym_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - key  key for which symbols are to be found

       - state
              state for which symbol should be found

       - mods_rtrn
              backfilled with unconsumed modifiers

       - sym_rtrn
              backfilled with symbol associated with key + state

DESCRIPTION
       XkbLookupKeySym is the equivalent of the core XLookupKeySym function. For
       the core keyboard, given a keycode key and an Xkb state state, XkbLookup&#8208;
       KeySym  returns  the  symbol  associated with the key in sym_rtrn and the
       list of modifiers that should still be applied in mods_rtrn.   The  state
       parameter  is  the state from a KeyPress or KeyRelease event.  XkbLookup&#8208;
       KeySym returns True if it succeeds.
