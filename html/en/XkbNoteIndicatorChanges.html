XkbNoteIndicatorChanges(3)        XKB FUNCTIONS       XkbNoteIndicatorChanges(3)



NAME
       XkbNoteIndicatorChanges - Notes the changes in a changes structure

SYNOPSIS
       void   XkbNoteIndicatorChanges  (XkbIndicatorChangesPtr  old,  XkbIndica&#8208;
              torNotifyEvent *new, unsigned int wanted);

ARGUMENTS
       - old  XkbIndicatorChanges structure to be updated

       - new  event from which changes are to be copied

       - wanted
              which changes are to be noted

DESCRIPTION
       Whenever  an  indicator  changes  state,  the  server  sends   XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotify  events  to all interested clients. Similarly, whenever an
       indicator&apos;s map changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to
       all interested clients.

       To  receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with both
       the bits_to_change and values_for_bits parameters  containing  XkbIndica&#8208;
       torStateNotifyMask.  To  receive XkbIndicatorMapNotify events, use XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEvents with XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.

       To receive events for only  specific  indicators,  use  XkbSelectEventDe&#8208;
       tails.   Set  the  event_type  parameter  to  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or
       XkbIndicatorMapNotify,  and  set  both  the   bits_to_change   and   val&#8208;
       ues_for_bits  detail  parameters  to  a mask where each bit specifies one
       indicator, turning on those bits that specify the  indicators  for  which
       you want to receive events.

       The  changed  parameter is a mask that is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
       indicators that have changed. If the event is of type  XkbIndicatorMapNo&#8208;
       tify,  changed  reports  the  maps  that changed. If the event is of type
       XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that have changed
       state.   state  is a mask that specifies the current state of all indica&#8208;
       tors, whether they have changed or not, for both  XkbIndicatorStateNotify
       and IndicatorMapNotify events.

       When  your  client  application receives either a XkbIndicatorStateNotify
       event or XkbIndicatorMapNotify event, you  can  note  the  changes  in  a
       changes structure by calling XkbNoteIndicatorChanges.


       The  wanted  parameter is the bitwise inclusive OR of XkbIndicatorMapMask
       and XkbIndicatorStateMask.  XkbNoteIndicatorChanges  copies  any  changes
       reported in new and specified in wanted into the changes record specified
       by old.

STRUCTURES
       Both types of indicator events use the same structure:

       typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify {
         int            type;       /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
         unsigned long  serial;     /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
         Bool           send_event; /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
         Display *      display;    /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
         Time           time;       /&#8727; server time when event generated */
         int            xkb_type;   /&#8727; specifies state or map notify */
         int            device;     /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */
         unsigned int   changed;    /&#8727; mask of indicators with new state or map */
         unsigned int   state;      /&#8727; current state of all indicators */
       } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;

       xkb_type  is  either  XkbIndicatorStateNotify  or  XkbIndicatorMapNotify,
       depending  on  whether  the  event  is  a kbIndicatorStateNotify event or
       kbIndicatorMapNotify event.
