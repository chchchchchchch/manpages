NAME
       XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber  - Returns the out-of-range group number, repre&#8208;
       sented as a group index, from the group_info  field  of  an  XkbSymMapRec
       structure

SYNOPSIS
       unsigned char XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber (unsigned char grp_inf);

ARGUMENTS
       - grp_inf
              Xkb description of interest

DESCRIPTION
       XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber  returns  the  out-of-range group number, repre&#8208;
       sented as a group index, from the group_info  field  of  an  XkbSymMapRec
       structure.

       The  group_info  field  of an XkbSymMapRec is an encoded value containing
       the number of groups of symbols bound to the key as well as the  specifi&#8208;
       cation  of the treatment of out-of-range groups. It is legal for a key to
       have zero groups, in which case it also has zero symbols and  all  events
       from  that key yield NoSymbol.  To obtain the number of groups of symbols
       bound to the key, use XkbKeyNumGroups.  To change the  number  of  groups
       bound  to  a  key, use XkbChangeTypesOfKey.  To obtain a mask that deter&#8208;
       mines the treatment  of  out-of-range  groups,  use  XkbKeyGroupInfo  and
       XkbOutOfRangeGroupInfo.

       The keyboard controls contain a groups_wrap field specifying the handling
       of illegal groups on a global basis. That is, when the user  performs  an
       action  causing  the  effective  group  to go out of the legal range, the
       groups_wrap field specifies how to normalize the effective keyboard group
       to  a  group  that  is legal for the keyboard as a whole, but there is no
       guarantee that the normalized group will be within  the  range  of  legal
       groups for any individual key. The per-key group_info field specifies how
       a key treats a legal effective group if the key  does  not  have  a  type
       specified  for  the  group of concern. For example, the Enter key usually
       has just one group defined. If the user performs an  action  causing  the
       global  keyboard  group to change to Group2, the group_info field for the
       Enter key describes how to handle this situation.

       Out-of-range groups for individual keys are mapped to a legal group using
       the same options as are used for the overall keyboard group. The particu&#8208;
       lar type of mapping used is controlled by the bits set in the  group_info
       flag, as shown in Table 1.
