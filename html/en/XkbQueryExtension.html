XkbQueryExtension(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbQueryExtension(3)



NAME
       XkbQueryExtension  -   Determines  the compatibility of a library at run&#8208;
       time.

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbQueryExtension (Display *dpy, int *opcode_rtrn, int  *event_rtrn,
              int *error_rtrn, int *major_in_out, int *minor_in_out);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       opcode_rtrn
              backfilled with the major extension opcode

       event_rtrn
              backfilled with the extension base event code

       error_rtrn
              backfilled with the extension base error code

       major_in_out
              compile time lib major version in, server major version out

       minor_in_out
              compile time lib min version in, server minor version out

DESCRIPTION
       Call XkbQueryExtension to check for the presence and compatibility of the
       extension in the server and  to  initialize  the  extension.  Because  of
       potential version mismatches, you cannot use the generic extension mecha&#8208;
       nism functions ( XQueryExtension and XInitExtension )  for  checking  for
       the presence of, and initializing the Xkb extension.

       You  must call XkbQueryExtension or XkbOpenDisplay before using any other
       Xkb library interfaces, unless such usage is explicitly  allowed  in  the
       interface  description in this document. The exceptions are: XkbIgnoreEx&#8208;
       tension, XkbLibraryVersion, and a handful of audible-bell functions.  You
       should not use any other Xkb functions if the extension is not present or
       is uninitialized. In general, calls to Xkb library functions  made  prior
       to initializing the Xkb extension cause BadAccess protocol errors.

       XkbQueryExtension  both  determines whether a compatible Xkb extension is
       present in the X server and initializes the extension when it is present.

       The XkbQueryExtension function determines whether a compatible version of
       the X Keyboard Extension is present in the server. If a compatible exten&#8208;
       sion is present, XkbQueryExtension returns True;  otherwise,  it  returns
       False.

       If  a compatible version of Xkb is present, XkbQueryExtension initializes
       the extension. It backfills the major opcode for the  keyboard  extension
       in opcode_rtrn, the base event code in event_rtrn, the base error code in
       error_rtrn, and the major and minor version numbers of the  extension  in
       major_in_out  and  minor_in_out.   The  major  opcode  is reported in the
       req_major fields of some Xkb events. For a discussion of the  base  event
       code.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbQueryExtension  function returns True if it deter&#8208;
                      mines a compatible version of the X Keyboard Extension  is
                      present in the server.
&#12;       False          The  XkbQueryExtension function returns False if it deter&#8208;
                      mines a compatible version of the X Keyboard Extension  is
                      not present in the server.
