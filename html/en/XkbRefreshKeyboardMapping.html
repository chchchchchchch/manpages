XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping(3)      XKB FUNCTIONS     XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping(3)



NAME
       XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping  -  Update  the  keyboard  description  that is
       internal to the X library

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping (XkbMapNotifyEvent *event);

ARGUMENTS
       - event
              event initiating remapping

DESCRIPTION
       XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping is the Xkb equivalent of the core  XRefreshKey&#8208;
       boardMapping function. It requests that the X server send the current key
       mapping information to this  client.  A  client  usually  invokes  XkbRe&#8208;
       freshKeyboardMapping  after  receiving  an  XkbMapNotify  event.   XkbRe&#8208;
       freshKeyboardMapping returns Success if it succeeds and BadMatch  if  the
       event is not an Xkb event.

       The XkbMapNotify event can be generated when some client calls XkbSetMap,
       XkbChangeMap, XkbGetKeyboardByName, or any  of  the  standard  X  library
       functions that change the keyboard mapping or modifier mapping.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The  XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping  function  returns  Success
                      when the request that the X server send  the  current  key
                      mapping information to this client is successful.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb  was  not available in the
                      server or an argument has correct type and range,  but  is
                      otherwise invalid
