XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions(3)   XKB FUNCTIONS  XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions(3)



NAME
       XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions  -  Allocate  additional  space  for  button
       actions in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       Status   XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions   (XkbDeviceInfoPtr    device_info,
              unsigned int new_total);

ARGUMENTS
       - device_info
              structure in which to allocate button actions

       - new_total
              new total number of button actions needed

DESCRIPTION
       XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions  reallocates  space,  if  necessary, to make
       sure there is room for  a  total  of  new_total  button  actions  in  the
       device_info  structure. Any new entries allocated are zeroed. If success&#8208;
       ful, XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions returns Success. If new_total is  zero,
       all button actions are deleted, device_info-&gt;num_btns is set to zero, and
       device_info-&gt;btn_acts is set  to  NULL.  If  device_info  is  invalid  or
       new_total  is greater than 255, BadValue is returned. If a memory alloca&#8208;
       tion failure occurs, a BadAlloc is returned.

       To free an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, use XkbFreeDeviceInfo.

STRUCTURES
       Information about X Input Extension  devices  is  transferred  between  a
       client program and the Xkb extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:

           typedef struct {
               char *               name;          /&#8727; name for device */
               Atom                 type;          /&#8727; name for class of devices */
               unsigned short       device_spec;   /&#8727; device of interest */
               Bool                 has_own_state; /&#8727; True=&gt;this device has its own state */
               unsigned short       supported;     /&#8727; bits indicating supported capabilities */
               unsigned short       unsupported;   /&#8727; bits indicating unsupported capabilities */
               unsigned short       num_btns;      /&#8727; number of entries in btn_acts */
               XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /&#8727; button actions */
               unsigned short       sz_leds;       /&#8727; total number of entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       num_leds;      /&#8727; number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
               unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /&#8727; input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
               XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /&#8727; LED descriptions */
           } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;
