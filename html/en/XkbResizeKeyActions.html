XkbResizeKeyActions(3)            XKB FUNCTIONS           XkbResizeKeyActions(3)



NAME
       XkbResizeKeyActions - Change the number of actions bound to a key

SYNOPSIS
       XkbAction * XkbResizeKeyActions (XkbDescRec *xkb, int key, int needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  keyboard description to change

       - key  keycode of key to change

       - needed
              new number of actions required

DESCRIPTION
       The  xkb  parameter points to the keyboard description containing the key
       whose number of actions is to be changed. The key parameter is  the  key&#8208;
       code of the key to change, and needed specifies the new number of actions
       required for the key.

       XkbResizeKeyActions reserves the space needed for the actions and returns
       a  pointer  to  the beginning of the new array that holds the actions. It
       can change the acts, num_acts, and size_acts fields of xkb-&gt;server if  it
       is necessary to reallocate the acts array.

       If  needed  is  greater  than  the current number of keysyms for the key,
       XkbResizeKeyActions initializes all new actions in the array to NoAction.

       Because the number of actions needed by a key  is  normally  computed  as
       width  * number of groups, and XkbResizeKeyActions does not modify either
       the width or number of groups for the key, a discrepancy exists on return
       from  XkbResizeKeyActions between the space allocated for the actions and
       the number required. The unused entries in the list of  actions  returned
       by  XkbResizeKeyActions  are  not preserved across future calls to any of
       the map editing functions, so you must  update  the  key  actions  (which
       updates  the  width  and  number  of  groups  for the key) before calling
       another allocator function. A call to XkbChangeTypesOfKey updates these.

       If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number of actions bound
       to the key, XkbResizeKeyActions returns NULL.

NOTES
       A change to the number of actions bound to a key should be accompanied by
       a change in the number of  symbols  bound  to  a  key.  Refer  to  XkbRe&#8208;
       sizeKeySyms  for more information on changing the number of symbols bound
       to a key.
