XkbResizeKeySyms(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbResizeKeySyms(3)



NAME
       XkbResizeKeySyms - Change the number of symbols bound to a key

SYNOPSIS
       KeySym * XkbResizeKeySyms (XkbDescRec *xkb, int key, int needed);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  keyboard description to be changed

       - key  keycode for key to modify

       - needed
              new number of keysyms required for key

DESCRIPTION
       XkbResizeKeySyms reserves the space needed for needed keysyms and returns
       a pointer to the beginning of the new array that holds  the  keysyms.  It
       adjusts  the  offset field of the key_sym_map entry for the key if neces&#8208;
       sary and can also change the syms,  num_syms,  and  size_syms  fields  of
       xkb-&gt;map  if  it  is  necessary  to  reallocate  the  syms array.  XkbRe&#8208;
       sizeKeySyms does not modify either the width or number of groups  associ&#8208;
       ated with the key.

       If  needed  is  greater  than  the current number of keysyms for the key,
       XkbResizeKeySyms initializes all new keysyms in the array to NoSymbol.

       Because the number of symbols needed by a key  is  normally  computed  as
       width * number of groups, and XkbResizeKeySyms does not modify either the
       width or number of groups for the key, a discrepancy exists  upon  return
       from XkbResizeKeySyms between the space allocated for the keysyms and the
       number required. The unused entries in the list of  symbols  returned  by
       XkbResizeKeySyms  are not preserved across future calls to any of the map
       editing functions, so you must  update  the  key  symbol  mapping  (which
       updates  the  width  and  number  of  groups  for the key) before calling
       another allocator function. A call to XkbChangeTypesOfKey will update the
       mapping.

       If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number of symbols bound
       to the key, XkbResizeKeySyms returns NULL.

NOTES
       A change to the number of symbols bound to a key should be accompanied by
       a  change in the number of actions bound to a key. Refer to XkbResizeKey&#8208;
       Actions for more information on changing the number of actions bound to a
       key.
