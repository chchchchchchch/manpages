XkbSAPtrDfltValue(3)              XKB FUNCTIONS             XkbSAPtrDfltValue(3)



NAME
       XkbSAPtrDfltValue  -  Returns  the  valueXXX  field of act converted to a
       signed int

SYNOPSIS
       int XkbSAPtrDfltValue (XkbAction act);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action from which to extract group

DESCRIPTION
       Actions  associated  with  the  XkbPtrDfltAction  structure  change   the
       mk_dflt_btn attribute of the MouseKeys control.

       If  the  MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and KeyRelease events
       are treated as though  the  action  is  XkbSA_NoAction.  Otherwise,  this
       action changes the mk_dflt_btn attribute of the MouseKeys control.

       The  type  field  of  the  XkbPtrDfltAction  structure  should  always be
       XkbSA_SetPtrDflt.

       The flags field is composed of the bitwise inclusive  OR  of  the  values
       shown in Table 1 (currently there is only one value defined).


       c  s  l  l  l  lw(4i).   Table  1  Pointer Default Flags _ Flag Meaning _
       XkbSA_DfltBtnAbsolute    T{ If set, the value field represents  an  abso&#8208;
       lute  pointer button. Otherwise, the value field represents the amount to
       be added to the current default button.  T}

       The affect field specifies what changes as a result of this  action.  The
       only valid value for the affect field is XkbSA_AffectDfltBtn.

       The  valueXXX  field is a signed character that represents the new button
       value  for  the  mk_dflt_btn  attribute  of  the  MouseKeys  control.  If
       XkbSA_DfltBtnAbsolute  is  set in flags, valueXXX specifies the button to
       be used; otherwise, valueXXX specifies the amount to be added to the cur&#8208;
       rent  default  button. In either case, illegal button choices are wrapped
       back around into range. Xkb provides macros, to convert between the inte&#8208;
       ger and signed character values in XkbPtrDfltAction structures.

       XkbSAPtrDfltValue returns the valueXXX field of act converted to a signed
       int.
