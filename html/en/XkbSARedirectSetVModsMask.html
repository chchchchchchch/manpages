XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask(3)      XKB FUNCTIONS     XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask(3)



NAME
       XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask  -  Sets the vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields
       of act from vm

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask (XkbRedirectKeyAction  act,  unsigned  int
              vm);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action in which to set vmods

       - vm   new value for virtual modifier mask

DESCRIPTION
       Actions  associated with the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure generate Key&#8208;
       Press and KeyRelease events containing a keycode different from  the  key
       that was pressed or released.

       The  type  field  for the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure should always be
       XkbSA_RedirectKey.  Key presses cause a KeyPress event for the key speci&#8208;
       fied  by  the new_key field instead of the actual key. The state reported
       in this event reports the current effective modifiers changed as follows:
       any real modifiers selected by the mods_mask field are set to correspond&#8208;
       ing values from the mods field. Any real modifiers bound to  the  virtual
       modifiers  specified by the vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields are either
       set or cleared, depending on the corresponding values in the  vmods0  and
       vmods1  fields. If the real and virtual modifier definitions specify con&#8208;
       flicting values for a single modifier, the real modifier  definition  has
       priority.

       Key  releases  cause  a  KeyRelease  event  for  the key specified by the
       new_key field instead of the actual key. The state for  this  event  con&#8208;
       sists  of  the  effective  keyboard modifiers at the time of the release,
       changed as described previously.

       The XkbSA_RedirectKey action normally redirects to  another  key  on  the
       same device as the key that caused the event, unless that device does not
       belong to the input extension KeyClass, in which case this action  causes
       an  event  on  the core keyboard device. (The input extension categorizes
       devices by breaking them into classes. Keyboards, and other input devices
       with keys, are classified as KeyClass devices by the input extension.)

       The  vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields actually represent one vmods_mask
       value. Xkb provides macros to convert between the two formats.

       XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask sets the vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields  of
       act from vm.
