XkbSAScreen(3)                    XKB FUNCTIONS                   XkbSAScreen(3)



NAME
       XkbSAScreen  -  Returns  the screenXXX field of act converted to a signed
       int

SYNOPSIS
       int XkbSAScreen (XkbSwitchScreenAction act);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action from which to extract screen

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbSwitchScreen action structure  change  the
       active screen on a multiscreen display.

       The  type  field  of the XkbSwitchScreenAction structure should always be
       XkbSA_SwitchScreen.

       The flags field is composed of the bitwise  inclusive  OR  of  the  masks
       shown in Table 1.


       c  s  l  l l lw(4i).  Table 1 Switch Screen Action Flags _ Flag Meaning _
       XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute     T{ If set, the screenXXX  field  represents  the
       index of the new screen. Otherwise, it represents an offset from the cur&#8208;
       rent screen to the new screen.   T}  XkbSA_SwitchApplication  T{  If  not
       set, the action should switch to another screen on the same server.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise, it should switch to another X server or application  that  shares
       the same physical display.  T}

       The  screenXXX  field  is a signed character value that represents either
       the relative or absolute screen index, depending  on  the  state  of  the
       XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute  bit  in the flags field. Xkb provides the following
       macros to convert between the integer  and  signed  character  value  for
       screen numbers in XkbSwitchScreenAction structures.

       XkbSAScreen  macro  returns  the  screenXXX  field  of act converted to a
       signed int.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbSwitchScreenAction {
               unsigned char    type;        /&#8727; XkbSA_SwitchScreen */
               unsigned char    flags;       /&#8727; controls screen switching */
               char             screenXXX;   /&#8727; screen number or delta */
           } XkbSwitchScreenAction;



NOTES
       The XkbSwitchScreen action is optional. Servers are free  to  ignore  the
       action or any of its flags if they do not support the requested behavior.
       If the action is ignored, it behaves like XkbSA_NoAction. Otherwise,  key
       press and key release events do not generate an event.
