XkbSASetScreen(3)                 XKB FUNCTIONS                XkbSASetScreen(3)



NAME
       XkbSASetScreen - Sets the screenXXX field of act from s

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSASetScreen (XkbSwitchScreenAction act, int s);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action in which to set screenXXX

       - s    value to set in screenXXX

DESCRIPTION
       Actions  associated  with the XkbSwitchScreen action structure change the
       active screen on a multiscreen display.

       The type field of the XkbSwitchScreenAction structure  should  always  be
       XkbSA_SwitchScreen.

       The  flags  field  is  composed  of the bitwise inclusive OR of the masks
       shown in Table 1.


       c s l l l lw(4i).  Table 1 Switch Screen Action Flags  _  Flag Meaning  _
       XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute     T{  If  set,  the screenXXX field represents the
       index of the new screen. Otherwise, it represents an offset from the cur&#8208;
       rent  screen  to  the  new screen.  T} XkbSA_SwitchApplication  T{ If not
       set, the action should switch to another screen on the same server.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise,  it  should switch to another X server or application that shares
       the same physical display.  T}

       The screenXXX field is a signed character value  that  represents  either
       the  relative  or  absolute  screen  index, depending on the state of the
       XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute bit in the flags field. Xkb provides  the  following
       macros  to  convert  between  the  integer and signed character value for
       screen numbers in XkbSwitchScreenAction structures.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbSwitchScreenAction {
               unsigned char    type;        /&#8727; XkbSA_SwitchScreen */
               unsigned char    flags;       /&#8727; controls screen switching */
               char             screenXXX;   /&#8727; screen number or delta */
           } XkbSwitchScreenAction;


NOTES
       This action is optional. Servers are free to ignore the action or any  of
       its flags if they do not support the requested behavior. If the action is
       ignored, it behaves like XkbSA_NoAction. Otherwise,  key  press  and  key
       release events do not generate an event.
