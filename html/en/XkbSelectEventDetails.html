XkbSelectEventDetails(3)          XKB FUNCTIONS         XkbSelectEventDetails(3)



NAME
       XkbSelectEventDetails  -   Selects  or deselects for a specific Xkb event
       and optionally places conditions on when events of that type are reported
       to your client

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbSelectEventDetails  (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec,
              unsigned  int  event_type,  unsigned  long   int   bits_to_change,
              unsigned long int values_for_bits);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       event_type
              Xkb event type of interest

       bits_to_change
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       values_for_bits
              1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events in bits_to_change

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb events are selected using an event mask, much the same as normal core
       X events are selected. However, unlike selecting core X events, where you
       must  specify  the  selection  status  (on or off) for all possible event
       types whenever you wish to change the  selection  criteria  for  any  one
       event,  Xkb  allows  you  to restrict the specification to only the event
       types you wish to change. This means that you do not need to remember the
       event  selection  values  for  all  possible  types each time you want to
       change one of them.

       Many Xkb event types are generated under several different circumstances.
       When  selecting  to receive an Xkb event, you may specify either that you
       want it delivered under all circumstances, or that you want it  delivered
       only for a subset of the possible circumstances.

       You  can  also  deselect  an event type that was previously selected for,
       using the same granularity.

       Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect delivery of Xkb events.
       XkbSelectEvents  allows  you  to select or deselect delivery of more than
       one Xkb event type at once. Events  selected  using  XkbSelectEvents  are
       delivered  to  your  program  under  all  circumstances that generate the
       events.  To restrict delivery of an event to a subset of  the  conditions
       under  which  it occurs, use XkbSelectEventDetails. XkbSelectEventDetails
       only allows you to change the selection conditions for a single event  at
       a time, but it provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which
       the event is delivered.

       To select or deselect for a specific Xkb event and optionally place  con&#8208;
       ditions on when events of that type are reported to your client, use Xkb&#8208;
       SelectEventDetails.  This allows you to exercise a finer  granularity  of
       control over delivery of Xkb events with XkbSelectEvents.

       While  XkbSelectEvents  allows  multiple  events  to  be selected, XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEventDetails changes the selection criteria for a single type of  Xkb
       event. The interpretation of the bits_to_change and values_for_bits masks
       depends on the event type in question.

       XkbSelectEventDetails changes the Xkb event selection mask for  the  key&#8208;
       board specified by device_spec and the Xkb event specified by event_type.
       To turn on event selection for an event  detail,  set  the  bit  for  the
       detail  in  the bits_to_change parameter and set the corresponding bit in
       the values_for_bits parameter. To turn off event detail selection  for  a
       detail, set the bit for the detail in the bits_to_change parameter and do
       not set the corresponding bit in the values_for_bits parameter.

       If an invalid event type is specified, a BadValue protocol error results.
       If  a bit is not set in the bits_to_change parameter, but the correspond&#8208;
       ing bit is set in the  values_for_bits  parameter,  a  BadMatch  protocol
       error results. If an undefined bit is set in either the bits_to_change or
       the values_for_bits parameter, a BadValue protocol error results.

       For each type of Xkb event, the legal event details that you can  specify
       in  the  XkbSelectEventDetails  request  are  listed in the chapters that
       describe each event in detail.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
