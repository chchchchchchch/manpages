NAME
       XkbSelectEvents -  Selects and / or deselects for delivery of one or more
       Xkb events and has them delivered under all conditions

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbSelectEvents  (Display  *display,  unsigned   int   device_spec,
              unsigned   long   int   bits_to_change,  unsigned  long  int  val&#8208;
              ues_for_bits);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       bits_to_change
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       values_for_bits
              1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events in bits_to_change

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb events are selected using an event mask, much the same as normal core
       X events are selected. However, unlike selecting core X events, where you
       must specify the selection status (on or  off)  for  all  possible  event
       types  whenever  you  wish  to  change the selection criteria for any one
       event, Xkb allows you to restrict the specification  to  only  the  event
       types you wish to change. This means that you do not need to remember the
       event selection values for all possible  types  each  time  you  want  to
       change one of them.

       Many Xkb event types are generated under several different circumstances.
       When selecting to receive an Xkb event, you may specify either  that  you
       want  it delivered under all circumstances, or that you want it delivered
       only for a subset of the possible circumstances.

       You can also deselect an event type that  was  previously  selected  for,
       using the same granularity.

       Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect delivery of Xkb events.
       XkbSelectEvents allows you to select or deselect delivery  of  more  than
       one  Xkb  event  type  at once. Events selected using XkbSelectEvents are
       delivered to your program  under  all  circumstances  that  generate  the
       events.   To  restrict delivery of an event to a subset of the conditions
       under which it occurs, use  XkbSelectEventDetails.  XkbSelectEventDetails
       only  allows you to change the selection conditions for a single event at
       a time, but it provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which
       the event is delivered.

       This request changes the Xkb event selection mask for the keyboard speci&#8208;
       fied by device_spec.

       Each Xkb event that can be selected  is  represented  by  a  bit  in  the
       bits_to_change  and  values_for_bits masks. Only the event selection bits
       specified by the bits_to_change parameter are affected;  any  unspecified
       bits are left unchanged. To turn on event selection for an event, set the
       bit for the event in the bits_to_change parameter and set the correspond&#8208;
       ing bit in the values_for_bits parameter. To turn off event selection for
       an event, set the bit for the event in the bits_to_change  parameter  and
       do  not  set  the corresponding bit in the values_for_bits parameter. The
       valid values for both of these parameters are an inclusive bitwise OR  of
       the masks shown in Table 1. There is no interface to return your client&apos;s
       current event selection mask. Clients cannot  set  other  clients&apos;  event
       selection masks.

       The X server reports the events defined by Xkb to your client application
       only if you have requested them via a call to XkbSelectEvents  or  XkbSe&#8208;
       lectEventDetails.  Specify the event types in which you are interested in
       a mask.

       Table 1 lists the event mask constants that can  be  specified  with  the
       XkbSelectEvents request and the circumstances in which the mask should be
       specified.

       If  a bit is not set in the bits_to_change parameter, but the correspond&#8208;
       ing bit is set in the  values_for_bits  parameter,  a  BadMatch  protocol
       error results. If an undefined bit is set in either the bits_to_change or
       the values_for_bits parameter, a BadValue protocol error results.

       All event selection bits are initially zero for  clients  using  the  Xkb
       extension.  Once you set some bits, they remain set for your client until
       you clear them via another call to XkbSelectEvents.

       XkbSelectEvents returns False if the Xkb extension has not  been  initil&#8208;
       ialized and True otherwise.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbSelectEvents  function  returns  True  if  the Xkb
                      extension has been initilialized.

       False          The XkbSelectEvents function  returns  False  if  the  Xkb
                      extension has not been initilialized.
