NAME
       XkbSetAccessXTimeout  -  Configures the AccessXTimeout options for a key&#8208;
       board device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetAccessXTimeout (Display *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned  short  timeout,  unsigned  int  ctrls_mask, unsigned int
              ctrls_values, unsigned short opts_mask, unsigned  short  opts_val&#8208;
              ues);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - device_spec
              device to configure, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - timeout
              seconds idle until AccessXTimeout occurs

       - ctrls_mask
              boolean controls to modify

       - ctrls_values
              new bits for controls selected by ctrls_mask

       - opts_mask

       - opts_values
              new bits for ax_options selected by opts_mask

DESCRIPTION
       In  environments  where  computers  are shared, features such as SlowKeys
       present a problem: if SlowKeys is on, the keyboard can appear to be unre&#8208;
       sponsive  because keys are not accepted until they are held for a certain
       period of time. To help solve this problem, Xkb provides an  AccessXTime&#8208;
       out  control  to  automatically  change the enabled/disabled state of any
       boolean  controls  and  to  change  the  value  of  the  AccessXKeys  and
       AccessXFeedback  control  attributes if the keyboard is idle for a speci&#8208;
       fied period of time.

       When a timeout as specified by AccessXTimeout occurs  and  a  control  is
       consequently modified, Xkb generates an XkbControlsNotify event. For more
       information on XkbControlsNotify events.

       timeout specifies the number of seconds the keyboard must be idle  before
       the  controls are modified.  ctrls_mask specifies what controls are to be
       enabled or disabled, and ctrls_values specifies  whether  those  controls
       are  to  be  enabled  or disabled. The bit values correspond to those for
       enabling and disabling boolean controls using XkbChangeEnabledControls.
        The opts_mask field specifies which attributes of  the  AccessXKeys  and
       AccessXFeedback controls are to be changed, and opts_values specifies the
       new values for those options. The bit values correspond to those for  the
       ax_options field of an XkbDescRec.

       XkbSetAccessXTimeout sends a request to configure the AccessXTimeout con&#8208;
       trol to the server. It does not wait for a reply,  and  normally  returns
       True.  If  a  compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in
       the server, XkbSetAccessXTimeout returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetAccessXTimeout function returns True when a com&#8208;
                      patible  version  of the Xkb extension is available in the
                      server.

       False          The XkbSetAccessXTimeout function  returns  False  when  a
                      compatible  version  of the Xkb extension is not available
                      in the server.

STRUCTURES
       The complete description of an Xkb keyboard is given  by  an  XkbDescRec.
       The component structures in the XkbDescRec represent the major Xkb compo&#8208;
       nents.

       typedef struct {
          struct _XDisplay * display;      /&#8727; connection to X server */
          unsigned short     flags;        /&#8727; private to Xkb, do not modify */
          unsigned short     device_spec;  /&#8727; device of interest */
          KeyCode            min_key_code; /&#8727; minimum keycode for device */
          KeyCode            max_key_code; /&#8727; maximum keycode for device */
          XkbControlsPtr     ctrls;        /&#8727; controls */
          XkbServerMapPtr    server;       /&#8727; server keymap */
          XkbClientMapPtr    map;          /&#8727; client keymap */
          XkbIndicatorPtr    indicators;   /&#8727; indicator map */
          XkbNamesPtr        names;        /&#8727; names for all components */
          XkbCompatMapPtr    compat;       /&#8727; compatibility map */
          XkbGeometryPtr     geom;         /&#8727; physical geometry of keyboard */
       } XkbDescRec, *XkbDescPtr;

       The display field points to an X display structure. The  flags  field  is
       private  to the library: modifying flags may yield unpredictable results.
       The device_spec field specifies the device  identifier  of  the  keyboard
       input  device,  or  XkbUseCoreKeyboard, which specifies the core keyboard
       device. The min_key_code and max_key_code fields specify  the  least  and
       greatest keycode that can be returned by the keyboard.

       Each  structure  component  has  a corresponding mask bit that is used in
       function calls to indicate that the structure should  be  manipulated  in
       some  manner,  such as allocating it or freeing it. These masks and their
       relationships to the fields in the XkbDescRec are shown in Table 1.

       The structure for the XkbControlsNotify event is defined as follows:

           typedef struct {
               int           type;          /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
               unsigned long serial;        /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
               Bool          send_event;    /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */

               Time          time;          /&#8727; server time when event generated */
               int           xkb_type;      /&#8727; XkbCompatMapNotify */

               char          event_type;    /&#8727; Type of event causing change */
               char          req_major;     /&#8727; major event code of event causing change */
               char          req_minor;     /&#8727; minor event code of event causing change */
           } XkbControlsNotifyEvent;
