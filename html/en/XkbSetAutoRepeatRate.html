XkbSetAutoRepeatRate(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbSetAutoRepeatRate(3)



NAME
       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate  - Sets the attributes of the RepeatKeys control for
       a keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetAutoRepeatRate (Display *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned int timeout, unsigned int interval);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - device_spec
              device to configure, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - timeout
              initial delay, ms

       - interval
              delay between repeats, ms

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire key&#8208;
       board or individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is
       a boolean control that extends this capability by adding control over the
       delay until a key begins to repeat and the  rate  at  which  it  repeats.
       RepeatKeys  is coupled with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys
       is enabled or disabled, the core auto-repeat is enabled or  disabled  and
       vice versa.

       Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, timeout,
       is the delay after the initial press of an  auto-repeating  key  and  the
       first  generated repeat event. The second, interval, is the delay between
       all subsequent generated repeat events. As  with  all  boolean  controls,
       configuring  the  attributes that determine how the control operates does
       not automatically enable the control as a whole.

       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate sends a request to the X  server  to  configure  the
       AutoRepeat  control  attributes  to  the  values specified in timeout and
       interval.

       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate does not wait for a reply; it normally returns True.
       Specifying  a zero value for either timeout or interval causes the server
       to generate a BadValue protocol error. If a compatible version of the Xkb
       extension  is  not  available in the server, XkbSetAutoRepeatRate returns
       False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetAutoRepeatRate function returns True normally.

       False          The XkbSetAutoRepeatRate function returns False if a  com&#8208;
                      patible  version  of the Xkb extension is not available in
                      the server.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue       An argument is out of range
