XkbSetBounceKeysDelay(3)          XKB FUNCTIONS         XkbSetBounceKeysDelay(3)



NAME
       XkbSetBounceKeysDelay - Sets the BounceKeys delay for a keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbSetBounceKeysDelay  (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec,
              unsigned int *delay);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - delay
              backfilled with bounce keys delay, ms

DESCRIPTION
       The server can generate XkbAccessXNotify events for some  of  the  global
       keyboard  controls.   The  detail field describes what AccessX event just
       occurred and can be any of the values in Table 1.


       c s l l l lw(4i).  Table 1  AccessXNotify  Events  _  detail    Reason  _
       XkbAXN_SKPress T{  A  key  was  pressed  when  SlowKeys  was enabled.  T}
       XkbAXN_SKAccept     T{ A key was accepted (held longer than the  SlowKeys
       delay).  T} XkbAXN_SKRelease    T{ An accepted SlowKeys key was released.
       T}  XkbAXN_SKReject     T{  A  key  was  rejected  (released  before  the
       SlowKeys delay expired).  T} XkbAXN_BKAccept     T{ A key was accepted by
       BounceKeys.  T} XkbAXN_BKReject     T{ A key was rejected (pressed before
       the  BounceKeys delay expired).  T} XkbAXN_AXKWarning   T{ AccessXKeys is
       about to turn on/off StickyKeys or BounceKeys.  T}

       The keycode field reports the keycode of the  key  for  which  the  event
       occurred.  If  the action is related to SlowKeys, the slowKeysDelay field
       contains the current SlowKeys acceptance delay. If the action is  related
       to  BounceKeys,  the  debounceDelay field contains the current BounceKeys
       debounce delay.

       Selecting for AccessX Events

       To receive XkbAccessXNotify events under  all  possible  conditions,  use
       XkbSelectEvents  and  pass XkbAccesXNotifyMask in both bits_to_change and
       values_for_bits.

       To receive XkbStateNotify events only under certain conditions, use XkbS&#8208;
       electEventDetails using XkbAccessXNotify as the event_type and specifying
       the desired state changes in  bits_to_change  and  values_for_bits  using
       mask bits from Table 2.


       c  s  s  l  l l l l lw(3i).  Table 2 AccessXNotify Event Details _ XkbAc&#8208;
       cessXNotify Event Details     Value     Circumstances  _  XkbAXN_SKPress&#8208;
       Mask  (1&lt;&lt;0)    T{ Slow key press notification wanted T} XkbAXN_SKAccept&#8208;
       Mask (1&lt;&lt;1)    T{ Slow key accept notification wanted T} XkbAXN_SKReject&#8208;
       Mask (1&lt;&lt;2)    T{  Slow  key  reject  notification wanted T} XkbAXN_SKRe&#8208;
       leaseMask     (1&lt;&lt;3)    T{  Slow  key  release  notification  wanted   T}
       XkbAXN_BKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;4)    T{ Bounce key accept notification wanted T}
       XkbAXN_BKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;5)    T{ Bounce key reject notification wanted T}
       XkbAXN_AXKWarningMask    (1&lt;&lt;6)    T{ AccessX warning notification wanted
       T} XkbAllAccessXEventsMask  (0x7f)    T{ All AccessX  features  notifica&#8208;
       tions wanted T}

       Some  users may accidentally &quot;bounce&quot; on a key when they release it. They
       press it once, then accidentally press it again after  they  release  it.
       The  BounceKeys  control  temporarily  disables  a  key after it has been
       pressed, effectively &quot;debouncing&quot; the keyboard. The period  of  time  the
       key  is  disabled  after it is released is known as the BounceKeys delay.
       BounceKeys is a boolean control.

       When the BounceKeys control is active, the server reports  acceptance  or
       rejection  of  any  key  to  interested clients by sending an appropriate
       AccessXNotify event.

       XkbSetBounceKeysDelay sends a request to configure the BounceKeys control
       to  the  server.  It does not wait for a reply and normally returns True.
       Specifying a value  of  zero  for  the  delay  parameter  causes  XkbSet&#8208;
       BounceKeysDelay  to  generate  a BadValue protocol error. If a compatible
       version of the Xkb extension is not  available  in  the  server,  XkbSet&#8208;
       BounceKeysDelay returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The  XkbSetBounceKeysDelay  function  returns True when it
                      sends a request to configure the BounceKeys control to the
                      server.

       False          The XkbSetBounceKeysDelay function returns False if a com&#8208;
                      patible version of the Xkb extension is not  available  in
                      the server.

STRUCTURES
       The structure for the XkbAccessXNotify event type is as follows:

       typedef struct {
           int            type;           /&#8727; Xkb extension base event code */
           unsigned long  serial;         /&#8727; X server serial number for event */
           Bool           send_event;     /&#8727; True =&gt; synthetically generated */
           Display *      display;        /&#8727; server connection where event generated */
           Time           time;           /&#8727; server time when event generated */
           int            xkb_type;       /&#8727; XkbAccessXNotify */
           int            device;         /&#8727; Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd
       */
           int            detail;         /&#8727; XkbAXN_* */
           KeyCode        keycode;        /&#8727; key of event */
           int            slowKeysDelay;  /&#8727; current SlowKeys delay */
           int            debounceDelay;  /&#8727; current debounce delay */
       } XkbAccessXNotifyEvent;
