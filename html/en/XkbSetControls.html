XkbSetControls(3)                 XKB FUNCTIONS                XkbSetControls(3)



NAME
       XkbSetControls - Copies changes to the X server based on a modified ctrls
       structure in a local copy of the keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetControls (Display *display, unsigned  long  which,  XkbDescPtr
              xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - which
              mask of controls requested

       - xkb  keyboard description for controls information

DESCRIPTION
       For each bit that is set in the which parameter, XkbSetControls sends the
       corresponding values from the xkb-&gt;ctrls field to the server. Valid  val&#8208;
       ues  for  which  are  any combination of the masks listed in Table 1 that
       have &quot;ok&quot; in the which column.

       Table 1 shows the actual values for the  individual  mask  bits  used  to
       select  controls  for modification and to enable and disable the control.
       Note that the same mask bit is used to specify general  modifications  to
       the  parameters  used to configure the control (which), and to enable and
       disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no  &quot;ok&quot;
       in column) are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for
       controls that are not boolean controls and therefore cannot be enabled or
       disabled.

       Mask        ok   (0x00001FFF) XkbAllControlsMask  ok        (0xF8001FFF)

       If  xkb-&gt;ctrls  is NULL, the server does not support a compatible version
       of Xkb, or the Xkb extension has not been properly  initialized,  XkbSet&#8208;
       Controls  returns  False. Otherwise, it sends the request to the X server
       and returns True.

       Note that changes to attributes of controls in the XkbControlsRec  struc&#8208;
       ture  are  apparent only when the associated control is enabled, although
       the corresponding values are still updated in the X server. For  example,
       the  repeat_delay  and  repeat_interval  fields  are  ignored  unless the
       RepeatKeys control is enabled (that is,  the  X  server&apos;s  equivalent  of
       xkb-&gt;ctrls has XkbRepeatKeyMask set in enabled_ctrls).  It is permissible
       to modify the attributes of a control in one call to  XkbSetControls  and
       enable the control in a subsequent call. See XkbChangeEnabledControls for
       more information on enabling and disabling controls.

       Note that the enabled_ctrls field is itself a control -  the  EnabledCon&#8208;
       trols  control.  As  such, to set a specific configuration of enabled and
       disabled boolean controls, you must set enabled_ctrls to the  appropriate
       bits  to  enable  only the controls you want and disable all others, then
       specify the XkbControlsEnabledMask in a call to XkbSetControls.

       Because this is somewhat awkward if all you want to do is enable and dis&#8208;
       able  controls,  and  not  modify  any of their attributes, a convenience
       function is also provided for this purpose, XkbChangeEnabledControls.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetControls function returns True when it sends the
                      request to the X server.

       False          The  XkbSetControls function returns False when xkb-&gt;ctrls
                      is NULL, the server does not support a compatible  version
                      of  Xkb,  or  the Xkb extension has not been properly ini&#8208;
                      tialized.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid
