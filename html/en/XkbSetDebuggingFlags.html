XkbSetDebuggingFlags(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbSetDebuggingFlags(3)



NAME
       XkbSetDebuggingFlags - Change the values of any of the debug controls

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbSetDebuggingFlags (Display *display, unsigned int mask, unsigned
              int flags, char *msg, unsigned int ctrls_mask, unsigned int ctrls,
              unsigned int *ret_flags, unsigned int *ret_ctrls);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to X server

       - mask mask selecting debug output flags to change

       - flags
              values for debug output flags selected by mask

       - msg  message to print right now

       - ctrls_mask
              mask selecting debug controls to change

       - ctrls
              values for debug controls selected by ctrls_mask

       - ret_flags
              resulting state of all debug output flags

       - ret_ctrls
              resulting state of all debug controls

DESCRIPTION
       The debugging aids are intended for use primarily by Xkb implementors and
       are optional in any implementation.

       There are two bitmasks that may be used to control debugging. One bitmask
       controls  the  output  of  debugging  information, and the other controls
       behavior.  Both bitmasks are initially all zeros.

       To change the values of any  of  the  debug  controls,  use  XkbSetDebug&#8208;
       gingFlags.

       XkbSetDebuggingFlags modifies the debug output flags as specified by mask
       and flags, modifies the debug controls flags as specified  by  ctrls_mask
       and  ctrls, prints the message msg, and backfills ret_flags and ret_ctrls
       with the resulting debug output and debug controls flags.

       When bits are set in the debug output masks, mask and flags,  Xkb  prints
       debug  information corresponding to each bit at appropriate points during
       its processing. The device to which the output is written is  implementa&#8208;
       tion-dependent,  but  is normally the same device to which X server error
       messages are directed; thus the bits that can be set in mask and flags is
       implementation-specific. To turn on a debug output selection, set the bit
       for the output in the mask parameter and set the corresponding bit in the
       flags  parameter.  To  turn off event selection for an event, set the bit
       for the output in the mask parameter and do not set the corresponding bit
       in the flags parameter.

       When  bits are set in the debug controls masks, ctrls_mask and ctrls, Xkb
       modifies its behavior according to each  controls  bit.   ctrls_mask  and
       ctrls are related in the same way that mask and flags are. The valid con&#8208;
       trols bits are defined in Table 1.

       XkbSetDebuggingFlags returns True if successful and False otherwise.  The
       only protocol error it may generate is BadAlloc, if for some reason it is
       unable to allocate storage.

       XkbSetDebuggingFlags is intended for developer use and may be disabled in
       production  X  servers.  If  it  is disabled, XkbSetDebuggingFlags has no
       effect and does not generate any protocol errors.

       The message in msg is written immediately. The  device  to  which  it  is
       written is implementation dependent but is normally the same device where
       X server error messages are directed.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetDebuggingFlags function returns True  when  suc&#8208;
                      cessful.

       False          The  XkbSetDebuggingFlags  function returns False when not
                      successful.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage
