XkbSetDeviceButtonActions(3)      XKB FUNCTIONS     XkbSetDeviceButtonActions(3)



NAME
       XkbSetDeviceButtonActions  -  Change only the button actions for an input
       extension device

SYNTAX
       Bool XkbSetDeviceButtonActions (Display  *dpy,  XkbDeviceInfoPtr  device,
              unsigned int first_button, unsigned int num_buttons);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - device
              structure defining the device and modifications

       - first_button
              number of first button to update, 0 relative

       - num_buttons
              number of buttons to update

DESCRIPTION
       XkbSetDeviceButtonActions  assigns  actions  to the buttons of the device
       specified in device_info-&gt;device_spec.  Actions are assigned to  num_but&#8208;
       tons  buttons  beginning with first_button and are taken from the actions
       specified in device_info-&gt;btn_acts.

       If the server does not support assignment of  Xkb  actions  to  extension
       device  buttons,  XkbSetDeviceButtonActions  has  no  effect  and returns
       False. If the device has no buttons or  if  first_button  or  num_buttons
       specify   buttons   outside   of   the   valid  range  as  determined  by
       device_info-&gt;num_btns, the function has no effect and returns False. Oth&#8208;
       erwise, XkbSetDeviceButtonActions sends a request to the server to change
       the actions for the specified buttons and returns True.

       If the actual request sent to the server involved illegal button numbers,
       a  BadValue  protocol error is generated. If an invalid device identifier
       is specified in device_info-&gt;device_spec, a  BadKeyboard  protocol  error
       results.  If the actual device specified in device_info-&gt;device_spec does
       not contain buttons and a request affecting buttons is made,  a  BadMatch
       protocol error is generated.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadKeyboard    The  device specified was not a valid core or input exten&#8208;
                      sion device

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
