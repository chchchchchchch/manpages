XkbSetIgnoreLockMods(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbSetIgnoreLockMods(3)



NAME
       XkbSetIgnoreLockMods  - Sets the modifiers that, if locked, are not to be
       reported in matching events to passive grabs

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetIgnoreLockMods (Display *display,  unsigned  int  device_spec,
              unsigned  int  affect_real, unsigned int real_values, unsigned int
              affect_virtual, unsigned int virtual_values);

ARGUMENTS
       - display
              connection to the X server

       - device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       - affect_real
              mask of real modifiers affected by this call

       - real_values
              values for affected real modifiers (1=&gt;set, 0=&gt;unset)

       - affect_virtual
              mask of virtual modifiers affected by this call

       - virtual_values
              values for affected virtual modifiers (1=&gt;set, 0=&gt;unset)

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol does not provide a way to  exclude  specific  modifiers
       from  grab calculations, with the result that locking modifiers sometimes
       have unanticipated side effects.

       The IgnoreLockMods control specifies modifiers that  should  be  excluded
       from grab calculations. These modifiers are also not reported in any core
       events except KeyPress and KeyRelease events that do not activate a  pas&#8208;
       sive grab and that do not occur while a grab is active.

       Manipulate  the  IgnoreLockMods  control via the ignore_lock field in the
       XkbControlsRec structure, then use XkbSetControls and  XkbGetControls  to
       query and change this control. Alternatively, use XkbSetIgnoreLockMods.

       XkbSetIgnoreLockMods sends a request to the server to change the server&apos;s
       IgnoreLockMods control.  affect_real and real_values are  masks  of  real
       modifier bits indicating which real modifiers are to be added and removed
       from the server&apos;s IgnoreLockMods  control.  Modifiers  selected  by  both
       affect_real and real_values are added to the server&apos;s IgnoreLockMods con&#8208;
       trol; those selected by affect_real but not by  real_values  are  removed
       from  the  server&apos;s  IgnoreLockMods control. Valid values for affect_real
       and real_values consist of any combination of  the  eight  core  modifier
       bits: ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask - Mod5Mask.  affect_vir&#8208;
       tual and virtual_values are masks of  virtual  modifier  bits  indicating
       which  virtual  modifiers  are  to be added and removed from the server&apos;s
       IgnoreLockMods control. Modifiers selected  by  both  affect_virtual  and
       virtual_values  are  added  to the server&apos;s IgnoreLockMods control; those
       selected by affect_virtual but not by virtual_values are removed from the
       server&apos;s  IgnoreLockMods  control.  See below for a discussion of virtual
       modifier masks to use in affect_virtual and virtual_values. XkbSetIgnore&#8208;
       LockMods  does  not  wait for a reply from the server. It returns True if
       the request was sent, and False otherwise.

       Virtual modifiers are named by converting their string name to an X  Atom
       and storing the Atom in the names.vmods array in an XkbDescRec structure.
       The position of a name Atom in the  names.vmods  array  defines  the  bit
       position  used  to represent the virtual modifier and also the index used
       when accessing virtual modifier information in arrays: the name in the i-
       th (0 relative) entry of names.vmods is the i-th virtual modifier, repre&#8208;
       sented by the mask (1&lt;&lt;i).  Throughout  Xkb,  various  functions  have  a
       parameter  that  is a mask representing virtual modifier choices. In each
       case, the i-th bit (0 relative) of the mask represents the  i-th  virtual
       modifier.

       To  set  the  name  of a virtual modifier, use XkbSetNames, using XkbVir&#8208;
       tualModNamesMask in which and the name in the xkb argument;  to  retrieve
       indicator names, use XkbGetNames.

STRUCTURES
       The  complete  description  of an Xkb keyboard is given by an XkbDescRec.
       The component structures in the XkbDescRec represent the major Xkb compo&#8208;
       nents.

       typedef struct {
           struct _XDisplay * display;      /&#8727; connection to X server */
           unsigned short     flags;        /&#8727; private to Xkb, do not modify */
           unsigned short     device_spec;  /&#8727; device of interest */
           KeyCode            min_key_code; /&#8727; minimum keycode for device */
           KeyCode            max_key_code; /&#8727; maximum keycode for device */
           XkbControlsPtr     ctrls;        /&#8727; controls */
           XkbServerMapPtr    server;       /&#8727; server keymap */
           XkbClientMapPtr    map;          /&#8727; client keymap */
           XkbIndicatorPtr    indicators;   /&#8727; indicator map */
           XkbNamesPtr        names;        /&#8727; names for all components */
           XkbCompatMapPtr    compat;       /&#8727; compatibility map */
           XkbGeometryPtr     geom;         /&#8727; physical geometry of keyboard */
       } XkbDescRec, *XkbDescPtr;

       The  display  field  points to an X display structure. The flags field is
       private to the library: modifying flags may yield unpredictable  results.
       The  device_spec  field  specifies  the device identifier of the keyboard
       input device, or XkbUseCoreKeyboard, which specifies  the  core  keyboard
       device.  The  min_key_code  and max_key_code fields specify the least and
       greatest keycode that can be returned by the keyboard.

       Each structure component has a corresponding mask bit  that  is  used  in
       function  calls  to  indicate that the structure should be manipulated in
       some manner, such as allocating it or freeing it. These masks  and  their
       relationships to the fields in the XkbDescRec are shown in Table 1.
