XkbSetNames(3)                    XKB FUNCTIONS                   XkbSetNames(3)



NAME
       XkbSetNames - Change the symbolic names in the server

SYNOPSIS
       Bool   XkbSetNames  (Display  *dpy,  unsigned  int  which,  unsigned  int
              first_type, unsigned int num_types, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to the X server

       - which
              mask of names or map components to be changed

       - first_type
              first type whose name is to be changed

       - num_types
              number of types for which names are to be changed

       - xkb  keyboard description from which names are to be taken

DESCRIPTION
       To change the symbolic names in the server, first modify a local copy  of
       the  keyboard  description  and  then use either XkbSetNames, or, to save
       network traffic, use a XkbNameChangesRecstructure and call XkbChangeNames
       to  download  the  changes to the server.  XkbSetNames and XkbChangeNames
       can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, BadLength, BadMatch,  and  BadImplementa&#8208;
       tion errors.

       Use  XkbSetNames  to change many names at the same time. For each bit set
       in which, XkbSetNames takes the corresponding value  (or  values  in  the
       case  of  arrays)  from  the keyboard description xkb and sends it to the
       server.

       The first_type and num_types arguments are used only if  XkbKeyTypeNames&#8208;
       Mask  or  XkbKTLevelNamesMask is set in which and specify a subset of the
       types for which the corresponding names are to be changed. If  either  or
       both of these mask bits are set but the specified types are illegal, Xkb&#8208;
       SetNames returns False and does not update any of the names specified  in
       which.   The  specified  types  are illegal if xkb does not include a map
       component or if first_type and  num_types  specify  types  that  are  not
       defined in the keyboard description.

STRUCTURES
       The XkbNameChangesRec allows applications to identify small modifications
       to the symbolic names and effectively reduces the amount of traffic  sent
       to the server:

           typedef struct _XkbNameChanges {
               unsigned int   changed;          /&#8727; name components that have changed */
               unsigned char  first_type;       /&#8727; first key type with a new name */
               unsigned char  num_types;        /&#8727; number of types with new names */
               unsigned char  first_lvl;        /&#8727; first key type with new level names
       */
               unsigned char  num_lvls;         /&#8727; number of key types with new level
       names */
               unsigned char  num_aliases;      /&#8727; if key aliases changed, total number
       of key aliases */
               unsigned char  num_rg;           /&#8727; if radio groups changed, total
       number of radio groups */
               unsigned char  first_key;        /&#8727; first key with a new name */
               unsigned char  num_keys;         /&#8727; number of keys with new names */
               unsigned short changed_vmods;    /&#8727; mask of virtual modifiers for which
       names have changed */
               unsigned long  changed_indicators; /&#8727; mask of indicators for which names
       were changed */
               unsigned char  changed_groups;     /&#8727; mask of groups for which names
       were changed */
           } XkbNameChangesRec, *XkbNameChangesPtr

       The  changed field specifies the name components that have changed and is
       the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid names mask bits defined in Table 1.
       The  rest  of  the  fields  in the structure specify the ranges that have
       changed for the various kinds of symbolic names, as shown in Table 2.

       Xkb provides several functions that work with  symbolic  names.  Each  of
       these  functions  uses  a mask to specify individual fields of the struc&#8208;
       tures described above. These masks and their relationships to the  fields
       in a keyboard description are shown in Table 1.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadAtom        A name is neither a valid Atom or None

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server

       BadLength      The  length  of  a  request is shorter or longer than that
                      required to minimally contain the arguments

       BadMatch       A compatible version of  Xkb  was  not  available  in  the
                      server  or  an argument has correct type and range, but is
                      otherwise invalid
