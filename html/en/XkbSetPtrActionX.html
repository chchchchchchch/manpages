XkbSetPtrActionX(3)               XKB FUNCTIONS              XkbSetPtrActionX(3)



NAME
       XkbSetPtrActionX  -  Sets the high_XXX and low_XXX fields of act from the
       signed integer value x

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSetPtrActionX (XkbPtrAction act, int x);

ARGUMENTS
       - act  action in which to set X

       - x    new value to set

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbPtrAction structure move the pointer  when
       keys are pressed and released.

       If  the  MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and KeyRelease events
       are treated as though the action is XkbSA_NoAction.

       If  the  MouseKeys  control  is  enabled,  a  server   action   of   type
       XkbSA_MovePtr  instructs the server to generate core pointer MotionNotify
       events rather than the usual KeyPress event, and the corresponding KeyRe&#8208;
       lease  event disables any mouse keys timers that were created as a result
       of handling the XkbSA_MovePtr action.

       The type field of the XkbPtrAction structure is always XkbSA_MovePtr.

       The flags field is a bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 1.


       c s l l l lw(4i).  Table 1 Pointer Action Types _ Action  Type    Meaning
       _  XkbSA_NoAcceleration     T{ If not set, and the MouseKeysAccel control
       is enabled, the KeyPress initiates a mouse keys timer for this key; every
       time  the  timer expires, the cursor moves.  T} XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteX T{ If
       set, the X portion of the structure specifies the new pointer  X  coordi&#8208;
       nate.  Otherwise, the X portion is added to the current pointer X coordi&#8208;
       nate to determine the  new  pointer  X  coordinate.   T}  XkbSA_MoveAbso&#8208;
       luteY T{ If set, the Y portion of the structure specifies the new pointer
       Y coordinate.  Otherwise, the Y portion is added to the current pointer Y
       coordinate to determine the new pointer Y coordinate.  T}

       Each of the X and Y coordinates of the XkbPtrAction structure is composed
       of two signed 16-bit values, that is, the X  coordinate  is  composed  of
       high_XXX  and  low_XXX,  and similarly for the Y coordinate. Xkb provides
       the following macros, to convert between a signed integer and two  signed
       16-bit values in XkbPtrAction structures.
