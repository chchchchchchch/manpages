XkbTranslateKeySym(3)             XKB FUNCTIONS            XkbTranslateKeySym(3)



NAME
       XkbTranslateKeySym  - Find the string and symbol associated with a keysym
       for a given keyboard state

SYNOPSIS
       int XkbTranslateKeySym (Display *dpy,  KeySym  *sym_inout,  unsigned  int
              mods, char *buf, int nbytes, int *extra_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       - dpy  connection to X server

       - sym_inout
              symbol to be translated; result of translation

       - mods modifiers to apply to sym_inout

       - buf  buffer into which returned string is written

       - nbytes
              size of buffer in bytes

       - extra_rtrn
              number of bytes overflow

DESCRIPTION
       XkbTranslateKeySym  applies  the transformations specified in mods to the
       symbol specified by sym_inout.  It returns in buf  the  string,  if  any,
       associated with the keysym for the current locale. If the transformations
       in mods changes the keysym, sym_inout  is  updated  accordingly.  If  the
       string returned is larger than nbytes, a count of bytes that does not fit
       into the buffer is returned in extra_rtrn. XkbTranslateKeySym returns the
       number of bytes it placed into buf.

RETURN VALUES
       buf            Returns the string, if any, associated with the keysym for
                      the current locale.
