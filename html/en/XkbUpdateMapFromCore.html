XkbUpdateMapFromCore(3)           XKB FUNCTIONS          XkbUpdateMapFromCore(3)



NAME
       XkbUpdateMapFromCore  -   Update  a local Xkb keyboard map to reflect the
       mapping expressed by a core format mapping

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbUpdateMapFromCore  (XkbDescPtr  xkb,  KeyCode   first_key,   int
              num_keys,   int  map_width,  KeySym  *core_keysyms,  XkbChangesPtr
              changes);

ARGUMENTS
       - xkb  keyboard description to update

       - first_key
              keycode of first key description to update

       - num_keys
              number of key descriptions to update

       - map_width
              width of core protocol keymap

       - core_keysyms
              symbols in core protocol keymap

       - changes
              backfilled with changes made to Xkb

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb provides several functions that make it easier to apply the  compati&#8208;
       bility  map to configure a client-side Xkb keyboard mapping, given a core
       protocol representation of part or all of a keyboard  mapping.  Obtain  a
       core  protocol representation of a keyboard mapping from an actual server
       (by using XGetKeyboardMapping, for example), a data file, or  some  other
       source.

       XkbUpdateMapFromCore interprets input argument information representing a
       keyboard map in core format to update the Xkb keyboard description passed
       in  xkb.   Only  a portion of the Xkb map is updated - the portion corre&#8208;
       sponding to keys with keycodes in the range first_key through first_key +
       num_keys  -  1.  If XkbUpdateMapFromCore is being called in response to a
       MappingNotify event, first_key and num_keys are reported in the  Mapping&#8208;
       Notify  event.   core_keysyms  contains  the keysyms corresponding to the
       keycode  range  being  updated,  in  core  keyboard  description   order.
       map_width  is  the  number of keysyms per key in core_keysyms.  Thus, the
       first map_width entries in core_keysyms are  for  the  key  with  keycode
       first_key,  the  next map_width entries are for key first_key + 1, and so
       on.

       In addition  to  modifying  the  Xkb  keyboard  mapping  in  xkb,  XkbUp&#8208;
       dateMapFromCore  backfills  the changes structure whose address is passed
       in changes to indicate the modifications that were made. You may then use
       changes  in  subsequent  calls  such as XkbSetMap, to propagate the local
       modifications to a server.
