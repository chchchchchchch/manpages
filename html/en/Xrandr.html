       } XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent;

       The XRRScreenSize structure contains a possible root size in  pixels  and
       in millimeters.

       A XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent is sent to a client that has requested noti&#8208;
       fication whenever the screen configuration is changed. A client can  per&#8208;
       form  this  request  by  calling XRRSelectInput, passing the display, the
       root window, and the RRScreenChangeNotifyMask mask.

       XRRScreenConfiguration is an opaque data type containing  the  configura&#8208;
       tion information for a screen.

       Timestamps

       Time stamps are included and must be used to ensure the client is playing
       with a full deck: the screen may change properties on the  fly  and  this
       ensures  its  knowledge  of  the configuration is up to date.  This is to
       help issues when screens may become hot-pluggable in the future.


DESCRIPTION
       Xrandr is a simple library designed to interface the X Resize and  Rotate
       Extension.   This  allows  clients to change the size and rotation of the
       root window of a screen, along with the ability  to  reflect  the  screen
       about  either  axis  (if  supported by the implementation).  Rotation and
       reflection may be implemented by software and may result in  slower  per&#8208;
       formance  if  rotation and reflection are implemented in this fashion (as
       are all implementations as of October 2002).

       The Xrandr library does some minimal caching to avoid roundtrips to  pro&#8208;
       vide  clients  frequently used information.  See &quot;The X Resize and Rotate
       Extension&quot; for a detailed description; also note that depth switching, as
       described  in  the document is not implemented, and may (or may not) ever
       be implemented, as display memory is growing rapidly,  and  toolkits  are
       already  beginning  to  support  migration, mitigating the need for depth
       switching.  If it is implemented in the future, we expect to do so via an
       upward  compatible extension to the current library/protocol; functional&#8208;
       ity described here should continue to work.

       Rotation and reflection and how  they  interact  can  be  confusing.   In
       Randr,  the coordinate system is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction
       relative to the normal orientation.  Reflection is along the window  sys&#8208;
       tem  coordinate  system,  not  the  physical screen X and Y axis, so that
       rotation and reflection do not  interact.   The  other  way  to  consider
       reflection  is  to  treat  it  as  specified in the &quot;normal&quot; orientation,
       before rotation.

       The XRRScreenChangeNotify event  is  sent  to  clients  that  ask  to  be
       informed  whenever  the root window configuration changes.  Configuration
       changes may include resolution, physical size, subpixel order (see  XRen&#8208;
       der(3)),  and  rotation.   Note that changes to any or all of these could
       occur due to external events (user control in the X server,  a  different
       monitor/flat  panel display being hot-plugged) and is not only the result
       of a protocol/library request to the X server.

       Additionally, to eliminate a potential race condition, this event may  be
       generated  immediately  upon selecting for notification if the screen has
       changed since the client of Xrandr connected to the X server,  to  enable
       reliable screen resolution changing when a user may log in and change the
       configuration while one or many clients are starting up.

       Xlib notification

       Clients must call back into Xlib using XRRUpdateConfiguration when screen
       configuration change notify events are generated (or root window configu&#8208;
       ration changes occur, to update Xlib&apos;s  view  of  the  resolution,  size,
       rotation, reflection or subpixel order.  Generally, toolkits will perform
       this operation on behalf of applications; we did not want to change  dis&#8208;
       play  structure  data  behind  the  back of toolkits, as in multithreaded
       clients, various race conditions might occur.   Toolkits  should  provide
       clients some mechanism for notification of screen change, of course.


FUNCTIONS
       There  are  two  classes  of interfaces: those which can be safely called
       even if RandR is not implemented on a screen (to make common  idioms  not
       dependent  on  the  server  having  support), and those which will return
       errors if the extension is not present.

       XRRRotations returns both the possible set of rotations/reflections  sup&#8208;
       ported  (as  a bitmask) as the value of the function, along with the cur&#8208;
       rent rotation/reflection of the screen.

       XRRSizes returns the size and a pointer to the current sizes supported by
       the  specified  screen.   The first size specified is the default size of
       the server. If RandR is not supported, it returns 0  for  the  number  of
       sizes.

       XRRRates  returns a pointer to the rates supported by the specified size.
       If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for the number of rates.

       XRRTimes returns the time last reported by  the  server  along  with  the
       timestamp  the  last  configuration  changed.   If  the configuration has
       changed since the client last  updated  its  view  of  the  server  time,
       requests to change the configuration will fail until the client has an up
       to date timestamp.

       XRRRootToScreen returns the screen number given a root window (for  exam&#8208;
       ple, from an XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent).

       The  rest of the functions will fail if applied to screens not implement&#8208;
       ing the RandR extension.  XRRSetScreenConfig sets  the  screen  size  and
       rotation  and reflection to the desired values on the screen specified by
       draw, or returns a BadValue error.  size_index specifies which size  con&#8208;
       figuration is to be used, rotation specifies which rotation or reflection
       is to be used (or a BadValue error is returned).  The timestamp  is  used
       by the server to make sure the client has up to date configuration infor&#8208;
       mation. Status is returned to indicate success or failure; a client  must
       refresh  its configuration information if it fails and try the call again
       (by calling XRRGetScreenInfo).

       XRRSetScreenConfigAndRate is like XRRSetScreenConfig but  also  sets  the
       refresh  rate.  If  specified  rate  is not supported a BadValue error is
       returned.

       XRRConfigRotations,    XRRConfigSizes,     XRRConfigCurrentConfiguration,
       XRRConfigTimes,  XRRConfigRates, and XRRConfigCurrentRate are used to get
       specific configuration information out of a screen configuration.

       XRRGetScreenInfo returns a screen configuration for later use; the infor&#8208;
       mation  is  private to the library.  Call XRRFreeScreenConfigInfo to free
       this information when you are finished with it.  It forces a  round  trip
       to the server.

       Other  functions  include:  XRRQueryExtension which returns the event and
       error base codes, XRRQueryVersion , which returns the current version  of
       the extension (this information is cached by the library).

RESTRICTIONS
       Xrandr will remain upward compatible after the current 1.0 release.
