       OfDatabase, XrmGetDatabase, XrmSetDatabase, XrmDestroyDatabase - retrieve
       and store resource databases

SYNTAX
       XrmDatabase XrmGetFileDatabase(char *filename);

       void XrmPutFileDatabase(XrmDatabase database, char *stored_db);

       XrmDatabase XrmGetStringDatabase(char *data,

       XrmDatabase XrmGetDatabase(Display *display);

       void XrmSetDatabase(Display *display, XrmDatabase database);

       void XrmDestroyDatabase(XrmDatabase database);

ARGUMENTS
       filename  Specifies the resource database file name.

       database  Specifies the database that is to be used.

       stored_db Specifies the file name for the stored database.

       data      Specifies the database contents using a string.

       database  Specifies the resource database.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

DESCRIPTION
       The XrmGetFileDatabase function opens the specified file, creates a new
       resource database, and loads it with the specifications read in from the
       specified file.  The specified file should contain a sequence of entries
       in valid ResourceLine format (see section 15.1); the database that
       results from reading a file with incorrect syntax is implementation-
       dependent.  The file is parsed in the current locale, and the database is
       created in the current locale.  If it cannot open the specified file,
       XrmGetFileDatabase returns NULL.

       The XrmPutFileDatabase function stores a copy of the specified database
       in the specified file.  Text is written to the file as a sequence of
       entries in valid ResourceLine format (see section 15.1).  The file is
       written in the locale of the database.  Entries containing resource names
       that are not in the Host Portable Character Encoding or containing values
       that are not in the encoding of the database locale, are written in an
       implementation-dependent manner.  The order in which entries are written
       is implementation-dependent.  Entries with representation types other
       than ``String&apos;&apos; are ignored.

       The XrmGetStringDatabase function creates a new database and stores the
       resources specified in the specified null-terminated string.  XrmGet&#8208;
       StringDatabase is similar to XrmGetFileDatabase except that it reads the
       information out of a string instead of out of a file.  The string should
       contain a sequence of entries in valid ResourceLine format (see section
       15.1) terminated by a null character; the database that results from
       using a string with incorrect syntax is implementation-dependent.  The
       string is parsed in the current locale, and the database is created in
       the current locale.

       If database is NULL, XrmDestroyDatabase returns immediately.

       The XrmLocaleOfDatabase function returns the name of the locale bound to
       the specified database, as a null-terminated string.  The returned locale
       name string is owned by Xlib and should not be modified or freed by the
       client.  Xlib is not permitted to free the string until the database is
       destroyed.  Until the string is freed, it will not be modified by Xlib.

       The XrmGetDatabase function returns the database associated with the
       specified display.  It returns NULL if a database has not yet been set.

       The XrmSetDatabase function associates the specified resource database
       (or NULL) with the specified display.  The database previously associated
       with the display (if any) is not destroyed.  A client or toolkit may find
       this function convenient for retaining a database once it is constructed.

FILE SYNTAX
       The syntax of a resource file is a sequence of resource lines terminated
       by newline characters or the end of the file.  The syntax of an individ&#8208;
       ual resource line is:

       ResourceLine   =    Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
       Comment   =    &quot;!&quot; {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
       IncludeFile    =    &quot;#&quot; WhiteSpace &quot;include&quot; WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
       FileName  =    &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
       ResourceSpec   =    WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace &quot;:&quot; WhiteSpace Value
       ResourceName   =    [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
       Binding   =    &quot;.&quot; | &quot;*&quot;
       WhiteSpace     =    {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
       Component =    &quot;?&quot; | ComponentName
       ComponentName  =    NameChar {NameChar}
       NameChar  =    &quot;a&quot;-&quot;z&quot; | &quot;A&quot;-&quot;Z&quot; | &quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;-&quot;
       Value     =    {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}

       Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.  Curly braces
       ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of the enclosed elements.
       Square brackets ([...]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
       Quotes (&quot;...&quot;) are used around literal characters.

       IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line with the contents
       of the specified file.  The word ``include&apos;&apos; must be in lowercase.  The
       file name is interpreted relative to the directory of the file in which
       the line occurs (for example, if the file name contains no directory or
       contains a relative directory specification).

       If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two or more Binding
       characters, the sequence will be replaced with single ``.&apos;&apos; character if
       the sequence contains only ``.&apos;&apos; characters; otherwise, the sequence will
       be replaced with a single ``*&apos;&apos; character.

       A resource database never contains more than one entry for a given
       ResourceName.  If a resource file contains multiple lines with the same
       ResourceName, the last line in the file is used.

       Any white space characters before or after the name or colon in a
       ResourceSpec are ignored.  To allow a Value to begin with white space,
       the two-character sequence ``\space&apos;&apos; (backslash followed by space) is
       recognized and replaced by a space character, and the two-character
       sequence ``\tab&apos;&apos; (backslash followed by horizontal tab) is recognized
       and replaced by a horizontal tab character.  To allow a Value to contain
       embedded newline characters, the two-character sequence ``\n&apos;&apos; is recog&#8208;
       nized and replaced by a newline character.  To allow a Value to be broken
       across multiple lines in a text file, the two-character sequence ``\new&#8208;
       line&apos;&apos; (backslash followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the
       value.  To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the four-
       character sequence ``\nnn&apos;&apos;, where each n is a digit character in the
       range of ``0&apos;&apos;-``7&apos;&apos;, is recognized and replaced with a single byte that
       contains the octal value specified by the sequence.  Finally, the two-
       character sequence ``\\&apos;&apos; is recognized and replaced with a single back&#8208;
       slash.
