DESCRIPTION
       The XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource functions retrieve a resource from
       the specified database.  Both take a fully qualified name/class pair, a
       destination resource representation, and the address of a value
       (size/address pair).  The value and returned type point into database
       memory; therefore, you must not modify the data.

       The database only frees or overwrites entries on XrmPutResource, XrmQPu&#8208;
       tResource, or XrmMergeDatabases.  A client that is not storing new values
       into the database or is not merging the database should be safe using the
       address passed back at any time until it exits.  If a resource was found,
       both XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource return True; otherwise, they
       return False.

       The XrmQGetSearchList function takes a list of names and classes and
       returns a list of database levels where a match might occur.  The
       returned list is in best-to-worst order and uses the same algorithm as
       XrmGetResource for determining precedence.  If list_return was large
       enough for the search list, XrmQGetSearchList returns True; otherwise, it
       returns False.

       The size of the search list that the caller must allocate is dependent
       upon the number of levels and wildcards in the resource specifiers that
       are stored in the database.  The worst case length is %3 sup n%, where n
       is the number of name or class components in names or classes.

       When using XrmQGetSearchList followed by multiple probes for resources
       with a common name and class prefix, only the common prefix should be
       specified in the name and class list to XrmQGetSearchList.

       The XrmQGetSearchResource function searches the specified database levels
       for the resource that is fully identified by the specified name and
       class.  The search stops with the first match.  XrmQGetSearchResource
       returns True if the resource was found; otherwise, it returns False.

       A call to XrmQGetSearchList with a name and class list containing all but
       the last component of a resource name followed by a call to XrmQGet&#8208;
       SearchResource with the last component name and class returns the same
       database entry as XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource with the fully qual&#8208;
       ified name and class.

MATCHING RULES
       The algorithm for determining which resource database entry matches a
       given query is the heart of the resource manager.  All queries must fully
       specify the name and class of the desired resource (use of the characters
       ``*&apos;&apos; and ``?&apos;&apos; are not permitted).  The library supports up to 100 com&#8208;
       ponents in a full name or class.  Resources are stored in the database
       with only partially specified names and classes, using pattern matching
       constructs.  An asterisk (*) is a loose binding and is used to represent
       any number of intervening components, including none.  A period (.) is a
       tight binding and is used to separate immediately adjacent components.  A
       question mark (?) is used to match any single component name or class.  A
       database entry cannot end in a loose binding; the final component (which
       cannot be the character ``?&apos;&apos;) must be specified.  The lookup algorithm
       searches the database for the entry that most closely matches (is most
       specific for) the full name and class being queried.  When more than one
       database entry matches the full name and class, precedence rules are used
       to select just one.

       The full name and class are scanned from left to right (from highest
       level in the hierarchy to lowest), one component at a time.  At each
       level, the corresponding component and/or binding of each matching entry
       is determined, and these matching components and bindings are compared
       according to precedence rules.  Each of the rules is applied at each
       level before moving to the next level, until a rule selects a single
       entry over all others.  The rules, in order of precedence, are:

       1.   An entry that contains a matching component (whether name, class, or
            the character ``?&apos;&apos;)  takes precedence over entries that elide the
            level (that is, entries that match the level in a loose binding).

       2.   An entry with a matching name takes precedence over both entries
            with a matching class and entries that match using the character
            ``?&apos;&apos;.  An entry with a matching class takes precedence over entries
            that match using the character ``?&apos;&apos;.

       3.   An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence over entries
            preceded by a loose binding.
