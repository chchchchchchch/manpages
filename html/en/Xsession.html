Xsession(5)                                                          Xsession(5)



NAME
       Xsession - initialize X session

SYNOPSIS
       Xsession [ session-type ]

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/X11/Xsession is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script which is run when an X
       Window System session is begun by startx(1) or a display manager such  as
       xdm(1).   (Some  display  managers only invoke Xsession when specifically
       directed to so by the user; see the documentation for your  display  man&#8208;
       ager  to find out more.)  Administrators unfamiliar with the Bourne shell
       will likely find the Xsession.options(5)  configuration  file  easier  to
       deal with than Xsession itself.

       Xsession is not intended to be invoked directly by the user; to be effec&#8208;
       tive it needs to run in a special environment associated  with  X  server
       initialization.  startx, xdm, xinit(1), and other similar programs handle
       this.

       By default on a Debian system, Xsession is used by both common methods of
       starting  the  X  Window  System,  xdm (or another X display manager) and
       startx.  To  change  this  for  xdm,  edit  the  &#8216;DisplayManager*session&#8217;
       resource  in  the  /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config  file &#8212; for other display man&#8208;
       agers, consult their documentation.  To stop startx from  using  Xsession
       by default, replace the contents of the /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc file.

       The Xsession script is quite flexible, and extensive customization of the
       X startup procedure is possible without modifying the script itself.  See
       &#8220;CUSTOMIZING THE STARTUP PROCEDURE&#8221; below.

   SESSION TYPES
       Xsession  may  optionally be passed a single argument indicating the type
       of X session to be started.  It is up to the display manager to  set  the
       argument.   To   pass   Xsession   an  argument  from  startx  or  xinit,
       /etc/X11/Xsession (or /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc) must be  called  explicitly
       with  a path, as in startx /etc/X11/Xsession failsafe.  By default, three
       different arguments are supported:

       failsafe
              invokes a session consisting solely of  an  x-terminal-emulator(1)
              (no  window manager is launched).  If the x-terminal-emulator pro&#8208;
              gram cannot be found, the session exits.  The &#8216;failsafe&#8217;  argument
              is   ignored  if  there  is  no  &#8216;allow-failsafe&#8217;  line  in  Xses&#8208;
              sion.options.

       default
              produces the same behavior as if no session type argument had been
              given at all.

       program
              starts program if it can be found in the $PATH.  This is usually a
              session manager or a very featureful window manager.   If  program
              is not found, the Xsession script proceeds with its default behav&#8208;
              ior.  This argument is ignored if there  is  no  &#8216;allow-user-xses&#8208;
              sion&#8217;  line  in  Xsession.options.  (If the administrator does not
              want users writing their own  .xsession  files,  it  makes  little
              sense to permit them to specify the names of arbitrary programs to
              run.)  Note that the restriction may be easy to  bypass,  e.g.  by
              using a .gnomerc file instead.

   DEFAULT STARTUP PROCEDURE
       Initially,  Xsession  performs  some  housekeeping.  It declares a set of
       built-in functions (see &#8220;BUILT-IN SHELL FUNCTIONS&#8221; below) and  variables,
       then  attempts  to  create  a log file for the X session, or append to an
       existing one.  Historically this  is  called  an  &#8216;error&#8217;  file,  but  it
       catches  all sorts of diagnostic output from various X clients run in the
       user&apos;s session, not just error messages.  If it is impossible to write to
       an  error  file,  the script (and thus the X session) aborts.  For conve&#8208;
       nience, once the error file is successfully opened, Xsession reports  the
       fact that the session has started, the invoking username, and the date to
       the error file.  This makes it easier to discern which X session produced
       a particular line of output in the file.

       Xsession next confirms that its script directory, Xsession.d, exists.  If
       it does not, the script aborts.  After the script directory is  confirmed
       to  be  present,  Xsession  uses  run-parts(1)  to identify files in that
       directory that should be sourced (executed) in the  shell&apos;s  environment.
       Only  files  named in a certain way are sourced; see the run-parts manual
       page for a description  of  valid  characters  in  the  filename.   (This
       restriction enables the administrator to move experimental or problematic
       files out of the way of the script but keep them in an obvious place, for
       instance  by renaming them with &#8216;.old&#8217; or &#8216;.broken&#8217; appended to the file&#8208;
       name.)

   SUPPLIED SCRIPTS
       Five shell script portions are supplied by default to handle the  details
       of the session startup procedure.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/20x11-common_process-args
              Arguments  are  processed  as  described in &#8220;SESSION TYPES&#8221; above.
              The startup program, if one is identified at this point, is merely
              stored for later reference, and not immediately executed.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/30x11-common_xresources
              X  resources  are  merged.   run-parts is again used, this time to
              identify files in the /etc/X11/Xresources directory that should be
              processed    with    &#8216;xrdb    -merge&#8217;.     Next,   if   the   line
              &#8216;allow-user-resources&#8217; is present in Xsession.options, the  user&apos;s
              $HOME/.Xresources file is merged in the same way.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/35x11-common_xhost-local
              Give  access  to  the X server to the same user on the local host.
              If the xhost command is available, it will use  it  to  allow  any
              process of the same user running on the local host to access the X
              server.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/40x11-common_xsessionrc
              Source global environment variables.  This script will source any&#8208;
              thing in $HOME/.xsessionrc if the file is present. This allows the
              user to set global environment variables for their X session, such
              as locale information.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/50x11-common_determine-startup
              Determine startup program.  The X client to launch as the control&#8208;
              ling process (the one that, upon exiting, causes the X  server  to
              exit  as well) is determined next.  If a program or failsafe argu&#8208;
              ment was given and is allowed (see above), it is used as the  con&#8208;
              trolling process.  Otherwise, if the line &#8216;allow-user-xsession&#8217; is
              present in Xsession.options, a user-specified session  program  or
              script  is  used.   In  the  latter case, two historically popular
              names for user X session scripts are searched for: $HOME/.xsession
              and  $HOME/.Xsession (note the difference in case).  The first one
              found is used.  If the script is not executable, it is  marked  to
              be  executed  with  the Bourne shell interpreter, sh.  Finally, if
              none of the above succeeds, the following  programs  are  searched
              for:  /usr/bin/x-session-manager,  /usr/bin/x-window-manager,  and
              /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator.  The first one found  is  used.   If
              none are found, Xsession aborts with an error.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/90x11-common_ssh-agent
              Start  ssh-agent(1),  if  needed.   If the line &#8216;use-ssh-agent&#8217; is
              present in Xsession.options, and no SSH agent process  appears  to
              be  running already, ssh-agent is marked to be used to execute the
              startup program determined previously.  Note:  this  functionality
              may move to the ssh package in the future.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99x11-common_start
              Start  the  X  session.  The startup program is executed, inside a
              Bourne shell if it is not executable, and inside an  ssh-agent  if
              necessary.   The  shell&apos;s  exec command is used to spare a slot in
              the process table.

   CUSTOMIZING THE STARTUP PROCEDURE
       Of course, any of the existing files can be edited in place.

       Because the order in which the various scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d are
       executed  is important, files to be added to this directory should have a
       well-formed name.  The following format is recommended:

       * a two-digit number denoting sequence;

       * the  name  of  the  package  providing  the  script  (or  &#8216;custom&#8217;  for
       locally-created scripts);

       * an underscore;

       *  a  description  of  the script&apos;s basic function, using only characters
       allowed by run-parts.

       Here is an example  of  how  one  might  write  a  script,  named  40cus&#8208;
       tom_load-xmodmap, to invoke xmodmap(1):

       SYSMODMAP=&quot;/etc/X11/Xmodmap&quot;
       USRMODMAP=&quot;$HOME/.Xmodmap&quot;

       if [ -x /usr/bin/X11/xmodmap ]; then
           if [ -f &quot;$SYSMODMAP&quot; ]; then
               xmodmap &quot;$SYSMODMAP&quot;
           fi
       fi

       if [ -x /usr/bin/X11/xmodmap ]; then
           if [ -f &quot;$USRMODMAP&quot; ]; then
               xmodmap &quot;$USRMODMAP&quot;
           fi
       fi

       Those  writing scripts for Xsession to execute should avail themselves of
       its built-in shell functions, described below.

   BUILT-IN SHELL FUNCTIONS
       message is used for communicating with the user.  It is a wrapper for the
       echo(1)  command  and relies upon echo for its argument processing.  This
       function may be given an arbitrarily long message string, which  is  for&#8208;
       matted  to  the  user&apos;s terminal width (breaking lines at whitespace) and
       sent to standard error.  If the DISPLAY environment variable is  set  and
       the  xmessage(1)  program  is available, xmessage is also used to display
       the message.

       message_nonl is used for communicating with the user when a trailing new&#8208;
       line  is  undesirable; it omits a trailing newline from the message text.
       It otherwise works as message.

       errormsg is used for indicating  an  error  condition  and  aborting  the
       script.   It  works  as  message, above, except that after displaying the
       message, it will exit Xsession with status 1.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect the execution of Xsession:

       HOME   specifies the user&apos;s home directory; various  files  are  searched
              for here.

       TMPDIR names  a  default directory for temporary files; if the standard X
              session error file cannot be opened,  this  variable  is  used  to
              locate a place for one.

       COLUMNS
              indicates  the  width of terminal device in character cells.  This
              value is used for formatting diagnostic messages.

INPUT FILES
       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/
              is a directory containing Bourne shell scripts to be  executed  by
              Xsession.  Files in this directory are matched using run-parts and
              are sourced, not executed in a subshell.

       /etc/X11/Xresources/
              is a directory containing files corresponding  to  Debian  package
              names,  each of which contains system-wide X resource settings for
              X clients from the corresponding package.  The settings are loaded
              with  xrdb  -merge.   Files  in  this  directory are matched using
              run-parts.

       /etc/X11/Xsession.options
              contains configuration options for the  /etc/X11/Xsession  script.
              See Xsession.options(5) for more information.

       $HOME/.Xresources
              contains  X resources specific to the invoking user&apos;s environment.
              The settings are loaded with xrdb -merge.  Note  that  $HOME/.Xde&#8208;
              faults  is  a  relic  from  X  Version 10 (and X11R1) days, before
              app-defaults files were implemented.  It has been  deprecated  for
              over ten years at the time of this writing.  .Xresources should be
              used instead.

       $HOME/.xsession
              is a sequence of commands invoking X clients (or a session manager
              such  as xsm(1)).  See the manual page for xinit for tips on writ&#8208;
              ing an .xsession file.

OUTPUT FILES
       $HOME/.xsession-errors
              is where standard output and standard error  for  Xsession  script
              and all X client processes are directed by default.

       $TMPDIR/filename
              is  where  the  X  session  error  file  is placed if $HOME/.xses&#8208;
              sion-errors cannot be opened.  For  security  reasons,  the  exact
              filename is randomly generated by tempfile(1).
