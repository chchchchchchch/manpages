Xsession.options(5)                                          Xsession.options(5)



NAME
       Xsession.options - configuration options for Xsession(5)

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/X11/Xsession.options  contains a set of flags that determine some of
       the behavior of the Xsession(5) Bourne shell  (sh(1))  script.   See  the
       Xsession(5) manpage for further information.

       Xsession.options may contain comments, which begin with a hash mark (&#8216;#&#8217;)
       and end at the next newline, just like comments in  shell  scripts.   The
       rest  of  the file consists of options which are expressed as words sepa&#8208;
       rated by hyphens, with only one option per line.  Options are enabled  by
       simply  placing  them  in  the  file;  they are disabled by prefixing the
       option name with &#8216;no-&#8217;.

       Available options are:

       allow-failsafe
              If the &#8216;failsafe&#8217; argument is passed to the  Xsession  script,  an
              emergency  X  session  is  invoked, consisting of only an x-termi&#8208;
              nal-emulator(1) in the upper-left hand corner of the  screen.   No
              window  manager  is started.  If an x-terminal-emulator program is
              not available, the session exits immediately.

       allow-user-resources
              If users have a file called .Xresources in their home directories,
              these  resources  will be merged with the default X resources when
              they log in.

       allow-user-xsession
              If users have an executable file called .xsession  in  their  home
              directories,  it can be used as the startup program for the X ses&#8208;
              sion (see Xsession(5)).  If the  file  is  present  but  not  exe&#8208;
              cutable, it may still be used, but is assumed to be a Bourne shell
              script, and executed with sh(1).

       use-session-dbus
              If the dbus package is installed, the session bus  will  be  acti&#8208;
              vated at X session launch.

       use-ssh-agent
              If  the  ssh-agent(1)  program  is  available and no agent process
              appears to be running already, the X session will  be  invoked  by
              exec&apos;ing  ssh-agent  with  the  startup  command,  instead  of the
              startup command directly.

       All of the above options are enabled by default.  Additional options  may
       be  supported by the local administrator.  Xsession(5) describes how this
       is accomplished.
