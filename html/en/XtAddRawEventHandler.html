XtAddEventHandler(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtAddEventHandler(3)



NAME
       XtAddEventHandler, XtAddRawEventHandler, XtRemoveEventHandler, XtRemove&#8208;
       RawEventHandler, XtInsertEventHandler, XtInsertRawEventHandler - add and
       remove event handlers

SYNTAX
       void XtAddEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean nonmask&#8208;
              able, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtAddRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean non&#8208;
              maskable, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtRemoveEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean non&#8208;
              maskable, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtRemoveRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean non&#8208;
              maskable, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtInsertEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean non&#8208;
              maskable, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data, XtListPosi&#8208;
              tion position);

       void XtInsertRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask event_mask, Boolean non&#8208;
              maskable, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data, XtListPosi&#8208;
              tion position);

       typedef enum { XtListHead, XtListTail } XtListPosition;

ARGUMENTS
       client_data
                 Specifies additional data to be passed to the client&apos;s event
                 handler.

       event_mask
                 Specifies the event mask for which to call or unregister this
                 procedure.

       nonmaskable
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether this procedure
                 should be called or removed on the nonmaskable events (Graphic&#8208;
                 sExpose, NoExpose, SelectionClear, SelectionRequest, Selection&#8208;
                 Notify, ClientMessage, and MappingNotify).

       proc      Specifies the procedure that is to be added or removed.

       w         Specifies the widget for which this event handler is being reg&#8208;
                 istered.

       position  Specifies when the event handler is to be called relative to
                 other previously registered handlers.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAddEventHandler function registers a procedure with the dispatch
       mechanism that is to be called when an event that matches the mask occurs
       on the specified widget.  If the procedure is already registered with the
       same client_data, the specified mask is ORed into the existing mask.  If
       the widget is realized, XtAddEventHandler calls XSelectInput, if neces&#8208;
       sary.

       The XtAddRawEventHandler function is similar to XtAddEventHandler except
       that it does not affect the widget&apos;s mask and never causes an XSelectIn&#8208;
       put for its events.  Note that the widget might already have those mask
       bits set because of other nonraw event handlers registered on it.

       The XtRemoveRawEventHandler function stops the specified procedure from
       receiving the specified events.  Because the procedure is a raw event
       handler, this does not affect the widget&apos;s mask and never causes a call
       on XSelectInput.

       XtInsertEventHandler is identical to XtAddEventHandler with the addi&#8208;
       tional position argument. if position is XtListHead, the event handler is
       registered to that it will be called before any event handlers that were
       previously registered for the same widget.  If position is XtListTail,
       the event handler is registered to be called after any previously regis&#8208;
       tered event handlers. If the procedure is already registered with the
       same client_data value, the specified mask augments the existing mask and
       the procedure is repositioned in the list.

       XtInsertRawEventHandler is similar to XtInsertEventHandler except that it
       does not modify the widget&apos;s event mask and never causes an XSelectInput
       for the specified events. If the procedure is already registered with the
       same client_data value, the specified mask augments the existing mask and
       the procedure is repositioned in the list.
