XtAllocateGC(3)                   XT FUNCTIONS                   XtAllocateGC(3)



NAME
       XtAllocateGC - obtain a sharable GC with modifiable fields

SYNTAX
       GC XtAllocateGC(Widget w, Cardinal depth, XtGCMask value_mask, XGCValues
              *values, XtGCMask dynamic_mask, XtGCMask unused_mask);

ARGUMENTS
       values    Specifies the actual values for this GC.

       value_mask
                 Specifies which fields of the values are specified.

       w         Specifies the widget.

       depth     Specifies the depth for which the returned GC is valid, or 0.

       dynamic_mask
                 Specifies the fields of the GC that will be modified by the
                 caller.

       unused_mask
                 Specifies the fields of the GC that will not be needed by the
                 caller.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAllocateGC function returns a sharable GC that may be modified by
       the client.  The screen field of the specified widget or of the nearest
       widget ancestor of the specified object and the specified depth argument
       supply the root and drawable depths for which the GC is to be valid. If
       depth is zero the depth is taken from the depth field of the specified
       widget or of the nearest widget ancestor of the specified object.

       The value_mask argument specifies the fields of the GC that will be ini&#8208;
       tialized with the respective members of the values structure.  The
       dynamic_mask argument specifies fields that the caller intends to modify
       during program execution. The caller must ensure that the corresponding
       GC field is set prior to each use of the GC. The unused_mask argument
       specifies fields of the GC that are of no interest to the caller. The
       caller may make no assumptions about the contents of any fields specified
       in unused_mask. The caller may assume that at all times all fields not
       specified in either dynamic_mask or unused_mask have their default value
       if not specified in value_mask or the value specified by values.  If a
       field is specified in both value_mask and dynamic_mask, the effect is as
       if it were specified only in dynamic_mask and then immediately set to the
       value in values. If a field is set in unused_mask and also in either
       value_mask or dynamic_mask, the specification in unused_mask is ignored.

       XtAllocateGC tries to minimize the number of unique GCs created by com&#8208;
       paring the arguments with those of previous calls and returning an exist&#8208;
       ing GC when there are no conflicts.  XtAllocateGC may modify and return
       an existing GC if it was allocated with a nonzero unused_mask.
