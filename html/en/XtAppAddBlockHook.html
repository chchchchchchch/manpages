XtAppAddBlockHook(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtAppAddBlockHook(3)



NAME
       XtAppAddBlockHook, XtRemoveBlockHook - register a block hook procedure

SYNTAX
       XtBlockHookId XtAppAddBlockHook(XtAppContext app_context, XtBlockHookProc
              proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtRemoveBlockHook(XtBlockHookId id);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context.

       proc      Specifies the block hook procedure.

       num_args  Specifies the application-specific data to be passed to the
                 block hook.

DESCRIPTION
       XtAppAddBlockHook registers the specified procedure and returns an iden&#8208;
       tifier for it.  The hook is called at any time in the future when the
       Intrinsics are about to block pending some input.

       Block hook procedures are removed automatically and the XtBlockHookId is
       destroyed when the application context in which they were added is
       destroyed.

       XtRemoveBlockHook removes the specified block hook procedure from the
       list in which it was registered.
