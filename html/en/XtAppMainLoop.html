XtAppNextEvent(3)                 XT FUNCTIONS                 XtAppNextEvent(3)



NAME
       XtAppNextEvent, XtAppPending, XtAppPeekEvent, XtAppProcessEvent, Xt&#8208;
       DispatchEvent, XtAppMainLoop - query and process events and input

SYNTAX
       void XtAppNextEvent(XtAppContext app_context, XEvent *event_return);

       Boolean XtAppPeekEvent(XtAppContext app_context, XEvent *event_return);

       XtInputMask XtAppPending(XtAppContext app_context);

       void XtAppProcessEvent(XtAppContext app_context, XtInputMask mask);

       Boolean XtDispatchEvent(XEvent *event);

       void XtAppMainLoop(XtAppContext app_context);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context that identifies the applica&#8208;
                 tion.

       event     Specifies a pointer to the event structure that is to be dis&#8208;
                 patched to the appropriate event handler.

       event_return
                 Returns the event information to the specified event structure.

       mask      Specifies what types of events to process.  The mask is the
                 bitwise inclusive OR of any combination of XtIMXEvent, XtIM&#8208;
                 Timer, XtIMAlternateInput, and XtIMSignal.  As a convenience,
                 the X Toolkit defines the symbolic name XtIMAll to be the bit&#8208;
                 wise inclusive OR of all event types.

DESCRIPTION
       If the X event queue is empty, XtAppNextEvent flushes the X output buf&#8208;
       fers of each Display in the application context and waits for an event
       while looking at the other input sources, timeout timeout values, and
       signal handlers and calling any callback procedures triggered by them.
       This wait time can be used for background processing (see Section 7.8).

       If there is an event in the queue, XtAppPeekEvent fills in the event and
       returns a nonzero value. If no X input is on the queue, XtAppPeekEvent
       flushes the output buffer and blocks until input is available (possibly
       calling some timeout callbacks in the process).  If the input is an
       event, XtAppPeekEvent fills in the event and returns a nonzero value.
       Otherwise, the input is for an alternate input source, and XtAppPeekEvent
       returns zero.

       The XtAppPending function returns a nonzero value if there are events
       pending from the X server, timer pending, or other input sources pending.
       The value returned is a bit mask that is the OR of XtIMXEvent, XtIMTimer,
       XtIMAlternateInput, and XtIMSignal (see XtAppProcessEvent).  If there are
       no events pending, XtAppPending flushes the output buffer and returns
       zero.

       The XtAppProcessEvent function processes one timer, alternate input, sig&#8208;
       nal source, or X event.  If there is nothing of the appropriate type to
       process, XtAppProcessEvent blocks until there is.  If there is more than
       one type of thing available to process, it is undefined which will get
       processed.  Usually, this procedure is not called by client applications
       (see XtAppMainLoop).  XtAppProcessEvent processes timer events by calling
       any appropriate timer callbacks, alternate input by calling any appropri&#8208;
       ate alternate input callbacks, signal source by calling any appropriate
       signal callbacks, and X events by calling XtDispatchEvent.

       When an X event is received, it is passed to XtDispatchEvent, which calls
       the appropriate event handlers and passes them the widget, the event, and
       client-specific data registered with each procedure.  If there are no
       handlers for that event registered, the event is ignored and the dis&#8208;
       patcher simply returns.  The order in which the handlers are called is
       undefined.

       The XtDispatchEvent function sends those events to the event handler
       functions that have been previously registered with the dispatch routine.
       XtDispatchEvent returns True if it dispatched the event to some handler
       and False if it found no handler to dispatch the event to.  The most com&#8208;
       mon use of XtDispatchEvent is to dispatch events acquired with the XtApp&#8208;
       NextEvent procedure.  However, it also can be used to dispatch user-con&#8208;
       structed events.  XtDispatchEvent also is responsible for implementing
       the grab semantics for XtAddGrab.

       The XtAppMainLoop function first reads the next incoming X event by call&#8208;
       ing XtAppNextEvent and then it dispatches the event to the appropriate
       registered procedure by calling XtDispatchEvent.  This constitutes the
       main loop of X Toolkit applications, and, as such, it does not return
       unless XtAppSetExitFlag is called.  Applications are expected to exit in
       response to some user action.  There is nothing special about XtAppMain&#8208;
       Loop; it is simply an loop that calls XtAppNextEvent and then XtDispatch&#8208;
       Event, until XtAppGetExitFlag() returns true.

       Applications can provide their own version of this loop, which tests some
       global termination flag or tests that the number of top-level widgets is
       larger than zero before circling back to the call to XtAppNextEvent.
