XtAppSetFallbackResources(3)      XT FUNCTIONS      XtAppSetFallbackResources(3)



NAME
       XtAppSetFallbackResources - set fallback resources

SYNTAX
       void XtAppSetFallbackResources(XtAppContext app_context, String* specifi&#8208;
              cation_list);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context.

       specification_list
                 Specifies a NULL-terminated list of resource specifications to
                 pre-load the database, or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Each entry in specification_list points to a string in the format XrmPut&#8208;
       LineResource.  following a call to XtAppSetFallbackResources, when a
       resource database is being created for a particular screen and the
       Intrinsics are not able to find or read an application-specific class
       resource file and if specification_list is not NULL the resource specifi&#8208;
       cation in specification_list will be merged into the screen resource
       database in place of the application-specific class resource file.
       XtAppSetFallbackResources is not required to copy specification_list; the
       caller must ensure that the contents of the list and the strings
       addressed by the list remain valid until all displays are initialized or
       until XtAppSetFallbackResources is called again. The value NULL for spec&#8208;
       ification_list removes any previous fallback resource specification for
       the application context.  The intended use for fallback resources is to
       provide a minimal number of resources that will make the application
       usable (or at least terminate with helpful diagnostic messages) when some
       problem exists in finding and loading the application defaults file.
