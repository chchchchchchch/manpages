       XtBuildEventMask - retrieve a widget&apos;s event mask

SYNTAX
       EventMask XtBuildEventMask(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtBuildEventMask function returns the event mask representing the
       logical OR of all event masks for event handlers registered on the widget
       with XtAddEventHandler and all event translations, including accelera&#8208;
       tors, installed on the widget.  This is the same event mask stored into
       the XSetWindowAttributes structure by XtRealizeWidget and sent to the
       server when event handlers and translations are installed or removed on
       the realized widget.
