XtPopdown(3)                      XT FUNCTIONS                      XtPopdown(3)



NAME
       XtPopdown, XtCallbackPopdown - unmap a pop-up

SYNTAX
       void XtPopdown(Widget popup_shell);

       void XtCallbackPopdown(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer
              call_data);

       void MenuPopdown(String shell_name);

ARGUMENTS
       call_data Specifies the callback data, which is not used by this proce&#8208;
                 dure.

       client_data
                 Specifies a pointer to the XtPopdownID structure.

       popup_shell
                 Specifies the widget shell to pop down.

       shell_name
                 Specifies the name of the widget shell to pop down.

       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtPopdown function performs the following:

       &#183;    Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is a subclass of Shell.

       &#183;    Checks that popup_shell is currently popped_up; otherwise, it gener&#8208;
            ates an error.

       &#183;    Unmaps popup_shell&apos;s window.

       &#183;    If popup_shell&apos;s grab_kind is either XtGrabNonexclusive or XtGrabEx&#8208;
            clusive, it calls XtRemoveGrab.

       &#183;    Sets pop-up shell&apos;s popped_up field to False.

       &#183;    Calls the callback procedures on the shell&apos;s popdown_callback list.

       The XtCallbackPopdown function casts the client data parameter to an
       XtPopdownID pointer:

       typedef struct {
            Widget shell_widget;
            Widget enable_widget;
       } XtPopdownIDRec, *XtPopdownID;
The shell_widget is the pop-up shell to pop down, and the enable_widget is the
widget that was used to pop it up.

       XtCallbackPopdown calls XtPopdown with the specified shell_widget and
       then calls XtSetSensitive to resensitize the enable_widget.

       If a shell name is not given, MenuPopdown calls XtPopdown with the widget
       for which the translation is specified.  If a shell_name is specified in
       the translation table, MenuPopdown tries to find the shell by looking up
       the widget tree starting at the parent of the widget in which it is
       invoked.  If it finds a shell with the specified name in the pop-up chil&#8208;
       dren of that parent, it pops down the shell; otherwise, it moves up the
       parent chain as needed.  If MenuPopdown gets to the application top-level
       shell widget and cannot find a matching shell, it generates an error.
