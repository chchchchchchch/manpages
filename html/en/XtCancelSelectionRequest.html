XtCreateSelectionRequest(3)       XT FUNCTIONS       XtCreateSelectionRequest(3)



NAME
       XtCreateSelectionRequest, XtSendSelectionRequest, XtCancelSelection&#8208;
       Request - bundle multiple selection conversion requests into a single
       request using MULTIPLE target

SYNTAX
       void XtCreateSelectionRequest(Widget requestor, Atom selection):

       void XtSendSelectionRequest(Widget requestor, Atom selection, Time time);

       void XtCancelSelectionRequest(Widget requestor, Atom selection);

ARGUMENTS
       requestor Specifies the widget making the request. Must be of class Core
                 or a subclass thereof.

       selection Specifies the particular selection desired.

       time      Specifies the timestamp to be used in making the request.

DESCRIPTION
       When XtCreateSelectionRequest is called, subsequent calls to XtGetSelec&#8208;
       tionValue and XtGetSelectionValueIncremental with the requestor and
       selection as specified to XtCreateSelectionRequest will be bundled into a
       single selection conversion request with multiple targets. The request is
       actually initiated by calling XtSendSelectionRequest.

       When XtSendSelectionRequest is called with a value of requestor and
       selection matching a previous call to XtCreateSelectionRequest, a selec&#8208;
       tion conversion request is actually sent to the selection owner.  If a
       single target request is queued, that request is made. If multiple tar&#8208;
       gets are queued they are bundled into a single request with the target
       MULTIPLE using the specified timestamp. As the conversions are made, the
       callbacks associated with each XtGetSelectionValue and XtGetSelectionVal&#8208;
       ueIncremental are invoked in turn.

       Multi-threaded applications should lock the application context before
       calling XtCreateSelectionRequest and release the lock after calling
       XtSendSelectionRequest to ensure that the thread assembling the request
       is safe from interference by another thread assembling a different
       request naming the same widget and selection.

       When XtCancelSelectionRequest is called, any requests queued since the
       last call to XtCreateSelectionRequest are cleaned up. Subsequent calls to
       XtGetSelectionValue, XtGetSelectionValues, XtGetSelectionValueIncremen&#8208;
       tal, and XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental will not be deferred.
