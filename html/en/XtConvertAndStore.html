XtConvertAndStore(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtConvertAndStore(3)



NAME
       XtConvertAndStore, XtCallConverter - invoke resource converters

SYNTAX
       Boolean XtConvertAndStore(Widget widget, String from_type, XrmValuePtr
              from, String to_type, XrmValuePtr to_in_out);

       Boolean XtCallConverter(Display* dpy, XtConverter converter, XrmValuePtr
              args, Cardinal num_args, XrmValuePtr from, XrmValuePtr to_in_out,
              XtCacheRef* cache_ref_return);

ARGUMENTS
       args      Specifies the argument list that contains the additional argu&#8208;
                 ments needed to perform the conversion, or NULL.

       converter Specifies the conversion procedure that is to be called.

       from      Specifies the value to be converted.

       from_type Specifies the source type.

       num_args  Specifies the number of additional arguments (often zero).

       to_type   Specifies the destination type.

       to_in_out Returns the converted value.

       widget    Specifies the widget to use for additional arguments, if any
                 are needed, and the destroy callback list.

       dpy       Specifies the display with which the conversion is to be asso&#8208;
                 ciated.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtConvertAndStore function looks up the type converter registered to
       convert from_type to to_type, computes any additional arguments needed,
       and then calls XtCallConverter.  (or XtDirectConvert if an old-style con&#8208;
       verter was registered with XtAddConverter or XtAppAddConverter.  ) with
       the from and to_in_out arguments.

       The XtCallConverter function looks up the specified type converter in the
       application context associated with the display and, if the converter was
       not registered or was registered with cache type XtCacheAll or XtCacheBy&#8208;
       Display looks in the conversion cache to see if this conversion procedure
       has been called with the specified conversion arguments. If so, it checks
       the success status of the prior call, and if the conversion failed,
       XtCallConverter returns False immediately; otherwise it checks the size
       specified in the to argument and, if it is greater than or equal to the
       size stored in the cache, copies the information stored in the cache into
       the location specified by to-&gt;addr, stores the cache size into to-&gt;size,
       and returns True.  If the size specified in the to argument is smaller
       than the size stored in the cache, XtCallConverter copies the cache size
       into the to-&gt;size and returns False.  If the converter was registered
       with cache type XtCacheNone or no value was found in the conversion
       cache, XtCallConverter calls the converter and, if it was not registered
       with cache type XtCacheNone, enters the result into the cache.  XtCall&#8208;
       Converter then returns what the converter returned.

       The cache_ref_return field specifies storage allocated by the caller in
       which an opaque value will be stored. If the type converter has been reg&#8208;
       istered with the XtCacheRefCount modifier and if the value returned in in
       cache_ref_return is non-NULL, then the call should store the
       cache_ref_return value in order to decrement the reference count when the
       converted value is no longer required. The cache_ref_return argument
       should be NULL if the caller is unwilling or unable to store the value.
