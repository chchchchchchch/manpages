XtCreateWidget(3)                 XT FUNCTIONS                 XtCreateWidget(3)



NAME
       XtCreateWidget, XtVaCreateWidget, XtCreateManagedWidget, XtVaCreate&#8208;
       ManagedWidget, XtDestroyWidget - create and destroy widgets

SYNTAX
       Widget XtCreateWidget(String name, WidgetClass widget_class, Widget par&#8208;
              ent, ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);

       Widget XtVaCreateWidget(String name, WidgetClass widget_class, Widget
              parent, ...);

       Widget XtCreateManagedWidget(String name, WidgetClass widget_class, Wid&#8208;
              get parent, ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);

       Widget XtVaCreateManagedWidget(String name, WidgetClass widget_class,
              Widget parent, ...);

       void XtDestroyWidget(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       args      Specifies the argument list to override the resource defaults.

       name      Specifies the resource name for the created widget, which is
                 used for retrieving resources and, for that reason, should not
                 be the same as any other widget that is a child of same parent.

       num_args  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument list.

       parent    Specifies the parent widget.

       w         Specifies the widget.

       widget_class
                 Specifies the widget class pointer for the created widget.

       ...       Specifies the variable argument list to override the resource
                 defaults.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtCreateWidget function performs much of the boilerplate operations
       of widget creation:

       &#183;    Checks to see if the class_initialize procedure has been called for
            this class and for all superclasses and, if not, calls those neces&#8208;
            sary in a superclass-to-subclass order.

       &#183;    Allocates memory for the widget instance.

       &#183;    If the parent is a subclass of constraintWidgetClass, it allocates
            memory for the parent&apos;s constraints and stores the address of this
            memory into the constraints field.

       &#183;    Initializes the core nonresource data fields (for example, parent
            and visible).

       &#183;    Initializes the resource fields (for example, background_pixel) by
            using the resource lists specified for this class and all super&#8208;
            classes.

       &#183;    If the parent is a subclass of constraintWidgetClass, it initializes
            the resource fields of the constraints record by using the con&#8208;
            straint resource list specified for the parent&apos;s class and all
            superclasses up to constraintWidgetClass.

       &#183;    Calls the initialize procedures for the widget by starting at the
            Core initialize procedure on down to the widget&apos;s initialize proce&#8208;
            dure.

       &#183;    If the parent is a subclass of compositeWidgetClass, it puts the
            widget into its parent&apos;s children list by calling its parent&apos;s
            insert_child procedure.  For further information, see Section 3.5.

       &#183;    If the parent is a subclass of constraintWidgetClass, it calls the
            constraint initialize procedures, starting at constraintWidgetClass
            on down to the parent&apos;s constraint initialize procedure.

       Note that you can determine the number of arguments in an argument list
       by using the XtNumber macro.  For further information, see Section 11.1.

       The XtCreateManagedWidget function is a convenience routine that calls
       XtCreateWidget and XtManageChild.

       The XtDestroyWidget function provides the only method of destroying a
       widget, including widgets that need to destroy themselves.  It can be
       called at any time, including from an application callback routine of the
       widget being destroyed.  This requires a two-phase destroy process in
       order to avoid dangling references to destroyed widgets.

       In phase one, XtDestroyWidget performs the following:

       &#183;    If the being_destroyed field of the widget is True, it returns imme&#8208;
            diately.

       &#183;    Recursively descends the widget tree and sets the being_destroyed
            field to True for the widget and all children.

       &#183;    Adds the widget to a list of widgets (the destroy list) that should
            be destroyed when it is safe to do so.

       Entries on the destroy list satisfy the invariant that if w2 occurs after
       w1 on the destroy list then w2 is not a descendent of w1.  (A descendant
       refers to both normal and pop-up children.)

       Phase two occurs when all procedures that should execute as a result of
       the current event have been called (including all procedures registered
       with the event and translation managers), that is, when the current invo&#8208;
       cation of XtDispatchEvent is about to return or immediately if not in
       XtDispatchEvent.

       In phase two, XtDestroyWidget performs the following on each entry in the
       destroy list:

       &#183;    Calls the destroy callback procedures registered on the widget (and
            all descendants) in post-order (it calls children callbacks before
            parent callbacks).

       &#183;    If the widget&apos;s parent is a subclass of compositeWidgetClass and if
            the parent is not being destroyed, it calls XtUnmanageChild on the
            widget and then calls the widget&apos;s parent&apos;s delete_child procedure
            (see Section 3.4).

       &#183;    If the widget&apos;s parent is a subclass of constraintWidgetClass, it
            calls the constraint destroy procedure for the parent, then the par&#8208;
            ent&apos;s superclass, until finally it calls the constraint destroy pro&#8208;
            cedure for constraintWidgetClass.

       &#183;    Calls the destroy methods for the widget (and all descendants) in
            post-order.  For each such widget, it calls the destroy procedure
            declared in the widget class, then the destroy procedure declared in
            its superclass, until finally it calls the destroy procedure
            declared in the Core class record.

       &#183;    Calls XDestroyWindow if the widget is realized (that is, has an X
            window).  The server recursively destroys all descendant windows.

       &#183;    Recursively descends the tree and deallocates all pop-up widgets,
            constraint records, callback lists and, if the widget is a subclass
            of compositeWidgetClass, children.
