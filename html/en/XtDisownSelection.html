XtOwnSelection(3)                 XT FUNCTIONS                 XtOwnSelection(3)



NAME
       XtOwnSelection, XtOwnSelectionIncremental, XtDisownSelection - set selec&#8208;
       tion owner

SYNTAX
       Boolean XtOwnSelection(Widget w, Atom selection, Time time, XtConvertSe&#8208;
              lectionProc convert_proc, XtLoseSelectionProc lose_selection, XtS&#8208;
              electionDoneProc done_proc);

       Boolean XtOwnSelectionIncremental(Widget w, Atom selection, Time time,
              XtConvertSelectionIncrProc convert_callback, XtLoseSelectionIncr&#8208;
              Proc lose_callback, XtSelectionDoneIncrProc done_callback,
              XtCancelConvertSelectionProc cancel_callback, XtPointer
              client_data);

       void XtDisownSelection(Widget w, Atom selection, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       convert_proc
                 Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever someone
                 requests the current value of the selection.

       done_proc Specifies the procedure that is called after the requestor has
                 received the selection or NULL if the owner is not interested
                 in being called back.

       lose_selection
                 Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever the wid&#8208;
                 get has lost selection ownership or NULL if the owner is not
                 interested in being called back.

       selection Specifies an atom that describes the type of the selection (for
                 example, XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY, or XA_CLIPBOARD).

       time      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection own&#8208;
                 ership should commence or is to be relinquished.

       w         Specifies the widget that wishes to become the owner or to
                 relinquish ownership.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtOwnSelection function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism
       that a widget believes it owns a selection.  It returns True if the wid&#8208;
       get has successfully become the owner and False otherwise.  The widget
       may fail to become the owner if some other widget has asserted ownership
       at a time later than this widget.  Note that widgets can lose selection
       ownership either because someone else asserted later ownership of the
       selection or because the widget voluntarily gave up ownership of the
       selection.  Also note that the lose_selection procedure is not called if
       the widget fails to obtain selection ownership in the first place.

       The XtOwnSelectionIncremental procedure informs the Intrinsics incremen&#8208;
       tal selection mechanism that the specified widget wishes to own the
       selection. It returns True if the specified widget successfully becomes
       the selection owner or False otherwise. For more information about selec&#8208;
       tion, target, and time, see Section 2.6 of the Inter-Client Communication
       Conventions Manual.

       A widget that becomes the selection owner using XtOwnSelectionIncremental
       may use XtDisownSelection to relinquish selection ownership.

       The XtDisownSelection function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism
       that the specified widget is to lose ownership of the selection.  If the
       widget does not currently own the selection either because it lost the
       selection or because it never had the selection to begin with, XtDisown&#8208;
       Selection does nothing.

       After a widget has called XtDisownSelection, its convert procedure is not
       called even if a request arrives later with a timestamp during the period
       that this widget owned the selection.  However, its done procedure will
       be called if a conversion that started before the call to XtDisown&#8208;
       Selection finishes after the call to XtDisownSelection.
