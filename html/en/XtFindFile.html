XtFindFile(3)                     XT FUNCTIONS                     XtFindFile(3)



NAME
       XtFindFile - search for a file using substitutions in the path list

SYNTAX
       String XtFindFile(String path, Substitution substitutions, Cardinal
              num_substitutions, XtFilePredicate predicate);

ARGUMENTS
       path      Specifies a path of file names, including substitution charac&#8208;
                 ters.

       substitutions
                 Specifies a list of substitutions to make into a path.

       num_substitutions
                 Specifies the number of substitutions passed in.

       predicate Specifies a procedure to call to judge a potential file name,
                 or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       The path parameter specifies a string that consists of a series of poten&#8208;
       tial file names delimited by colons.  Within each name, the percent char&#8208;
       acter specifies a string substitution selected by the following charac&#8208;
       ter.  The character sequence ``%:&apos;&apos; specifies an embedded colon that is
       not a delimiter; the sequence is replaced by a single colon.  The charac&#8208;
       ter sequence ``%%&apos;&apos; specifies a percent character that does not introduce
       a substitution; the sequence is replaced by a single percent character.
       If a percent character is followed by any other character, XtFindFile
       looks through the specified substitutions for that character in the match
       field and if found replaces the percent and match characters with the
       string in the corresponding substitution field.  A substitution field
       entry of NULL is equivalent to a pointer to an empty string.  If the
       operating system does not interpret multiple embedded name separators in
       the path (i.e., ``/&apos;&apos; in POSIX) the same way as a single separator,
       XtFindFile will collapse multiple separators into a single one after per&#8208;
       forming all string substitutions.  Except for collapsing embedded separa&#8208;
       tors, the contents of the string substitutions are not interpreted by
       XtFindFile and may therefore contain any operating-system-dependent char&#8208;
       acters, including additional name separators.  Each resulting string is
       passed to the predicate procedure until a string is found for which the
       procedure returns True; this string is the return value for XtFindFile.
       If no string yields a True return from the predicate, XtFindFile returns
       NULL.

       If the predicate parameter is NULL, an internal procedure that checks if
       the file exists, is readable, and is not a directory will be used.

       It is the responsibility of the caller to free the returned string using
       XtFree when it is no longer needed.
