XtGetActionKeysym(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtGetActionKeysym(3)



NAME
       XtGetActionKeysym - obtain corresponding keysym

SYNTAX
       KeySym XtGetActionKeysym(XEvent* event, Modifiers* modifiers_return);

ARGUMENTS
       event     Specifies the event pointer passed to the action procedure by
                 the Intrinsics.

       modifiers_return
                 Returns the modifiers that caused the match, if non-NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       If XtGetActionKeysym is called after an action procedure has been invoked
       by the Intrinsics and before that action procedure returns, and if the
       event pointer has the same value as the event pointer passed to that
       action routine, and if the event is a KeyPress or KeyRelease event, then
       XtGetActionKeysym returns the KeySym that matched the final event speci&#8208;
       fication in the translation table and, if modifiers_return is non-NULL,
       the modifier state actually used to generate this KeySym; otherwise, if
       the event is a KeyPress or KeyRelease event, then XtGetActionKeysym calls
       XtTranslateKeycode and returns the results; else it returns NoSymbol and
       does not examine modifiers_return.
