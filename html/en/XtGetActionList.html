       void XtGetActionList(WidgetClass widget_class, XtActionList*
              actions_return, Cardinal* num_actions_return);

       num_actions_return
                 Returns the number of action procedures declared by the class.

DESCRIPTION
       XtGetActionList returns the action table defined by the specified widget

       If widget_class is not initialized, or is not coreWidgetClass or a sub&#8208;
       class thereof, or if the class does not define any actions,
       *actions_return will be NULL and *num_actions_return will be zero. If
       *actions_return is non-NULL the client is responsible for freeing the ta&#8208;
       ble using XtFree when it is no longer needed.
