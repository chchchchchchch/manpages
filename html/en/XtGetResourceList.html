XtGetResourceList(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtGetResourceList(3)



NAME
       XtGetResourceList, XtGetConstraintResourceList - obtain resource list

SYNTAX
       void XtGetResourceList(WidgetClass class, XtResourceList
              *resources_return, Cardinal *num_resources_return);

       void XtGetConstraintResourceList(WidgetClass class, XtResourceList
              *resources_return, Cardinal *num_resources_return);

ARGUMENTS
       num_resources_return
                 Specifies a pointer to where to store the number of entries in
                 the resource list.

       resources_return
                 Specifies a pointer to where to store the returned resource
                 list.  The caller must free this storage using XtFree when done
                 with it.

       widget_class
                 Specifies the widget class.

DESCRIPTION
       If XtGetResourceList is called before the widget class is initialized
       (that is, before the first widget of that class has been created), XtGet&#8208;
       ResourceList returns the resource list as specified in the widget class
       record.  If it is called after the widget class has been initialized,
       XtGetResourceList returns a merged resource list that contains the
       resources for all superclasses. The list returned by XtGetResourceList
       should be freed using XtFree when it is no longer needed.

       If XtGetConstraintResourceList is called before the widget class is ini&#8208;
       tialized (that is, before the first widget of that class has been cre&#8208;
       ated), XtGetConstraintResourceList returns the resource list as specified
       in the widget class Constraint part record. If it is called after the
       widget class has been initialized, XtGetConstraintResourceList returns a
       merged resource list that contains the Constraint resources for all
       superclasses. If the specified class is not a subclass of constraintWid&#8208;
       getClass, *resources_return is set to NULL and *num_resources_return is
       set to zero. The list returned by XtGetConstraintResourceList should be
       freed using XtFree when it is no longer needed.
