XtGetSelectionRequest(3)          XT FUNCTIONS          XtGetSelectionRequest(3)



NAME
       XtGetSelectionRequest - retrieve the event that triggered the XtConvertS&#8208;
       electionProc

SYNTAX
       XSelectionRequestEvent* XtGetSelectionRequest(Widget w, Atom selection,
              XtRequestId request_id);

ARGUMENTS
       w         Specifies the widget.

       selection Specifies the selection being processed.

       request_id
                 Specifies the requestor id in the case of incremental selec&#8208;
                 tions, or NULL in the case of atomic transfers.

DESCRIPTION
       XtGetSelectionRequest may only be called from within an XtConvertSelec&#8208;
       tionProc procedure and returns a pointer to the SelectionRequest event
       that caused the conversion procedure to be invoked. Request_id specifies
       a unique id for the individual request in the case that multiple incre&#8208;
       mental transfers are outstanding. For atomic transfers, request_id must
       be specified as NULL. If no SelectionRequest event is being processed for
       the specified widget, selection, and request_id, XtGetSelectionRequest
       returns NULL.
