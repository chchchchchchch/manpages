XtGetSelectionValueIncremental(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtGetSelectionValueIncremental(3)



NAME
       XtGetSelectionValueIncremental, XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental - obtain
       selection values

SYNTAX
       void XtGetSelectionValueIncremental(Widget w, Atom selection, Atom tar&#8208;
              get, XtSelectionCallbackProc callback, XtPointer client_data, Time
              time);

       void XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental(Widget w, Atom selection, Atom *tar&#8208;
              gets, int count, XtSelectionCallbackProc callback, XtPointer
              client_data, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       callback  Specifies the callback procedure that is to be called when the
                 selection value has been obtained.

       client_data
                 Specifies the argument that is to be passed to the specified
                 procedure when it is called.

       client_data
                 Specifies the client data (one for each target type) that is
                 passed to the callback procedure when it is called for that
                 target.

       count     Specifies the length of the targets and client_data lists.

       selection Specifies the particular selection desired (that is, primary or
                 secondary).

       target    Specifies the type of the information that is needed about the
                 selection.

       targets   Specifies the types of information that is needed about the
                 selection.

       time      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection value
                 is desired.

       w         Specifies the widget that is making the request.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtGetSelectionValueIncremental function is similar to XtGetSelection&#8208;
       Value except that the selection_callback procedure will be called repeat&#8208;
       edly upon delivery of multiple segments of the selection value.  The end
       of the selection value is indicated when selection_callback is called
       with a non-NULL value of length zero, which must still be freed by the
       client. If the transfer of the selection is aborted in the middle of a
       transfer (for example, because to timeout), the selection_callback proce&#8208;
       dure is called with a type value equal to the symbolic constant XT_CON&#8208;
       VERT_FAIL so that the requestor can dispose of the partial selection
       value it has collected up until that point. Upon receiving XT_CON&#8208;
       VERT_FAIL, the requesting client must determine for itself whether or not
       a partially completed transfer is meaningful.

       The XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental function is similar to XtGet&#8208;
       SelectionValueIncremental except that it takes a list of target types and
       a list of client data and obtains the current value of the selection con&#8208;
       verted to each of the targets.  The effect is as if each target were
       specified in a separate call to XtGetSelectionValueIncremental.  The
       callback is called once with the corresponding client data for each tar&#8208;
       get.  XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental does guarantee that all the conver&#8208;
       sions will use the same selection value because the ownership of the
       selection cannot change in the middle of the list, as would be when call&#8208;
       ing XtGetSelectionValueIncremental repeatedly.
