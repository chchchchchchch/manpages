XtGetSelectionValue(3)            XT FUNCTIONS            XtGetSelectionValue(3)



NAME
       XtGetSelectionValue, XtGetSelectionValues - obtain selection values

SYNTAX
       void XtGetSelectionValue(Widget w, Atom selection, Atom target, XtSelec&#8208;
              tionCallbackProc callback, XtPointer client_data, Time time);

       void XtGetSelectionValues(Widget w, Atom selection, Atom *targets, int
              count, XtSelectionCallbackProc callback, XtPointer client_data,
              Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       callback  Specifies the callback procedure that is to be called when the
                 selection value has been obtained.

       client_data
                 Specifies the argument that is to be passed to the specified
                 procedure when it is called.

       client_data
                 Specifies the client data (one for each target type) that is
                 passed to the callback procedure when it is called for that
                 target.

       count     Specifies the length of the targets and client_data lists.

       selection Specifies the particular selection desired (that is, primary or
                 secondary).

       target    Specifies the type of the information that is needed about the
                 selection.

       targets   Specifies the types of information that is needed about the
                 selection.

       time      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection value
                 is desired.

       w         Specifies the widget that is making the request.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtGetSelectionValue function requests the value of the selection that
       has been converted to the target type.  The specified callback will be
       called some time after XtGetSelectionValue is called; in fact, it may be
       called before or after XtGetSelectionValue returns.

       The XtGetSelectionValues function is similar to XtGetSelectionValue
       except that it takes a list of target types and a list of client data and
       obtains the current value of the selection converted to each of the tar&#8208;
       gets.  The effect is as if each target were specified in a separate call
       to XtGetSelectionValue.  The callback is called once with the correspond&#8208;
       ing client data for each target.  XtGetSelectionValues does guarantee
       that all the conversions will use the same selection value because the
       ownership of the selection cannot change in the middle of the list, as
       would be when calling XtGetSelectionValue repeatedly.
