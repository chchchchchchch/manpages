NAME
       XtGrabKey, XtUngrabKey, XtGrabKeyboard, XtUngrabKeyboard, XtGrabButton,
       XtUngrabButton, XtGrabPointer, XtUngrabPointer - manage grabs

SYNTAX
       void XtGrabKey(Widget widget, KeyCode keycode, Modifiers modifiers, Bool&#8208;
              ean owner_events, int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode);

       void XtUngrabKey(Widget widget, KeyCode keycode, Modifiers modifiers);

       int XtGrabKeyboard(Widget widget, Boolean owner_events, int pointer_mode,
              int keyboard_mode, Time time);

       void XtUngrabKeyboard(Widget widget, Time time);

       void XtGrabButton(Widget widget, int button, Modifiers modifiers, Boolean
              owner_events, unsigned int event_mask, int pointer_mode, int key&#8208;
              board_mode, Window confine_to, Cursor cursor);

       void XtUngrabButton(Widget widget, KeyCode button, Modifiers modifiers);

       int XtGrabPointer(Widget widget, Boolean owner_events, unsigned int
              event_mask, int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Window con&#8208;
              fine_to, Cursor cursor, Time time);

       void XtUngrabPointer(Widget widget, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       widget    Specifies the widget in whose window the grab will occur. Must
                 be of class Core or a subclass thereof.

       keycode
       modifiers
       owner_events
       pointer_mode
       keyboard_mode
       time
       button
       confine_to
       cursor    Specifies arguments to the associated Xlib function call.

DESCRIPTION
       XtGrabKey calls XGrabKey specifying the widget&apos;s window as the grab win&#8208;
       dow if the widget is realized. The remaining arguments are exactly as for
       XGrabKey.  If the widget is not realized, or is later unrealized, the
       call to XGrabKey will be performed (again) when the widget is realized
       and its window becomes mapped. In the future, if XtDispatchEvent is
       called with a KeyPress event matching the specified keycode and modifiers
       (which may be AnyKey or AnyModifier, respectively) for the widget&apos;s win&#8208;
       dow, the Intrinsics will call XtUngrabKeyboard with the timestamp from
       the KeyPress event if either of the following conditions is true:

       &#183;  There is a modal cascade and the widget is not in the active subset of
          the cascade and the keyboard was not previously grabbed, or

       &#183;  XFilterEvent returns True.

       XtUngrabKey calls XUngrabKey specifying the widget&apos;s window as the ungrab
       window if the widget is realized. The remaining arguments are exactly as
       for XUngrabKey.  If the widget is not realized, XtUngrabKey removes a
       deferred XtGrabKey request, if any, for the specified widget, keycode,
       and modifiers.

       If the specified widget is realized XtGrabKeyboard calls XGrabKeyboard
       specifying the widget&apos;s window as the grab window. The remaining argu&#8208;
       ments and return value are exactly as for XGrabKeyboard.  If the widget
       is not realized, XtGrabKeyboard immediately returns GrabNotViewable.  No
       future ungrab is implied by XtGrabKeyboard.

       XtUngrabKeyboard calls XUngrabKeyboard with the specified time.

       XtGrabButton calls XGrabButton specifying the widget&apos;s window as the grab
       window if the widget is realized. The remaining arguments are exactly as
       for XGrabButton.  If the widget is not realized, or is later unrealized,
       the call to XGrabButton will be performed (again) when the widget is
       realized and its window becomes mapped. In the future, if XtDispatchEvent
       is called with a ButtonPress event matching the specified button and mod&#8208;
       ifiers (which may be AnyButton or AnyModifier, respectively) for the wid&#8208;
       get&apos;s window, the Intrinsics will call XtUngrabPointer with the timestamp
       from the ButtonPress event if either of the following conditions is true:

       &#183;  There is a modal cascade and the widget is not in the active subset of
          the cascade and the pointer was not previously grabbed, or

       &#183;  XFilterEvent returns True.

       XtUngrabButton calls XUngrabButton specifying the widget&apos;s window as the
       ungrab window if the widget is realized. The remaining arguments are
       exactly as for XUngrabButton.  If the widget is not realized, XtUngrab&#8208;
       Button removes a deferred XtGrabButton request, if any, for the specified
       widget, button, and modifiers.

       XtGrabPointer calls XGrabPointer specifying the widget&apos;s window as the
       grab window. The remaining arguments and return value are exactly as for
       XGrabPointer.  If the widget is not realized, XtGrabPointer immediately
       returns GrabNotViewable.  No future ungrab is implied by XtGrabPointer.

       XtUngrabPointer calls XUngrabPointer with the specified time.
