XtMakeGeometryRequest(3)          XT FUNCTIONS          XtMakeGeometryRequest(3)



NAME
       XtMakeGeometryRequest, XtMakeResizeRequest - make geometry manager
       request

SYNTAX
       XtGeometryResult XtMakeGeometryRequest(Widget w, XtWidgetGeometry
              *request, XtWidgetGeometry *reply_return);

       XtGeometryResult XtMakeResizeRequest(Widget w, Dimension width, height,
              Dimension *width_return, Dimension *height_return);

ARGUMENTS
       reply_return
                 Returns the allowed widget size or may be NULL if the request&#8208;
                 ing widget is not interested in handling XtGeometryAlmost.

       request   Specifies the desired widget geometry (size, position, border
                 width, and stacking order).

       w         Specifies the widget that is making the request.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the allowed widget width and height.

DESCRIPTION
       Depending on the condition, XtMakeGeometryRequest performs the following:

       &#183;    If the widget is unmanaged or the widget&apos;s parent is not realized,
            it makes the changes and returns XtGeometryYes.

       &#183;    If the parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass or the par&#8208;
            ent&apos;s geometry_manager is NULL, it issues an error.

       &#183;    If the widget&apos;s being_destroyed field is True, it returns XtGeome&#8208;
            tryNo.

       &#183;    If the widget x, y, width, height and border_width fields are all
            equal to the requested values, it returns XtGeometryYes; otherwise,
            it calls the parent&apos;s geometry_manager procedure with the given
            parameters.

       &#183;    If the parent&apos;s geometry manager returns XtGeometryYes and if XtCW&#8208;
            QueryOnly is not set in the request_mode and if the widget is real&#8208;
            ized, XtMakeGeometryRequest calls the XConfigureWindow Xlib function
            to reconfigure the widget&apos;s window (set its size, location, and
            stacking order as appropriate).

       &#183;    If the geometry manager returns XtGeometryDone, the change has been
            approved and actually has been done.  In this case, XtMakeGeometry&#8208;
            Request does no configuring and returns XtGeometryYes.  XtMake&#8208;
            GeometryRequest never returns XtGeometryDone.

       Otherwise, XtMakeGeometryRequest returns the resulting value from the
       parent&apos;s geometry manager.

       Children of primitive widgets are always unmanaged; thus, XtMakeGeometry&#8208;
       Request always returns XtGeometryYes when called by a child of a primi&#8208;
       tive widget.

       The XtMakeResizeRequest function, a simple interface to XtMakeGeometry&#8208;
       Request, creates a XtWidgetGeometry structure and specifies that width
       and height should change.  The geometry manager is free to modify any of
       the other window attributes (position or stacking order) to satisfy the
       resize request.  If the return value is XtGeometryAlmost, width_return
       and height_return contain a compromise width and height.  If these are
       acceptable, the widget should immediately make an XtMakeResizeRequest and
       request that the compromise width and height be applied.  If the widget
       is not interested in XtGeometryAlmost replies, it can pass NULL for
       width_return and height_return.
