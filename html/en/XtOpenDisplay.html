XtDisplayInitialize(3)            XT FUNCTIONS            XtDisplayInitialize(3)



NAME
       XtDisplayInitialize, XtOpenDisplay, XtDatabase, XtScreenDatabase,
       XtCloseDisplay - initialize, open, or close a display

SYNTAX
       void XtDisplayInitialize(XtAppContext app_context, Display *display,
              String application_name, String application_class, XrmOptionDe&#8208;
              scRec *options, Cardinal num_options, int *argc, String *argv);

       Display *XtOpenDisplay(XtAppContext app_context, String display_string,
              String application_name, String application_class, XrmOptionDe&#8208;
              scRec *options, Cardinal num_options, int *argc, String *argv);

       void XtCloseDisplay(Display *display);

       XrmDatabase XtDatabase(Display *display);

       XrmDatabase XtScreenDatabase(Screen* screen);

ARGUMENTS
       argc      Specifies a pointer to the number of command line parameters.

       argv      Specifies the command line parameters.

       app_context
                 Specifies the application context.

       application_class
                 Specifies the class name of this application, which usually is
                 the generic name for all instances of this application.

       application_name
                 Specifies the name of the application instance.

       display   Specifies the display.  Note that a display can be in at most
                 one application context.

       num_options
                 Specifies the number of entries in the options list.

       options   Specifies how to parse the command line for any application-
                 specific resources.  The options argument is passed as a param&#8208;
                 eter to XrmParseCommand.  For further information, see Xlib - C
                 Language X Interface.

       screen    Specifies the screen whose resource database is to be returned.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtDisplayInitialize function builds the resource database, calls the
       Xlib XrmParseCommand function to parse the command line, and performs
       other per display initialization.  After XrmParseCommand has been called,
       argc and argv contain only those parameters that were not in the standard
       option table or in the table specified by the options argument.  If the
       modified argc is not zero, most applications simply print out the modi&#8208;
       fied argv along with a message listing the allowable options.  On UNIX-
       based systems, the application name is usually the final component of
       argv[0].  If the synchronize resource is True for the specified applica&#8208;
       tion, XtDisplayInitialize calls the Xlib XSynchronize function to put
       Xlib into synchronous mode for this display connection.  If the reverseV&#8208;
       ideo resource is True, the Intrinsics exchange XtDefaultForeground and
       XtDefaultBackground for widgets created on this display.  (See Section
       9.6.1).

       The XtOpenDisplay function calls XOpenDisplay the specified display name.
       If display_string is NULL, XtOpenDisplay uses the current value of the
       -display option specified in argv and if no display is specified in argv,
       uses the user&apos;s default display (on UNIX-based systems, this is the value
       of the DISPLAY environment variable).

       If this succeeds, it then calls XtDisplayInitialize and pass it the
       opened display and the value of the -name option specified in argv as the
       application name.  If no name option is specified, it uses the applica&#8208;
       tion name passed to XtOpenDisplay.  If the application name is NULL, it
       uses the last component of argv[0].  XtOpenDisplay returns the newly
       opened display or NULL if it failed.

       XtOpenDisplay is provided as a convenience to the application programmer.

       The XtCloseDisplay function closes the specified display as soon as it is
       safe to do so.  If called from within an event dispatch (for example, a
       callback procedure), XtCloseDisplay does not close the display until the
       dispatch is complete.  Note that applications need only call XtClose&#8208;
       Display if they are to continue executing after closing the display; oth&#8208;
       erwise, they should call XtDestroyApplicationContext or just exit.

       The XtDatabase function returns the fully merged resource database that
       was built by XtDisplayInitialize associated with the display that was
       passed in.  If this display has not been initialized by XtDisplay&#8208;
       Initialize, the results are not defined.

       The XtScreenDatabase function returns the fully merged resource database
       associated with the specified screen. If the screen does not belong to a
       Display initialized by XtDisplayInitialize, the results are undefined.
