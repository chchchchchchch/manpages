NAME
       XtPopup, XtPopupSpringLoaded, XtCallbackNone, XtCallbackNonexclusive,
       XtCallbackExclusive - map a pop-up

SYNTAX
       void XtPopup(Widget popup_shell, XtGrabKind grab_kind);

       void XtPopupSpringLoaded(Widget popup_shell);

       void XtCallbackNone(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer
              call_data):

       void XtCallbackNonexclusive(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer
              call_data);

       void XtCallbackExclusive(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer
              call_data);

       void MenuPopup(String shell_name);

ARGUMENTS
       call_data Specifies the callback data, which is not used by this proce&#8208;
                 dure.

       client_data
                 Specifies the pop-up shell.

       grab_kind Specifies the way in which user events should be constrained.

       popup_shell
                 Specifies the widget shell.

       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtPopup function performs the following:

       &#183;    Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is a subclass of Shell.

       &#183;    Generates an error if the shell&apos;s popped_up field is already True.

       &#183;    Calls the callback procedures on the shell&apos;s popup_callback list.

       &#183;    Sets the shell popped_up field to True, the shell spring_loaded
            field to False, and the shell grab_kind field from grab_kind.

       &#183;    If the shell&apos;s create_popup_child field is non-NULL, XtPopup calls
            it with popup_shell as the parameter.

       &#183;    If grab_kind is either XtGrabNonexclusive or XtGrabExclusive, it
            calls:

       XtAddGrab(popup_shell, (grab_kind == XtGrabExclusive), False)

       &#183;    Calls XtRealizeWidget with popup_shell specified.

       &#183;    Calls XMapWindow with popup_shell specified.

       The XtPopupSpringLoaded function performs exactly as XtPopup except that
       it sets the shell spring_loaded field to True and always calls XtAddGrab
       with exclusive True and spring_loaded True.
&#12;       The XtCallbackNone, XtCallbackNonexclusive, and XtCallbackExclusive func&#8208;
       tions call XtPopup with the shell specified by the client data argument
       and grab_kind set as the name specifies.  XtCallbackNone, XtCallback&#8208;
       Nonexclusive, and XtCallbackExclusive specify XtGrabNone, XtGrabNonexclu&#8208;
       sive, and XtGrabExclusive, respectively.  Each function then sets the
       widget that executed the callback list to be insensitive by using XtSet&#8208;
       Sensitive.  Using these functions in callbacks is not required.  In par&#8208;
       ticular, an application must provide customized code for callbacks that
       create pop-up shells dynamically or that must do more than desensitizing
       the button.

       MenuPopup is known to the translation manager, which must perform special
       actions for spring-loaded pop-ups.  Calls to MenuPopup in a translation
       specification are mapped into calls to a nonexported action procedure,
       and the translation manager fills in parameters based on the event speci&#8208;
       fied on the left-hand side of a translation.

       If MenuPopup is invoked on ButtonPress (possibly with modifiers), the
       translation manager pops up the shell with grab_kind set to XtGrabExclu&#8208;
       sive and spring_loaded set to True.  If MenuPopup is invoked on EnterWin&#8208;
       dow (possibly with modifiers), the translation manager pops up the shell
       with grab_kind set to XtGrabNonexclusive and spring_loaded set to False.
       Otherwise, the translation manager generates an error.  When the widget
       is popped up, the following actions occur:

       &#183;    Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is a subclass of Shell.

       &#183;    Generates an error if the shell&apos;s popped_up field is already True.

       &#183;    Calls the callback procedures on the shell&apos;s popup_callback list.

       &#183;    Sets the shell popped_up field to True and the shell grab_kind and
            spring_loaded fields appropriately.

       &#183;    If the shell&apos;s create_popup_child field is non-NULL, it is called
            with popup_shell as the parameter.

       &#183;    Calls:

       XtAddGrab(popup_shell, (grab_kind == XtGrabExclusive), spring_loaded)

       &#183;    Calls XtRealizeWidget with popup_shell specified.

       &#183;    Calls XMapWindow with popup_shell specified.

       (Note that these actions are the same as those for XtPopup.)  MenuPopup
       tries to find the shell by searching the widget tree starting at the par&#8208;
       ent of the widget in which it is invoked.  If it finds a shell with the
       specified name in the pop-up children of that parent, it pops up the
       shell with the appropriate parameters.  Otherwise, it moves up the parent
       chain as needed.  If MenuPopup gets to the application widget and cannot
       find a matching shell, it generates an error.
