XtRegisterDrawable(3)             XT FUNCTIONS             XtRegisterDrawable(3)



NAME
       XtRegisterDrawable - register a drawable with the Intrinsics event dis&#8208;
       patcher

SYNTAX
       void XtRegisterDrawable(Display* display, Drawable drawable, Widget wid&#8208;
              get);

       void XtUnregisterDrawable(Display* display, Drawable drawable);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the drawable&apos;s display.

       drawable  Specifies the drawable to register.

       widget    Specifies the widget to register the drawable for.

DESCRIPTION
       XtRegisterDrawable associates the specified drawable with the specified
       widget so that future calls to XtWindowToWidget with the drawable will
       return the widget. The default event dispatcher will dispatch future core
       events that arrive with the drawable to the widget as though the event
       contained the widget&apos;s window, but the event itself will not be changed
       in any way when being passed to even handler or action procedures.

       If the drawable is already registered with another widget, or if the
       drawable is the window of a widget in the client&apos;s widget tree, the
       results of calling XtRegisterDrawable are undefined.

       XtUnregisterDrawable removes an association created with XtRegister&#8208;
       Drawable.  If the drawable is the window of a widget in the client&apos;s wid&#8208;
       get tree the results of calling XtUnregisterDrawable are undefined.
