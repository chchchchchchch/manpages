              select_data, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data, XtListPo&#8208;
              sition position);

       void XtRemoveEventTypeHandler(Widget widget, int event_type, XtPointer
              select_data, XtEventHandler proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtRegisterExtensionSelector(Display* display, int min_event_type,
              int max_event_type, XtExtensionSelectProc proc, XtPointer
              client_data);

       XtEventDispatchProc XtSetEventDispatcher(Widget widget, int event_type,
              XtEventDispatchProc proc);

       Boolean XtDispatchEventToWidget(Widget widget, XEvent* event);

ARGUMENTS
       widget    Specifies the widget for this event handler.  Must be of class
                 Core or any subclass thereof.

       event_type
                 Specifies the event type.

       select_data
                 Specifies data used to select or deselect events from the
                 server.

       proc      Specifies the proc.

       client_data
                 Specifies additional data to be passed to the event handler.

       position  Specifies when the event handler is to be called relative to
                 other previously registered handlers.

       display   Specifies the display.

       min_event_type, max_event_type
                 Specifies the range of event types for this extension.

       event     Specifies a pointer to the event to be dispatched.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtInsertEventTypeHandler function registers a procedure with the dis&#8208;
       patch mechanism that is to be called when an event that matches the spec&#8208;
       ified event_type is dispatched to the specified widget.

       If event_type is one of the core X protocol events then select_data must
       be a pointer to a value of type EventMask, indicating the event mask to
       be used to select for the desired event.  This event mask will be
       included in the value returned by XtBuildEventMask.  If the widget is
       realized XtInsertEventTypeHandler calls XSelectInput if necessary. Speci&#8208;
       fying NULL for select_data is equivalent to specifying a pointer to an
       event mask containing 0. This is similar to the XtInsertRawEventHandler
       function.
&#12;       If event_type specifies an extension event type then the semantics of the
       data pointed to by select_data are defined by the extension selector reg&#8208;
       istered for the specified event type.

       In either case the Intrinsics are not required to copy the data pointed
       to by select_data, so the caller must ensure that it remains valid as
       long as the event handler remains registered with this value of
       select_data.

       The position argument allows the client to control the order of the invo&#8208;
       cation of event handlers registered for the same event type. If the
       client does not care about the order, it should normally specify XtList&#8208;
       Tail, which registers this event handler after any previously registered
       handlers for this event type.

       The XtRemoveEventTypeHandler function unregisters an even handler regis&#8208;
       tered with XtInsertEventTypeHandler for the specified event type. The
       request is ignored if client_data does not match the value given with the
       handler was registered.

       If event_type specifies on of the core X protocol events, select_data
       must be a pointer to a value of type EventMask, indicating the mask to be
       used to deselect for the appropriate event.  If the widget is realized,
       XtRemoveEventTypeHandler calls XSelectInput if necessary. Specifying NULL
       for select_data is equivalent to specifying a pointer to an event mask
       containing 0. This is similar to the XtRemoveRawEventHandler function.

       If event_type specifies an extension event type then the semantics of the
       data pointed to by select_data are defined by the extension selector reg&#8208;
       istered for the specified event type.

       The XtRegisterExtensionSelector function registers a procedure to arrange
       for the delivery of extension events to widgets.

       If min_event_type and max_event_type match the parameters to a previous
       call to XtRegisterExtensionSelector for the same display, the proc and
       client_data replace the previously registered values. If the range speci&#8208;
       fied by min_event_type and max_event_type overlaps the range of the
       parameters to a previous call for the same display in any other way, an
       error results.

       The XtSetEventDispatcher function registers the event dispatcher proce&#8208;
       dure specified by proc for events with the type event_type. The previ&#8208;
       ously registered dispatcher (or the default dispatcher if there was no
       previously registered dispatcher) is returned. If proc is NULL, the
       default procedure is restored for the specified type.

       In the future, when XtDispatchEvent is called with an event of
       event_type, the specified proc (or the default dispatcher) will be
       invoked to determine a widget ot which to dispatch the event.

       The XtDispatchEventToWidget function scans the list of registered event
       handlers for the specified widget and calls each handler that has been
       registered for the specified event type, subject to the continue_to_dis&#8208;
       patch value returned by each handler. The Intrinsics behave as if event
       handlers were registered at the head of the list for Expose, NoExpose,
       GraphicsExpose, and VisibilityNotify events to invoke the widget&apos;s expose
       procedure according to the exposure compression rules and to update the
       widget&apos;s visible field if visible_interest is True.  These internal event
       handlers never set continue_to_dispatch to False.

       XtDispatchEventToWidget returns True if any event handler was called and
       False otherwise.
