XtAddGrab(3)                      XT FUNCTIONS                      XtAddGrab(3)



NAME
       XtAddGrab, XtRemoveGrab - redirect user input to a modal widget

SYNTAX
       void XtAddGrab(Widget w, Boolean exclusive, Boolean spring_loaded);

       void XtRemoveGrab(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       exclusive Specifies whether user events should be dispatched exclusively
                 to this widget or also to previous widgets in the cascade.

       spring_loaded
                 Specifies whether this widget was popped up because the user
                 pressed a pointer button.

       w         Specifies the widget to add to or remove from the modal cas&#8208;
                 cade.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAddGrab function appends the widget (and associated parameters) to
       the modal cascade and checks that exclusive is True if spring_loaded is
       True.  If these are not True, XtAddGrab generates an error.

       The modal cascade is used by XtDispatchEvent when it tries to dispatch a
       user event.  When at least one modal widget is in the widget cascade,
       XtDispatchEvent first determines if the event should be delivered.  It
       starts at the most recent cascade entry and follows the cascade up to and
       including the most recent cascade entry added with the exclusive parame&#8208;
       ter True.

       This subset of the modal cascade along with all descendants of these wid&#8208;
       gets comprise the active subset.  User events that occur outside the wid&#8208;
       gets in this subset are ignored or remapped.  Modal menus with submenus
       generally add a submenu widget to the cascade with exclusive False.
       Modal dialog boxes that need to restrict user input to the most deeply
       nested dialog box add a subdialog widget to the cascade with exclusive
       True.  User events that occur within the active subset are delivered to
       the appropriate widget, which is usually a child or further descendant of
       the modal widget.

       Regardless of where on the screen they occur, remap events are always
       delivered to the most recent widget in the active subset of the cascade
       that has spring_loaded True, if any such widget exists.

       The XtRemoveGrab function removes widgets from the modal cascade starting
       at the most recent widget up to and including the specified widget.  It
       issues an error if the specified widget is not on the modal cascade.
