XtAppAddSignal(3)                 XT FUNCTIONS                 XtAppAddSignal(3)



NAME
       XtAppAddSignal, XtRemoveSignal, XtNoticeSignal - register and remove a
       signal source

SYNTAX
       XtSignalId XtAppAddSignal(XtAppContext app_context, XtSignalCallbackProc
              proc, XtPointer client_data);

       void XtRemoveSignal(XtSignalId id);

       void XtNoticeSignal(XtSignalId id);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context.

       client_data
                 Specifies the argument that is to be passed to the specified
                 procedure when a signal has been raised.

       id        Specifies the ID returned from the corresponding XtAppAddSignal
                 call.

       proc      Specifies the procedure that is to be called when the signal
                 has been raised.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAppAddSignal function initiates a mechanism for handling signals
       within the context of the Intrinsics. Prior to establishing an operating
       system dependent signal handler the application may call XtAppAddSignal
       and store the returned id in a place accessible to the signal handler.

       Upon receipt of a signal from the operating system, the application may
       call XtNoticeSignal passing the id returned by the call to XtAppAdd&#8208;
       Signal.

       XtNoticeSignal is the only Intrinsics function that can safely be called
       from a signal handler. If XtNoticeSignal is called multiple times before
       the Intrinsics are able to invoke the registered callback, the callback
       is only called once. Logically the Intrinsics maintain ``pending&apos;&apos; for
       each registered callback. This flag is initially False and is set to True
       by XtNoticeSignal; the Intrinsics invoke the callback whenever the flag
       is True, and the flag is set to False just before the callback is
       invoked.

       The XtRemoveSignal function is called to remove the specified Intrinsics
       signal handler. The client should disable the source of the signal before
       calling XtRemoveSignal.
