NAME
       XtResolvePathname - search for a file using standard substitution

SYNTAX
       String XtResolvePathname(Display *display, String type, String filename,
              String suffix, String path, Substitution substitutions, Cardinal
              num_substitutions, XtFilePredicate predicate);

ARGUMENTS
       display     Specifies the display to use to find the language for lan&#8208;
                   guage substitutions.

       type
       filename
       suffix      Specify values to substitute into the path.

       path        Specifies the list of file specifications, or NULL.

       substitutions
                   Specifies a list of additional substitutions to make into the
                   path, or NULL.

       num_substitutions
                   Specifies the number of entries in substitutions.

       predicate   Specifies a procedure called to judge each potential file
                   name, or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       The substitutions specified by XtResolvePathname are determined from the
       value of the language string retrieved by XtDisplayInitialize for the
       specified display.  To set the language for all applications specify
       ``*xnlLanguage: lang&apos;&apos; in the resource database.  The format and content
       of the language string are implementation-defined.   One suggested syntax
       is to compose the language string of three parts;  a  ``language  part&apos;&apos;,
       a ``territory  part&apos;&apos; and a ``codeset part&apos;&apos;.  The manner in which this
       composition is accomplished is implementation-defined and the Intrinsics
       make no interpretation of the parts other than to use them in substitu&#8208;
       tions as described below.

       XtResolvePathname calls XtFindFile with the following substitutions in
       addition to any passed by the caller and returns the value returned by
       XtFindFile:

       %N   The value of the filename parameter, or the application&apos;s class name
            if filename is NULL.

       %T   The value of the type parameter.

       %S   The value of the suffix parameter.

       %L   The language string associated with the specified display.

       %l   The language part of the display&apos;s language string.

       %t   The territory part of the display&apos;s language string.

       %c   The codeset part of the display&apos;s language string.

       %C   The customization string retrieved from the resource database asso&#8208;
            ciated with display.
&#12;       %D   The value of the implementation-specific default path.

       If a path is passed to XtResolvePathname, it will be passed along to
       XtFindFile.  If the path argument is NULL, the value of the XFILESEARCH&#8208;
       PATH environment variable will be passed to XtFindFile.  If XFILESEARCH&#8208;
       PATH is not defined, an implementation-specific default path will be used
       which contains at least 6 entries.  These entries must contain the fol&#8208;
       lowing substitutions:

       1. %C, %N, %S, %T, %L  or  %C, %N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c
       2. %C, %N, %S, %T, %l
       3. %C, %N, %S, %T
       4. %N, %S, %T, %L      or  %N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c
       5. %N, %S, %T, %l
       6. %N, %S, %T

       The order of these six entries within the path must be as given above.
       The order and use of substitutions within a given entry is implementation
       dependent.  If the path begins with a colon, it will be preceded by %N%S.
       If the path includes two adjacent colons, %N%S will be inserted between
       them.

       The type parameter is intended to be a category of files, usually being
       translated into a directory in the pathname.  Possible values might
       include ``app-defaults&apos;&apos;, ``help&apos;&apos;, and ``bitmap&apos;&apos;.

       The suffix parameter is intended to be appended to the file name.  Possi&#8208;
       ble values might include ``.txt&apos;&apos;, ``.dat&apos;&apos;, and ``.bm&apos;&apos;.

       A suggested value for the default path on POSIX-based systems is

              /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:\
              /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:\
              /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S

       Using this example, if the user has specified a language, it will be used
       as a subdirectory of /usr/lib/X11 that will be searched for other files.
       If the desired file is not found there, the lookup will be tried again
       using just the language part of the specification.  If the file is not
       there, it will be looked for in /usr/lib/X11.  The type parameter is used
       as a subdirectory of the language directory or of /usr/lib/X11, and suf&#8208;
       fix is appended to the file name.

       The %D substitution allows the addition of path elements to the implemen&#8208;
       tation-specific default path, typically to allow additional directories
       to be searched without preventing resources in the system directories
       from being found.  For example, a user installing resource files under a
       directory called ``ourdir&apos;&apos; might set XFILESEARCHPATH to

              %D:ourdir/%T/%N%C:ourdir/%T/%N

       The customization string is obtained by querying the resource database
       currently associated with the display (the database returned by XrmGet&#8208;
       Database) for the resource application_name.customization, class applica&#8208;
       tion_class.Customization where application_name and application_class are
       the values returned by XtGetApplicationNameAndClass.  If no value is
       specified in the database, the empty string is used.

       It is the responsibility of the caller to free the returned string using
       XtFree when it is no longer needed.
