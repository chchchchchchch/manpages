XtSetKeyboardFocus(3)             XT FUNCTIONS             XtSetKeyboardFocus(3)



NAME
       XtSetKeyboardFocus - focus events on a child widget

SYNTAX
       XtSetKeyboardFocus(Widget subtree, Widget descendant);

ARGUMENTS
       subtree   Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is
                 to receive the keyboard event, or None.  Note that it is not an
                 error to specify None when no input focus was previously set.

       descendant
                 Specifies the widget for which the keyboard focus is to be set.

DESCRIPTION
       If a future KeyPress or KeyRelease event occurs within the specified sub&#8208;
       tree, XtSetKeyboardFocus causes XtDispatchEvent to remap and send the
       event to the specified descendant widget.

       When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can occur within a widget
       W in one of three ways:

       &#183;    W has the X input focus.

       &#183;    W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors, and the event
            occurs within the ancestor or one of the ancestor&apos;s descendants.

       &#183;    No ancestor of W has a descendant within the keyboard focus, and the
            pointer is within W.

       When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives keyboard events if an
       ancestor of W is in the active subset of the modal cascade and one or
       more of the previous conditions is True.

       When subtree or one of its descendants acquires the X input focus or the
       pointer moves into the subtree such that keyboard events would now be
       delivered to subtree, a FocusIn event is generated for the descendant if
       FocusNotify events have been selected by the descendant.  Similarly, when
       W loses the X input focus or the keyboard focus for one of its ancestors,
       a FocusOut event is generated for descendant if FocusNotify events have
       been selected by the descendant.
