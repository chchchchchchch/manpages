XtSetLanguageProc(3)              XT FUNCTIONS              XtSetLanguageProc(3)



NAME
       XtSetLanguageProc - set the language procedure

SYNTAX
       Widget XtSetLanguageProc(XtAppContext app_context, XtLanguageProc proc,
              XtPointer client_data);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context in which the language proce&#8208;
                 dure is to be used, or NULL.

       proc      Specifies the language procedure, or NULL.

       client_data
                 Specifies additional client data to be passed to the language
                 procedure when it is called.

DESCRIPTION
       XtSetLanguageProc sets the language procedure that will be called from
       XtDisplayInitialize for all subsequent Displays initialized in the speci&#8208;
       fied application context. If app_context is NULL, the specified language
       procedure is registered in all application contexts created by the call&#8208;
       ing process, including any future application contexts that may be cre&#8208;
       ated. If proc is NULL a default language procedure is registered.  XtSet&#8208;
       LanguageProc returns the previously registered language procedure. If a
       language procedure has not yet been registered, the return value is
       unspecified but if this return value is used in a subsequent call to
       XtSetLanguageProc, it will cause the default language procedure to be
       registered.

       The default language procedure does the following:

       &#183;    Sets the locale according to the environment. On ANSI C-based sys&#8208;
            tems this is done by calling setlocale( LC_ALL, language ). If an
            error is encountered a warning message is issued with XtWarning.

       &#183;    Calls XSupportsLocale to verify that the current locale is sup&#8208;
            ported. If the locale is not supported, a warning message is issued
            with XtWarning and the locale is set to ``C&apos;&apos;.

       &#183;    Calls XSetLocaleModifiers specifying the empty string.

       &#183;    Returns the value of the current locale. On ANSI C-based systems
            this is the return value from a final call to setlocale( LC_ALL,
            NULL ).

       A client wishing to use this mechanism to establish locale can do so by
       calling XtSetLanguageProc prior to XtDisplayInitialize.
