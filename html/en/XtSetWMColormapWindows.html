XtSetWMColormapWindows(3)         XT FUNCTIONS         XtSetWMColormapWindows(3)



NAME
       XtSetWMColormapWindows - Set the value of the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS prop&#8208;
       erty

SYNTAX
       void XtSetWMColormapWindows(Widget widget, Widget* list, Cardinal count);

ARGUMENTS
       widget    Specifies the widget on whose window the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS
                 property will be stored. Must be of class Core or any subclass
                 thereof.

       list      Specifies a list of widgets whose windows are are potentially
                 to be listed in the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.

       count     Specifies the number of widgets in list.

DESCRIPTION
       XtSetWMColormapWindows returns immediately if widget is not realized or
       if count is zero. Otherwise, XtSetWMColormapWindows constructs an ordered
       list of windows by examining each widget in list in turn and ignoring the
       widget if it is not realized, or adding the widget&apos;s window to the window
       list if the widget is realized and its colormap resource is different
       from the colormap resources of all widgets whose windows are already on
       the window list.

       Finally, XtSetWMColormapWindows stores the resulting window list in the
       WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the specified widget&apos;s window.
