XtToolkitThreadInitialize(3)      XT FUNCTIONS      XtToolkitThreadInitialize(3)



NAME
       XtToolkitThreadInitialize - initialize the toolkit for multiple threads

SYNTAX
       Boolean XtToolkitThreadInitialize(void);

DESCRIPTION
       If XtToolkitThreadInitialize was previously called, it returns. The
       application programmer must ensure that two or more threads do not simul&#8208;
       taneously attempt to call XtToolkitThreadInitialize; the effect of this
       is undefined.  XtToolkitThreadInitialize returns True if the host operat&#8208;
       ing system has threads and the Intrinsics are thread safe.
