DESCRIPTION
       The XtManageChildren function performs the following:

       &#183;    Issues an error if the children do not all have the same parent or
            if the parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass.

       &#183;    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed; other&#8208;
            wise, for each unique child on the list, XtManageChildren ignores
            the child if it already is managed or is being destroyed and marks
            it if not.

       &#183;    If the parent is realized and after all children have been marked,
            it makes some of the newly managed children viewable:

            -    Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets&apos; parent.

            -    Calls XtRealizeWidget on each previously unmanaged child that
                 is unrealized.

            -    Maps each previously unmanaged child that has map_when_managed
                 True.

       Managing children is independent of the ordering of children and indepen&#8208;
       dent of creating and deleting children.  The layout routine of the parent
       should consider children whose managed field is True and should ignore
       all other children.  Note that some composite widgets, especially fixed
       boxes, call XtManageChild from their insert_child procedure.

       If the parent widget is realized, its change_managed procedure is called
       to notify it that its set of managed children has changed.  The parent
       can reposition and resize any of its children.  It moves each child as
       needed by calling XtMoveWidget, which first updates the x and y fields
       and then calls XMoveWindow if the widget is realized.

       The XtManageChild function constructs a WidgetList of length one and
       calls XtManageChildren.

       The XtUnmanageChildren function performs the following:

       &#183;    Issues an error if the children do not all have the same parent or
            if the parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass.

       &#183;    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed; other&#8208;
            wise, for each unique child on the list, XtUnmanageChildren performs
            the following:

            -    Ignores the child if it already is unmanaged or is being
                 destroyed and marks it if not.

            -    If the child is realized, it makes it nonvisible by unmapping
                 it.

       &#183;    Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets&apos; parent after all
            children have been marked if the parent is realized.

       XtUnmanageChildren does not destroy the children widgets.  Removing wid&#8208;
       gets from a parent&apos;s managed set is often a temporary banishment, and,
       some time later, you may manage the children again.

       The XtUnmanageChild function constructs a widget list of length one and
       calls XtUnmanageChildren.

       The XtChangeManagedSet function performs the following:

       &#183;    Issues an error if the widgets specified in the manage_children and
            the unmanage_children lists to no all have the same parent, or if
            that parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass.

       &#183;    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed.

       &#183;    If no CompositeClassExtension is defined, or a CompositeClassExten&#8208;
            sion is defined but with an allows_change_managed_set field with a
            value of False, and XtChangeManagedSet was invoked with a non-NULL
            do_change_proc procedure then XtChangeManagedSet performs the fol&#8208;
            lowing:

            -    Calls XtUnmanageChildren (unmanage_children, num_unmanage_chil&#8208;
                 dren).

            -    Calls the do_change_proc specified.

            -    Calls XtManageChildren (manage_children, num_manage_children)
                 and then returns immediately.

       &#183;    Otherwise, if a CompositeClassExtension is defined with an
            allows_change_managed_set field with a value of True, or if no Com&#8208;
            positeClassExtension is defined, and XtChangeManagedSetwas
            do_change_proc procedure, then the following is performed:

            -    For each child on the unmanage_children list; if the child is
                 already unmanaged or is being destroyed it is ignored, other&#8208;
                 wise it is marked as being unmanaged and if it is realized it
                 is made nonvisible by being unmapped.

            -    If the do_change_proc procedure is non-NULL then it is invoked
                 as specified.

            -    For each child on the manage_children list; if the child is
                 already managed or it is being destroyed it is ignored, other&#8208;
                 wise it is marked as managed

       &#183;    If the parent is realized and after all children have been marked,
            the change_managed method of the parent is invoked and subsequently
            some of the newly managed children are made viewable by:

            -    Calling XtRealizeWidget on each of the previously unmanaged
                 child that is unrealized.

            -    Mapping each previously unmanaged child that has map_when_man&#8208;
                 aged True.

       The XtIsManaged function returns True if the specified widget is of class
       RectObj or any subclass thereof and is managed, or False otherwise.
