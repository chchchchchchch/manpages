XtRealizeWidget(3)                XT FUNCTIONS                XtRealizeWidget(3)



NAME
       XtRealizeWidget, XtIsRealized, XtUnrealizeWidget - realize and unrealize
       widgets

SYNTAX
       void XtRealizeWidget(Widget w);

       Boolean XtIsRealized(Widget w);

       void XtUnrealizeWidget(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       If the widget is already realized, XtRealizeWidget simply returns.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise, it performs the following:

       &#183;    Binds all action names in the widget&apos;s translation table to proce&#8208;
            dures (see Section 10.1.2).

       &#183;    Makes a post-order traversal of the widget tree rooted at the speci&#8208;
            fied widget and calls the change_managed procedure of each composite
            widget that has one or more managed children.

       &#183;    Constructs an XSetWindowAttributes structure filled in with informa&#8208;
            tion derived from the Core widget fields and calls the realize pro&#8208;
            cedure for the widget, which adds any widget-specific attributes and
            creates the X window.

       &#183;    If the widget is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass, XtRealize&#8208;
            Widget returns; otherwise, it continues and performs the following:

            -    Descends recursively to each of the widget&apos;s managed children
                 and calls the realize procedures.  Primitive widgets that
                 instantiate children are responsible for realizing those chil&#8208;
                 dren themselves.

            -    Maps all of the managed children windows that have
                 mapped_when_managed True.  (If a widget is managed but
                 mapped_when_managed is False, the widget is allocated visual
                 space but is not displayed.  Some people seem to like this to
                 indicate certain states.)

       If the widget is a top-level shell widget (that is, it has no parent),
       and mapped_when_managed is True, XtRealizeWidget maps the widget window.

       The XtIsRealized function returns True if the widget has been realized,
       that is, if the widget has a nonzero X window ID.

       Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might wish to operate
       differently after the widget has been realized.

       The XtUnrealizeWidget function destroys the windows of an existing widget
       and all of its children (recursively down the widget tree).  To recreate
       the windows at a later time, call XtRealizeWidget again.  If the widget
       was managed, it will be unmanaged automatically before its window is
       freed.
