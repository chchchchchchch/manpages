XtGetApplicationResources(3)      XT FUNCTIONS      XtGetApplicationResources(3)



NAME
       XtGetApplicationResources, XtVaGetApplicationResources - obtain applica&#8208;
       tion resources

SYNTAX
       void XtGetApplicationResources(Widget w, XtPointer base, XtResourceList
              resources, Cardinal num_resources, ArgList args, Cardinal
              num_args);

       void XtVaGetApplicationResources(Widget w, XtPointer base, XtResourceList
              resources, Cardinal num_resources, ...);

ARGUMENTS
       args      Specifies the argument list to override resources obtained from
                 the resource database.

       base      Specifies the base address of the subpart data structure where
                 the resources should be written.

       num_args  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument list.

       num_resources
                 Specifies the number of resources in the resource list.

       resources Specifies the resource list for the subpart.

       w         Specifies the widget that wants resources for a subpart or that
                 identifies the resource database to search.

       ...       Specifies the variable arguments to override resources obtained
                 from the resource database.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtGetApplicationResources function first uses the passed widget,
       which is usually an application shell, to construct a resource name and
       class list, Then, it retrieves the resources from the argument list, the
       resource database, or the resource list default values.  After adding
       base to each address, XtGetApplicationResources copies the resources into
       the address given in the resource list.  If args is NULL, num_args must
       be zero.  However, if num_args is zero, the argument list is not refer&#8208;
       enced.  The portable way to specify application resources is to declare
       them as members of a structure and pass the address of the structure as
       the base argument.
