XmbResetIC(3)                    XLIB FUNCTIONS                    XmbResetIC(3)



NAME
       XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC, Xutf8ResetIC - reset the state of an input con&#8208;
       text

SYNTAX
       char *XmbResetIC(XIC ic);

       wchar_t *XwcResetIC(XIC ic);

       char *Xutf8ResetIC(XIC ic);

ARGUMENTS
       ic        Specifies the input context.

DESCRIPTION
       When XNResetState is set to XIMInitialState, XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC and
       Xutf8ResetIC reset an input context to its initial state; when XNReset&#8208;
       State is set to XIMPreserveState, the current input context state is pre&#8208;
       served.  In both cases, any input pending on that context is deleted.
       The input method is required to clear the preedit area, if any, and
       update the status accordingly.  Calling XmbResetIC, XwcResetIC or
       Xutf8ResetIC does not change the focus.

       The return value of XmbResetIC is its current preedit string as a multi&#8208;
       byte string.  The return value of XwcResetIC is its current preedit
       string as a wide character string.  The return value of Xutf8ResetIC is
       its current preedit string as an UTF-8 string.  If there is any preedit
       text drawn or visible to the user, then these procedures must return a
       non-NULL string.  If there is no visible preedit text, then it is input
       method implementation-dependent whether these procedures return a non-
       NULL string or NULL.

       The client should free the returned string by calling XFree.

       The function Xutf8ResetIC is an extension introduced by The XFree86
       Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2 release. Its presence is indicated by the
       macro X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.
