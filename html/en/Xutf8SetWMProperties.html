DESCRIPTION
       The XSetWMProperties convenience function provides a single programming
       interface for setting those essential window properties that are used for
       communicating with other clients (particularly window and session man&#8208;
       agers).

       If the window_name argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSetWM&#8208;
       Name, which in turn, sets the WM_NAME property (see section 14.1.4).  If
       the icon_name argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSetWMIcon&#8208;
       Name, which sets the WM_ICON_NAME property (see section 14.1.5).  If the
       argv argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSetCommand, which sets
       the WM_COMMAND property (see section 14.2.1).  Note that an argc of zero
       is allowed to indicate a zero-length command.  Note also that the host&#8208;
       name of this machine is stored using XSetWMClientMachine (see section
       14.2.2).

       If the normal_hints argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSetWM&#8208;
       NormalHints, which sets the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property (see section
       14.1.7).  If the wm_hints argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls
       XSetWMHints, which sets the WM_HINTS property (see section 14.1.6).
&#12;       If the class_hints argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSet&#8208;
       ClassHint, which sets the WM_CLASS property (see section 14.1.8).  If the
       res_name member in the XClassHint structure is set to the NULL pointer
       and the RESOURCE_NAME environment variable is set, then the value of the
       environment variable is substituted for res_name.  If the res_name member
       is NULL, the environment variable is not set, and argv and argv[0] are
       set, then the value of argv[0], stripped of any directory prefixes, is
       substituted for res_name.

       The XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties convenience functions
       provide a simple programming interface for setting those essential window
       properties that are used for communicating with other clients (particu&#8208;
       larly window and session managers).

       If the window_name argument is non-NULL, they set the WM_NAME property.
       If the icon_name argument is non-NULL, they set the WM_ICON_NAME prop&#8208;
       erty.  The window_name and icon_name arguments are null-terminated
       strings, for XmbSetWMProperties in the encoding of the current locale,
       for Xutf8SetWMProperties in UTF-8 encoding.  If the arguments can be
       fully converted to the STRING encoding, the properties are created with
       type ``STRING&apos;&apos;; otherwise, the arguments are converted to Compound Text,
       and the properties are created with type ``COMPOUND_TEXT&apos;&apos;.

       If the normal_hints argument is non-NULL, XmbSetWMProperties and
       Xutf8SetWMProperties call XSetWMNormalHints, which sets the WM_NOR&#8208;
       MAL_HINTS property (see section 14.1.7).  If the wm_hints argument is
       non-NULL, XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties call XSetWMHints,
       which sets the WM_HINTS property (see section 14.1.6).

       If the argv argument is non-NULL, XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProp&#8208;
       erties set the WM_COMMAND property from argv and argc.  An argc of zero
       indicates a zero-length command.

       The hostname of the machine is stored using XSetWMClientMachine (see sec&#8208;
       tion 14.2.2).

       If the class_hints argument is non-NULL, XmbSetWMProperties and
       Xutf8SetWMProperties set the WM_CLASS property.  If the res_name member
       in the XClassHint structure is set to the NULL pointer and the
       RESOURCE_NAME environment variable is set, the value of the environment
       variable is substituted for res_name.  If the res_name member is NULL,
       the environment variable is not set, and argv and argv[0] are set, then
       the value of argv[0], stripped of any directory prefixes, is substituted
       for res_name.

       It is assumed that the supplied class_hints.res_name and argv, the
       RESOURCE_NAME environment variable, and the hostname of the machine are
       in the encoding of the current locale.  The corresponding WM_CLASS,
       WM_COMMAND, and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE properties are typed according to the
       local host locale announcer.  No encoding conversion is performed for
       these strings prior to storage in the properties.

       For clients that need to process the property text in a locale, XmbSetWM&#8208;
       Properties and Xutf8SetWMProperties set the WM_LOCALE_NAME property to be
       the name of the current locale.  The name is assumed to be in the Host
       Portable Character Encoding and is converted to STRING for storage in the
       property.

       XSetWMProperties, XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties can gener&#8208;
       ate BadAlloc and BadWindow errors.

       The function Xutf8SetWMProperties is an extension introduced by The
       XFree86 Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2 release. Its presence is indicated
       by the macro X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.

PROPERTIES
       WM_CLASS  Set by application programs to allow window and session man&#8208;
                 agers to obtain the application&apos;s resources from the resource
                 database.

       WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
                 The string name of the machine on which the client application
                 is running.

       WM_COMMAND
                 The command and arguments, null-separated, used to invoke the
                 application.

       WM_HINTS  Additional hints set by the client for use by the window man&#8208;
                 ager.  The C type of this property is XWMHints.

       WM_ICON_NAME
                 The name to be used in an icon.

       WM_NAME   The name of the application.

       WM_NORMAL_HINTS
                 Size hints for a window in its normal state.  The C type of
                 this property is XSizeHints.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server
                 memory.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
