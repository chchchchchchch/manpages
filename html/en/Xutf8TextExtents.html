XmbTextExtents(3)                XLIB FUNCTIONS                XmbTextExtents(3)



NAME
       XmbTextExtents, XwcTextExtents, Xutf8TextExtents - compute text extents

SYNTAX
       int XmbTextExtents(XFontSet font_set, char *string, int num_bytes, XRect&#8208;
              angle *overall_ink_return, XRectangle *overall_logical_return);

       int XwcTextExtents(XFontSet font_set, wchar_t *string, int num_wchars,
              XRectangle *overall_ink_return, XRectangle *overall_logi&#8208;
              cal_return);

       int Xutf8TextExtents(XFontSet font_set, char *string, int num_bytes,
              XRectangle *overall_ink_return, XRectangle *overall_logi&#8208;
              cal_return);

ARGUMENTS
       font_set  Specifies the font set.

       num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes in the string argument.

       num_wchars
                 Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.

       overall_ink_return
                 Returns the overall ink dimensions.

       overall_logical_return
                 Returns the overall logical dimensions.

       string    Specifies the character string.

DESCRIPTION
       The XmbTextExtents, XwcTextExtents and Xutf8TextExtents functions set the
       components of the specified overall_ink_return and overall_logical_return
       arguments to the overall bounding box of the string&apos;s image and a logical
       bounding box for spacing purposes, respectively.  They return the value
       returned by XmbTextEscapement, XwcTextEscapement or Xutf8TextEscapement.
       These metrics are relative to the drawing origin of the string, using the
       fonts loaded for the specified font set.

       If the overall_ink_return argument is non-NULL, it is set to the bounding
       box of the string&apos;s character ink.  The overall_ink_return for a nonde&#8208;
       scending, horizontally drawn Latin character is conventionally entirely
       above the baseline; that is, overall_ink_return.height &lt;= -over&#8208;
       all_ink_return.y.  The overall_ink_return for a nonkerned character is
       entirely at, and to the right of, the origin; that is, over&#8208;
       all_ink_return.x &gt;= 0.  A character consisting of a single pixel at the
       origin would set overall_ink_return fields y = 0, x = 0, width = 1, and
       height = 1.

       If the overall_logical_return argument is non-NULL, it is set to the
       bounding box that provides minimum spacing to other graphical features
       for the string.  Other graphical features, for example, a border sur&#8208;
       rounding the text, should not intersect this rectangle.

       When the XFontSet has missing charsets, metrics for each unavailable
       character are taken from the default string returned by XCreateFontSet so
       that the metrics represent the text as it will actually be drawn.  The
       behavior for an invalid codepoint is undefined.

       The function Xutf8TextExtents is an extension introduced by The XFree86
       Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2 release. Its presence is indicated by the
       macro X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.
