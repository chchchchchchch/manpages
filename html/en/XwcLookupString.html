XmbLookupString(3)               XLIB FUNCTIONS               XmbLookupString(3)



NAME
       XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString, Xutf8LookupString - obtain composed
       input from an input method

SYNTAX
       int XmbLookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent *event, char *buffer_return,
              int bytes_buffer, KeySym *keysym_return, Status *status_return);

       int XwcLookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent *event, wchar_t *buf&#8208;
              fer_return, int wchars_buffer, KeySym *keysym_return, Status *sta&#8208;
              tus_return);

       int Xutf8LookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent *event, char *buf&#8208;
              fer_return, int bytes_buffer, KeySym *keysym_return, Status *sta&#8208;
              tus_return);

ARGUMENTS
       buffer_return
                 Returns a multibyte string or wide character string (if any)
                 from the input method.

       bytes_buffer
       wchars_buffer
                 Specifies space available in the return buffer.

       event     Specifies the key event to be used.

       ic        Specifies the input context.

       keysym_return
                 Returns the KeySym computed from the event if this argument is
                 not NULL.

       status_return
                 Returns a value indicating what kind of data is returned.

DESCRIPTION
       The XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString and Xutf8LookupString functions
       return the string from the input method specified in the buffer_return
       argument.  If no string is returned, the buffer_return argument is
       unchanged.

       The KeySym into which the KeyCode from the event was mapped is returned
       in the keysym_return argument if it is non-NULL and the status_return
       argument indicates that a KeySym was returned.  If both a string and a
       KeySym are returned, the KeySym value does not necessarily correspond to
       the string returned.

       XmbLookupString and Xutf8LookupString return the length of the string in
       bytes, and XwcLookupString returns the length of the string in charac&#8208;
       ters.  Both XmbLookupString and XwcLookupString return text in the encod&#8208;
       ing of the locale bound to the input method of the specified input con&#8208;
       text, and Xutf8LookupString returns text in UTF-8 encoding.

       Each string returned by XmbLookupString and XwcLookupString begins in the
       initial state of the encoding of the locale (if the encoding of the
       locale is state-dependent).

                                         Note

            &#174;To ensure proper input processing, it is essential that the
            client pass only KeyPress events to XmbLookupString, XwcLookup&#8208;
            String and Xutf8LookupString.  Their behavior when a client
            passes a KeyRelease event is undefined.


       Clients should check the status_return argument before using the other
       returned values.  These three functions each return a value to sta&#8208;
       tus_return that indicates what has been returned in the other arguments.
       The possible values returned are:

       lw(1.5i) lw(4.3i).  T{ XBufferOverflow T}   T{ The input string to be
       returned is too large for the supplied buffer_return.  The required size
       (for XmbLookupString, Xutf8LookupString in bytes; for XwcLookupString in
       characters) is returned as the value of the function, and the contents of
       buffer_return and keysym_return are not modified.  The client should
       recall the function with the same event and a buffer of adequate size to
       obtain the string.  T} T{ XLookupNone T}   T{ No consistent input has
       been composed so far.  The contents of buffer_return and keysym_return
       are not modified, and the function returns zero.  T} T{ XLookupChars
       T}   T{ Some input characters have been composed.  They are placed in the
       buffer_return argument, using the encoding described above, and the
       string length is returned as the value of the function.  The content of
       the keysym_return argument is not modified.  T} T{ XLookupKeySym T}   T{
       A KeySym has been returned instead of a string and is returned in
       keysym_return.  The content of the buffer_return argument is not modi&#8208;
       fied, and the function returns zero.  T} T{ XLookupBoth T}   T{ Both a
       KeySym and a string are returned; XLookupChars and XLookupKeySym occur
       simultaneously.  T}

       It does not make any difference if the input context passed as an argu&#8208;
       ment to XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString and Xutf8LookupString is the one
       currently in possession of the focus or not.  Input may have been com&#8208;
       posed within an input context before it lost the focus, and that input
       may be returned on subsequent calls to XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString
       or Xutf8LookupString even though it does not have any more keyboard
       focus.

       The function Xutf8LookupString is an extension introduced by The XFree86
       Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2 release. Its presence is indicated by the
       macro X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.
