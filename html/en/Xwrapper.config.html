NAME
       Xwrapper.config - configuration options for X server wrapper

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config  contains  a set of flags that determine some of
       the behavior of Debian&apos;s X server wrapper, which is installed on the sys&#8208;
       tem as /usr/bin/X.  The purpose of the wrapper, and of this configuration
       file, is twofold.

       Firstly, it is intended to implement sound security practices.  Since the
       X  server  requires superuser privileges, it may be unwise to permit just
       any user on the system to execute it.   Even  if  the  X  server  is  not
       exploitable  in  the  sense of permitting ordinary users to gain elevated
       privileges, a poorly-written or insufficiently-tested hardware driver for
       the  X  server may cause bus lockups and freeze the system, an unpleasant
       experience for anyone using it at the time.

       Secondly, a wrapper is a convenient place to set up an execution environ&#8208;
       ment  for the X server distinct from the configurable parameters of the X
       server itself.

       Xwrapper.config may be edited by hand, but it is typically configured via
       debconf(7),  the Debian configuration tool.  The X server wrapper is part
       of the x11-common Debian package; therefore,  the  parameters  of  Xwrap&#8208;
       per.config may be changed with the command
              dpkg-reconfigure x11-common.
       See dpkg-reconfigure(8) for more information.

       The format of Xwrapper.config is a text file containing a series of lines
       of the form

       name=value

       where name is a variable name containing any combination of numbers, let&#8208;
       ters,  or underscore (_) characters, and value is any combination of let&#8208;
       ters, numbers, underscores (_), or dashes (-).  value  may  also  contain
       spaces  as  long  as  there is at least one character from the list above
       bounding the space(s) on both sides.  Whitespace before and  after  name,
       value,  or  the equals sign is legal but ignored.  Any lines not matching
       the above described legal format are ignored.  Note that this  specifica&#8208;
       tion may change as the X server wrapper develops.

       Available options are:

       allowed_users
              may  be  set to one of the following values: rootonly, console, or
              anybody.  rootonly indicates that only the root user may start the
              X  server; console indicates that root, or any user whose control&#8208;
              ling TTY is a virtual console, may start the X server; and anybody
              indicates that any user may start the X server.

       The X server wrapper was written by Stephen Early, Mark Eichin, and Bran&#8208;

       Erik Troan, Topi Miettinen, and Colin Phipps.  This manual page was writ&#8208;
