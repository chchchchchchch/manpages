YAML::Syck(3pm)        User Contributed Perl Documentation       YAML::Syck(3pm)



NAME
       YAML::Syck - Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper

SYNOPSIS
           use YAML::Syck;

           # Set this for interoperability with other YAML/Syck bindings:
           # e.g. Load(&apos;Yes&apos;) becomes 1 and Load(&apos;No&apos;) becomes &apos;&apos;.
           $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;

           $data = Load($yaml);
           $yaml = Dump($data);

           # $file can be an IO object, or a filename
           $data = LoadFile($file);
           DumpFile($file, $data);

           # A string with multiple YAML streams in it
           $yaml = Dump(@data);
           @data = Load($yaml);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface to the libsyck data serialization
       library.  It exports the &quot;Dump&quot; and &quot;Load&quot; functions for converting Perl
       data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

       NOTE: If you are working with other language&apos;s YAML/Syck bindings (such
       as Ruby), please set $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping to 1 before calling the
       &quot;Load&quot;/&quot;Dump&quot; functions.  The default setting is for preserving backward-
       compatibility with &quot;YAML.pm&quot;.

Differences Between YAML::Syck and YAML
   Error handling
       Some calls are designed to die rather than returning YAML. You should
       wrap your calls in eval to assure you do not get unexpected results.

FLAGS
   $YAML::Syck::Headless
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make &quot;Dump&quot; omit
       the leading &quot;---\n&quot; marker.

   $YAML::Syck::SortKeys
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make &quot;Dump&quot; sort
       hash keys.

   $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make &quot;Dump&quot; always
       emit single quotes instead of bare strings.

   $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make &quot;Load&quot;
       recognize various implicit types in YAML, such as unquoted &quot;true&quot;,
       &quot;false&quot;, as well as integers and floating-point numbers.  Otherwise, only
       &quot;~&quot; is recognized to be &quot;undef&quot;.

   $YAML::Syck::ImplicitUnicode
       Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value
       will make &quot;Load&quot; set Unicode flag on for every string that contains valid
       UTF8 sequences, and make &quot;Dump&quot; return a unicode string.

       Regardless of this flag, Unicode strings are dumped verbatim without
       escaping; byte strings with high-bit set will be dumped with backslash
       escaping.

       However, because YAML does not distinguish between these two kinds of
       strings, so this flag will affect loading of both variants of strings.

       If you want to use LoadFile or DumpFile with unicode, you are required to
       open your own file in order to assure it&apos;s UTF8 encoded:

         open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;, &quot;out.yml&quot;);
         DumpFile($fh, $hashref);

   $YAML::Syck::ImplicitBinary
       Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value
       will make &quot;Dump&quot; generate Base64-encoded &quot;!!binary&quot; data for all non-
       Unicode scalars containing high-bit bytes.

   $YAML::Syck::UseCode / $YAML::Syck::LoadCode / $YAML::Syck::DumpCode
       These flags control whether or not to try and eval/deparse perl source
       code; each of them defaults to false.

       Setting $YAML::Syck::UseCode to a true value is equivalent to setting
       both $YAML::Syck::LoadCode and $YAML::Syck::DumpCode to true.

   $YAML::Syck::LoadBlessed
       Defaults to true. Setting this to a false value will prevent &quot;Load&quot; from
       blessing tag names that do not begin with &quot;!!perl&quot; or &quot;!perl&quot;; see below.

BUGS
       Dumping Glob/IO values do not work yet.

       Dumping of Tied variables is unsupported.

CAVEATS
       This module implements the YAML 1.0 spec.  To deal with data in YAML 1.1,
       please use the &quot;YAML::XS&quot; module instead.

       The current implementation bundles libsyck source code; if your system
       has a site-wide shared libsyck, it will not be used.

       Tag names such as &quot;!!perl/hash:Foo&quot; is blessed into the package &quot;Foo&quot;,
       but the &quot;!hs/foo&quot; and &quot;!!hs/Foo&quot; tags are blessed into &quot;hs::Foo&quot;.  Note
       that this holds true even if the tag contains non-word characters; for
       example, &quot;!haskell.org/Foo&quot; is blessed into &quot;haskell.org::Foo&quot;.  Please
       use Class::Rebless to cast it into other user-defined packages. You can
       also set the LoadBlessed flag false to disable blessing tag names that do
       not begin with &quot;!!perl&quot; or &quot;!perl&quot;.

       This module has a lot of known issues
       &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=YAML-Syck&gt; and has
       only been semi-actively maintained since 2007. If you encounter an issue
       with it probably won&apos;t be fixed unless you offer up a patch
       &lt;http://github.com/avar/YAML-Syck&gt; in Git that&apos;s ready for release.

       There are still good reasons to use this module, such as better
       interoperability with other syck wrappers (like Ruby&apos;s), or some edge
       case of YAML&apos;s syntax that it handles better. It&apos;ll probably work
       perfectly for you, but if it doesn&apos;t you may want to look at YAML::XS, or
       perhaps at looking another serialization format like JSON.
