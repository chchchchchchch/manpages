__SETFPUCW(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              __SETFPUCW(3)



NAME
       __setfpucw - set FPU control word on i386 architecture (obsolete)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;i386/fpu_control.h&gt;

       void __setfpucw(unsigned short control_word);

DESCRIPTION
       __setfpucw()  transfers  control_word to the registers of the FPU (float&#8208;
       ing-point unit) on the i386  architecture.   This  was  used  to  control
       floating-point precision, rounding and floating-point exceptions.

CONFORMING TO
       This function was a nonstandard GNU extension.

NOTES
       As  of  glibc  2.1  this  function does not exist anymore.  There are new
       functions from C99, with prototypes in &lt;fenv.h&gt;, to control FPU  rounding
       modes,  like  fegetround, fesetround, and the floating-point environment,
       like fegetenv, feholdexcept, fesetenv, feupdateenv and FPU exception han&#8208;
       dling,  like  feclearexcept, fegetexceptflag, feraiseexcept, fesetexcept&#8208;
       flag, fetestexcept.

       If direct access to the FPU control word is still needed, the  _FPU_GETCW
       and _FPU_SETCW macros from &lt;fpu_control.h&gt; can be used.

EXAMPLE
       __setfpucw(0x1372)

       Set FPU control word on the i386 architecture to
            - extended precision
            - rounding to nearest
            - exceptions on overflow, zero divide and NaN
