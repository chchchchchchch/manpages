LLSEEK(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  LLSEEK(2)



NAME
       _llseek - reposition read/write file offset

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int _llseek(unsigned int fd, unsigned long offset_high,
                   unsigned long offset_low, loff_t *result,
                   unsigned int whence);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The _llseek() function repositions the offset of the open file associated
       with the file descriptor fd to (offset_high&lt;&lt;32) | offset_low bytes rela&#8208;
       tive  to  the beginning of the file, the current position in the file, or
       the end of the file, depending on whether whence is  SEEK_SET,  SEEK_CUR,
       or SEEK_END, respectively.  It returns the resulting file position in the
       argument result.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, _llseek() returns 0.  Otherwise, a  value  of
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not an open file descriptor.

       EFAULT Problem with copying results to user space.

       EINVAL whence is invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  Linux-specific,  and  should  not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this  system  call;  call  it  using
       syscall(2).
