AALIB(1)                                                                AALIB(1)



NAME
       aalib-config  -  script to get information about the installed version of
       aalib

SYNOPSIS
       aalib-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version]  [--libs]
       [--static-libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       aalib-config  is  a  tool that is used to configure to determine the com&#8208;
       piler and linker flags that should be used to compile and  link  programs
       that  use  aalib.  It  is  also used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU
       autoconf that are included with aalib.

OPTIONS
       aalib-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of aalib  on  the  standard
               output.

       --libs  Print  the  linker  flags that are necessary to link a aalib pro&#8208;
               gram.

       --static-libs
               Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a aalib program
               statically.

       --cflags
               Print  the  compiler  flags that are necessary to compile a aalib
               program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix  that
               aalib  was  built with when computing the output for the --cflags
               and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec  prefix
               if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec  prefix
               that  aalib  was  built  with  when  computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs  options.   This  option  must  be  specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
