HISTORY
       AbiWord was started in 1998 by  AbiSource  Inc.,  a  company  founded  by
       SourceGear corporation. The initial plan was to build a free office suite
       named AbiSuite, encompassing word processing, spreadsheet  and  presenta&#8208;
       tion  applications.  As they didn&apos;t have a usable product when their ven&#8208;
       ture capital was up, the code already developed (namely AbiWord) was made
       open  source.   AbiWord development was subsequently taken over by volun&#8208;
       teers and is driven by the community to date.



AbiWord 2.9                        2012-04-26                         ABIWORD(1)
