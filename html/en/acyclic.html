ACYCLIC(1)                                                            ACYCLIC(1)



NAME
       acyclic - make directed graph acyclic

SYNOPSIS
       acyclic [ -nv?  ] [ -o outfile ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       acyclic  is  a  filter that takes a directed graph as input and outputs a
       copy of the graph with  sufficient  edges  reversed  to  make  the  graph
       acyclic. The reversed edge inherits all of the attributes of the original
       edge. The optional file argument specifies where the the input  graph  is
       stored; by default, the program reads from stdin.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -n     No  output  is  produced,  though  the  return value will indicate
              whether the graph is acyclic or not.

       -v     Print information about whether the file is acyclic, has  a  cycle
              or is undirected.

       -o outfile
              causes the output to be written to the specified file; by default,
              output is written to stdout.

       -?     option causes the program to print usage information.

RETURN CODES
       acyclic returns 0 if the graph is acyclic; 1 if the graph has a cycle;  2
       if the graph is undirected; and 255 if there are any errors.

BUGS
       If  the  graph is strict and there is a cycle of length 2, the attributes
       of the reversed edge are lost.

       Some edge attributes are non-symmetric, referring to either the  head  or
       tail  node. At present, there is no mechanism or convention for correctly
       switching or renaming these.
