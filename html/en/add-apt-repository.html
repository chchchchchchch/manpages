NAME
       add-apt-repository  - Adds a repository into the /etc/apt/sources.list or
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d or removes an existing one

SYNOPSIS
       add-apt-repository [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY

DESCRIPTION
       add-apt-repository is a script which adds an external APT  repository  to
       either  /etc/apt/sources.list  or  a  file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or
       removes an already existing repository.

       The options supported by add-apt-repository are:

       -h, --help Show help message and exit

       -r, --remove Remove the specified repository

       -y, --yes Assume yes to all queries

       -k, --keyserver Use a custom keyserver URL instead of the default



REPOSITORY STRING
       REPOSITORY  can  be  either  a  line  that  can  be  added  directly   to
       sources.list(5), or in the form ppa:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;ppa-name&gt; for adding Personal
       Package Archives.

       In   the   first   form,   REPOSITORY   will   just   be   appended    to
       /etc/apt/sources.list.

       In  the  second  form, ppa:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;ppa-name&gt; will be expanded to the full
       deb  line  of  the   PPA   and   added   into   a   new   file   in   the
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  directory.   The  GPG  public  key of the newly
       added PPA will also be downloaded and added to apt&apos;s keyring.
