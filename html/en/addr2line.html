NAME
       addr2line - convert addresses into file names and line numbers.

SYNOPSIS
       addr2line [-a|--addresses]
                 [-b bfdname|--target=bfdname]
                 [-C|--demangle[=style]]
                 [-e filename|--exe=filename]
                 [-f|--functions] [-s|--basename]
                 [-i|--inlines]
                 [-p|--pretty-print]
                 [-j|--section=name]
                 [-H|--help] [-V|--version]
                 [addr addr ...]

DESCRIPTION
       addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers.  Given
       an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable
       object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name
       and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e
       option.  The default is the file a.out.  The section in the relocatable
       object to use is specified with the -j option.

       addr2line has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line,
       and addr2line displays the file name and line number for each address.

       In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses from standard input,
       and prints the file name and line number for each address on standard
       output.  In this mode, addr2line may be used in a pipe to convert
       dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  The file name and line
       number for each address is printed on a separate line.  If the -f option
       is used, then each FILENAME:LINENO line is preceded by a FUNCTIONNAME
       line which is the name of the function containing the address.  If the -a
       option is used, then the address read is first printed.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, addr2line will
       print two question marks in their place.  If the line number can not be
       determined, addr2line will print 0.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
       equivalent.

       -a
       --addresses
           Display address before function names or file and line number
           information.  The address is printed with a 0x prefix to easily
           identify it.

       -b bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is bfdname.

       -C
       --demangle[=style]
           Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
           Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
           makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can
           be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       -e filename
       --exe=filename
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
           translated.  The default file is a.out.

       -f
       --functions
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       -s
       --basenames
           Display only the base of each file name.

       -i
       --inlines
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
           information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-inlined
           function will also be printed.  For example, if &quot;main&quot; inlines
           &quot;callee1&quot; which inlines &quot;callee2&quot;, and address is from &quot;callee2&quot;, the
           source information for &quot;callee1&quot; and &quot;main&quot; will also be printed.

       -j
       --section
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute
           addresses.

       -p
       --pretty-print
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one
           line.  If option -i is specified, lines for all enclosing scopes are
           prefixed with (inlined by).

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
