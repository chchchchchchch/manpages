AFM2AFM(1)                        Marc Penninga                       AFM2AFM(1)



NAME
       afm2afm - reencode an afm file

SYNOPSIS
       afm2afm [-help] [-encoding encodingfile] [-output outputfile] afmfile

DESCRIPTION
       afm2afm re-encodes an afm file.

       Metrics (including kerning data) for characters not present in the chosen
       encoding are excluded from the output, which resuls in much smaller
       files.

       Note that if you don&apos;t specify an encoding file, the afm file isn&apos;t re-
       encoded, but the unused data is still pruned.

       The program also generates an entry for a dvips-style map file, but only
       if the afm file has been re-encoded and the output was written to file
       (i.e., if both the -encoding and -output options were specified).

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       -help
           Print a short description of the syntax

       -encoding encodingfile
           Re-encode to the enconding in encodingfile

       -output outputfile
           Write the result to outputfile instead of &quot;stdout&quot;.

       afmfile
           The afm file to be re-encoded.

       Option names may be shortened to a unique prefix.
