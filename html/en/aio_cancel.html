AIO_CANCEL(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              AIO_CANCEL(3)



NAME
       aio_cancel - cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O request

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_cancel(int fd, struct aiocb *aiocbp);

       Link with -lrt.

DESCRIPTION
       The aio_cancel() function attempts to cancel outstanding asynchronous I/O
       requests for the file  descriptor  fd.   If  aiocbp  is  NULL,  all  such
       requests are canceled.  Otherwise, only the request described by the con&#8208;
       trol block pointed to by aiocbp is canceled.  (See aio(7) for a  descrip&#8208;
       tion of the aiocb structure.)

       Normal asynchronous notification occurs for canceled requests (see aio(7)
       and sigevent(7)).  The request return status (aio_return(3))  is  set  to
       -1, and the request error status (aio_error(3)) is set to ECANCELED.  The
       control block of requests that cannot be canceled is not changed.

       If the request could not be canceled, then it will terminate in the usual
       way after performing the I/O operation.  (In this case, aio_error(3) will
       return the status EINPROGRESSS.)

       If aiocbp is not NULL, and fd differs from the file descriptor with which
       the asynchronous operation was initiated, unspecified results occur.

       Which operations are cancelable is implementation-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       The aio_cancel() function returns one of the following values:

       AIO_CANCELED
              All requests were successfully canceled.

       AIO_NOTCANCELED
              At least one of the requests specified was not canceled because it
              was in progress.  In this case, one may check the status of  indi&#8208;
              vidual requests using aio_error(3).

       AIO_ALLDONE
              All requests had already been completed before the call.

       -1     An  error  occurred.   The  cause  of  the  error  can be found by
              inspecting errno.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOSYS aio_cancel() is not implemented.

VERSIONS
       The aio_cancel() function is available since glibc 2.1.
