ALSACTL(1)                                                            ALSACTL(1)



NAME
       alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver


SYNOPSIS
       alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] &lt;card # or id or device&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       alsactl is used to control advanced settings for the ALSA soundcard driv&#8208;
       ers. It supports multiple soundcards. If your card has features that  you
       can&apos;t  seem  to  control  from  a mixer application, you have come to the
       right place.


COMMANDS
       store saves the current driver state for the selected  soundcard  to  the
       configuration file.

       restore loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the configura&#8208;
       tion file. If restoring fails (eventually partly),  the  init  action  is
       called.

       init tries to initialize all devices to a default state. If device is not
       known, error code 99 is returned.

       If no soundcards are specified, setup for all  cards  will  be  saved  or
       loaded.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags and commands.


       -d, --debug
              Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.


       -v, --version
              Print alsactl version number.


       -f, --file
              Select   the   configuration   file   to   use.   The  default  is
              /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.


       -F, --force
              Used with restore command.  Try to restore  the  matching  control
              elements as much as possible.  This option is set as default now.


       -g, --ignore
              Used  with  store and restore commands. Do not show &apos;No soundcards
              found&apos; and do not set an error exit code when soundcards  are  not
              installed.


       -P, --pedantic
              Used with restore command.  Don&apos;t restore mismatching control ele&#8208;
              ments.  This option was the old default behavior.


       -I, --no-init-fallback
              Don&apos;t initialize cards if restore fails.   Since  version  1.0.18,
              alsactl tries to initialize the card with the restore operation as
              default.  But this can cause incompatibility with the  older  ver&#8208;
              sion.  The caller may expect that the state won&apos;t be touched if no
              state file exists.  This option takes the restore behavior back to
              the older version by suppressing the initialization.


       -r, --runstate
              Save  restore  and  init state to this file. The file will contain
              only errors.  Errors are appended with the soundcard id to the end
              of file.


       -R, --remove
              Remove runstate file at first.


       -E, --env #=#
              Set  environment variable (useful for init action or you may over&#8208;
              ride ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read different or optimized configuration
              - may be useful for &quot;boot&quot; scripts).


       -i, --initfile #=#
              The    configuration    file    for   init.   By   default,   PRE&#8208;
              FIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.


FILES
       /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (or whatever file  you  specify  with  the  -f
       flag) is used to store current settings for your soundcards. The settings
       include all the usual soundcard mixer settings.  More  importantly,  als&#8208;
       actl  is  capable  of controlling other card-specific features that mixer
       apps usually don&apos;t know about.

       The configuration file is  generated  automatically  by  running  alsactl
       store.  Editing  the configuration file by hand may be necessary for some
       soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic mic  gain,  digital
       output, joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options, etc).
