MIXER VIEWS
       The top-left corner of alsamixer is the are to show some  basic  informa&#8208;
       tion:  the  card name, the mixer chip name, the current view mode and the
       currently selected mixer item.  When the  mixer  item  is  switched  off,
       [Off] is displayed in its name.

       Volume bars are located below the basic information area.  You can scroll
       left/right when all controls can&apos;t be put in a single screen.   The  name
       of  each  control is shown in the bottom below the volume bars.  The cur&#8208;
       rently selected item is drawn in red and/of emphasized.

       Each mixer control with volume capability shows a  box  and  the  current
       volume  filled  in  that box.  The volume percentages are displayed below
       the volume bar for left and right channels.  For a mono control, only one
       value is shown there.

       When  a  mixer  control  is turned off, M (mute) appears below the volume
       bar.  When it&apos;s turned on, O in green appears instead.   You  can  toggle
       the switch via m key.

       When  a  mixer  control  has capture capability, the capture flag appears
       below the volume bar, too.  When the capture is turned  off,  -------  is
       shown.   CAPTURE in red appears when the capture switch is turned on.  In
       addition, L and R letters appear in left and right side to indicate  that
       left and the right channels are turned on.

       Some  controls  have  the enumeration list, and don&apos;t show boxes but only
       texts which indicate the currently active item.  You can change the  item
       via up/down keys.


VIEW MODES
       alsamixer  has three view modes: playback, capture and all.  In the play&#8208;
       back view, only the controls related with playback are shown.  Similarly,
       only  the controls for capture (recording) are shown in the capture view.
       The all view mode shows all controls.  The current view mode is displayed
       in the top-left position together with the mixer name, etc.

       The  default  view  mode  is the playback view.  You can change it via -V
       option.

       Each view mode can be switched via keyboard commands, too.  See the  next
       section.


KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       alsamixer  recognizes  the  following  keyboard  commands  to control the
       soundcard.  Commands shown here in upper case can also be given in  lower
       case.  To be reminded of these keystrokes, hit the h key.


   General Controls
       The  Left and right arrow keys are used to select the channel (or device,
       depending on your preferred terminology). You can also use n (&quot;next&quot;) and
       p (&quot;previous&quot;).

       The  Up  and  Down  Arrows  control the volume for the currently selected
       device. You can also use + or - for the same purpose. Both the  left  and
       right  signals  are affected. For independent left and right control, see
       below.

       The B or = key adjusts the balance of volumes on left and right channels.

       M toggles muting for the current channel (both left and right).   If  the
       hardware  supports it, you can mute left and right independently by using
       , (or &lt;) and . (or &gt;) respectively.

       SPACE enables recording for the current channel. If  any  other  channels
       have  recording enabled, they will have their recording function disabled
       first. This only works for valid input channels, of course.

       L re-draws the screen.


   View Mode Controls
       Function keys are used to change view modes.  You can switch to the  help
       mode  and the proc info mode via F1 and F2 keys, respectively.  On termi&#8208;
       nals that can&apos;t use function keys like gnome-terminal, ? and /  keys  can
       be used alternatively for help and proc modes.

       F3,  F4  and F5 keys are used to switch to playback, capture and all view
       mode, respectively.  TAB key toggles the current view mode circularly.


   Quick Volume Changes
       PageUp increases volume by 5.

       PageDown decreases volume by 5.

       End sets volume to 0.

       You can also control left &amp; right levels for the current channel indepen&#8208;
       dently, as follows:

       [Q | W | E ]  -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]

       [Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]

       If the currently selected mixer channel is not a stereo channel, then all
       UP keys will work like W, and all DOWN keys will work like X.

       The number keys from 0 to 9 are to change the  absolute  volume  quickly.
       They correspond to 0 to 90% volume.


   Selecting the Sound Card
       You  can  select  another  sound card by pressing the F6 or S keys.  This
       will show a list of available sound cards to choose from, and an entry to
       enter the mixer device name by hand.


   Exiting
       Quit  the  program  with  ALT Q, or by hitting ESC.  Please note that you
       might need to hit ESC twice on some terminals since it&apos;s  regarded  as  a
       prefix key.

BUGS
       Some  terminal  emulators  (e.g.  nxterm)  may  not work quite right with
       ncurses, but that&apos;s their own damn fault. Plain old  xterm  seems  to  be
       fine.
