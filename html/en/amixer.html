AMIXER(1)                                                              AMIXER(1)



NAME
       amixer - command-line mixer for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       amixer [-option] [cmd]

DESCRIPTION
       amixer  allows  command-line  control of the mixer for the ALSA soundcard
       driver.  amixer supports multiple soundcards.

       amixer with no arguments will display the current mixer settings for  the
       default  soundcard  and  device.  This is a good way to see a list of the
       simple mixer controls you can use.


COMMANDS
       help   Shows syntax.


       info   Shows the information about a mixer device.


       scontrols
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls.


       scontents
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer  controls  with  their  con&#8208;
              tents.


       set or sset &lt;SCONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ...
              Sets  the  simple mixer control contents. The parameter can be the
              volume either as a percentage from 0% to 100% with % suffix, a  dB
              gain  with  dB  suffix (like -12.5dB), or an exact hardware value.
              The dB gain can be used only for the mixer elements with available
              dB information.  When plus(+) or minus(-) letter is appended after
              volume value, the volume is incremented or  decremented  from  the
              current value, respectively.

              The parameters cap, nocap, mute, unmute, toggle are used to change
              capture (recording) and muting for the group specified.

              The optional modifiers can be put as extra parameters  to  specify
              the stream direction or channels to apply.  The modifiers playback
              and capture specify the stream, and  the  modifiers  front,  rear,
              center, woofer are used to specify channels to be changed.

              A  simple  mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be
              controlled at a time.


       get or sget &lt;SCONTROL&gt;
              Shows the simple mixer control contents.

              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device  can  be
              controlled at a time.


       controls
              Shows a complete list of card controls.
&#12;
       contents
              Shows a complete list of card controls with their contents.


       cset &lt;CONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ...
              Sets  the  card  control contents. The identifier has these compo&#8208;
              nents: iface, name, index,  device,  subdevice,  numid.  The  next
              argument specifies the value of control.


       cget &lt;CONTROL&gt;
              Shows the card control contents. The identifier has same syntax as
              for the cset command.


OPTIONS
       -c card

              Select the card number to control. The device  name  created  from
              this parameter has syntax &apos;hw:N&apos; where N is specified card number.


       -D device

              Select  the  device  name  to control. The default control name is
              &apos;default&apos;.


       -s | --stdin

              Read from stdin and execute the command on each line sequentially.
              When  this  option is given, the command in command-line arguments
              is ignored.

              Only sset and cset are accepted.  Other commands are ignored.  The
              commands to unmatched ids are ignored without errors too.


       -h     Help: show syntax.

       -q     Quiet mode. Do not show results of changes.


EXAMPLES
       amixer -c 1 sset Line,0 80%,40% unmute cap
              will  set the second soundcard&apos;s left line input volume to 80% and
              right line input to 40%, unmute it, and select it as a source  for
              capture (recording).


       amixer -c 1 -- sset Master playback -20dB
              will  set  the  master volume of the second card to -20dB.  If the
              master has multiple channels, all channels are  set  to  the  same
              value.


       amixer -c 1 set PCM 2dB+
              will  increase  the  PCM volume of the second card with 2dB.  When
              both playback and capture volumes exist, this is applied  to  both
              volumes.


       amixer -c 2 cset iface=MIXER,name=&apos;Line Playback Volume&quot;,index=1 40%
              will  set  the third soundcard&apos;s second line playback volume(s) to
              40%


       amixer -c 2 cset numid=34 40%
              will set the 34th soundcard element to 40%
