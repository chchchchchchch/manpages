AMSTEX(1)                                                              AMSTEX(1)



NAME
       amstex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       amstex [first-line]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documenta&#8208;
       tion for this version of TeX can be found in  the  info  file  or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The AmSTeX language is described in the book The Joy of TeX.  AmSTeX is a
       TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX source program,  so  all
       the capabilities described in tex(1) are present.

       The  AmSTeX  macros encourage writers to think about the content of their
       documents, rather than the form.  The ideal, not always realized,  is  to
       have  no  formatting commands (like &#8220;switch to italic&#8221; or &#8220;skip 2 picas&#8221;)
       in the document at all; instead, everything is done  by  specific  markup
       instructions: &#8220;emphasize&#8221;, &#8220;start a section&#8221;.

       For  authors  more  familiar  with LaTeX, an AMS-supported package called
       amsmath.sty is available, among others.
