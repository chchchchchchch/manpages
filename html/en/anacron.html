ANACRON(8)                    Anacron Users&apos; Manual                   ANACRON(8)



NAME
       anacron - runs commands periodically

SYNOPSIS
       anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t anacrontab] [-S spooldir] [job] ...
       anacron [-S spooldir] -u [-t anacrontab] [job] ...
       anacron [-V|-h]
       anacron -T [-t anacrontab]

DESCRIPTION
       Anacron  can  be  used to execute commands periodically, with a frequency
       specified in days.  Unlike cron(8), it does not assume that  the  machine
       is  running  continuously.  Hence, it can be used on machines that aren&apos;t
       running 24 hours a day, to control daily, weekly, and monthly  jobs  that
       are usually controlled by cron.

       When  executed,  Anacron  reads a list of jobs from a configuration file,
       normally /etc/anacrontab (see anacrontab(5)).   This  file  contains  the
       list of jobs that Anacron controls.  Each job entry specifies a period in
       days, a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell command.

       For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been  executed  in  the
       last  n  days,  where  n  is  the period specified for that job.  If not,
       Anacron runs the job&apos;s shell command, after waiting  for  the  number  of
       minutes specified as the delay parameter.

       After  the command exits, Anacron records the date in a special timestamp
       file for that job, so it can know when to execute  it  again.   Only  the
       date is used for the time calculations.  The hour is not used.

       When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.

       Anacron  only  considers  jobs  whose  identifier,  as  specified  in the
       anacrontab matches any of the job command-line arguments.  The job  argu&#8208;
       ments  can  be shell wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your
       shell with adequate quoting).  Specifying no job arguments, is equivalent
       to specifying &quot;*&quot;  (That is, all jobs will be considered).

       Unless  the  -d  option  is given (see below), Anacron forks to the back&#8208;
       ground when it starts, and the parent process exits immediately.

       Unless the -s or -n options are given, Anacron  starts  jobs  immediately
       when  their delay is over.  The execution of different jobs is completely
       independent.

       If a job generates any output on its standard output or  standard  error,
       the  output  is  mailed to the user running Anacron (usually root), or to
       the address contained by the MAILTO environment variable in the  crontab,
       if  such  exists.  If the LOGNAME environment variable is set, it will be
       used as From: field.

       Informative messages about what Anacron is doing are sent  to  syslogd(8)
       under  facility cron, priority notice.  Error messages are sent at prior&#8208;
       ity error.

       &quot;Active&quot; jobs (i.e. jobs that Anacron already decided to run and now wait
       for  their  delay  to pass, and jobs that are currently being executed by
       Anacron), are &quot;locked&quot;, so that other copies of Anacron won&apos;t run them at
       the same time.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force execution of the jobs, ignoring the timestamps.
&#12;       -u     Only  update  the timestamps of the jobs, to the current date, but
              don&apos;t run anything.

       -s     Serialize execution of jobs.  Anacron will not  start  a  new  job
              before the previous one finished.

       -n     Run   jobs   now.    Ignore   the   delay  specifications  in  the
              /etc/anacrontab file.  This options implies -s.

       -d     Don&apos;t fork to the background.  In this mode, Anacron  will  output
              informational  messages  to  standard error, as well as to syslog.
              The output of jobs is mailed as usual.

       -q     Suppress messages to standard error.  Only applicable with -d.

       -t anacrontab
              Use specified anacrontab, rather than the default

       -T     Anacrontab testing. The configuration  file  will  be  tested  for
              validity. If there is an error in the file, an error will be shown
              and anacron will return 1. Valid anacrontabs will return 0.

       -S spooldir
              Use the specified spooldir to store timestamps in. This option  is
              required for users who wish to run anacron themselves.

       -V     Print version information, and exit.

       -h     Print short usage message, and exit.

SIGNALS
       After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits for running jobs, if any,
       to finish and then exits.  This can be used to stop Anacron cleanly.

NOTES
       Make sure that the time-zone is set correctly before Anacron is  started.
       (The  time-zone  affects the date).  This is usually accomplished by set&#8208;
       ting the TZ environment  variable,  or  by  installing  a  /usr/lib/zone&#8208;
       info/localtime file.  See tzset(3) for more information.

       Timestamp  files  are  created  in  the  spool  directory for each job in
       anacrontab. These are never removed automatically by anacron, and  should
       be removed by hand if a job is no longer being scheduled.

FILES
       /etc/anacrontab
              Contains specifications of jobs.  See anacrontab(5) for a complete
              description.

       /var/spool/anacron
              This directory is used by Anacron for storing timestamp files.

BUGS
       Anacron never removes timestamp files.  Remove unused files manually.

       Anacron uses up to two file descriptors for each active job.  It may  run
       out  of descriptors if there are more than about 125 active jobs (on nor&#8208;
       mal kernels).
