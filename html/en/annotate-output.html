ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1)                                            ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1)



NAME
       annotate-output - annotate program output with time and stream

SYNOPSIS
       annotate-output [options] program [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       annotate-output  will  execute  the  specified  program, while prepending
       every line with the current time and O for stdout and E for stderr.


OPTIONS
       +FORMAT
              Controls the  timestamp  format,  as  per  date(1).   Defaults  to
              &quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit successfully.


EXAMPLE
       $ annotate-output make
       21:41:21 I: Started make
       21:41:21 O: gcc -Wall program.c
       21:43:18 E: program.c: Couldn&apos;t compile, and took me ages to find out
       21:43:19 E: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
       21:43:19 E: make: *** [all] Error 1
       21:43:19 I: Finished with exitcode 2


BUGS
       Since  stdout  and  stderr  are processed in parallel, it can happen that
       some lines received on stdout will show up  before  later-printed  stderr
       lines (and vice-versa).

       This is unfortunately very hard to fix with the current annotation strat&#8208;
       egy.  A fix would involve switching to PTRACE&apos;ing  the  process.   Giving
       nice  a  (much)  higher  priority over the executed program could however
       cause this behaviour to show up less frequently.

       The program does not work as well when the output is  not  linewise.   In
       particular,  when  an  interactive  program  asks for input, the question
       might not be shown until after you have answered it.  This will give  the
       impression that the annotated program has hung, while it has not.

SUPPORT
       This program is community-supported (meaning: you&apos;ll need to fix it your&#8208;
       self).  Patches are however appreciated, as is any feedback (positive  or
       negative).
