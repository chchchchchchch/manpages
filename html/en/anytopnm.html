NAME
       anytopnm - attempt to convert an unknown type of image file to a portable
       anymap


SYNOPSIS
       anytopnm [file]


DESCRIPTION
       anytopnm converts the input image, which may  be  in  any  of  dozens  of
       graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM format, depending on that nature of
       the input image, and outputs it to Standard Output.

       To determine the format of the input,  anytopnm  uses  the  file  program
       (possibly  assisted  by  the  magic  numbers  file fragment included with
       Netpbm).  If that fails (very few image formats have magic numbers), any&#8208;
       topnm looks at the filename extension.  If that fails, anytopnm punts.

       The type of the output file depends on the input image.

       If file indicates that the input file is compressed (either via Unix com&#8208;
       press, gzip, or bzip compression), anytopnm uncompresses it and  proceeds
       as above with the uncompressed result.

       If  file  indicates  that  the input file is encoded by uuencode or btoa,
       anytopnm decodes it and proceeds as above with the decoded result.

       If file is - or not given, anytopnm takes its input from Standard Input.
