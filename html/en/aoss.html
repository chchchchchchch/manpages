NAME
       aoss  -  Wrapper  script  to facilitate use of the ALSA OSS compatibility
       library.

SYNOPSIS
       aoss osscommand [arguments]


DESCRIPTION
       aoss is a simple wrapper script which facilitates the use of the ALSA OSS
       compatibility  library.  It just sets the appropriate LD_PRELOAD path and
       then runs the command.

       This is useful in cases where routing settings (which can be made in your
       .asoundrc file) need to be applied to commands that use the OSS API.

       Examples of asoundrc configuration:

       pcm.dsp0 {      type plug      slave.pcm &quot;hw:0,0&quot; }

       or

       pcm.dsp0 {      type plug      slave.pcm &quot;dmix&quot; }

       In  the  above configuration examples, the pcm.dsp0 definition is used to
       wrap calls do /dev/dsp0. You can also wrap usage of /dev/dsp1, /dev/dsp2,
       etc. by defining pcm.dsp1, pcm.dsp2, etc..

       The  PCM  name  to  open  can be given explicitly via ALSA_OSS_PCM_DEVICE
       environment variable, too.  This overrides the default dsp0, etc.

       Note on mmap: aoss mmap support might be buggy.  Your  results  may  vary
       when  trying  to  use an application that uses mmap&apos;ing to access the OSS
       device files.



   Arguments
       osscommand
              A command that uses the OSS API

       arguments
              The appropriate arguments and options for the OSS command.
