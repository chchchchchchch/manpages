NAME
       apgbfm - APG Bloom filter management program


SYNOPSIS
       apgbfm -f filter -n numofwords [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -d dictfile [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -a word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -A dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -c word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -C dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -i filter
       apgbfm [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       apgbfm  is  used to manage Bloom filter that is used to restrict password
       generation in APG pasword generation software. Usage of the Bloom  filter
       allows  to  speed  up  password check for large dictionaries and has some
       other benefits.

       The idea to use Bloom filter for that purpose is came from  the  descrip&#8208;
       tion  of  the  OPUS project OPUS: Preventing Weak Password Choices Purdue
       Technical Report CSD-TR 92-028 writen by Eugene H. Spafford.

       You can obtain this article from:
       http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/tech-reps/9128.ps
       It has very nice description of Bloom  filter  and  it&apos;s  advantages  for
       password checking systems.

       In  simple  words, apgbfm generates n hash values for every word and sets
       corresponding bits in filter file to 1. To check the word  apgbfm  gener&#8208;
       ates  the  same  hash  functions for that word and if all n corresponding
       bits in filter file are set to 1 then it  suppose  that  word  exists  in
       dicionary.  apgbfm uses SHA-1 as a hash function.

       apgbfm can be used as standalone utility, not only with apg, or apgd.

       WARNING !!!
              Filter  file format can be changed in the future. I&apos;ll try to make
              file formats compatible but i can not guaranty this.

       WARNING !!!
              apgbfm may slow down your computer during filter creation.

OPTIONS
       -f filter
              use filter as the name for Bloom filter filename.

       -i filter
              print information about filter.

       -n numofwords
              create new empty filter for numofwords  number  of  words.  Useful
              when you want to fill filter dynamicaly.

       -d dictfile
              create new filter from dictfile. It may take a lot of time to gen&#8208;
              erate filter from a big dictionary. In  that  dictionary  you  may
              place  words  (one  per  line) that should not appear as generated
              passwords.  For example: user names common words,  etc.  You  even
              can use one of the dictionaries that come with dictionary password
              crackers.  This check is case sensitive. For example, if you  want
              to  reject word &apos;root&apos;, you should insert in dictfile words: root,
              Root, RoOt, ... , ROOT.  To indicate that program is working  apg&#8208;
              bfm prints dot for every 100 words added in dictionary.

       -a word
              add word to the filter.

       -A dictfile
              add  all  words from dictfile to the filter. To indicate that pro&#8208;
              gram is working apgbfm prints dot for every  100  words  added  in
              dictionary.

       -c word
              check word for appearance in the filter.

       -C dictfile
              check every word from dictfile for appearance in the filter.

       -q     quiet mode.

       -s     create new filter in case-insensitive mode.

       -v     print version information.

       -h     print help information.

EXIT CODE
       On successful completion of its task, apgbfm will complete with exit code
       0.  An exit code of -1 indicates an error occurred.  Textual  errors  are
       written to the standard error stream.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you&apos;ve found one, please send bug description to the author.

       This man page is Alpha too.
