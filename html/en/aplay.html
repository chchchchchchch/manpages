APLAY(1)                                                                APLAY(1)



NAME
       arecord,  aplay  - command-line sound recorder and player for ALSA sound&#8208;
       card driver

SYNOPSIS
       arecord [flags] [filename]
       aplay [flags] [filename [filename]] ...


DESCRIPTION
       arecord is a command-line  soundfile  recorder  for  the  ALSA  soundcard
       driver.  It  supports  several  file formats and multiple soundcards with
       multiple devices. If recording with interleaved mode samples the file  is
       automatically split before the 2GB filesize.

       aplay is much the same, only it plays instead of recording. For supported
       soundfile formats, the sampling rate, bit depth,  and  so  forth  can  be
       automatically determined from the soundfile header.

       If  filename  is not specified, the standard output or input is used. The
       aplay utility accepts multiple filenames.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       --version
              Print current version.

       -l, --list-devices
              List all soundcards and digital audio devices

       -L, --list-pcms
              List all PCMs defined

       -D, --device=NAME
              Select PCM by name

       -q --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress messages (not sound :))

       -t, --file-type TYPE
              File type (voc, wav, raw or au).  If this parameter is omitted the
              WAVE format is used.

       -c, --channels=#
              The number of channels.  The default is one channel.  Valid values
              are 1 through 32.

       -f --format=FORMAT
              Sample format
              Recognized sample formats are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE  U16_LE  U16_BE
              S24_LE  S24_BE  U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE S32_BE U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE
              FLOAT_BE  FLOAT64_LE  FLOAT64_BE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE   IEC958_SUB&#8208;
              FRAME_BE  MU_LAW  A_LAW IMA_ADPCM MPEG GSM SPECIAL S24_3LE S24_3BE
              U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE  U20_3BE  S18_3LE  S18_3BE
              U18_3LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_BE -c2 -f44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given U8 is used.

       -r, --rate=#&lt;Hz&gt;
              Sampling  rate  in  Hertz. The default rate is 8000 Hertz.  If the
              value specified is less than 300, it is taken as the rate in kilo&#8208;
              hertz.  Valid values are 2000 through 192000 Hertz.

       -d, --duration=#
              Interrupt  after  # seconds.  A value of zero means infinity.  The
              default is zero, so if this option is  omitted  then  the  arecord
              process will run until it is killed.

       -s, --sleep-min=#
              Min ticks to sleep. The default is not to sleep.

       -M, --mmap
              Use  memory-mapped  (mmap) I/O mode for the audio stream.  If this
              option is not set, the read/write I/O mode will be used.

       -N, --nonblock
              Open the audio device in non-blocking mode. If the device is  busy
              the  program will exit immediately.  If this option is not set the
              program will block until the audio device is available again.

       -F, --period-time=#
              Distance between interrupts is # microseconds.  If no period  time
              and  no  period size is given then a quarter of the buffer time is
              set.

       -B, --buffer-time=#
              Buffer duration is # microseconds If no buffer time and no  buffer
              size  is  given  then the maximal allowed buffer time but not more
              than 500ms is set.

       --period-size=#
              Distance between interrupts is # frames If no period size  and  no
              period time is given then a quarter of the buffer size is set.

       --buffer-size=#
              Buffer  duration  is # frames If no buffer time and no buffer size
              is given then the maximal allowed buffer time but  not  more  than
              500ms is set.

       -A, --avail-min=#
              Min available space for wakeup is # microseconds

       -R, --start-delay=#
              Delay  for automatic PCM start is # microseconds (relative to buf&#8208;
              fer size if &lt;= 0)

       -T, --stop-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM stop is # microseconds from xrun

       -v, --verbose
              Show PCM structure and setup.  This option is  accumulative.   The
              VU meter is displayed when this is given twice or three times.

       -V, --vumeter=TYPE
              Specifies  the  VU-meter  type, either stereo or mono.  The stereo
              VU-meter is available  only  for  2-channel  stereo  samples  with
              interleaved format.

       -I, --separate-channels
              One file for each channel.  This option disables max-file-time and
              use-strftime, and ignores SIGUSR1.  The stereo  VU  meter  is  not
              available with separate channels.

       -P     Playback.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing
              aplay.

       -C     Record.  This is the default if the program is invoked  by  typing
              arecord.

       -i, --interactive
              Allow   interactive   operation   via   stdin.    Currently   only
              pause/resume via space or enter key is implemented.

       --disable-resample
              Disable automatic rate resample.

       --disable-channels
              Disable automatic channel conversions.

       --disable-format
              Disable automatic format conversions.

       --disable-softvol
              Disable software volume control (softvol).

       --test-position
              Test ring buffer position.

       --test-coef=&lt;coef&gt;
              Test coefficient for ring buffer position; default is 8.   Expres&#8208;
              sion  for  validation is: coef * (buffer_size / 2).  Minimum value
              is 1.

       --test-nowait
              Do not wait for the ring buffer--eats the whole CPU.

       --max-file-time
              While recording, when the output file has been accumulating  sound
              for  this  long,  close it and open a new output file.  Default is
              the maximum size supported by the  file  format:  2  GiB  for  WAV
              files.  This option has no effect if  --separate-channels is spec&#8208;
              ified.

       --process-id-file &lt;file name&gt;
              aplay writes its process ID here, so other programs can send  sig&#8208;
              nals to it.

       --use-strftime
              When recording, interpret %-codes in the file name parameter using
              the strftime facility whenever the output  file  is  opened.   The
              important  strftime codes are: %Y is the year, %m month, %d day of
              the month, %H hour, %M minute and %S second.  In addition,  %v  is
              the  file  number,  starting at 1.  When this option is specified,
              intermediate directories for the output file are created automati&#8208;
              cally.  This option has no effect if --separate-channels is speci&#8208;
              fied.


SIGNALS
       When recording, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGABRT will close  the  output  file
       and  exit.   SIGUSR1 will close the output file, open a new one, and con&#8208;
       tinue recording.  However, SIGUSR1 does not  work  with  --separate-chan&#8208;
       nels.


EXAMPLES
       aplay -c 1 -t raw -r 22050 -f mu_law foobar
              will play the raw file &quot;foobar&quot; as a 22050-Hz, mono, 8-bit, Mu-Law
              .au file.


       arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy foobar.wav
              will record foobar.wav as a 10-second, CD-quality wave file, using
              the  PCM  &quot;copy&quot;  (which  might be defined in the user&apos;s .asoundrc
              file as:
              pcm.copy {
                type plug
                slave {
                  pcm hw
                }
                route_policy copy
              }


       arecord -t wav -max-file_time 30 mon.wav
              Record from the default audio source in  monaural,  8,000  samples
              per second, 8 bits per sample.  Start a new file every 30 seconds.
              File names are mon-nn.wav, where nn increases from 01.   The  file
              after mon-99.wav is mon-100.wav.


       arecord  -f  cd  -t  wav -max-file-time 3600 --use-strftime %Y/%m/%d/lis&#8208;
       ten-%H-%M-%v.wav
              Record in stereo from the default audio source.  Create a new file
              every  hour.   The  files are placed in directories based on their
              start dates and have names which include  their  start  times  and
              file numbers.
