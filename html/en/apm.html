DESCRIPTION
       apm  is  an Xorg driver for Alliance ProMotion video cards. The driver is
       accelerated for supported hardware/depth combination. It supports  frame&#8208;
       buffer  depths  of  8, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits. For 6420, 6422, AT24, AT3D
       and AT25, all depths are fully accelerated except 24 bpp for  which  only
       screen to screen copy and rectangle filling is accelerated.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The apm driver supports PCI and ISA video cards on the following Alliance
       ProMotion chipsets

       ProMotion 6420

       ProMotion 6422

       AT24

       AT3D

       AT25

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet names
       may optionally be specified in the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
       override the auto-detection:

           &quot;6422&quot;, &quot;at24&quot;, &quot;at3d&quot;.

           The AT25 is Chipset &quot;at3d&quot; and the 6420 is 6422.

           The  driver  will  auto-detect the amount of video memory present for
           all chips. The actual amount of video memory can  also  be  specified
           with a VideoRam entry in the config file &quot;Device&quot; section.

           The following driver Options are supported:

           Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
                  Enable or disable the hardware cursor.  Default: on.

           Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
                  Disable  or  enable  acceleration.   Default:  acceleration is
                  enabled.

           Option &quot;PciRetry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
                  Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

           Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_On&quot; &quot;string&quot;

           Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_Standby&quot; &quot;string&quot;

           Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_Suspend&quot; &quot;string&quot;

           Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_Off&quot; &quot;string&quot;
                  Remaps the corresponding DPMS events. I&apos;ve found that my  Her&#8208;
                  cules  128/3D  swaps  Off  and Suspend events. You can correct
                  that with
                         Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_Suspend&quot; &quot;Off&quot;
                         Option &quot;Remap_DPMS_Off&quot; &quot;Suspend&quot;
                  in the Device section of the config file.

                  Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
                         Force the software cursor.  Default: off.

                  Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
                         Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer  layer.
                         Default: off.
