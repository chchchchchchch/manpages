APM(1)                                                                    APM(1)



NAME
       apm - interface with the APM subsystem

SYNOPSIS
       apm [ -VvmMsSdin ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  requires  the Advanced Power Management subsystem.  If run
       without arguments it reads /proc/apm and presents the output in a  human-
       readable format.

       Given  a -S or -s option it requests that the machine be put into the APM
       standby or the APM suspend state, respectively.  For a brief  description
       of these states, see apmd(8).

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              Print the version of the program and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Also  print  version  information  for the APM subsystem.  The APM
              subsystem consists of power-management hardware, firmware  usually
              referred  to  as the APM BIOS and a driver in the operating system
              kernel.

       -m, --minutes
              Print the time remaining as a number of minutes.  The  default  is
              to print the time remaining in &quot;hours:minutes&quot; format.

       -M, --monitor
              Continuously  monitor  and update the status information.  Assumes
              that the standard output is a terminal.

       -S, --standby
              Request that the machine be put into the APM standby state.

       -s, --suspend
              Request that the machine be put into the APM suspend state.

       -d, --debug
              Print APM status information in a format more  useful  for  debug&#8208;
              ging.  Implies -v.
