APMSLEEP(1)                                                          APMSLEEP(1)



NAME
       apmsleep - go into suspend or standby mode and wake-up later

SYNOPSIS
       apmsleep  [-sSnwhVd]  [--suspend]  [--standby] [--noapm] [--wait] [--pre&#8208;
       cise] [--help]  [--version] [--debug] [+]hh:mm

DESCRIPTION
       Some computers, especially laptops, can wake-up from a low-power  suspend
       to  DRAM mode using the Real-time-clock (RTC) chip.  Apmsleep can be used
       to set the alarm time in the RTC and to go into suspend or standby  mode.
       An  interrupt  from  the RTC causes the computer to wake-up.  The program
       detects this event, by waiting for a leap in the kernel time  and  termi&#8208;
       nates  successfully.  If  no time leap occurs within one minute, or some&#8208;
       thing goes wrong, the exit value will be non-zero.

       The wake-up time can be specified in two formats:

       +hh:mm specifies a relative offset to the current time. The computer will
       suspend  for  exactly  hh hours and mm minutes plus a few seconds to wake
       up.  On some laptops, the timing is not completely accurate so it may  be
       a few minutes (or more?) late.

       hh:mm specifies absolute local time in 24-hour format. The time stored in
       the RTC is not important.  You may change the time zone used, with the TZ
       environment variable as usual. Daylight saving time is not obeyed in this
       version, but might be in a future release.  WARNING: Do not  close  cover
       of  laptop after suspending the laptop with apmsleep.  Most laptops over&#8208;
       heat when running with closed cover.

       Energy conservation with APM is little for  a  desktop.  Turning  of  the
       screen will save 1/2, going into standby with drives turned off will save
       another 1/6th of the current.

       -V, --version
              Print the apmsleep program version and exit immediately.

       -s, --suspend
              Put the machine into suspend mode if  possible  (default).  On  my
              laptop, suspend mode turns off everything except the memory.

       -S, --standby
              Put  the  machine  into  standby  mode  if possible. On my laptop,
              standby mode turns off screen, hard disk, and CPU.

       -w, --wait
              Wait indefinitely for the time leap.

       -p, --precise
              Wait for alarm time to match actual time. Do  not  wait  for  time
              leap.  This might be useful even without APM.

       -n, --noapm
              Do not call apm bios to suspend computer, just set the alarm clock
              and wait for time leap indefinitely.

       -d, --debug
              Print some information about what is going on.

REQUIRED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
       Kernel The special character device /dev/rtc must exist  and  the  kernel
              needs to be compiled with APM and RTC support.

       BIOS   The computer must have the &apos;suspend to RAM&apos; feature enabled in the
              BIOS; &apos;suspend to Disk&apos; will not work,  because  the  computer  is
              turned  off completely. You do not need to enable the ALARM timer,
              it will be activated by apmsleep. On some boards, you can  config&#8208;
              ure  which  interrupts  can be used to awake from suspend mode. If
              you have such a board, you might want to make sure  that  keyboard
              (IRQ  1)  and RTC (IRQ 8) are among those interrupts. If your com&#8208;
              puter does not wake up, try to enable &apos;modem ring&apos;  in  the  BIOS,
              even if you do not have a modem.

       Privileges
              The  program  must  be  run as root or have the SUID attribute set
              (see chmod(1)).

BUGS
       Apmsleep cannot detect which event terminated  the  suspension.  Possible
       events  are:  keyboard or mouse activity, modem ring, alarm from RTC, any
       other interrupt. Sometimes, the time leap is not detected properly (caus&#8208;
       ing a wrong exit value).

       Should  use  APM BIOS calls to set alarm clock (not yet supported by ker&#8208;
       nel).

       This program was tested on a Winbook XL laptop (Pentium)  only.   It  may
       not function on your hardware.
