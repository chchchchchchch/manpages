Name
       appletviewer - The Java Applet Viewer.

       The  appletviewer  command  allows  you  to  run applets outside of a web
       browser.

SYNOPSIS
       appletviewer [ options ] urls ...

DESCRIPTION
       The appletviewer command connects to the documents  or  resources  desig&#8208;
       nated by urls and displays each applet referenced by the documents in its
       own window. Note: if the documents referred to by urls do  not  reference
       any applets with the OBJECT, EMBED, or APPLET tag, then appletviewer does
       nothing. For details on the HTML tags that appletviewer supports, see
       AppletViewer Tags @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/appletview&#8208;
       ertags.html.

       Note: The appletviewer is intended for development purposes only. See
       About Sample / Test Applications and Code for more information.

       Note: The appletviewer requires encoded URLs according to the escaping
       mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only encoded URLs are supported. However,
       file names must be unencoded, as specified in RFC2396.

OPTIONS
          -debug
             Starts the applet viewer in the Java debugger, jdb(1), thus allow&#8208;
             ing you to debug the applets in the document.

          -encoding    encoding name
             Specify the input HTML file encoding name.

          -Jjavaoption
             Passes through the string javaoption as a single argument to the
             Java interpreter which runs the appletviewer. The argument should
             not contain spaces. Multiple argument words must all begin with the
             prefix -J, which is stripped. This is useful for adjusting the com&#8208;
             piler&apos;s execution environment or memory usage.
