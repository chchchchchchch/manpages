APROPOS(1)                     Manual pager utils                     APROPOS(1)



NAME
       apropos - search the manual page names and descriptions

SYNOPSIS
       apropos  [-dalhvV]  [-e|-w|-r]  [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-L
       locale] [-C file] keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
       Each manual page has a short description available  within  it.   apropos
       searches the descriptions for instances of keyword.

       keyword is usually a regular expression, as if (-r) was used, or may con&#8208;
       tain wildcards (-w), or  match  the  exact  keyword  (-e).   Using  these
       options,  it may be necessary to quote the keyword or escape (\) the spe&#8208;
       cial characters to stop the shell from interpreting them.

       The standard matching rules allow matches to be  made  against  the  page
       name and word boundaries in the description.

       The  database  searched  by  apropos  is  updated  by  the mandb program.
       Depending on your installation, this may be run by a periodic  cron  job,
       or  may  need  to  be  run  manually  after  new  manual  pages have been
       installed.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose warning messages.

       -r, --regex
              Interpret each keyword as  a  regular  expression.   This  is  the
              default  behaviour.  Each keyword will be matched against the page
              names and the descriptions independently.  It can match  any  part
              of either.  The match is not limited to word boundaries.

       -w, --wildcard
              Interpret  each  keyword as a pattern containing shell style wild&#8208;
              cards.  Each keyword will be matched against the  page  names  and
              the  descriptions independently.  If --exact is also used, a match
              will only be found  if  an  expanded  keyword  matches  an  entire
              description  or  page name.  Otherwise the keyword is also allowed
              to match on word boundaries in the description.

       -e, --exact
              Each keyword will be exactly matched against the  page  names  and
              the descriptions.

       -a, --and
              Only  display  items  that  match  all the supplied keywords.  The
              default is to display items that match any keyword.

       -l, --long
              Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally,  output  will
              be  truncated  to  the  terminal  width to avoid ugly results from
              poorly-written NAME sections.

       -s list, --sections list, --section list
              Search only the given manual sections.  list is a colon- or comma-
              separated  list of sections.  If an entry in list is a simple sec&#8208;
              tion, for example &quot;3&quot;, then the  displayed  list  of  descriptions
              will  include  pages  in  sections  &quot;3&quot;, &quot;3perl&quot;, &quot;3x&quot;, and so on;
              while if an entry in list has an extension, for  example  &quot;3perl&quot;,
              then  the  list  will only include pages in that exact part of the
              manual section.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system&apos;s manual  page
              descriptions,  they  can be searched using this option.  To search
              NewOS&apos;s manual page descriptions, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma-delimited oper&#8208;
              ating  system  names.  To include a search of the native operating
              system&apos;s whatis descriptions, include the system name man  in  the
              argument  string.   This option will override the $SYSTEM environ&#8208;
              ment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited  manual  page  hierar&#8208;
              chies  to  search.  By default, apropos uses the $MANPATH environ&#8208;
              ment variable, unless it is empty or unset, in which case it  will
              determine  an  appropriate manpath based on your $PATH environment
              variable.  This option overrides the contents of $MANPATH.

       -L locale, --locale=locale
              apropos will normally determine your current locale by a  call  to
              the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment
              variables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.   To  tempo&#8208;
              rarily  override the determined value, use this option to supply a
              locale string directly to apropos.  Note that  it  will  not  take
              effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as
              the help message will always be displayed in the initially  deter&#8208;
              mined locale.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use  this  user  configuration  file  rather  than  the default of
              ~/.manpath.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       16     Nothing was found that matched the criteria specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had  been
              specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANPATH
              If  $MANPATH  is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-delim&#8208;
              ited manual page hierarchy search path to use.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the terminal width  (see
              the  --long option).  If it is not set, the terminal width will be
              calculated using an ioctl(2) if available, the value of  $COLUMNS,
              or falling back to 80 characters if all else fails.
&#12;       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If  $POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  set,  even  to a null value, the default
              apropos search will be as an extended regex (-r).  Nowadays,  this
              is the default behaviour anyway.

FILES
