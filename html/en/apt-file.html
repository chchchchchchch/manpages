APT-FILE(1)                                                          APT-FILE(1)



NAME
       apt-file - APT package searching utility -- command-line interface

SYNOPSIS
       apt-file [ options ] [ action ] [ pattern ]


       apt-file -f [ options ] search [ file ... ]


       apt-file -D [ options ] search [ binary-packet.deb ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       apt-file  is  a command line tool for searching files in packages for the
       APT package management system.

       Some actions are required to run the search:

       find   Alias for search.

       list   List the contents of a package matching the pattern pattern.  This
              action  is  very  close  to the dpkg -L command except the package
              does not need to be installed or fetched.

       purge  remove all Contents-* files from the cache directory.

       search Search in which package a file is included. A list of all packages
              containing the pattern pattern is returned.

              apt-file  will  only  search  for  filenames, not directory names.
              This is due to the format of the Contents files it searches.

       show   Alias for list.

       update Resynchronize the package contents from their sources.  The  lists
              of the contents of packages are fetched from the location(s) spec&#8208;
              ified in /etc/apt/sources.list. This command attempts to fetch the
              Contents-&lt;ARCH&gt;.gz  files  from  remote  sources.  For downloading
              these uses either the curl or wget commands as specified  in  apt-
              file.conf.

OPTIONS
          -a, --architecture architecture
              Sets  architecture  to  architecture. This option is useful if you
              search a  package  for  a  different  architecture  from  the  one
              installed on your system.  It determines how the $ARCH variable in
              sources.list is expanded (but it does not influence the search  in
              any other way).

          -c, --cache cache-directory
              Sets  the  cache  directory  to  cache-directory  instead  of  its
              default.  If  executed  as   non-root   user,   the   default   is
              $HOME/.cache/apt-file  with  fall-back to /var/cache/apt/apt-file.
              The latter is also the default if apt-file is called as root.

          -d, --cdrom-mount cdrom-mount-point
              Use cdrom-mount-point instead of apt&apos;s.

          -D, --from-deb
              Use contents of the given .deb archives(s)  as  patterns.   Useful
              for searching for file conflicts with other packages.  Implies -F.

          -f, --from-file
              Read  patterns from the given file(s), one per line.  Use -f - for
              stdin.  This is much faster than invoking apt-file many times.

          -F, --fixed-string
              Do not expand search pattern with generic characters at  pattern&apos;s
              start and end.

          -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for pattern.

          -l, --package-only
              Only display package name; do not display file names.

          -N, --non-interactive
              Skip  schemes  that  are  listed  in  the interactive line in apt-
              file.conf.  This is useful if you want to call  &apos;apt-file  update&apos;
              in cron jobs and skip all schemes that may require user input.

          -s, --sources-list sources.list
              Sets  the  sources.list file to a different value from its default
              /etc/apt/sources.list.

          -v, --verbose
              Run apt-file in verbose mode.

          -x, --regexp
              Treat pattern as a (perl) regular expression. See perlreref(1) for
              details.  Without  this  option,  pattern  is treated as a literal
              string to search for.

          -y, --dummy
              Run in dummy mode (no action).

          -h, --help
              Display a short help screen.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The apt-file configuration file can be found in /etc/apt/apt-file.conf.

       A string expansion is done on several values. See  the  string  expansion
       section.

       destination
              This variable describes how cached files will be named.

       http | ftp | ssh | rsh | file | cdrom
              Defines the commands used to fetch files.

   STRING EXPANSION
       A sources.list entry is defined as:

              deb uri dist component1 component2 ...

       A uri is defined as:

              proto:/[/][user[:password]@]host[:port][/path]


       &lt;host&gt; replace with the hostname

       &lt;port&gt; replace with the port number

       &lt;uri&gt;  replace with full uri
&#12;       &lt;path&gt; replace with full path (relative to / on the host)

       &lt;dist&gt; replace with distribution name

       &lt;comp&gt; replace with component name

       &lt;cache&gt;
              replace with cache directory

       &lt;dest&gt; replace with destination expanded value.

       &lt;cdrom&gt;
              replace with cdrom-mount-point.

BUGS
       The cdrom backend has not been tested.

       Non-release lines in sources.list are not handled by apt-file.

       There is only one Contents file per distribution that contains all compo&#8208;
       nents (i.e. main, contrib, and non-free). Threrefore, apt-file will  dis&#8208;
       play  search  results from all components, even if not all components are
       included in the sources.list file.

       When a new line has been added to the sources.list  and  apt-file  update
       has not been run, apt-file does not print a warning message.

       Complex  regular  expressions  that  match the leading slash may not work
       correctly. As a workaround, try to pull the leading slash to  the  begin&#8208;
       ning     of     the     regular     expression.    For    example,    use
       &quot;/(usr/bin/vim|sbin/lvm)&quot; instead of &quot;/usr/bin/vim|/sbin/lvm&quot;.

FILES
       /etc/apt/sources.list
              Locations to fetch package contents from.

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
              Directory with additional sources.list snippets

       /etc/apt/apt-file.conf
              Configuration file for apt-file.
