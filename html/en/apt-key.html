APT-KEY(8)                             APT                            APT-KEY(8)



NAME
       apt-key - APT key management utility

SYNOPSIS
       apt-key [--keyring filename] {add filename | del keyid | export keyid |
               exportall | list | finger | adv | update | net-update |
               {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-key is used to manage the list of keys used by apt to authenticate
       packages. Packages which have been authenticated using these keys will be
       considered trusted.

COMMANDS
       add filename
           Add a new key to the list of trusted keys. The key is read from the
           filename given with the parameter filename or if the filename is -
           from standard input.

       del keyid
           Remove a key from the list of trusted keys.

       export keyid
           Output the key keyid to standard output.

       exportall
           Output all trusted keys to standard output.

       list
           List trusted keys.

       finger
           List fingerprints of trusted keys.

       adv
           Pass advanced options to gpg. With adv --recv-key you can download
           the public key.

       update
           Update the local keyring with the archive keyring and remove from the
           local keyring the archive keys which are no longer valid. The archive
           keyring is shipped in the archive-keyring package of your
           distribution, e.g. the debian-archive-keyring package in Debian.

       net-update
           Perform an update working similarly to the update command above, but
           get the archive keyring from a URI instead and validate it against a
           master key. This requires an installed wget(1) and an APT build
           configured to have a server to fetch from and a master keyring to
           validate. APT in Debian does not support this command, relying on
           update instead, but Ubuntu&apos;s APT does.

OPTIONS
       Note that options need to be defined before the commands described in the
       previous section.

       --keyring filename
           With this option it is possible to specify a particular keyring file
           the command should operate on. The default is that a command is
           executed on the trusted.gpg file as well as on all parts in the
           trusted.gpg.d directory, though trusted.gpg is the primary keyring
           which means that e.g. new keys are added to this one.

FILES
       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
           Keyring of local trusted keys, new keys will be added here.
           Configuration Item: Dir::Etc::Trusted.

       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
           File fragments for the trusted keys, additional keyrings can be
           stored here (by other packages or the administrator). Configuration
           Item Dir::Etc::TrustedParts.

       /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg
           Local trust database of archive keys.

       /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
           Keyring of Debian archive trusted keys.

       /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-removed-keys.gpg
           Keyring of Debian archive removed trusted keys.
