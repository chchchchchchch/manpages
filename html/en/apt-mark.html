APT-MARK(8)                            APT                           APT-MARK(8)



NAME
       apt-mark - mark/unmark a package as being automatically-installed

SYNOPSIS
       apt-mark [-f=filename] {auto | manual | showauto | showmanual} pkg...  |
                {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-mark will change whether a package has been marked as being
       automatically installed.

       When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other
       packages are installed to satisfy its dependencies, the dependencies are
       marked as being automatically installed. Once these automatically
       installed packages are no longer depended on by any manually installed
       packages, they will be removed by e.g.  apt-get or aptitude.

       auto
           auto is used to mark a package as being automatically installed,
           which will cause the package to be removed when no more manually
           installed packages depend on this package.

       manual
           manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which
           will prevent the package from being automatically removed if no other
           packages depend on it.

       hold
           hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the
           package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed. The
           command is only a wrapper around dpkg --set-selections and the state
           is therefore maintained by dpkg(1) and not affected by the --file
           option.

       unhold
           unhold is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to allow
           all actions again.

       showauto
           showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed packages
           with each package on a new line. All automatically installed packages
           will be listed if no package is given. If packages are given only
           those which are automatically installed will be shown.

       showmanual
           showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it
           will print a list of manually installed packages instead.

       showhold
           showhold is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same way
           as for the other show commands.

OPTIONS
       -f=filename, --file=filename
           Read/Write package stats from the filename given with the parameter
           filename instead of from the default location, which is
           extended_status in the directory defined by the Configuration Item:
           Dir::State.

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.
&#12;       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program
           will read the default configuration file and then this configuration
           file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default
           configuration files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG
           environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration
           option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and --option can be used
           multiple times to set different options.

FILES
       /var/lib/apt/extended_states
           Status list of auto-installed packages. Configuration Item:
           Dir::State::extended_states.

SEE ALSO

DIAGNOSTICS
