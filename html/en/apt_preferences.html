APT_PREFERENCES(5)                     APT                    APT_PREFERENCES(5)



NAME
       apt_preferences - Preference control file for APT

DESCRIPTION
       The APT preferences file /etc/apt/preferences and the fragment files in
       the /etc/apt/preferences.d/ folder can be used to control which versions
       of packages will be selected for installation.

       Several versions of a package may be available for installation when the
       sources.list(5) file contains references to more than one distribution
       (for example, stable and testing). APT assigns a priority to each version
       that is available. Subject to dependency constraints, apt-get selects the
       version with the highest priority for installation. The APT preferences
       override the priorities that APT assigns to package versions by default,
       thus giving the user control over which one is selected for installation.

       Several instances of the same version of a package may be available when
       the sources.list(5) file contains references to more than one source. In
       this case apt-get downloads the instance listed earliest in the
       sources.list(5) file. The APT preferences do not affect the choice of
       instance, only the choice of version.

       Preferences are a strong power in the hands of a system administrator but
       they can become also their biggest nightmare if used without care! APT
       will not question the preferences, so wrong settings can lead to
       uninstallable packages or wrong decisions while upgrading packages. Even
       more problems will arise if multiple distribution releases are mixed
       without a good understanding of the following paragraphs. Packages
       included in a specific release aren&apos;t tested in (and therefore don&apos;t
       always work as expected in) older or newer releases, or together with
       other packages from different releases. You have been warned.

       Note that the files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d directory are parsed in
       alphanumeric ascending order and need to obey the following naming
       convention: The files have either no or &quot;pref&quot; as filename extension and
       only contain alphanumeric, hyphen (-), underscore (_) and period (.)
       characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file,
       unless that file matches a pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently
       configuration list - in which case it will be silently ignored.

   APT&apos;s Default Priority Assignments
       If there is no preferences file or if there is no entry in the file that
       applies to a particular version then the priority assigned to that
       version is the priority of the distribution to which that version
       belongs. It is possible to single out a distribution, &quot;the target
       release&quot;, which receives a higher priority than other distributions do by
       default. The target release can be set on the apt-get command line or in
       the APT configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf. Note that this has
       precedence over any general priority you set in the /etc/apt/preferences
       file described later, but not over specifically pinned packages. For
       example,

           apt-get install -t testing some-package



           APT::Default-Release &quot;stable&quot;;

       If the target release has been specified then APT uses the following
       algorithm to set the priorities of the versions of a package. Assign:

       priority 1
           to the versions coming from archives which in their Release files are
           marked as &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; but not as &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot;
           like the Debian experimental archive.

       priority 100
           to the version that is already installed (if any) and to the versions
           coming from archives which in their Release files are marked as
           &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; and &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot; like the Debian
           backports archive since squeeze-backports.

       priority 500
           to the versions that are not installed and do not belong to the
           target release.

       priority 990
           to the versions that are not installed and belong to the target
           release.

       If the target release has not been specified then APT simply assigns
       priority 100 to all installed package versions and priority 500 to all
       uninstalled package versions, except versions coming from archives which
       in their Release files are marked as &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; - these versions
       get the priority 1 or priority 100 if it is additionally marked as
       &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot;.

       APT then applies the following rules, listed in order of precedence, to
       determine which version of a package to install.

       &#183;   Never downgrade unless the priority of an available version exceeds
           1000. (&quot;Downgrading&quot; is installing a less recent version of a package
           in place of a more recent version. Note that none of APT&apos;s default
           priorities exceeds 1000; such high priorities can only be set in the
           preferences file. Note also that downgrading a package can be risky.)

       &#183;   Install the highest priority version.

       &#183;   If two or more versions have the same priority, install the most
           recent one (that is, the one with the higher version number).

       &#183;   If two or more versions have the same priority and version number but
           either the packages differ in some of their metadata or the
           --reinstall option is given, install the uninstalled one.

       In a typical situation, the installed version of a package (priority 100)
       is not as recent as one of the versions available from the sources listed
       in the sources.list(5) file (priority 500 or 990). Then the package will
       be upgraded when apt-get install some-package or apt-get upgrade is
       executed.

       More rarely, the installed version of a package is more recent than any
       of the other available versions. The package will not be downgraded when
       apt-get install some-package or apt-get upgrade is executed.

       Sometimes the installed version of a package is more recent than the
       version belonging to the target release, but not as recent as a version
       belonging to some other distribution. Such a package will indeed be
       upgraded when apt-get install some-package or apt-get upgrade is
       executed, because at least one of the available versions has a higher
       priority than the installed version.

   The Effect of APT Preferences
       The APT preferences file allows the system administrator to control the
       assignment of priorities. The file consists of one or more multi-line
       records separated by blank lines. Records can have one of two forms, a
       specific form and a general form.
&#12;       &#183;   The specific form assigns a priority (a &quot;Pin-Priority&quot;) to one or
           more specified packages with a specified version or version range.
           For example, the following record assigns a high priority to all
           versions of the perl package whose version number begins with &quot;5.10&quot;.
           Multiple packages can be separated by spaces.

               Package: perl
               Pin: version 5.10*
               Pin-Priority: 1001

       &#183;   The general form assigns a priority to all of the package versions in
           a given distribution (that is, to all the versions of packages that
           are listed in a certain Release file) or to all of the package
           versions coming from a particular Internet site, as identified by the
           site&apos;s fully qualified domain name.

           This general-form entry in the APT preferences file applies only to
           groups of packages. For example, the following record assigns a high
           priority to all package versions available from the local site.

               Package: *
               Pin: origin &quot;&quot;
               Pin-Priority: 999

           A note of caution: the keyword used here is &quot;origin&quot; which can be
           used to match a hostname. The following record will assign a high
           priority to all versions available from the server identified by the
           hostname &quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot;

               Package: *
               Pin: origin &quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot;
               Pin-Priority: 999

           This should not be confused with the Origin of a distribution as
           specified in a Release file. What follows the &quot;Origin:&quot; tag in a
           Release file is not an Internet address but an author or vendor name,
           such as &quot;Debian&quot; or &quot;Ximian&quot;.

           The following record assigns a low priority to all package versions
           belonging to any distribution whose Archive name is &quot;unstable&quot;.

               Package: *
               Pin: release a=unstable
               Pin-Priority: 50

           The following record assigns a high priority to all package versions
           belonging to any distribution whose Codename is &quot;jessie&quot;.

               Package: *
               Pin: release n=jessie
               Pin-Priority: 900

           The following record assigns a high priority to all package versions
           belonging to any release whose Archive name is &quot;stable&quot; and whose
           release Version number is &quot;7.0&quot;.

               Package: *
               Pin: release a=stable, v=7.0
               Pin-Priority: 500


   Regular expressions and glob(7) syntax
       APT also supports pinning by glob(7) expressions, and regular expressions
       surrounded by slashes. For example, the following example assigns the
       priority 500 to all packages from experimental where the name starts with
       gnome (as a glob(7)-like expression) or contains the word kde (as a POSIX
       extended regular expression surrounded by slashes).

           Package: gnome* /kde/
           Pin: release n=experimental
           Pin-Priority: 500

       The rule for those expressions is that they can occur anywhere where a
       string can occur. Thus, the following pin assigns the priority 990 to all
       packages from a release starting with precise.

           Package: *
           Pin: release n=precise*
           Pin-Priority: 990

       If a regular expression occurs in a Package field, the behavior is the
       same as if this regular expression were replaced with a list of all
       package names it matches. It is undecided whether this will change in the
       future; thus you should always list wild-card pins first, so later
       specific pins override it. The pattern &quot;*&quot; in a Package field is not
       considered a glob(7) expression in itself.

   How APT Interprets Priorities
       Priorities (P) assigned in the APT preferences file must be positive or
       negative integers. They are interpreted as follows (roughly speaking):

       P &gt;= 1000
           causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes a downgrade
           of the package

       990 &lt;= P &lt; 1000
           causes a version to be installed even if it does not come from the
           target release, unless the installed version is more recent

       500 &lt;= P &lt; 990
           causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available
           belonging to the target release or the installed version is more
           recent

       100 &lt;= P &lt; 500
           causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available
           belonging to some other distribution or the installed version is more
           recent

       0 &lt; P &lt; 100
           causes a version to be installed only if there is no installed
           version of the package

       P &lt; 0
           prevents the version from being installed

       If any specific-form records match an available package version then the
       first such record determines the priority of the package version. Failing
       that, if any general-form records match an available package version then
       the first such record determines the priority of the package version.

       For example, suppose the APT preferences file contains the three records
       presented earlier:

           Package: perl
           Pin: version 5.10*
           Pin-Priority: 1001

           Package: *
           Pin: origin &quot;&quot;
           Pin-Priority: 999
&#12;           Package: *
           Pin: release unstable
           Pin-Priority: 50

       Then:

       &#183;   The most recent available version of the perl package will be
           installed, so long as that version&apos;s version number begins with
           &quot;5.10&quot;. If any 5.10* version of perl is available and the installed
           version is 5.14*, then perl will be downgraded.

       &#183;   A version of any package other than perl that is available from the
           local system has priority over other versions, even versions
           belonging to the target release.

       &#183;   A version of a package whose origin is not the local system but some
           other site listed in sources.list(5) and which belongs to an unstable
           distribution is only installed if it is selected for installation and
           no version of the package is already installed.


   Determination of Package Version and Distribution Properties
       The locations listed in the sources.list(5) file should provide Packages
       and Release files to describe the packages available at that location.

       The Packages file is normally found in the directory
       .../dists/dist-name/component/arch: for example,
       .../dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages. It consists of a series of
       multi-line records, one for each package available in that directory.
       Only two lines in each record are relevant for setting APT priorities:

       the Package: line
           gives the package name

       the Version: line
           gives the version number for the named package

       The Release file is normally found in the directory .../dists/dist-name:
       for example, .../dists/stable/Release, or .../dists/wheezy/Release. It
       consists of a single multi-line record which applies to all of the
       packages in the directory tree below its parent. Unlike the Packages
       file, nearly all of the lines in a Release file are relevant for setting
       APT priorities:

       the Archive: or Suite: line
           names the archive to which all the packages in the directory tree
           belong. For example, the line &quot;Archive: stable&quot; or &quot;Suite: stable&quot;
           specifies that all of the packages in the directory tree below the
           parent of the Release file are in a stable archive. Specifying this
           value in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release a=stable

       the Codename: line
           names the codename to which all the packages in the directory tree
           belong. For example, the line &quot;Codename: jessie&quot; specifies that all
           of the packages in the directory tree below the parent of the Release
           file belong to a version named jessie. Specifying this value in the
           APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release n=jessie

       the Version: line
           names the release version. For example, the packages in the tree
           might belong to Debian release version 7.0. Note that there is
           normally no version number for the testing and unstable distributions
           because they have not been released yet. Specifying this in the APT
           preferences file would require one of the following lines.

               Pin: release v=7.0
               Pin: release a=stable, v=7.0
               Pin: release 7.0

       the Component: line
           names the licensing component associated with the packages in the
           directory tree of the Release file. For example, the line &quot;Component:
           main&quot; specifies that all the packages in the directory tree are from
           the main component, which entails that they are licensed under terms
           listed in the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Specifying this
           component in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release c=main

       the Origin: line
           names the originator of the packages in the directory tree of the
           Release file. Most commonly, this is Debian. Specifying this origin
           in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release o=Debian

       the Label: line
           names the label of the packages in the directory tree of the Release
           file. Most commonly, this is Debian. Specifying this label in the APT
           preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release l=Debian

       All of the Packages and Release files retrieved from locations listed in
       the sources.list(5) file are stored in the directory /var/lib/apt/lists,
       or in the file named by the variable Dir::State::Lists in the apt.conf
       file. For example, the file
       debian.lcs.mit.edu_debian_dists_unstable_contrib_binary-i386_Release
       contains the Release file retrieved from the site debian.lcs.mit.edu for
       binary-i386 architecture files from the contrib component of the unstable
       distribution.

   Optional Lines in an APT Preferences Record
       Each record in the APT preferences file can optionally begin with one or
       more lines beginning with the word Explanation:. This provides a place
       for comments.

EXAMPLES
   Tracking Stable
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a priority
       higher than the default (500) to all package versions belonging to a
       stable distribution and a prohibitively low priority to package versions
       belonging to other Debian distributions.

           Explanation: Uninstall or do not install any Debian-originated
           Explanation: package versions other than those in the stable distro
           Package: *
           Pin: release a=stable
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Package: *
           Pin: release o=Debian
           Pin-Priority: -10

       With a suitable sources.list(5) file and the above preferences file, any
       of the following commands will cause APT to upgrade to the latest stable
       version(s).
&#12;           apt-get install package-name
           apt-get upgrade
           apt-get dist-upgrade

       The following command will cause APT to upgrade the specified package to
       the latest version from the testing distribution; the package will not be
       upgraded again unless this command is given again.

           apt-get install package/testing


   Tracking Testing or Unstable
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a high
       priority to package versions from the testing distribution, a lower
       priority to package versions from the unstable distribution, and a
       prohibitively low priority to package versions from other Debian
       distributions.

           Package: *
           Pin: release a=testing
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Package: *
           Pin: release a=unstable
           Pin-Priority: 800

           Package: *
           Pin: release o=Debian
           Pin-Priority: -10

       With a suitable sources.list(5) file and the above preferences file, any
       of the following commands will cause APT to upgrade to the latest testing
       version(s).

           apt-get install package-name
           apt-get upgrade
           apt-get dist-upgrade

       The following command will cause APT to upgrade the specified package to
       the latest version from the unstable distribution. Thereafter, apt-get
       upgrade will upgrade the package to the most recent testing version if
       that is more recent than the installed version, otherwise, to the most
       recent unstable version if that is more recent than the installed
       version.

           apt-get install package/unstable


   Tracking the evolution of a codename release
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a priority
       higher than the default (500) to all package versions belonging to a
       specified codename of a distribution and a prohibitively low priority to
       package versions belonging to other Debian distributions, codenames and
       archives. Note that with this APT preference APT will follow the
       migration of a release from the archive testing to stable and later
       oldstable. If you want to follow for example the progress in testing
       notwithstanding the codename changes you should use the example
       configurations above.

           Explanation: Uninstall or do not install any Debian-originated package versions
           Explanation: other than those in the distribution codenamed with jessie or sid
           Package: *
           Pin: release n=jessie
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Explanation: Debian unstable is always codenamed with sid
           Package: *
           Pin: release n=sid
           Pin-Priority: 800

           Package: *
           Pin: release o=Debian
           Pin-Priority: -10

       With a suitable sources.list(5) file and the above preferences file, any
       of the following commands will cause APT to upgrade to the latest
       version(s) in the release codenamed with jessie.

           apt-get install package-name
           apt-get upgrade
           apt-get dist-upgrade

       The following command will cause APT to upgrade the specified package to
       the latest version from the sid distribution. Thereafter, apt-get upgrade
       will upgrade the package to the most recent jessie version if that is
       more recent than the installed version, otherwise, to the most recent sid
       version if that is more recent than the installed version.

           apt-get install package/sid
