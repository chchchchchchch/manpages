              Try to resolve unsatisified dependencies. Attention: Currently you
              don&apos;t  get  a confirmation of the changes, which makes this method
              quite dangerous since it could remove a lot of packages.

              given DEB_LINE.  You  have  to  put  quotation  marks  around  the
              DEB_LINE    since    it    normally    contains    spaces:    &#180;deb
              http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian unstable main&#180;

       --sources-file SOURCES_FILE
              Specify an alternative sources file to which  the  new  repository
              should be written. SOURCES_FILE should be only the basename: back&#8208;
              ports.list

       --list-trusted-vendors
              Show all trusted software vendors and theirs keys.

       --hide-terminal

              call.

       --allow-unauthenticated
              Allow to install packages which are not from a trusted vendor.

EXAMPLES
       The following command will install the package xterm and remove the pack&#8208;
       age eterm in the same run:
              $ aptdcon --install &quot;xterm&quot; --remove &quot;eterm&quot;

       To handle more than one package the names have to be put  into  quotation
       marks. The following command will install xterm and eterm:
              $ aptdcon --install &quot;xterm eterm&quot;

       The   following   command   will  add  the  backport  repository  to  the
       sources.list in a separate file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list :
              $ aptdcon --sources-file backports.list \
                  --add-repostiry &quot;deb http://archive.backports.org/debian  sta&#8208;
              ble main&quot;

DIAGNOSTICS
       By  default  aptdaemon logs to the syslog facility AptDaemon. Furthermore
       you can use the -d option to get additional information  on  the  command
       line.
