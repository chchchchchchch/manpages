APTITUDE-CREATE-ST(1)        Command-line reference        APTITUDE-CREATE-ST(1)



NAME
       aptitude-create-state-bundle - bundle the current aptitude state

SYNOPSIS
       aptitude-create-state-bundle [&lt;options&gt;...] &lt;output-file&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       aptitude-create-state-bundle produces a compressed archive storing the
       files that are required to replicate the current package archive state.
       The following files and directories are included in the bundle:

       &#183;   $HOME/.aptitude

       &#183;   /var/lib/aptitude

       &#183;   /var/lib/apt

       &#183;   /var/cache/apt/*.bin

       &#183;   /etc/apt

       &#183;   /var/lib/dpkg/status

       The output of this program can be used as an argument to aptitude-run-
       state-bundle(1).

OPTIONS
       --force-bzip2
           Override the autodetection of which compression algorithm to use. By
           default, aptitude-create-state-bundle uses bzip2(1) if it is
           available, and gzip(1) otherwise. Passing this option forces the use
           of bzip2 even if it doesn&apos;t appear to be available.

       --force-gzip
           Override the autodetection of which compression algorithm to use. By
           default, aptitude-create-state-bundle uses bzip2(1) if it is
           available, and gzip(1) otherwise. Passing this option forces the use
           of gzip even if bzip2 is available.

       --help
           Print a brief usage message, then exit.

       --print-inputs
           Instead of creating a bundle, display a list of the files and
           directories that the program would include if it generated a bundle.

FILE FORMAT
       The bundle file is simply a tar(1) file compressed with bzip2(1) or
       gzip(1), with each of the input directory trees rooted at &#8220;.&#8221;.
