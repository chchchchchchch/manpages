DESCRIPTION
       aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package
       system.

       It allows the user to view the list of packages and to perform package
       management tasks such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages.
       Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the
       command-line.

COMMAND-LINE ACTIONS
       The first argument which does not begin with a hyphen (&#8220;-&#8221;) is considered
       to be an action that the program should perform. If an action is not
       specified on the command-line, aptitude will start up in visual mode.

       The following actions are available:

       install
           Install one or more packages. The packages should be listed after the
           &#8220;install&#8221; command; if a package name contains a tilde character (&#8220;~&#8221;)
           or a question mark (&#8220;?&#8221;), it will be treated as a search pattern and
           every package matching the pattern will be installed (see the section
           &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the aptitude reference manual).

           To select a particular version of the package, append &#8220;=&lt;version&gt;&#8221; to
           the package name: for instance, &#8220;aptitude install apt=0.3.1&#8221;.
           Similarly, to select a package from a particular archive, append
           &#8220;/&lt;archive&gt;&#8221; to the package name: for instance, &#8220;aptitude install
           apt/experimental&#8221;. You cannot specify both an archive and a version
           for a package.

           Not every package listed on the command line has to be installed; you
           can tell aptitude to do something different with a package by
           appending an &#8220;override specifier&#8221; to the name of the package. For
           example, aptitude remove wesnoth+ will install wesnoth, not remove
           it. The following override specifiers are available:

           &lt;package&gt;+
               Install &lt;package&gt;.

           &lt;package&gt;+M
               Install &lt;package&gt; and immediately mark it as automatically
               installed (note that if nothing depends on &lt;package&gt;, this will
               cause it to be immediately removed).

           &lt;package&gt;-
               Remove &lt;package&gt;.

           &lt;package&gt;_
               Purge &lt;package&gt;: remove it and all its associated configuration
               and data files.

           &lt;package&gt;=
               Place &lt;package&gt; on hold: cancel any active installation, upgrade,
               or removal, and prevent this package from being automatically
               upgraded in the future.

           &lt;package&gt;:
               Keep &lt;package&gt; at its current version: cancel any installation,
               removal, or upgrade. Unlike &#8220;hold&#8221; (above) this does not prevent
               automatic upgrades in the future.

           &lt;package&gt;&amp;M
               Mark &lt;package&gt; as having been automatically installed.

           &lt;package&gt;&amp;m
               Mark &lt;package&gt; as having been manually installed.

           As a special case, &#8220;install&#8221; with no arguments will act on any
           stored/pending actions.

               Note
               Once you enter Y at the final confirmation prompt, the &#8220;install&#8221;
               command will modify aptitude&apos;s stored information about what
               actions to perform. Therefore, if you issue (e.g.) the command
               &#8220;aptitude install foo bar&#8221; and then abort the installation once
               aptitude has started downloading and installing packages, you
               will need to run &#8220;aptitude remove foo bar&#8221; to cancel that order.

       remove, purge, hold, unhold, keep, reinstall
           These commands are the same as &#8220;install&#8221;, but apply the named action
           to all packages given on the command line for which it is not
           overridden. The difference between hold and keep is that hold will
           cause a package to be ignored by future safe-upgrade or full-upgrade
           commands, while keep merely cancels any scheduled actions on the
           package.  unhold will allow a package to be upgraded by future
           safe-upgrade or full-upgrade commands, without otherwise altering its
           state.

           For instance, &#8220;aptitude remove &apos;~ndeity&apos;&#8221; will remove all packages
           whose name contains &#8220;deity&#8221;.

       markauto, unmarkauto
           Mark packages as automatically installed or manually installed,
           respectively. Packages are specified in exactly the same way as for
           the &#8220;install&#8221; command. For instance, &#8220;aptitude markauto &apos;~slibs&apos;&#8221;
           will mark all packages in the &#8220;libs&#8221; section as having been
           automatically installed.

           For more information on automatically installed packages, see the
           section &#8220;Managing Automatically Installed Packages&#8221; in the aptitude
           reference manual.

       build-depends, build-dep
           Satisfy the build-dependencies of a package. Each package name may be
           a source package, in which case the build dependencies of that source
           package are installed; otherwise, binary packages are found in the
           same way as for the &#8220;install&#8221; command, and the build-dependencies of
           the source packages that build those binary packages are satisfied.

           If the command-line parameter --arch-only is present, only
           architecture-dependent build dependencies (i.e., not
           Build-Depends-Indep or Build-Conflicts-Indep) will be obeyed.

       forbid-version
           Forbid a package from being upgraded to a particular version. This
           will prevent aptitude from automatically upgrading to this version,
           but will allow automatic upgrades to future versions. By default,
           aptitude will select the version to which the package would normally
           be upgraded; you may override this selection by appending
           &#8220;=&lt;version&gt;&#8221; to the package name: for instance, &#8220;aptitude
           forbid-version vim=1.2.3.broken-4&#8221;.

           This command is useful for avoiding broken versions of packages
           without having to set and clear manual holds. If you decide you
           really want the forbidden version after all, &#8220;aptitude install
           &lt;package&gt;&#8221; will remove the ban.

       update
           Updates the list of available packages from the apt sources (this is
           equivalent to &#8220;apt-get update&#8221;)

       safe-upgrade
           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version. Installed
           packages will not be removed unless they are unused (see the section
           &#8220;Managing Automatically Installed Packages&#8221; in the aptitude reference
           manual). Packages which are not currently installed may be installed
           to resolve dependencies unless the --no-new-installs command-line
           option is supplied.

           If no &lt;package&gt;s are listed on the command line, aptitude will
           attempt to upgrade every package that can be upgraded. Otherwise,
           aptitude will attempt to upgrade only the packages which it is
           instructed to upgrade. The &lt;package&gt;s can be extended with suffixes
           in the same manner as arguments to aptitude install, so you can also
           give additional instructions to aptitude here; for instance, aptitude
           safe-upgrade bash dash- will attempt to upgrade the bash package and
           remove the dash package.

           It is sometimes necessary to remove one package in order to upgrade
           another; this command is not able to upgrade packages in such
           situations. Use the full-upgrade command to upgrade as many packages
           as possible.

       full-upgrade
           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version, removing or
           installing packages as necessary. This command is less conservative
           than safe-upgrade and thus more likely to perform unwanted actions.
           However, it is capable of upgrading packages that safe-upgrade cannot
           upgrade.

           If no &lt;package&gt;s are listed on the command line, aptitude will
           attempt to upgrade every package that can be upgraded. Otherwise,
           aptitude will attempt to upgrade only the packages which it is
           instructed to upgrade. The &lt;package&gt;s can be extended with suffixes
           in the same manner as arguments to aptitude install, so you can also
           give additional instructions to aptitude here; for instance, aptitude
           full-upgrade bash dash- will attempt to upgrade the bash package and
           remove the dash package.

               Note
               This command was originally named dist-upgrade for historical
               reasons, and aptitude still recognizes dist-upgrade as a synonym
               for full-upgrade.

       keep-all
           Cancels all scheduled actions on all packages; any packages whose
           sticky state indicates an installation, removal, or upgrade will have
           this sticky state cleared.

       forget-new
           Forgets all internal information about what packages are &#8220;new&#8221;
           (equivalent to pressing &#8220;f&#8221; when in visual mode).

       search
           Searches for packages matching one of the patterns supplied on the
           command line. All packages which match any of the given patterns will
           be displayed; for instance, &#8220;aptitude search &apos;~N&apos; edit&#8221; will list all
           &#8220;new&#8221; packages and all packages whose name contains &#8220;edit&#8221;. For more
           information on search patterns, see the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in
           the aptitude reference manual.

               Note
               In the example above, &#8220;aptitude search &apos;~N&apos; edit&#8221; has two
               arguments after search and thus is searching for two patterns:
               &#8220;~N&#8221; and &#8220;edit&#8221;. As described in the search pattern reference, a
               single pattern composed of two sub-patterns separated by a space
               (such as &#8220;~N edit&#8221;) matches only if both patterns match. Thus,
               the command &#8220;aptitude search &apos;~N edit&apos;&#8221; will only show &#8220;new&#8221;
               packages whose name contains &#8220;edit&#8221;.
           Unless you pass the -F option, the output of aptitude search will
           look something like this:

               i   apt                             - Advanced front-end for dpkg
               pi  apt-build                       - frontend to apt to build, optimize and in
               cp  apt-file                        - APT package searching utility -- command-
               ihA raptor-utils                    - Raptor RDF Parser utilities

           Each search result is listed on a separate line. The first character
           of each line indicates the current state of the package: the most
           common states are p, meaning that no trace of the package exists on
           the system, c, meaning that the package was deleted but its
           configuration files remain on the system, i, meaning that the package
           is installed, and v, meaning that the package is virtual. The second
           character indicates the stored action (if any; otherwise a blank
           space is displayed) to be performed on the package, with the most
           common actions being i, meaning that the package will be installed,
           d, meaning that the package will be deleted, and p, meaning that the
           package and its configuration files will be removed. If the third
           character is A, the package was automatically installed.

           For a complete list of the possible state and action flags, see the
           section &#8220;Accessing Package Information&#8221; in the aptitude reference
           guide. To customize the output of search, see the command-line
           options -F and --sort.

       show
           Displays detailed information about one or more packages, listed
           following the search command. If a package name contains a tilde
           character (&#8220;~&#8221;) or a question mark (&#8220;?&#8221;), it will be treated as a
           search pattern and all matching packages will be displayed (see the
           section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the aptitude reference manual).

           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater (i.e., at least one -v is
           present on the command-line), information about all versions of the
           package is displayed. Otherwise, information about the &#8220;candidate
           version&#8221; (the version that &#8220;aptitude install&#8221; would download) is
           displayed.

           You can display information about a different version of the package
           by appending =&lt;version&gt; to the package name; you can display the
           version from a particular archive or release by appending /&lt;archive&gt;
           or /&lt;release&gt; to the package name: for instance, /unstable or /sid.
           If either of these is present, then only the version you request will
           be displayed, regardless of the verbosity level.

           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater, the package&apos;s architecture,
           compressed size, filename, and md5sum fields will be displayed. If
           the verbosity level is 2 or greater, the select version or versions
           will be displayed once for each archive in which they are found.

       versions
           Displays the versions of the packages listed on the command-line.

               $ aptitude versions wesnoth
               p   1:1.4.5-1                                                             100
               p   1:1.6.5-1                                    unstable                 500
               p   1:1.7.14-1                                   experimental             1

           Each version is listed on a separate line. The leftmost three
           characters indicate the current state, planned state (if any), and
           whether the package was automatically installed; for more information
           on their meanings, see the documentation of aptitude search. To the
           right of the version number you can find the releases from which the
           version is available, and the pin priority of the version.

           If a package name contains a tilde character (&#8220;~&#8221;) or a question mark
           (&#8220;?&#8221;), it will be treated as a search pattern and all matching
           versions will be displayed (see the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the
           aptitude reference manual). This means that, for instance, aptitude
           versions &apos;~i&apos; will display all the versions that are currently
           installed on the system and nothing else, not even other versions of
           the same packages.

               $ aptitude versions &apos;~nexim4-daemon-light&apos;
               Package exim4-daemon-light:
               i   4.71-3                                                                100
               p   4.71-4                                       unstable                 500

               Package exim4-daemon-light-dbg:
               p   4.71-4                                       unstable                 500

           If the input is a search pattern, or if more than one package&apos;s
           versions are to be displayed, aptitude will automatically group the
           output by package, as shown above. You can disable this via
           --group-by=none, in which case aptitude will display a single list of
           all the versions that were found and automatically include the
           package name in each output line:

               $ aptitude versions --group-by=none &apos;~nexim4-daemon-light&apos;
               i   exim4-daemon-light 4.71-3                                             100
               p   exim4-daemon-light 4.71-4                    unstable                 500
               p   exim4-daemon-light-dbg 4.71-4                unstable                 500

           To disable the package name, pass --show-package-names=never:

               $ aptitude versions --show-package-names=never --group-by=none &apos;~nexim4-daemon-light&apos;
               i   4.71-3                                                                100
               p   4.71-4                                       unstable                 500
               p   4.71-4                                       unstable                 500

           In addition to the above options, the information printed for each
           version can be controlled by the command-line option -F. The order in
           which versions are displayed can be controlled by the command-line
           option --sort. To prevent aptitude from formatting the output into
           columns, use --disable-columns.

       add-user-tag, remove-user-tag
           Adds a user tag to or removes a user tag from the selected group of
           packages. If a package name contains a tilde (&#8220;~&#8221;) or question mark
           (&#8220;?&#8221;), it is treated as a search pattern and the tag is added to or
           removed from all the packages that match the pattern (see the section
           &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the aptitude reference manual).

           User tags are arbitrary strings associated with a package. They can
           be used with the ?user-tag(&lt;tag&gt;) search term, which will select all
           the packages that have a user tag matching &lt;tag&gt;.

       why, why-not
           Explains the reason that a particular package should or cannot be
           installed on the system.

           This command searches for packages that require or conflict with the
           given package. It displays a sequence of dependencies leading to the
           target package, along with a note indicating the installed state of
           each package in the dependency chain:

               $ aptitude why kdepim
               i   nautilus-data Recommends nautilus
               i A nautilus      Recommends desktop-base (&gt;= 0.2)
               i A desktop-base  Suggests   gnome | kde | xfce4 | wmaker
               p   kde           Depends    kdepim (&gt;= 4:3.4.3)

           The command why finds a dependency chain that installs the package
           named on the command line, as above. Note that the dependency that
           aptitude produced in this case is only a suggestion. This is because
           no package currently installed on this computer depends on or
           recommends the kdepim package; if a stronger dependency were
           available, aptitude would have displayed it.

           In contrast, why-not finds a dependency chain leading to a conflict
           with the target package:

               $ aptitude why-not textopo
               i   ocaml-core          Depends   ocamlweb
               i A ocamlweb            Depends   tetex-extra | texlive-latex-extra
               i A texlive-latex-extra Conflicts textopo

           If one or more &lt;pattern&gt;s are present, then aptitude will begin its
           search at these patterns; that is, the first package in the chain it
           prints will be a package matching the pattern in question. The
           patterns are considered to be package names unless they contain a
           tilde character (&#8220;~&#8221;) or a question mark (&#8220;?&#8221;), in which case they
           are treated as search patterns (see the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in
           the aptitude reference manual).

           If no patterns are present, then aptitude will search for dependency
           chains beginning at manually installed packages. This effectively
           shows the packages that have caused or would cause a given package to
           be installed.

               Note
               aptitude why does not perform full dependency resolution; it only
               displays direct relationships between packages. For instance, if
               A requires B, C requires D, and B and C conflict, &#8220;aptitude
               why-not D&#8221; will not produce the answer &#8220;A depends on B, B
               conflicts with C, and D depends on C&#8221;.
           By default aptitude outputs only the &#8220;most installed, strongest,
           tightest, shortest&#8221; dependency chain. That is, it looks for a chain
           that only contains packages which are installed or will be installed;
           it looks for the strongest possible dependencies under that
           restriction; it looks for chains that avoid ORed dependencies and
           Provides; and it looks for the shortest dependency chain meeting
           those criteria. These rules are progressively weakened until a match
           is found.

           If the verbosity level is 1 or more, then all the explanations
           aptitude can find will be displayed, in inverse order of relevance.
           If the verbosity level is 2 or more, a truly excessive amount of
           debugging information will be printed to standard output.

           This command returns 0 if successful, 1 if no explanation could be
           constructed, and -1 if an error occurred.

       clean
           Removes all previously downloaded .deb files from the package cache
           directory (usually /var/cache/apt/archives).

       autoclean
           Removes any cached packages which can no longer be downloaded. This
           allows you to prevent a cache from growing out of control over time
           without completely emptying it.

       changelog
           Downloads and displays the Debian changelog for each of the given
           source or binary packages.

           By default, the changelog for the version which would be installed
           with &#8220;aptitude install&#8221; is downloaded. You can select a particular
           version of a package by appending =&lt;version&gt; to the package name; you
           can select the version from a particular archive or release by
           appending /&lt;archive&gt; or /&lt;release&gt; to the package name (for instance,
           /unstable or /sid).

       download
           Downloads the .deb file for the given package to the current
           directory. If a package name contains a tilde character (&#8220;~&#8221;) or a
           question mark (&#8220;?&#8221;), it will be treated as a search pattern and all
           the matching packages will be downloaded (see the section &#8220;Search
           Patterns&#8221; in the aptitude reference manual).

           By default, the version which would be installed with &#8220;aptitude
           install&#8221; is downloaded. You can select a particular version of a
           package by appending =&lt;version&gt; to the package name; you can select
           the version from a particular archive or release by appending
           /&lt;archive&gt; or /&lt;release&gt; to the package name (for instance: /unstable
           or /sid).

       extract-cache-subset
           Copy the apt configuration directory (/etc/apt) and a subset of the
           package database to the specified directory. If no packages are
           listed, the entire package database is copied; otherwise only the
           entries corresponding to the named packages are copied. Each package
           name may be a search pattern, and all the packages matching that
           pattern will be selected (see the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the
           aptitude reference manual). Any existing package database files in
           the output directory will be overwritten.

           Dependencies in binary package stanzas will be rewritten to remove
           references to packages not in the selected set.

       help
           Displays a brief summary of the available commands and options.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used to modify the behavior of the actions
       described above. Note that while all options will be accepted for all
       commands, some options don&apos;t apply to particular commands and will be
       ignored by those commands.

       --add-user-tag &lt;tag&gt;
           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade, forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold, and
           unmarkauto: add the user tag &lt;tag&gt; to all packages that are
           installed, removed, or upgraded by this command as if with the
           add-user-tag command.

       --add-user-tag-to &lt;tag&gt;,&lt;pattern&gt;
           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold, and
           unmarkauto: add the user tag &lt;tag&gt; to all packages that match
           &lt;pattern&gt; as if with the add-user-tag command. The pattern is a
           search pattern as described in the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the
           aptitude reference manual.

           For instance, aptitude safe-upgrade --add-user-tag-to
           &quot;new-installs,?action(install)&quot; will add the tag new-installs to all
           the packages installed by the safe-upgrade command.

       --allow-new-upgrades
           When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
           passed, the action is safe-upgrade, or
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow the
           dependency resolver to install upgrades for packages regardless of
           the value of Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Upgrades.

       --allow-new-installs
           Allow the safe-upgrade command to install new packages; when the safe
           resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was passed, the action
           is safe-upgrade, or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to
           true), allow the dependency resolver to install new packages. This
           option takes effect regardless of the value of
           Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.

       --allow-untrusted
           Install packages from untrusted sources without prompting. You should
           only use this if you know what you are doing, as it could easily
           compromise your system&apos;s security.

       --disable-columns
           This option causes aptitude search and aptitude versions to output
           their results without any special formatting. In particular: normally
           aptitude will add whitespace or truncate search results in an attempt
           to fit its results into vertical &#8220;columns&#8221;. With this flag, each line
           will be formed by replacing any format escapes in the format string
           with the corresponding text; column widths will be ignored.

           For instance, the first few lines of output from &#8220;aptitude search -F
           &apos;%p %V&apos; --disable-columns libedataserver&#8221; might be:

               disksearch 1.2.1-3
               hp-search-mac 0.1.3
               libbsearch-ruby 1.5-5
               libbsearch-ruby1.8 1.5-5
               libclass-dbi-abstractsearch-perl 0.07-2
               libdbix-fulltextsearch-perl 0.73-10

           As in the above example, --disable-columns is often useful in
           combination with a custom display format set using the command-line
           option -F.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Disable-Columns.

       -D, --show-deps
           For commands that will install or remove packages (install,
           full-upgrade, etc), show brief explanations of automatic
           installations and removals.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Deps.

       -d, --download-only
           Download packages to the package cache as necessary, but do not
           install or remove anything. By default, the package cache is stored
           in /var/cache/apt/archives.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Download-Only.

       -F &lt;format&gt;, --display-format &lt;format&gt;
           Specify the format which should be used to display output from the
           search and versions commands. For instance, passing &#8220;%p %V %v&#8221; for
           &lt;format&gt; will display a package&apos;s name, followed by its currently
           installed version and its available version (see the section
           &#8220;Customizing how packages are displayed&#8221; in the aptitude reference
           manual for more information).

           The command-line option --disable-columns is often useful in
           combination with -F.

           For search, this corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Format; for versions, this
           corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Version-Display-Format.

       -f
           Try hard to fix the dependencies of broken packages, even if it means
           ignoring the actions requested on the command line.

           This corresponds to the configuration item
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Fix-Broken.

       --full-resolver
           When package dependency problems are encountered, use the default
           &#8220;full&#8221; resolver to solve them. Unlike the &#8220;safe&#8221; resolver activated
           by --safe-resolver, the full resolver will happily remove packages to
           fulfill dependencies. It can resolve more situations than the safe
           algorithm, but its solutions are more likely to be undesirable.

           This option can be used to force the use of the full resolver even
           when Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is true. The safe-upgrade
           command never uses the full resolver and does not accept the
           --full-resolver option.

       --group-by &lt;grouping-mode&gt;
           Control how the versions command groups its output. The following
           values are recognized:

           &#183;    archive to group packages by the archive they occur in
               (&#8220;stable&#8221;, &#8220;unstable&#8221;, etc). If a package occurs in several
               archives, it will be displayed in each of them.

           &#183;    auto to group versions by their package unless there is exactly
               one argument and it is not a search pattern.

           &#183;    none to display all the versions in a single list without any
               grouping.

           &#183;    package to group versions by their package.

           &#183;    source-package to group versions by their source package.

           &#183;    source-version to group versions by their source package and
               source version.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Versions-Group-By.

       -h, --help
           Display a brief help message. Identical to the help action.

       --log-file=&lt;file&gt;
           If &lt;file&gt; is a nonempty string, log messages will be written to it,
           except that if &lt;file&gt; is &#8220;-&#8221;, the messages will be written to
           standard output instead. If this option appears multiple times, the
           last occurrence is the one that will take effect.

           This does not affect the log of installations that aptitude has
           performed (/var/log/aptitude); the log messages written using this
           configuration include internal program events, errors, and debugging
           messages. See the command-line option --log-level to get more control
           over what gets logged.

           This corresponds to the configuration option Aptitude::Logging::File.

       --log-level=&lt;level&gt;, --log-level=&lt;category&gt;:&lt;level&gt;

           --log-level=&lt;level&gt; causes aptitude to only log messages whose level
           is &lt;level&gt; or higher. For instance, setting the log level to error
           will cause only messages at the log levels error and fatal to be
           displayed; all others will be hidden. Valid log levels (in descending
           order) are off, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, and trace. The
           default log level is warn.


           --log-level=&lt;category&gt;:&lt;level&gt; causes messages in &lt;category&gt; to only
           be logged if their level is &lt;level&gt; or higher.


           --log-level may appear multiple times on the command line; the most
           specific setting is the one that takes effect, so if you pass
           --log-level=aptitude.resolver:fatal and
           --log-level=aptitude.resolver.hints.match:trace, then messages in
           aptitude.resolver.hints.parse will only be printed if their level is
           fatal, but all messages in aptitude.resolver.hints.match will be
           printed. If you set the level of the same category two or more times,
           the last setting is the one that will take effect.

           This does not affect the log of installations that aptitude has
           performed (/var/log/aptitude); the log messages written using this
           configuration include internal program events, errors, and debugging
           messages. See the command-line option --log-file to change where log
           messages go.

           This corresponds to the configuration group
           Aptitude::Logging::Levels.

       --log-resolver
           Set some standard log levels related to the resolver, to produce
           logging output suitable for processing with automated tools. This is
           equivalent to the command-line options
           --log-level=aptitude.resolver.search:trace
           --log-level=aptitude.resolver.search.tiers:info.

       --no-new-installs
           Prevent safe-upgrade from installing any new packages; when the safe
           resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was passed or
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), forbid the
           dependency resolver from installing new packages. This option takes
           effect regardless of the value of
           Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.

           This mimics the historical behavior of apt-get upgrade.

       --no-new-upgrades
           When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
           passed or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), forbid
           the dependency resolver from installing upgrades for packages
           regardless of the value of Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Upgrades.

       --no-show-resolver-actions
           Do not display the actions performed by the &#8220;safe&#8221; resolver,
           overriding any configuration option or earlier
           --show-resolver-actions.

       -O &lt;order&gt;, --sort &lt;order&gt;
           Specify the order in which output from the search and versions
           commands should be displayed. For instance, passing &#8220;installsize&#8221; for
           &lt;order&gt; will list packages in order according to their size when
           installed (see the section &#8220;Customizing how packages are sorted&#8221; in
           the aptitude reference manual for more information).

           The default sort order is name,version.

       -o &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
           Set a configuration file option directly; for instance, use -o
           Aptitude::Log=/tmp/my-log to log aptitude&apos;s actions to /tmp/my-log.
           For more information on configuration file options, see the section
           &#8220;Configuration file reference&#8221; in the aptitude reference manual.

       -P, --prompt
           Always display a prompt before downloading, installing or removing
           packages, even when no actions other than those explicitly requested
           will be performed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Always-Prompt.

       --purge-unused
           If Aptitude::Delete-Unused is set to &#8220;true&#8221; (its default), then in
           addition to removing each package that is no longer required by any
           installed package, aptitude will also purge them, removing their
           configuration files and perhaps other important data. For more
           information about which packages are considered to be &#8220;unused&#8221;, see
           the section &#8220;Managing Automatically Installed Packages&#8221; in the
           aptitude reference manual.  THIS OPTION CAN CAUSE DATA LOSS! DO NOT
           USE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

           This corresponds to the configuration option Aptitude::Purge-Unused.

       -q[=&lt;n&gt;], --quiet[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Suppress all incremental progress indicators, thus making the output
           loggable. This may be supplied multiple times to make the program
           quieter, but unlike apt-get, aptitude does not enable -y when -q is
           supplied more than once.

           The optional =&lt;n&gt; may be used to directly set the amount of quietness
           (for instance, to override a setting in /etc/apt/apt.conf); it causes
           the program to behave as if -q had been passed exactly &lt;n&gt; times.

       -R, --without-recommends
           Do not treat recommendations as dependencies when installing new
           packages (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf and
           ~/.aptitude/config). Packages previously installed due to
           recommendations will not be removed.

           This corresponds to the pair of configuration options
           Apt::Install-Recommends and Apt::AutoRemove::InstallRecommends.

       -r, --with-recommends
           Treat recommendations as dependencies when installing new packages
           (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf and
           ~/.aptitude/config).

           This corresponds to the configuration option Apt::Install-Recommends

       --remove-user-tag &lt;tag&gt;
           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold, and
           unmarkauto: remove the user tag &lt;tag&gt; from all packages that are
           installed, removed, or upgraded by this command as if with the
           add-user-tag command.

       --remove-user-tag-from &lt;tag&gt;,&lt;pattern&gt;
           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold, and
           unmarkauto: remove the user tag &lt;tag&gt; from all packages that match
           &lt;pattern&gt; as if with the remove-user-tag command. The pattern is a
           search pattern as described in the section &#8220;Search Patterns&#8221; in the
           aptitude reference manual.

           For instance, aptitude safe-upgrade --remove-user-tag-from
           &quot;not-upgraded,?action(upgrade)&quot; will remove the not-upgraded tag from
           all packages that the safe-upgrade command is able to upgrade.

       -s, --simulate
           In command-line mode, print the actions that would normally be
           performed, but don&apos;t actually perform them. This does not require
           root privileges. In the visual interface, always open the cache in
           read-only mode regardless of whether you are root.

           This corresponds to the configuration option Aptitude::Simulate.

       --safe-resolver
           When package dependency problems are encountered, use a &#8220;safe&#8221;
           algorithm to solve them. This resolver attempts to preserve as many
           of your choices as possible; it will never remove a package or
           install a version of a package other than the package&apos;s default
           candidate version. It is the same algorithm used in safe-upgrade;
           indeed, aptitude --safe-resolver full-upgrade is equivalent to
           aptitude safe-upgrade. Because safe-upgrade always uses the safe
           resolver, it does not accept the --safe-resolver flag.

           This option is equivalent to setting the configuration variable
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver to true.

       --schedule-only
           For commands that modify package states, schedule operations to be
           performed in the future, but don&apos;t perform them. You can execute
           scheduled actions by running aptitude install with no arguments. This
           is equivalent to making the corresponding selections in visual mode,
           then exiting the program normally.

           For instance, aptitude --schedule-only install evolution will
           schedule the evolution package for later installation.

       --show-package-names &lt;when&gt;
           Controls when the versions command shows package names. The following
           settings are allowed:

           &#183;    always: display package names every time that aptitude versions
               runs.

           &#183;    auto: display package names when aptitude versions runs if the
               output is not grouped by package, and either there is a
               pattern-matching argument or there is more than one argument.

           &#183;    never: never display package names in the output of aptitude
               versions.

           This option corresponds to the configuration item
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Versions-Show-Package-Names.

       --show-resolver-actions
           Display the actions performed by the &#8220;safe&#8221; resolver and by
           safe-upgrade.

           When executing the command safe-upgrade or when the option
           --safe-resolver is present, aptitude will display a summary of the
           actions performed by the resolver before printing the installation
           preview. This is equivalent to the configuration option
           Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::Show-Resolver-Actions.

       --show-summary[=&lt;MODE&gt;]
           Changes the behavior of &#8220;aptitude why&#8221; to summarize each dependency
           chain that it outputs, rather than displaying it in long form. If
           this option is present and &lt;MODE&gt; is not &#8220;no-summary&#8221;, chains that
           contain Suggests dependencies will not be displayed: combine
           --show-summary with -v to see a summary of all the reasons for the
           target package to be installed.


           &lt;MODE&gt; can be any one of the following:

            1.  no-summary: don&apos;t show a summary (the default behavior if
               --show-summary is not present).

            2.  first-package: display the first package in each chain. This is
               the default value of &lt;MODE&gt; if it is not present.

            3.  first-package-and-type: display the first package in each chain,
               along with the strength of the weakest dependency in the chain.

            4.  all-packages: briefly display each chain of dependencies leading
               to the target package.

            5.  all-packages-with-dep-versions: briefly display each chain of
               dependencies leading to the target package, including the target
               version of each dependency.

           This option corresponds to the configuration item
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Summary; if --show-summary is present on the
           command-line, it will override Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Summary.

           Example 10. Usage of --show-summary

           --show-summary used with -v to display all the reasons a package is
           installed:

               $ aptitude -v --show-summary why foomatic-db

           --show-summary used to list a chain on one line:

               $ aptitude --show-summary=all-packages why aptitude-gtk libglib2.0-data
               Packages requiring libglib2.0-data:
                 aptitude-gtk D: libglib2.0-0 R: libglib2.0-data

       -t &lt;release&gt;, --target-release &lt;release&gt;
           Set the release from which packages should be installed. For
           instance, &#8220;aptitude -t experimental ...&#8221;  will install packages from
           the experimental distribution unless you specify otherwise. For the
           command-line actions &#8220;changelog&#8221;, &#8220;download&#8221;, and &#8220;show&#8221;, this is
           equivalent to appending /&lt;release&gt; to each package named on the
           command-line; for other commands, this will affect the default
           candidate version of packages according to the rules described in
           apt_preferences(5).

           This corresponds to the configuration item APT::Default-Release.

       -V, --show-versions
           Show which versions of packages will be installed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Versions.

       -v, --verbose
           Causes some commands (for instance, show) to display extra
           information. This may be supplied multiple times to get more and more
           information.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Verbose.

       --version
           Display the version of aptitude and some information about how it was
           compiled.

       --visual-preview
           When installing or removing packages from the command line, instead
           of displaying the usual prompt, start up the visual interface and
           display its preview screen.

       -W, --show-why
           In the preview displayed before packages are installed or removed,
           show which manually installed package requires each automatically
           installed package. For instance:

               $ aptitude --show-why install mediawiki
               ...
               The following NEW packages will be installed:
                 libapache2-mod-php5{a} (for mediawiki)  mediawiki  php5{a} (for mediawiki)
                 php5-cli{a} (for mediawiki)  php5-common{a} (for mediawiki)
                 php5-mysql{a} (for mediawiki)

           When combined with -v or a non-zero value for
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Verbose, this displays the entire chain of
           dependencies that lead each package to be installed. For instance:

               $ aptitude -v --show-why install libdb4.2-dev
               The following NEW packages will be installed:
                 libdb4.2{a} (libdb4.2-dev D: libdb4.2)  libdb4.2-dev
               The following packages will be REMOVED:
                 libdb4.4-dev{a} (libdb4.2-dev C: libdb-dev P&lt;- libdb-dev)

           This option will also describe why packages are being removed, as
           shown above. In this example, libdb4.2-dev conflicts with libdb-dev,
           which is provided by libdb-dev.

           This argument corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Why and displays the same information that is
           computed by aptitude why and aptitude why-not.

       -w &lt;width&gt;, --width &lt;width&gt;
           Specify the display width which should be used for output from the
           search command (by default, the terminal width is used).

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Width

       -y, --assume-yes
           When a yes/no prompt would be presented, assume that the user entered
           &#8220;yes&#8221;. In particular, suppresses the prompt that appears when
           installing, upgrading, or removing packages. Prompts for &#8220;dangerous&#8221;
           actions, such as removing essential packages, will still be
           displayed. This option overrides -P.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Assume-Yes.

       -Z
           Show how much disk space will be used or freed by the individual
           packages being installed, upgraded, or removed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Size-Changes.

       The following options apply to the visual mode of the program, but are
       primarily for internal use; you generally won&apos;t need to use them
       yourself.

       --autoclean-on-startup
           Deletes old downloaded files when the program starts (equivalent to
           starting the program and immediately selecting Actions &#8594; Clean
           obsolete files). You cannot use this option and
           &#8220;--autoclean-on-startup&#8221;, &#8220;-i&#8221;, or &#8220;-u&#8221; at the same time.

       --clean-on-startup
           Cleans the package cache when the program starts (equivalent to
           starting the program and immediately selecting Actions &#8594; Clean
           package cache). You cannot use this option and
           &#8220;--autoclean-on-startup&#8221;, &#8220;-i&#8221;, or &#8220;-u&#8221; at the same time.

       -i
           Displays a download preview when the program starts (equivalent to
           starting the program and immediately pressing &#8220;g&#8221;). You cannot use
           this option and &#8220;--autoclean-on-startup&#8221;, &#8220;--clean-on-startup&#8221;, or
           &#8220;-u&#8221; at the same time.

       -S &lt;fname&gt;
           Loads the extended state information from &lt;fname&gt; instead of the
           standard state file.

       -u
           Begins updating the package lists as soon as the program starts. You
           cannot use this option and &#8220;--autoclean-on-startup&#8221;,
           &#8220;--clean-on-startup&#8221;, or &#8220;-i&#8221; at the same time.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           If $HOME/.aptitude exists, aptitude will store its configuration file
           in $HOME/.aptitude/config. Otherwise, it will look up the current
           user&apos;s home directory using getpwuid(2) and place its configuration
           file there.

       PAGER
           If this environment variable is set, aptitude will use it to display
           changelogs when &#8220;aptitude changelog&#8221; is invoked. If not set, it
           defaults to more.

       TMP
           If TMPDIR is unset, aptitude will store its temporary files in TMP if
           that variable is set. Otherwise, it will store them in /tmp.

       TMPDIR

           aptitude will store its temporary files in the directory indicated by
           this environment variable. If TMPDIR is not set, then TMP will be
           used; if TMP is also unset, then aptitude will use /tmp.

FILES
       /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates
           The file in which stored package states and some package flags are
           stored.

       /etc/apt/apt.conf, /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*, ~/.aptitude/config
           The configuration files for aptitude.  ~/.aptitude/config overrides
           /etc/apt/apt.conf. See apt.conf(5) for documentation of the format
           and contents of these files.
