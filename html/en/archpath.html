ARCHPATH(1)                                                          ARCHPATH(1)



NAME
       archpath  -  output  arch  (tla/Bazaar)  archive  names, with support for
       branches

SYNOPSIS
       archpath
       archpath branch
       archpath branch--version

DESCRIPTION
       archpath is intended to be run in an arch (tla or Bazaar) working copy.

       In its simplest usage, archpath with no parameters  outputs  the  package
       name  (archive/category--branch--version)  associated  with  the  working
       copy.

       If a parameter is given, it may either be  a  branch--version,  in  which
       case archpath will output a corresponding package name in the current ar&#8208;
       chive and category, or a plain branch name (without &#8216;--&quot;), in which  case
       archpath  will output a corresponding package name in the current archive
       and category and with the same version as the current working copy.

       This is useful for branching.  For example, if you&apos;re  using  Bazaar  and
       you  want  to  create a branch for a new feature, you might use a command
       like this:

              baz branch $(archpath) $(archpath new-feature)

       Or if you want to tag your current code onto a &#8216;releases&#8217; branch as  ver&#8208;
       sion 1.0, you might use a command like this:

              baz branch $(archpath) $(archpath releases--1.0)

       That&apos;s  much  easier than using &#8216;baz tree-version&#8217; to look up the package
       name and manually modifying the result.
