ARDOUR(1)                                                              ARDOUR(1)



NAME
       ardour - a digital audio workstation

SYNOPSIS
       ardour -b [-U file] [session]
       ardour --help

DESCRIPTION
       Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio work&#8208;
       station (DAW).  It is capable of simultaneous recording 24 or more  chan&#8208;
       nels of 32 bit audio at 48kHz.  Ardour is intended to function as a &quot;pro&#8208;
       fessional&quot; HDR system, replacing dedicated hardware solutions such as the
       Mackie  HDR,  the  Tascam 2424 and more traditional tape systems like the
       Alesis ADAT series.  It is also intended to provide the  same  or  better
       functionality  as  software  systems  such as ProTools, Samplitude, Logic
       Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST (we acknowledge these and all other names as
       trademarks  of  their  respective owners).  It supports MIDI Machine Con&#8208;
       trol, and so can be controlled from  any  MMC  controller,  such  as  the
       Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern digital mixers.

OPTIONS
       -b     Print all possible keyboard binding names.

       -U     Specify  the  path to the GTK RC file to use.  The provided one is
              called ardour_ui.rc and lives  in  the  top  level  Ardour  source
              directory.   This  file  controls  all  color  and font use within
              Ardour.  Ardour will run without it, but its appearance  is,  uhm,
              ugly.

       --help Displays the help message.
