ARPING(8)               System Manager&apos;s Manual: iputils               ARPING(8)



NAME
       arping - send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host

SYNOPSIS
       arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-s source] -I interface des&#8208;
       tination


DESCRIPTION
       Ping destination on device interface by ARP packets, using source address
       source.

OPTIONS
       -A     The same as -U, but ARP REPLY packets used instead of ARP REQUEST.

       -b     Send  only MAC level broadcasts. Normally arping starts from send&#8208;
              ing broadcast, and switch to unicast after reply received.

       -c count
              Stop after  sending  count  ARP  REQUEST  packets.  With  deadline
              option,  arping waits for count ARP REPLY packets, until the time&#8208;
              out expires.

       -D     Duplicate  address  detection  mode  (DAD).  See  RFC2131,  4.4.1.
              Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies are received

       -f     Finish after the first reply confirming that target is alive.

       -I interface
              Name  of  network  device  where to send ARP REQUEST packets. This
              option is required.

       -h     Print help page and exit.

       -q     Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.

       -s source
              IP source address to use  in  ARP  packets.   If  this  option  is
              absent, source address is:

              &#183; In DAD mode (with option -D) set to 0.0.0.0.

              &#183; In  Unsolicited ARP mode (with options -U or -A) set to destina&#8208;
                tion.

              &#183; Otherwise, it is calculated from routing tables.

       -U     Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours&apos; ARP caches.  No replies
              are expected.

       -V     Print version of the program and exit.

       -w deadline
              Specify  a  timeout, in seconds, before arping exits regardless of
              how many packets have been sent or received. In this  case  arping
              does  not  stop  after  count packet are sent, it waits either for
              deadline expire or until count probes are answered.

SEE ALSO
       ping(8), clockdiff(8), tracepath(8).

AUTHOR
       arping was written by Alexey Kuznetsov &lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;.  It is now
       maintained by YOSHIFUJI Hideaki &lt;yoshfuji@skbuff.net&gt;.

SECURITY
       arping requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be executed. It is not recom&#8208;
       mended to be used as set-uid root, because it allows user to  modify  ARP
       caches of neighbour hosts.

AVAILABILITY
       arping  is part of iputils package and the latest versions are  available
       in source form at http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.
