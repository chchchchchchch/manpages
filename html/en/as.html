DESCRIPTION
       GNU as is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used) the
       GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
       environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has
       much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
       assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.

       as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler
       &quot;gcc&quot; for use by the linker &quot;ld&quot;.  Nevertheless, we&apos;ve tried to make as
       assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same machine
       would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.  This doesn&apos;t
       mean as always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same
       architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible versions of
       680x0 assembly language syntax.

       Each time you run as it assembles exactly one source program.  The source
       program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input is also a
       file.)

       You give as a command line that has zero or more input file names.  The
       input files are read (from left file name to right).  A command line
       argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to be an
       input file name.

       If you give as no file names it attempts to read one input file from the
       as standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may have to type
       ctl-D to tell as there is no more program to assemble.

       Use -- if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in your
       command line.

       If the source is empty, as produces a small, empty object file.

       as may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file
       (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler runs as
       automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that as could keep
       assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that stops the
       assembly.

       If you are invoking as via the GNU C compiler, you can use the -Wa option
       to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The assembler arguments must
       be separated from each other (and the -Wa) by commas.  For example:

               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

       This passes two options to the assembler: -alh (emit a listing to
       standard output with high-level and assembly source) and -L (retain local
       symbols in the symbol table).

       Usually you do not need to use this -Wa mechanism, since many compiler
       command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler by the
       compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the -v option to
       see precisely what options it passes to each compilation pass, including
       the assembler.)

OPTIONS
       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.

       -a[cdghlmns]
           Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

           -ac omit false conditionals

           -ad omit debugging directives

           -ag include general information, like as version and options passed

           -ah include high-level source

           -al include assembly

           -am include macro expansions

           -an omit forms processing

           -as include symbols

           =file
               set the name of the listing file

           You may combine these options; for example, use -aln for assembly
           listing without forms processing.  The =file option, if used, must be
           the last one.  By itself, -a defaults to -ahls.

       --alternate
           Begin in alternate macro mode.

       --compress-debug-sections
           Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib.  The debug sections are
           renamed to begin with .zdebug, and the resulting object file may not
           be compatible with older linkers and object file utilities.

       --nocompress-debug-sections
           Do not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is the default.

       -D  Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with calls
           to other assemblers.

       --debug-prefix-map old=new
           When assembling files in directory old, record debugging information
           describing them as in new instead.

       --defsym sym=value
           Define the symbol sym to be value before assembling the input file.
           value must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading 0x indicates a
           hexadecimal value, and a leading 0 indicates an octal value.  The
           value of the symbol can be overridden inside a source file via the
           use of a &quot;.set&quot; pseudo-op.

       -f  &quot;fast&quot;---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
           compiler output).

       -g
       --gen-debug
           Generate debugging information for each assembler source line using
           whichever debug format is preferred by the target.  This currently
           means either STABS, ECOFF or DWARF2.

       --gstabs
           Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This
           may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.

       --gstabs+
           Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line, with
           GNU extensions that probably only gdb can handle, and that could make
           other debuggers crash or refuse to read your program.  This may help
           debugging assembler code.  Currently the only GNU extension is the
           location of the current working directory at assembling time.

       --gdwarf-2
           Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler line.  This
           may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.
           Note---this option is only supported by some targets, not all of
           them.

       --size-check=error
       --size-check=warning
           Issue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.

       --help
           Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       --target-help
           Print a summary of all target specific options and exit.

       -I dir
           Add directory dir to the search list for &quot;.include&quot; directives.

       -J  Don&apos;t warn about signed overflow.

       -K  Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.

       -L
       --keep-locals
           Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols start with
           system-specific local label prefixes, typically .L for ELF systems or
           L for traditional a.out systems.

       --listing-lhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for an
           assembler listing to number.

       --listing-lhs-width2=number
           Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for
           continuation lines in an assembler listing to number.

       --listing-rhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width of an input source line, as displayed in a
           listing, to number bytes.

       --listing-cont-lines=number
           Set the maximum number of lines printed in a listing for a single
           line of input to number + 1.

       -o objfile
           Name the object-file output from as objfile.

       -R  Fold the data section into the text section.

           Set the default size of GAS&apos;s hash tables to a prime number close to
           number.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of time it takes
           the assembler to perform its tasks, at the expense of increasing the
           assembler&apos;s memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this value can
           reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.

       --reduce-memory-overheads
           This option reduces GAS&apos;s memory requirements, at the expense of
           making the assembly processes slower.  Currently this switch is a
           synonym for --hash-size=4051, but in the future it may have other
           effects as well.

       --statistics
           Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used
           by assembly.

       --strip-local-absolute
           Remove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.

       -v
       -version
           Print the as version.

       --version
           Print the as version and exit.

       -W
       --no-warn
           Suppress warning messages.

       --fatal-warnings
           Treat warnings as errors.

       --warn
           Don&apos;t suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.

       -w  Ignored.

       -x  Ignored.

       -Z  Generate an object file even after errors.

       -- | files ...
           Standard input, or source files to assemble.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Alpha
       processor.

       -mcpu
           This option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is made to
           assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target
           processor, the assembler may either expand the instruction as a macro
           or issue an error message.  This option is equivalent to the &quot;.arch&quot;
           directive.

           The following processor names are recognized: 21064, &quot;21064a&quot;, 21066,
           21068, 21164, &quot;21164a&quot;, &quot;21164pc&quot;, 21264, &quot;21264a&quot;, &quot;21264b&quot;, &quot;ev4&quot;,
           &quot;ev5&quot;, &quot;lca45&quot;, &quot;ev5&quot;, &quot;ev56&quot;, &quot;pca56&quot;, &quot;ev6&quot;, &quot;ev67&quot;, &quot;ev68&quot;.  The
           special name &quot;all&quot; may be used to allow the assembler to accept
           instructions valid for any Alpha processor.

           In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to
           &quot;.arch&quot;, and existing practice within MILO (the Linux ARC
           bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable the
           processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the &quot;electro-vlasic&quot;
           names (e.g. &quot;ev4&quot;) do not.

       -mdebug
       -no-mdebug
           Enables or disables the generation of &quot;.mdebug&quot; encapsulation for
           stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default is to
           automatically enable &quot;.mdebug&quot; when the first stabs directive is
           seen.

       -relax
           This option forces all relocations to be put into the object file,
           instead of saving space and resolving some relocations at assembly
           time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol arithmetic
           into the object file, because not all symbol arithmetic can be
           represented.  However, the option can still be useful in specific
           applications.

       -replace
       -noreplace
           Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at
           assemblage and at link time.  These options are only available for
           VMS targets and &quot;-replace&quot; is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of the
           OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.

       -g  This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.
           When gcc is using mips-tfile to generate debug information for ECOFF,
           local labels must be passed through to the object file.  Otherwise
           this option has no effect.

       -Gsize
           A local common symbol larger than size is placed in &quot;.bss&quot;, while
           smaller symbols are placed in &quot;.sbss&quot;.

       -F
       -32addr
           These options are ignored for backward compatibility.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an ARC
       processor.

       -marc[5|6|7|8]
           This option selects the core processor variant.

           Select which procedure calling convention is in use.

       -EB | -EL
           Select either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL) output.

       -mthumb-interwork
           Specify that the code has been generated with interworking between
           Thumb and ARM code in mind.

       -k  Specify that PIC code has been generated.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the
       Blackfin processor family.

       -mcpu=processor[-sirevision]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The optional sirevision
           is not used in assembler.  It&apos;s here such that GCC can easily pass
           down its &quot;-mcpu=&quot; option.  The assembler will issue an error message
           if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not
           execute on the target processor.  The following processor names are
           recognized: &quot;bf504&quot;, &quot;bf506&quot;, &quot;bf512&quot;, &quot;bf514&quot;, &quot;bf516&quot;, &quot;bf518&quot;,
           &quot;bf522&quot;, &quot;bf523&quot;, &quot;bf524&quot;, &quot;bf525&quot;, &quot;bf526&quot;, &quot;bf527&quot;, &quot;bf531&quot;,
           &quot;bf532&quot;, &quot;bf533&quot;, &quot;bf534&quot;, &quot;bf535&quot; (not implemented yet), &quot;bf536&quot;,
           &quot;bf537&quot;, &quot;bf538&quot;, &quot;bf539&quot;, &quot;bf542&quot;, &quot;bf542m&quot;, &quot;bf544&quot;, &quot;bf544m&quot;,
           &quot;bf547&quot;, &quot;bf547m&quot;, &quot;bf548&quot;, &quot;bf548m&quot;, &quot;bf549&quot;, &quot;bf549m&quot;, &quot;bf561&quot;, and
           &quot;bf592&quot;.

       -mfdpic
           Assemble for the FDPIC ABI.

       -mno-fdpic
       -mnopic
           Disable -mfdpic.

       See the info pages for documentation of the CRIS-specific options.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a D10V
       processor.

       -O  Optimize output by parallelizing instructions.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a D30V
       processor.

       -O  Optimize output by parallelizing instructions.

       -n  Warn when nops are generated.

       -N  Warn when a nop after a 32-bit multiply instruction is generated.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an i386
       processor.

       --32 | --x32 | --64
           Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  --32 implies Intel
           i386 architecture, while --x32 and --64 imply AMD x86-64 architecture
           with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

           These options are only available with the ELF object file format, and
           require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a 32-bit
           platform you have to add --enable-64-bit-bfd to configure enable
           64-bit usage and use x86-64 as target platform).

       -n  By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for
           alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions such
           as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the optimization.

       --divide
           On SVR4-derived platforms, the character / is treated as a comment
           character, which means that it cannot be used in expressions.  The
           --divide option turns / into a normal character.  This does not
           disable / at the beginning of a line starting a comment, or affect
           using # for starting a comment.

       -march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue
           an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction
           which will not execute on the target processor.  The following
           processor names are recognized: &quot;i8086&quot;, &quot;i186&quot;, &quot;i286&quot;, &quot;i386&quot;,
           &quot;i486&quot;, &quot;i586&quot;, &quot;i686&quot;, &quot;pentium&quot;, &quot;pentiumpro&quot;, &quot;pentiumii&quot;,
           &quot;pentiumiii&quot;, &quot;pentium4&quot;, &quot;prescott&quot;, &quot;nocona&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, &quot;core2&quot;,
           &quot;corei7&quot;, &quot;l1om&quot;, &quot;k1om&quot;, &quot;k6&quot;, &quot;k6_2&quot;, &quot;athlon&quot;, &quot;opteron&quot;, &quot;k8&quot;,
           &quot;amdfam10&quot;, &quot;bdver1&quot;, &quot;bdver2&quot;, &quot;generic32&quot; and &quot;generic64&quot;.

           In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told
           to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,
           &quot;-march=i686+sse4+vmx&quot; extends i686 with sse4 and vmx.  The following
           extensions are currently supported: 8087, 287, 387, &quot;no87&quot;, &quot;mmx&quot;,
           &quot;nommx&quot;, &quot;sse&quot;, &quot;sse2&quot;, &quot;sse3&quot;, &quot;ssse3&quot;, &quot;sse4.1&quot;, &quot;sse4.2&quot;, &quot;sse4&quot;,
           &quot;nosse&quot;, &quot;avx&quot;, &quot;avx2&quot;, &quot;noavx&quot;, &quot;vmx&quot;, &quot;smx&quot;, &quot;xsave&quot;, &quot;xsaveopt&quot;,
           &quot;aes&quot;, &quot;pclmul&quot;, &quot;fsgsbase&quot;, &quot;rdrnd&quot;, &quot;f16c&quot;, &quot;bmi2&quot;, &quot;fma&quot;, &quot;movbe&quot;,
           &quot;ept&quot;, &quot;lzcnt&quot;, &quot;invpcid&quot;, &quot;clflush&quot;, &quot;lwp&quot;, &quot;fma4&quot;, &quot;xop&quot;,
           &quot;syscall&quot;, &quot;rdtscp&quot;, &quot;3dnow&quot;, &quot;3dnowa&quot;, &quot;sse4a&quot;, &quot;sse5&quot;, &quot;svme&quot;,
           &quot;abm&quot; and &quot;padlock&quot;.  Note that rather than extending a basic
           instruction set, the extension mnemonics starting with &quot;no&quot; revoke
           the respective functionality.

           When the &quot;.arch&quot; directive is used with -march, the &quot;.arch&quot; directive
           will take precedent.

       -mtune=CPU
           This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used in
           conjunction with the -march option, only instructions of the
           processor specified by the -march option will be generated.

           Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of -march=CPU.

       -msse2avx
           This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE
           instructions with VEX prefix.

       -msse-check=none
       -msse-check=warning
       -msse-check=error
           These options control if the assembler should check SSE intructions.
           -msse-check=none will make the assembler not to check SSE
           instructions,  which is the default.  -msse-check=warning will make
           the assembler issue a warning for any SSE intruction.
           -msse-check=error will make the assembler issue an error for any SSE
           intruction.

       -mavxscalar=128
       -mavxscalar=256
           These options control how the assembler should encode scalar AVX
           instructions.  -mavxscalar=128 will encode scalar AVX instructions
           with 128bit vector length, which is the default.  -mavxscalar=256
           will encode scalar AVX instructions with 256bit vector length.
&#12;       -mmnemonic=att
       -mmnemonic=intel
           This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching instructions.
           The &quot;.att_mnemonic&quot; and &quot;.intel_mnemonic&quot; directives will take
           precedent.

       -msyntax=att
       -msyntax=intel
           This option specifies instruction syntax when processing
           instructions.  The &quot;.att_syntax&quot; and &quot;.intel_syntax&quot; directives will
           take precedent.

       -mnaked-reg
           This opetion specifies that registers don&apos;t require a % prefix.  The
           &quot;.att_syntax&quot; and &quot;.intel_syntax&quot; directives will take precedent.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Intel
       80960 processor.

           Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
           error if necessary.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Ubicom
       IP2K series.

       -mip2022ext
           Specifies that the extended IP2022 instructions are allowed.

       -mip2022
           Restores the default behaviour, which restricts the permitted
           instructions to just the basic IP2022 ones.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Renesas
       M32C and M16C processors.

       -m32c
           Assemble M32C instructions.

       -m16c
           Assemble M16C instructions (the default).

           Support H&apos;00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Renesas
       M32R (formerly Mitsubishi M32R) series.

       --m32rx
           Specify which processor in the M32R family is the target.  The
           default is normally the M32R, but this option changes it to the
           M32RX.

       --warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wp
           Produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs are
           encountered.

       --no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wnp
           Do not produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs
           are encountered.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the
       Motorola 68000 series.

       -l  Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.

       | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200
           Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The
           default is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at
           configuration time.

       -m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882
           The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point
           coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020,
           68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with
           the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it&apos;s
           possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the
           main processor.

       -m68851 | -mno-68851
           The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management unit

           Specify to use the 64-bit double ABI.

       --force-long-branches
           Relative branches are turned into absolute ones. This concerns
           conditional branches, unconditional branches and branches to a sub
           routine.

       -S | --short-branches
           Do not turn relative branches into absolute ones when the offset is
           out of range.

       --strict-direct-mode
           Do not turn the direct addressing mode into extended addressing mode
           when the instruction does not support direct addressing mode.

       --print-insn-syntax
           Print the syntax of instruction in case of error.

       --print-opcodes
           print the list of instructions with syntax and then exit.

       --generate-example
           print an example of instruction for each possible instruction and

       The following options are available when as is configured for the SPARC
       architecture:

       -Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite
       -Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a
           Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.

           -Av8plus and -Av8plusa select a 32 bit environment.  -Av9 and -Av9a
           select a 64 bit environment.

           -Av8plusa and -Av9a enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
           UltraSPARC extensions.

       -xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa
           For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
           equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

       -bump
           Warn when the assembler switches to another architecture.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the &apos;c54x
       architecture.

       -mfar-mode
           Enable extended addressing mode.  All addresses and relocations will

       -mcpu=CPU_VERSION
           Sets the CPU version being compiled for.

       -merrors-to-file FILENAME
           Redirect error output to a file, for broken systems which don&apos;t
           support such behaviour in the shell.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a MIPS
       processor.

       -G num
           This option sets the largest size of an object that can be referenced
           implicitly with the &quot;gp&quot; register.  It is only accepted for targets
           that use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running Ultrix.  The
           default value is 8.

       -EB Generate &quot;big endian&quot; format output.

       -EL Generate &quot;little endian&quot; format output.

       -mips1
       -mips2
       -mips3
       -mips4
       -mips5
       -mips32
       -mips32r2
       -mips64
       -mips64r2
           Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
           level.  -mips1 is an alias for -march=r3000, -mips2 is an alias for
           -march=r6000, -mips3 is an alias for -march=r4000 and -mips4 is an
           alias for -march=r8000.  -mips5, -mips32, -mips32r2, -mips64, and
           -mips64r2 correspond to generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2,
           MIPS64, and MIPS64 Release 2 ISA processors, respectively.

       -march=CPU
           Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.

       -mtune=cpu
           Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS cpu.

       -mfix7000
       -mno-fix7000
           Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register of
           an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two instructions.

       -mdebug
       -no-mdebug
           Cause stabs-style debugging output to go into an ECOFF-style .mdebug
           section instead of the standard ELF .stabs sections.

       -mpdr
       -mno-pdr
           Control generation of &quot;.pdr&quot; sections.

       -mgp32
       -mfp32
           The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
           these flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 32
           bits wide at all times.  -mgp32 controls the size of general-purpose
           registers and -mfp32 controls the size of floating-point registers.

       -mips16
       -no-mips16
           Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
           putting &quot;.set mips16&quot; at the start of the assembly file.  -no-mips16
           turns off this option.

       -mmicromips
       -mno-micromips
           Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
           putting &quot;.set micromips&quot; at the start of the assembly file.
           -mno-micromips turns off this option.  This is equivalent to putting
           &quot;.set nomicromips&quot; at the start of the assembly file.

       -msmartmips
       -mno-smartmips
           Enables the SmartMIPS extension to the MIPS32 instruction set. This
           is equivalent to putting &quot;.set smartmips&quot; at the start of the
           assembly file.  -mno-smartmips turns off this option.

       -mips3d
       -no-mips3d
           Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.  This
           tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.  -no-mips3d turns
           off this option.

       -mdmx
       -no-mdmx
           Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
           tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  -no-mdmx turns off
           this option.

       -mdsp
       -mno-dsp
           Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
           This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
           -mno-dsp turns off this option.

       -mdspr2
       -mno-dspr2
           Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
           This option implies -mdsp.  This tells the assembler to accept DSP
           Release 2 instructions.  -mno-dspr2 turns off this option.

       -mmt
       -mno-mt
           Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This tells
           the assembler to accept MT instructions.  -mno-mt turns off this
           option.

       -mmcu
       -mno-mcu
           Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This tells
           the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  -mno-mcu turns off this
           option.

       --construct-floats
       --no-construct-floats
           The --no-construct-floats option disables the construction of double
           width floating point constants by loading the two halves of the value
           into the two single width floating point registers that make up the
           double width register.  By default --construct-floats is selected,
           allowing construction of these floating point constants.

       --emulation=name
           This option causes as to emulate as configured for some other target,
           in all respects, including output format (choosing between ELF and
           ECOFF only), handling of pseudo-opcodes which may generate debugging
           information or store symbol table information, and default
           endianness.  The available configuration names are: mipsecoff,
           mipself, mipslecoff, mipsbecoff, mipslelf, mipsbelf.  The first two
           do not alter the default endianness from that of the primary target
           for which the assembler was configured; the others change the default
           to little- or big-endian as indicated by the b or l in the name.
           Using -EB or -EL will override the endianness selection in any case.

           This option is currently supported only when the primary target as is
           configured for is a MIPS ELF or ECOFF target.  Furthermore, the
           primary target or others specified with --enable-targets=... at
           configuration time must include support for the other format, if both
           are to be available.  For example, the Irix 5 configuration includes
           support for both.

           Eventually, this option will support more configurations, with more
           fine-grained control over the assembler&apos;s behavior, and will be
           supported for more processors.

       -nocpp
           as ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with the
           native tools.

       --trap
       --no-trap
       --break
       --no-break
           Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by
           zero.  --trap or --no-break (which are synonyms) take a trap
           exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and
           higher); --break or --no-trap (also synonyms, and the default) take a
           break exception.

       -n  When this option is used, as will issue a warning every time it
           generates a nop instruction from a macro.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an MCore
       processor.

       -jsri2bsr
       -nojsri2bsr
           Enable or disable the JSRI to BSR transformation.  By default this is
           enabled.  The command line option -nojsri2bsr can be used to disable
           it.

       -sifilter
       -nosifilter
           Enable or disable the silicon filter behaviour.  By default this is
           disabled.  The default can be overridden by the -sifilter command
           line option.

       -relax
           Alter jump instructions for long displacements.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the s390
       processor family.

       -m31
       -m64
           Select the word size, either 31/32 bits or 64 bits.

       -mesa
       -mzarch
           Select the architecture mode, either the Enterprise System
           Architecture (esa) or the z/Architecture mode (zarch).

       -march=processor
           Specify which s390 processor variant is the target, g6, g6, z900,
           z990, z9-109, z9-ec, or z10.

       -mregnames
       -mno-regnames
           Allow or disallow symbolic names for registers.

       -mwarn-areg-zero
           Warn whenever the operand for a base or index register has been
           specified but evaluates to zero.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a
       TMS320C6000 processor.

       -march=arch
           Enable (only) instructions from architecture arch.  By default, all
           instructions are permitted.

           The following values of arch are accepted: &quot;c62x&quot;, &quot;c64x&quot;, &quot;c64x+&quot;,
           &quot;c67x&quot;, &quot;c67x+&quot;, &quot;c674x&quot;.

       -mdsbt
       -mno-dsbt
           The -mdsbt option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_DSBT&quot;
           attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the code is using DSBT
           addressing.  The -mno-dsbt option, the default, causes the tag to
           have a value of 0, indicating that the code does not use DSBT
           addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects of different
           type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked together.

       -mpid=no
       -mpid=near
       -mpid=far
           The -mpid= option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_PID&quot;
           attribute with a value indicating the form of data addressing used by
           the code.  -mpid=no, the default, indicates position-dependent data
           addressing, -mpid=near indicates position-independent addressing with
           GOT accesses using near DP addressing, and -mpid=far indicates
           position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using far DP
           addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects built with
           different settings of this option are linked together.

       -mpic
       -mno-pic
           The -mpic option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_PIC&quot;
           attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the code is using
           position-independent code addressing,  The &quot;-mno-pic&quot; option, the
           default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating position-
           dependent code addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects
           of different type (position-dependent and position-independent) are
           linked together.

       -mbig-endian
       -mlittle-endian
           Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is little-
           endian.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a TILE-Gx
       processor.

       -m32 | -m64
           Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Xtensa
       processor.

       --text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals
           Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
           --no-text-section-literals, which places literals in separate
           sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
           placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With --text-section-literals, the literals
           are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close
           as possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large
           assembly files, where the literals would otherwise be out of range of
           the &quot;L32R&quot; instructions in the text section.  These options only
           affect literals referenced via PC-relative &quot;L32R&quot; instructions;
           literals for absolute mode &quot;L32R&quot; instructions are handled
           separately.

       --absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals
           Indicate to the assembler whether &quot;L32R&quot; instructions use absolute or
           PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
           addressing option, the default is to use absolute &quot;L32R&quot; relocations.
           Otherwise, only the PC-relative &quot;L32R&quot; relocations can be used.

       --target-align | --no-target-align
           Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties at
           some expense in code size.    This optimization is enabled by
           default.  Note that the assembler will always align instructions like
           &quot;LOOP&quot; that have fixed alignment requirements.

       --longcalls | --no-longcalls
           Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow calls
           across a greater range of addresses.    This option should be used
           when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade
           both code size and performance, but the linker can generally optimize
           away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within range.  The
           default is --no-longcalls.

       --transform | --no-transform
           Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa
           instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The
           default is --transform; --no-transform should only be used in the
           rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified in the
           assembly source.  Using --no-transform causes out of range
           instruction operands to be errors.

       --rename-section oldname=newname
           Rename the oldname section to newname.  This option can be used
           multiple times to rename multiple sections.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a Z80
       family processor.

       -z80
           Assemble for Z80 processor.

       -r800

           Issue a warning for undocumented Z80 instructions that do not work on
           R800.

       -forbid-undocumented-instructions
       -Fud
           Treat all undocumented instructions as errors.

       -forbid-unportable-instructions
