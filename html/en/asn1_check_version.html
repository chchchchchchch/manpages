NAME
       asn1_check_version - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;libtasn1.h&gt;

       const char * asn1_check_version(const char * req_version);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * req_version
                   Required version number, or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Check that the version of the library is at minimum the requested one and
       return the version string; return NULL if the condition is not satisfied.
