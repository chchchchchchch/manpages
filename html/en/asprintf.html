ASPRINTF(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ASPRINTF(3)



NAME
       asprintf, vasprintf - print to allocated string

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int asprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, ...);

       int vasprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, va_list ap);

DESCRIPTION
       The  functions  asprintf()  and vasprintf() are analogs of sprintf(3) and
       vsprintf(3), except that they allocate a string large enough to hold  the
       output  including  the  terminating null byte, and return a pointer to it
       via the first argument.  This pointer should  be  passed  to  free(3)  to
       release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, these functions return the number of bytes printed, just
       like sprintf(3).  If memory allocation wasn&apos;t  possible,  or  some  other
       error occurs, these functions will return -1, and the contents of strp is
       undefined.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions, not in C or  POSIX.   They  are  also
       available  under  *BSD.   The FreeBSD implementation sets strp to NULL on
       error.

       free(3), malloc(3), printf(3)
