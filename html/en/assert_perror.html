ASSERT_PERROR(3)            Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual           ASSERT_PERROR(3)



NAME
       assert_perror - test errnum and abort

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;assert.h&gt;

       void assert_perror(int errnum);

DESCRIPTION
       If  the  macro  NDEBUG  was  defined  at  the  moment &lt;assert.h&gt; was last
       included, the macro assert_perror() generates no  code,  and  hence  does
       nothing  at  all.   Otherwise,  the macro assert_perror() prints an error
       message to standard error and terminates the program by calling  abort(3)
       if  errnum  is nonzero.  The message contains the filename, function name
       and line number of the macro call, and the output of strerror(errnum).

RETURN VALUE
       No value is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       This is a GNU extension.

BUGS
       The purpose of the assert macros is to help the programmer find  bugs  in
       his program, things that cannot happen unless there was a coding mistake.
       However, with system or library calls the situation is rather  different,
       and  error returns can happen, and will happen, and should be tested for.
       Not by an assert, where the test goes away when NDEBUG is defined, but by
       proper error handling code.  Never use this macro.

SEE ALSO
       abort(3), assert(3), exit(3), strerror(3)
