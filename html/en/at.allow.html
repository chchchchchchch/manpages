AT.ALLOW(5)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                AT.ALLOW(5)



NAME
       at.allow, at.deny - determine who can submit jobs via at or batch

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit
       commands for later execution via at(1) or batch(1).

       The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line.  White&#8208;
       space is not permitted.

       If  the  file  /etc/at.allow  exists,  only usernames mentioned in it are
       allowed to use at.

       If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every  username
       not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at.

       An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user may use at.

       If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed to use at.

SEE ALSO
       at(1), cron(8), crontab(1), atd(8).
