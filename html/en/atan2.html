ATAN2(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   ATAN2(3)



NAME
       atan2, atan2f, atan2l - arc tangent function of two variables

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double atan2(double y, double x);
       float atan2f(float y, float x);
       long double atan2l(long double y, long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       atan2f(), atan2l():
              _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 ||
              _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
              or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The atan2() function calculates the principal value of the arc tangent of
       y/x,  using  the  signs of the two arguments to determine the quadrant of
       the result.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the principal value of the arc tangent
       of y/x in radians; the return value is in the range [-pi, pi].

       If y is +0 (-0) and x is less than 0, +pi (-pi) is returned.

       If y is +0 (-0) and x is greater than 0, +0 (-0) is returned.

       If y is less than 0 and x is +0 or -0, -pi/2 is returned.

       If y is greater than 0 and x is +0 or -0, pi/2 is returned.

       If either x or y is NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If y is +0 (-0) and x is -0, +pi (-pi) is returned.

       If y is +0 (-0) and x is +0, +0 (-0) is returned.

       If y is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and x is negative infinity,
       +pi (-pi) is returned.

       If y is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and x is positive infinity,
       +0 (-0) is returned.

       If  y  is  positive  infinity  (negative infinity), and x is finite, pi/2
       (-pi/2) is returned.

       If y is positive infinity (negative infinity) and x is negative infinity,
       +3*pi/4 (-3*pi/4) is returned.

       If y is positive infinity (negative infinity) and x is positive infinity,
       +pi/4 (-pi/4) is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms  to  SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
