NAME
       audacity - Graphical cross-platform audio editor

SYNOPSIS
       audacity -help
       audacity -version

       audacity [-blocksize nnn] -test
       audacity [-blocksize nnn] [ AUDIO-FILE ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Audacity  is  a  graphical audio editor.  This man page does not describe
       all of the features of Audacity or how to use it; for this, see the  html
       documentation that came with the program, which should be accessible from
       the Help menu.  This  man  page  describes  the  Unix-specific  features,
       including special files and environment variables.

       Audacity  currently  uses libsndfile to open many uncompressed audio for&#8208;
       mats such as WAV, AIFF, and AU, and it can also be linked to libmad, lib&#8208;
       vorbis,  and  libflac,  to provide support for opening MP2/3, Ogg Vorbis,
       and FLAC files, respectively.  LAME, libvorbis,  libflac  and  libtwolame
       provide facilities to export files to all these formats as well.

       Audacity  is primarily an interactive, graphical editor, not a batch-pro&#8208;
       cessing tool. Whilst there is a basic batch processing tool it is experi&#8208;
       mental  and  incomplete.  If you need to batch-process audio or do simple
       edits from the command line, using sox  or  ecasound  driven  by  a  bash
       script will be much more powerful than audacity.


OPTIONS
       -help     display a brief list of command line options

       -version  display the audacity version number

       -test     run self diagnostics tests (only present in development builds)

       -blocksize nnn
                 set  the  audacity  block size for writing files to disk to nnn
                 bytes


FILES
       ~/.audacity-data/audacity.cfg
              Per user configuration file.

       /var/tmp/audacity-&lt;user&gt;/
              Default location of Audacity&apos;s temp  directory,  where  &lt;user&gt;  is
              your username.  If this location is not suitable (not enough space
              in /var/tmp, for example), you should change the temp directory in
              the  Preferences  and  restart Audacity.  Audacity is a disk-based
              editor, so the temp directory is very important: it should  always
              be on a fast (local) disk with lots of free space.

              Note that older versions of Audacity put the temp directory inside
              of the user&apos;s home directory.  This is undesirable  on  many  sys&#8208;
              tems, and using some directory in /tmp is recommended.

              On  many  modern  Linux systems all files in /tmp/ will be deleted
              each time the system boots up, which makes recovering a  recording
              that was going on when the system crashed much harder. This is why
              the default is to use a directory in /var/tmp/ which will not nor&#8208;
              mally be deleted by the system. Open the Preferences to check.

SEARCH PATH
       When  looking for plug-ins, help files, localization files, or other con&#8208;
       figuration files, Audacity searches  the  following  locations,  in  this
       order:

       AUDACITY_PATH
              Any  directories in the AUDACITY_PATH environment variable will be
              searched before anywhere else.

       .
              The current working directory when Audacity is started.

       ~/.audacity-files

       &lt;prefix&gt;/share/audacity
              The system-wide Audacity directory, where &lt;prefix&gt; is usually /usr
              or /usr/local, depending on where the program was installed.

       &lt;prefix&gt;/share/doc/audacity
              The  system-wide  Audacity documentation directory, where &lt;prefix&gt;
              is usually /usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program  was
              installed.

       For  localization files in particular (i.e. translations of Audacity into
       other languages), Audacity also searches &lt;prefix&gt;/share/locale


PLUG-INS
       Audacity supports two types of plug-ins on Unix: LADSPA and Nyquist plug-
       ins.  These are generally placed in a directory called plug-ins somewhere
       on the search path (see above).

       LADSPA plug-ins can either be in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively
       in  a  ladspa  directory  on the search path if you choose to create one.
       Audacity will also search the directories in the LADSPA_PATH  environment
       variable for additional LADSPA plug-ins.

       Nyquist  plug-ins  can  either  be in the plug-ins directory, or alterna&#8208;
       tively in a nyquist directory on the search path if you choose to  create
       one.
