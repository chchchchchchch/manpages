AUTOINST(1)                       Marc Penninga                      AUTOINST(1)



NAME
       autoinst - wrapper around the LCDF TypeTools, for installing OpenType
       fonts in LaTeX.

SYNOPSIS
       autoinst [options] font(s)

DESCRIPTION
       Eddie Kohler&apos;s TypeTools, especially otftotfm, are superb tools for
       installing OpenType fonts in LaTeX, but their use (even in automatic
       mode) is complicated: they need many long command lines and don&apos;t
       generate the fd and sty files LaTeX needs.  autoinst simplifies the font
       installation process with otftotfm by generating and executing all
       command lines and by creating and installing all fd and sty files.

       Given a family of font files (in either otf or ttf format), autoinst will
       create several LaTeX font families:

         -  Four text families (with lining and oldstyle digits, in tabular and
            proportional variants), each with the following shapes:

              n     Roman text

              sc    Small caps

              nw    &quot;Upright swash&quot;; usually normal text with some extra
                    &quot;oldstyle&quot; ligatures, such as ct, sp and st.

              tl    Titling shape. Meant for all-caps text only (even though it
                    sometimes contains lowercase glyphs as well), where
                    letterspacing and the positioning of punctuation characters
                    have been adjusted to suit all-caps text.  This shape is
                    generated only for the families with lining digits, since
                    all-caps text doesn&apos;t mix with old-style digits.

              it    Italic (or oblique) text

              scit  Italic small caps

              sw    Swash

              tlit  Italic titling

         -  For each text family: a family of TS1-encoded symbol fonts, in roman
            and italic shapes.

         -  Four families with superiors, inferiors, numerators and
            denominators, in roman and italic shapes.

         -  An ornament family, in roman and italic shapes.

       Of course, if the fonts don&apos;t contain oldstyle digits, small caps etc.,
       the corresponding shapes and families are not created.  Furthermore, the
       creation of most families and shapes can be controlled by command-line
       options (see &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot; below).

       The generated font families are named &lt;FontFamily&gt;-&lt;Suffix&gt;, where
       &lt;Suffix&gt; is one of

       LF      proportional (i.e., figures have varying widths) lining figures

       TLF     tabular (i.e., all figures have the same width) lining figures
&#12;       OsF     proportional oldstyle figures

       TOsF    tabular oldstyle figures

       Sup     superior characters (many fonts have only an incomplete set of
               superiors: digits, punctuation and the letters abdeilmnorst;
               normal forms will be used for the other characters)

       Inf     inferior characters; usually only digits and punctuation, normal
               forms for the other characters

       Orn     ornaments

       Numr    numerators

       Dnom    denominators

       The generated fonts are named &lt;FontName&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;-&lt;shape&gt;-&lt;enc&gt;, where
       &lt;suffix&gt; is the same as above (but in lowercase), &lt;shape&gt; is either
       empty, &quot;sc&quot;, &quot;swash&quot; or &quot;titling&quot;, and &lt;enc&gt; is the encoding.  A typical
       name in this scheme would be &quot;MinionPro-Regular-osf-sc-ly1&quot;.

   On the choice of text encoding
       By default, autoinst generates text fonts with OT1, T1 and LY1 encodings,
       and the generated style files use LY1 as the default text encoding.  LY1
       has been chosen over T1 because it has some empty slots to accomodate the
       additional ligatures and alternate glyphs provided by many OpenType
       fonts.  Different encodings can be selected using the -encoding command-
       line option (see &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot; below).

   Using the fonts in your LaTeX documents
       autoinst generates a style file for using the font in LaTeX documents,
       named &lt;FontFamily&gt;.sty. This style file also takes care of loading the
       fontenc and textcomp packages, if necessary.  To use the font, simply put
       &quot;\usepackage{&lt;FontFamily&gt;}&quot; in the preamble of your document.

       This style file defines a number of options:

       lining, oldstyle, tabular, proportional
           Choose which digits will be used for the text fonts.  The defaults
           are &quot;oldstyle&quot; and &quot;proportional&quot; (if available).

       ultrablack, ultrabold, heavy, extrablack, black, extrabold, demibold,
       semibold, bold
           Choose the weight that LaTeX will use for the &quot;bold&quot; weight (i.e.,
           the value of &quot;\bfdefault&quot;).

       light, medium, regular
           Choose the weight that LaTeX will use for the &quot;regular&quot; weight (i.e.,
           the value of &quot;\mddefault&quot;).

       scaled=&lt;scale&gt;
           Scale the font by a factor of &lt;scale&gt;.  For example: to increase the
           size of the font by 5%, use the command
           &quot;\usepackage[scaled=1.05]{&lt;FontFamily&gt;}&quot;.

           This option is only available when the xkeyval package is found in
           your TeX installation.

       The style file will also try to load the fontaxes package, which gives
       easy access to various font shapes and styles.  It is available from CTAN
       (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fontaxes).  Using
       the machinery set up by fontaxes, the generated style file also defines a
       number of commands (which take the text to be typeset as argument) and
       declarations (which don&apos;t take arguments, but affect all text up to the
       end of the current group) of its own:
&#12;           DECLARATION     COMMAND         SHORT FORM OF COMMAND

           \tlshape        \texttitling    \texttl
           \sufigures      \textsuperior   \textsu
           \infigures      \textinferior   \textin

       In addition, the &quot;\swshape&quot; and &quot;\textsw&quot; commands are redefined to place
       swash on the secondary shape axis (fontaxes places it on the primary
       shape axis); this makes these commands behave properly when nested, so
       that &quot;\swshape\upshape&quot; will give upright swash.

       There are no commands for accessing the numerator and denominator fonts;
       these can be selected using fontaxes&apos; standard commands, e.g.,
       &quot;\fontfigurestyle{numerator}\selectfont&quot;.

       The style file also provides a command &quot;\ornament{&lt;number&gt;}&quot;, where
       &quot;&lt;number&gt;&quot; is a number from 0 to the total number of ornaments minus one.
       Ornaments are always typeset using the current family, series and shape.
       A list of all ornaments in a font can be created by running LaTeX on the
       file nfssfont.tex (part of a standard LaTeX installation) and supplying
       the name of the ornament font.

       To access the ornaments, autoinst creates a font-specific encoding file
       &lt;FontFamily&gt;_orn.enc, but only if that file doesn&apos;t yet exist.  This
       means you can provide your own encoding vector, e.g. if your fonts use
       non-standard glyph names for ornaments.

       These commands are only generated for shapes and number styles that
       actually exist; no commands are generated for shapes and styles that
       don&apos;t exist, or whose generation has been turned off.  Please note that
       these commands are built on top of fontaxes; if that package cannot be
       found, you&apos;re limited to using the lower-level commands from standard
       NFSS (&quot;\fontfamily&quot;, &quot;\fontseries&quot;, &quot;\fontshape&quot; etc.).

   Using multiple font families in one document
       If you want to use more than one font family in a document, be aware that
       style files generated by versions of autoinst older dan 2009 are
       incompatible with those generated by newer versions.

   NFSS codes
       NFSS identifies fonts by a combination of family, series (weight plus
       width), shape and size.  autoinst parses the output of &quot;otfinfo --info&quot;
       to determine these parameters. When this fails (e.g., because the font
       family contains unusual widths or weights), autoinst ends up with
       different fonts having the same values for the font parameters, which
       means that these fonts cannot be used in NFSS.  autoinst will then split
       the font family into multiple subfamilies (based on the font&apos;s
       &quot;Subfamily&quot; value) and try again.  (Since many font families overdo the
       &quot;Subfamily&quot; by making each font a separate subfamily, this strategy is
       only used as a last resort.)

       If this proliferation of font families is unwanted, either rerun autoinst
       on a smaller set of fonts (omitting the ones that failed to parse
       correctly) or else add the missing widths, weights and shapes to the
       tables %FD_WIDTH, %FD_WEIGHT and %FD_SHAPE, near the top of the source
       code.  Please also send a bug report (see AUTHOR below).

       autoinst maps widths, weights and shapes to NFSS codes using the
       following tables. These are based both on the standard Fontname scheme
       and on the tables in Philipp Lehman&apos;s Font Installation Guide, but some
       changes had to be made to avoid name clashes in font families with many
       different widths and weights.

       Notes:

       [1] When both weight and width are empty, the &quot;series&quot; attribute becomes
           &quot;m&quot;.

       [2] Adobe Silentium Pro contains two &quot;Roman&quot; shapes (&quot;RomanI&quot; and
           &quot;RomanII&quot;); the first of these is mapped to &quot;n&quot;, the second one to
           &quot;it&quot;.

       [3] Mapping the &quot;Slanted&quot;, &quot;Oblique&quot; or &quot;Inclined&quot; shape to &quot;it&quot; instead
           of &quot;sl&quot; simplifies autoinst. Since font families with both italic and
           slanted shapes do - to the best of my knowledge - not exist (apart
           from Computer Modern, of course), this shouldn&apos;t cause problems in
           real life.

   A note for MiKTeX users
       Automatically installing the fonts into a suitable TEXMF tree (as
       autoinst does by default) requires a TeX-installation that uses the
       kpathsea library; with TeX distributions that implement their own
       directory searching (such as MiKTeX), autoinst will complain that it
       cannot find the kpsewhich program and install all generated files into
       subdirectories of the current directory.  If you use such a TeX
       distribution, you should either move these files to their correct
       destinations by hand, or use the -target option (see &quot;COMMAND-LINE
       OPTIONS&quot; below) to specify a TEXMF tree.

       Also, some OpenType fonts lead to pl and vpl files that are too big for
       MiKTeX&apos;s pltotf and vptovf; the versions that come with W32TeX
       (http://www.w32tex.org) and TeXLive (http://tug.org/texlive) don&apos;t have
       this problem.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       You may use either one or two dashes before options, and option names may
       be shortened to a unique prefix (e.g., -enc instead of -encoding).

       -encoding=encoding[,encoding]
           Use the specified encodings for the text fonts. The default is
           &quot;OT1,T1,LY1&quot;.  For each encoding, a file &lt;encoding&gt;.enc (in all
           lowercase) should be somewhere where otftotfm can find it. Suitable
           encoding files for OT1, T1/TS1 and LY1 come with autoinst. (Note that
           these files are called fontools_ot1.enc etc. to avoid name clashes
           with other packages; the &quot;fontools_&quot; prefix doesn&apos;t need to be
           specified.)

           Multiple text encodings can be specified as a comma-separated list:
           &quot;-encoding=OT1,T1&quot;. The encodings are passed to fontenc in the order
           specified, so the last one will be the default text encoding.

       -sanserif
           Install the font as a sanserif font, accessed via &quot;\sffamily&quot; and
           &quot;\textsf&quot;.  Note that the generated style file redefines
           &quot;\familydefault&quot;, so including it will still make this font the
           default text font.

       -typewriter
           Install the font as a typewriter font, accessed via &quot;\ttfamily&quot; and
           &quot;\texttt&quot;.  Note that the generated style file redefines
           &quot;\familydefault&quot;, so including it will still make this font the
           default text font.

       -ts1
       -nots1
           Turn the creation of TS1-encoded fonts on or off. The default is -ts1
           if the text encodings (see -encoding above) include T1, -nots1
           otherwise.

       -smallcaps
       -nosmallcaps
           Turn the creation of small caps fonts on or off. The default is
           -smallcaps.

       -swash
       -noswash
           Turn the creation of swash fonts on or off. The default is -swash.

       -titling
       -notitling
           Turn the creation of titling fonts on or off. The default is
           -titling.

       -superiors
       -nosuperiors
           Turn the creation of fonts with superior characters on or off.  The
           default is -superiors.

       -inferiors
       -noinferiors
           Turn the creation of fonts with inferior digits on or off.  The
           default is -noinferiors.

       -fractions
       -nofractions
           Turn the creation of fonts with numerators and denominators on or
           off.  The default is -nofractions.

       -ornaments
       -noornaments
           Turn the creation of ornament fonts on or off. The default is
           -ornaments.

       -target=DIRECTORY
           Install all generated files into the TEXMF tree at DIRECTORY.

           By default, autoinst searches your $TEXMFLOCAL and $TEXMFHOME paths
           and installs all files into subdirectories of the first writable
           TEXMF tree it finds (or into subdirectories of the current directory,
           if no writable directory is found).

           Note: this option gets overriden by the -manual option!

       -manual
           Manual mode. By default, autoinst immediately executes all otftotfm
           command lines it generates; with the -manual option, these commands
           are instead written to a file autoinst.bat.  Also, the generated
           otftotfm command lines specify the  --pl option (which tells otftotfm
           to generate readable/editable pl and vpl files instead of the default
           tfm and vf files) and leave out the  --automatic option (which tells
           otftotfm to leave all generated files in the current directory,
           rather than install them into your TEXMF tree).

           When using this option, you should run pltotf and vptovf after
           executing all commands, to convert the pl and vf files to tfm and vf
           format.

           Note: this option overrides the -target option!

       -verbose
           Verbose mode; print detailed info about what autoinst thinks it&apos;s
           doing.

       -extra=text
           Pass text as options to otftotfm. To prevent text from accidentily
           being interpreted as options to autoinst, it should be properly
           quoted.

       -figurekern
       -nofigurekern
           Some fonts provide kerning pairs for tabular figures.  This is
           probably unwanted (e.g., numbers in tables won&apos;t line up exactly).
           The option -nofigurekern adds extra  --ligkern options to the command
           lines for otftotfm to suppress such kerns (but only for the &quot;TLF&quot; and
           &quot;TOsF&quot; families).  Since this leads to very long command lines (it
           adds one hundred such options) and the problem affects only few
           fonts, the default is -figurekern.

                   Added recognition for a number of unusual widths, weights and
                   shapes.

       2012-02-29  Fixed a bug in the font parsing code, where possible widths,
                   weights and shapes where tested in the wrong order; this led
                   to &quot;ExtraLight&quot; fonts being recognised as &quot;Light&quot;.  Added
                   recognition for &quot;Narrow&quot; and &quot;Wide&quot; widths.  Also added the
                   -(no)figurekern command-line option.

       2012-02-01  Reorganised the code, and fixed some bugs in the process.
                   Added the -target command-line option.  Made autoinst install
                   the fd and sty files in the same TEXMF tree as the other
                   generated files.  Generate OT1, T1 and LY1 encoded text fonts
                   by default.  Made -titling a default option (instead of
                   -notitling).  Updated the documentation.

       2011-06-15  Fixed the font info parsing code for some fonts that are too
                   lazy to spell out &quot;Italic&quot; in full.

       2010-04-29  The  --feature=kern option is only used for fonts that
                   contain either a kern feature or a kern table.  Font feature
                   selection commands in the sty file are only generated for
                   shapes and figure styles that are supported by the current
                   font, and whose generation has not been turned off using the
                   command-line options.  Fixed the font info parsing to work
                   with the Condensed fonts in the Minion Pro family.

       2010-04-23  Always provide the  --feature=kern option to otftotfm, even
                   if the font doesn&apos;t have a kern feature; this will make
                   otftotfm use the kern table if present.  For fonts without a
                   liga feature, add  --ligkern options for the common
                   f-ligatures to the otftotfm command line, so that any
                   ligatures present in the font will still be used.  Bug fix:
                   the generated sty files now work for font families with names
                   containing digits.

       2009-04-09  Prefixed the filenames of  the included encoding files with
                   fontools_, to prevent name clashes with other packages.

       2009-04-06  A small patch to the &quot;get_orn&quot; subroutine: it now also
                   recognises the bullet.xxx ornament glyphs in Adobe Kepler
                   Pro.
