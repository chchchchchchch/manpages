DESCRIPTION
       This  package  attempts  to automate the use of HTTP proxy servers in Tcl
       HTTP client code. It tries to initialize the  web  access  settings  from
       system  standard locations and can be configured to negotiate authentica&#8208;
       tion with the proxy if required.

       On Unix the standard for identifying the local HTTP proxy server seems to
       be  to  use the environment variable http_proxy or ftp_proxy and no_proxy
       to list those domains to be excluded from proxying.  On  Windows  we  can
       retrieve  the Internet Settings values from the registry to obtain pretty
       much the same information.  With this information we can setup a suitable
       filter  procedure  for the Tcl http package and arrange for automatic use
       of the proxy.

       There seem to be a number of ways that the http_proxy  environment  vari&#8208;
       able  may  be set up. Either a plain host:port or more commonly a URL and
       sometimes the URL may contain authentication parameters or these  may  be
       requested   from   the   user   or   provided   via  http_proxy_user  and
       http_proxy_pass. This package attempts to deal with all these schemes. It
       will  do it&apos;s best to get the required parameters from the environment or
       registry and if it fails can be reconfigured.

COMMANDS
       ::autoproxy::init
              Initialize the autoproxy package from system resources. Under unix
              this  means  we  look  for environment variables. Under windows we
              look for the same environment variables but also look at the  reg&#8208;
              istry settings used by Internet Explorer.

       ::autoproxy::cget -option
              Retrieve individual package configuration options. See OPTIONS.

       ::autoproxy::configure ?-option value?
              Configure the autoproxy package. Calling configure with no options
              will return a list of all option names and values.  See OPTIONS.
&#12;       ::autoproxy::tls_connect args
              Connect to a secure socket through a  proxy.  HTTP  proxy  servers
              permit  the use of the CONNECT HTTP command to open a link through
              the proxy to the target machine. This function hides the  details.
              For use with the http package see tls_socket.

              The  args list may contain any of the tls package options but must
              end with the host and port as the last two items.

       ::autoproxy::tunnel_connect args
              Connect to a target host throught a proxy. This uses the same CON&#8208;
              NECT HTTP command as the tls_connect but does not promote the link
              security once the connection is established.

              The args list may contain any of the tls package options but  must
              end with the host and port as the last two items.

              Note  that  many proxy servers will permit CONNECT calls to a lim&#8208;
              ited set of ports - typically  only  port  443  (the  secure  HTTP
              port).

       ::autoproxy::tls_socket args
              This  function  is  to  be  used  to register a proxy-aware secure
              socket handler for the https protocol. It may only  be  used  with
              the Tcl http package and should be registered using the http::reg&#8208;
              ister command (see the examples below). The job of actually creat&#8208;
              ing  the  tunnelled  connection is done by the tls_connect command
              and this may be used when not registering with the http package.

OPTIONS
       -host hostname

       -proxy_host hostname
              Set the proxy hostname. This is normally set up by init but may be
              configured here as well.

       -port number

       -proxy_port number
              Set  the proxy port number. This is normally set up by init.  e.g.
              configure -port 3128

       -no_proxy list
              You may manipulate the no_proxy list that was setup by  init.  The
              value  of  this  option  is a tcl list of strings that are matched
              against the http request host using the tcl string match  command.
              Therefore  glob  patterns  are permitted.  For instance, configure
              -no_proxy *.localdomain

       -authProc procedure
              This option may be used to set an application defined procedure to
              be called when configure -basic is called with either no or insuf&#8208;
              ficient authentication details. This can be used to present a dia&#8208;
              log to the user to request the additional information.

       -basic Following  options  are  for  configuring the Basic authentication
              scheme parameters. See Basic Authentication.

BASIC AUTHENTICATION
       Basic is the simplest and most commonly  use  HTTP  proxy  authentication
       scheme.  It  is described in (1 section 11) and also in (2). It offers no
       privacy whatsoever and its use should be discouraged in  favour  of  more
       secure  alternatives  like  Digest.  To  perform Basic authentication the
       client base64 encodes the username and plaintext password separated by  a
       colon. This encoded text is prefixed with the word &quot;Basic&quot; and a space.
&#12;       The following options exists for this scheme:

       -username name
              The username required to authenticate with the configured proxy.

       -password password
              The password required for the username specified.

       -realm realm
              This option is not used.

EXAMPLES
              package require autoproxy
              autoproxy::init
              autoproxy::configure -basic -username ME -password SEKRET
              set tok [http::geturl http://wiki.tcl.tk/]
              http::data $tok

BUGS
       At  this  time  only  Basic  authentication  (1)  (2) is supported. It is
       planned to add support for Digest (2) and NTLM in the future.
