NAME
       avahi-daemon - The Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon

SYNOPSIS
       avahi-daemon [options]

       avahi-daemon --kill

       avahi-daemon --reload

       avahi-daemon --check

DESCRIPTION
       The  Avahi  mDNS/DNS-SD  daemon  implements Apple&apos;s Zeroconf architecture
       (also known as &quot;Rendezvous&quot; or &quot;Bonjour&quot;). The daemon registers local  IP
       addresses and static services using mDNS/DNS-SD and provides two IPC APIs
       for local programs to make use of the mDNS record cache the  avahi-daemon
       maintains.  First  there is the so called &quot;simple protocol&quot; which is used
       exclusively by avahi-dnsconfd (a  daemon  which  configures  unicast  DNS
       servers  using  server  info published via mDNS) and nss-mdns (a libc NSS
       plugin, providing name resolution via mDNS). Finally there is  the  D-Bus
       interface  which  provides  a  rich  object  oriented  interface to D-Bus
       enabled applications.

       Upon   startup   avahi-daemon   interprets   its    configuration    file
       /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and reads XML fragments from /etc/avahi/ser&#8208;
       vices/*.service which may define static DNS-SD services.  If  you  enable
       publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers    in    avahi-daemon.conf    the    file
       /etc/resolv.conf will be read, too.

OPTIONS
       -f | --file= FILE
              Specify   the    configuration    file    to    read.    (default:
              /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf)

       -D | --daemonize
              Daemonize after startup. Implies --syslog.

       -s | --syslog
              Log to syslog instead of STDERR. Implied by --daemonize.

       --debug
              Increase verbosity to debug level.

       --no-rlimits
              Don&apos;t  enforce  resource  limits as specified in the configuration
              file. (See setrlimit(2) for more information)

       --no-drop-root
              Don&apos;t drop root privileges after startup and don&apos;t require  daemon
              to be started as root. We recommend not to use this option.

       --no-chroot
              Don&apos;t  chroot(2)  the  daemon.  This option is only available when
              compiled with chroot() support.

       --no-proc-title
              Don&apos;t change the process name while running. Unless this option is
              specified  avahi-daemon  will  reflect  its  current state and the
              selected host name in the process title.

       -k | --kill
              Kill an already running avahi-daemon.  (equivalent  to  sending  a
              SIGTERM)

       -r | --reload
              Tell  an  already  running avahi-daemon to reread /etc/resolv.conf
              (in case you enabled publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers in avahi-dae&#8208;
              mon.conf)  the  files  from /etc/avahi/services/. Please note that
              this will not reload the /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf. (equivalent
              to sending a SIGHUP)

       -c | --check
              Return 0 as return code when avahi-daemon is already running.

       -h | --help
              Show help

       -v | --version
              Show version information

FILES
       /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf:  the  default configuration file for avahi-
       daemon, avahi-daemon.conf(5) for more information.

       /etc/avahi/hosts: additional static hostname mappings to publish in mDNS,
       see avahi.hosts(5) for more information.

       /etc/avahi/services/*.service: static service definitions, see avahi.ser&#8208;
       vice(5) for more information.

SIGNALS
       SIGINT, SIGTERM: avahi-daemon will shutdown. (Same as --kill).

       SIGHUP:  avahi-daemon  will  reload  unicast   DNS   server   data   from
       /etc/resolv.conf  and  static  service  definitions  from /etc/avahi/ser&#8208;
       vices/. (Same as --reload)

       SIGUSR1: avahi-daemon will dump local and remote cached  resource  record
       data to syslog.
