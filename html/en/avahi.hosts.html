avahi.hosts(5)                                                    avahi.hosts(5)



NAME
       avahi.hosts - avahi-daemon static host name file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/avahi/hosts

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/avahi/hosts  is  a file which may be used to define static host name
       to IP address mappings for multicast DNS. This is especially useful  when
       publishing DNS-SD services on behalf of other hosts. See avahi.service(5)
       for more information.

       The file format is similar to the one of /etc/hosts: on each line  an  IP
       address and the corresponding host name. The host names should be in FQDN
       form, i.e. with appended .local suffix.
