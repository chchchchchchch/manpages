NAME
       avahi.service - avahi-daemon static service file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/avahi/services/*.service

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/avahi/services/*.service  are XML fragments containing static DNS-SD
       service data. Every service file can contain multiple service definitions
       which share the same name. This is useful for publishing service data for
       services which implement multiple protocols. (i.e. a printer implementing
       _ipp._tcp and _printer._tcp)

XML TAGS
       &lt;service-group&gt;  The  document tag of avahi service files. Should contain
       one &lt;name&gt; and one or more &lt;service&gt; elements.

       &lt;name replace-wildcards=&quot;yes|no&quot;&gt; The service name. If  replace-wildcards
       is  &quot;yes&quot;, any occurence of the string &quot;%h&quot; will be replaced by the local
       host name. This can be used for service names like  &quot;Remote  Terminal  on
       %h&quot;. If replace-wildcards is not specified, defaults to &quot;no&quot;.

       &lt;service  protocol=&quot;ipv4|ipv6|any&quot;&gt;  Contains the service information for
       exactly one service type. Should contain one &lt;type&gt; and one  &lt;port&gt;  ele&#8208;
       ment.  Optionally  it may contain one &lt;domain-name&gt;, one &lt;host-name&gt;, any
       number  of  &lt;subtype&gt;  and  any  number  of  &lt;txt-record&gt;  elements.  The
       attribute protocol specifies the protocol to advertise the service on. If
       any is used (which is the default), the service  will  be  advertised  on
       both IPv4 and IPv6.

       &lt;type&gt;   Contains   the  DNS-SD  service  type  for  this  service.  e.g.
       &quot;_http._tcp&quot;.

       &lt;subtype&gt; Contains an additional DNS-SD service subtype for this service.
       e.g. &quot;_anon._sub._ftp._tcp&quot;.

       &lt;domain-name&gt;  The  domain  name  this  service  should be registered. If
       omited defaults to the default domain  of  the  avahi  daemon.  (probably
       .local)

       &lt;host-name&gt;  The  host  name of the host that provides this service. This
       should be a host that is resolvable by multicast or unicast  DNS.  Please
       note  that you need to specify a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) here,
       i.e. .local is not appended implicitly! The host name doesn&apos;t need to  be
       part  of  the  domain  specified in &lt;domain-name&gt;. See avahi.hosts(5) for
       more information how to publish additional host name mappings.

       &lt;port&gt; The IP port number the service listens on.

       &lt;txt-record&gt; DNS-SD TXT record data.
