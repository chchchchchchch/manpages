DESCRIPTION
     Avrdude is a program for downloading code and data to Atmel AVR microcon&#8208;
     trollers.  Avrdude supports Atmel&apos;s STK500 programmer, Atmel&apos;s AVRISP and
     AVRISP mkII devices, Atmel&apos;s STK600, Atmel&apos;s JTAG ICE (both mkI and mkII,
     the latter also in ISP mode), programmers complying to AppNote AVR910 and
     AVR109 (including the Butterfly), as well as a simple hard-wired programmer
     connected directly to a ppi(4) or parport(4) parallel port, or to a stan&#8208;
     dard serial port.  In the simplest case, the hardware consists just of a
     cable connecting the respective AVR signal lines to the parallel port.

     The MCU is programmed in serial programming mode, so, for the ppi(4) based
     programmer, the MCU signals &#8216;/RESET&#8217;, &#8216;SCK&#8217;, &#8216;MISO&#8217; and &#8216;MOSI&#8217; need to be
     connected to the parallel port.  Optionally, some otherwise unused output
     pins of the parallel port can be used to supply power for the MCU part, so
     it is also possible to construct a passive stand-alone programming device.
     Some status LEDs indicating the current operating state of the programmer
     can be connected, and a signal is available to control a buffer/driver IC
     74LS367 (or 74HCT367).  The latter can be useful to decouple the parallel
     port from the MCU when in-system programming is used.

     A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect to a
     serial port are supported as well, among them the popular Ponyprog serial
     adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to be supported by
     uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be attached to a physical
     serial port.  Connecting to a serial port emulated on top of USB is likely
     to not work at all, or to work abysmally slow.

     Atmel&apos;s STK500 programmer is also supported and connects to a serial port.
     Both, firmware versions 1.x and 2.x can be handled, but require a different
     programmer type specification (by now).  Using firmware version 2, high-
     voltage programming is also supported, both parallel and serial (programmer
     types stk500pp and stk500hvsp).

     Wiring boards are supported, utilizing STK500 V2.x protocol, but a simple
     DTR/RTS toggle is used to set the boards into programming mode.  The pro&#8208;
     grammer type is ``wiring&apos;&apos;.

     The Arduino (which is very similar to the STK500 1.x) is supported via its
     own programmer type specification ``arduino&apos;&apos;.

     The BusPirate is a versatile tool that can also be used as an AVR program&#8208;
     mer.  A single BusPirate can be connected to up to 3 independent AVRs. See
     the section on extended parameters below for details.

     Atmel&apos;s STK600 programmer is supported in ISP and high-voltage programming
     modes, and connects through the USB.  For ATxmega devices, the STK600 is
     supported in PDI mode.  For ATtiny4/5/9/10 devices, the STK600 and AVRISP
     mkII are supported in TPI mode.

     The simple serial programmer described in Atmel&apos;s application note AVR910,
     and the bootloader described in Atmel&apos;s application note AVR109 (which is
     also used by the AVR Butterfly evaluation board), are supported on a serial
     port.
&#12;     Atmel&apos;s JTAG ICE (both mkI and mkII) is supported as well to up- or down&#8208;
     load memory areas from/to an AVR target (no support for on-chip debugging).
     For the JTAG ICE mkII, JTAG, debugWire and ISP mode are supported, provided
     it has a firmware revision of at least 4.14 (decimal).  See below for the
     limitations of debugWire.  For ATxmega devices, the JTAG ICE mkII is sup&#8208;
     ported in PDI mode, provided it has a revision 1 hardware and firmware ver&#8208;
     sion of at least 5.37 (decimal).

     The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, HVSP, PP, debugWire).
     When used in JTAG and debugWire mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to a
     JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for that device will apply
     as well.  When used in ISP mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to an
     AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode), so all device-specific comments
     will apply there.  In particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast
     ISP clock frequency, so the -B bitclock option might be required to achieve
     a stable ISP communication.  For ATxmega devices, the AVR Dragon is sup&#8208;
     ported in PDI mode, provided it has a firmware version of at least 6.11
     (decimal).

     The avrftdi, USBasp ISP and USBtinyISP adapters are also supported, pro&#8208;
     vided avrdude has been compiled with libusb support.  USBasp ISP and
     USBtinyISP both feature simple firmware-only USB implementations, running
     on an ATmega8 (or ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively. If libftdi has
     has been compiled in avrdude, the avrftdi device adds support for many pro&#8208;
     grammers using FTDI&apos;s 2232C/D/H and 4232H parts running in MPSSE mode,
     which hard-codes (in the chip) SCK to bit 1, MOSI to bit 2, and MISO to bit
     3. Reset is usually bit 4.

     Input files can be provided, and output files can be written in different
     file formats, such as raw binary files containing the data to download to
     the chip, Intel hex format, or Motorola S-record format.  There are a num&#8208;
     ber of tools available to produce those files, like asl(1) as a standalone
     assembler, or avr-objcopy(1) for the final stage of the GNU toolchain for
     the AVR microcontroller.

     Avrdude can program the EEPROM and flash ROM memory cells of supported AVR
     parts.  Where supported by the serial instruction set, fuse bits and lock
     bits can be programmed as well.  These are implemented within avrdude as
     separate memory types and can be programmed using data from a file (see the
     -m option) or from terminal mode (see the dump and write commands).  It is
     also possible to read the chip (provided it has not been code-protected
     previously, of course) and store the data in a file.  Finally, a ``termi&#8208;
     nal&apos;&apos; mode is available that allows one to interactively communicate with
     the MCU, and to display or program individual memory cells.  On the STK500
     and STK600 programmer, several operational parameters (target supply volt&#8208;
     age, target Aref voltage, master clock) can be examined and changed from
     within terminal mode as well.

   Options
     In order to control all the different operation modi, a number of options
     need to be specified to avrdude.

           -p partno
                   This is the only option that is mandatory for every invoca&#8208;
                   tion of avrdude.  It specifies the type of the MCU connected
                   to the programmer.  These are read from the config file.  If
                   avrdude does not know about a part that you have, simply add
                   it to the config file (be sure and submit a patch back to the
                   author so that it can be incorporated for the next version).
                   See the sample config file for the format.  Currently, the
                   following MCU types are understood:

                   (***)  The ATtiny11 uses the same algorithm, but can only be
                          programmed in high-voltage serial mode.

                   (****)
                          The ISP programming protocol of the AT90S1200 differs
                          in subtle ways from that of other AVRs.  Thus, not all
                          programmers support this device.  Known to work are
                          all direct bitbang programmers, and all programmers
                          talking the STK500v2 protocol.

           -b baudrate
                   Override the RS-232 connection baud rate specified in the
                   respective programmer&apos;s entry of the configuration file.

           -B bitclock
                   Specify the bit clock period for the JTAG interface or the
                   ISP clock (JTAG ICE only).  The value is a floating-point
                   number in microseconds.  The default value of the JTAG ICE
                   results in about 1 microsecond bit clock period, suitable for
                   target MCUs running at 4 MHz clock and above.  Unlike certain
                   parameters in the STK500, the JTAG ICE resets all its parame&#8208;
                   ters to default values when the programming software signs
                   off from the ICE, so for MCUs running at lower clock speeds,
                   this parameter must be specified on the command-line.  You
                   can use the &apos;default_bitclock&apos; keyword in your
                   ${HOME}/.avrduderc file to assign a default value to keep
                   from having to specify this option on every invocation.
&#12;           -c programmer-id
                   Use the pin configuration specified by the argument.  Pin
                   configurations are read from the config file (see the -C
                   option).  New pin configurations can be easily added or modi&#8208;
                   fied through the use of a config file to make avrdude work
                   with different programmers as long as the programmer supports
                   the Atmel AVR serial program method.  You can use the
                   &apos;default_programmer&apos; keyword in your ${HOME}/.avrduderc file
                   to assign a default programmer to keep from having to specify
                   this option on every invocation.

           -C config-file
                   Use the specified config file to load configuration data.
                   This file contains all programmer and part definitions that
                   avrdude knows about.  If you have a programmer or part that
                   avrdude does not know about, you can add it to the config
                   file (be sure and submit a patch back to the author so that
                   it can be incorporated for the next version).  See the config
                   file, located at /etc/avrdude.conf, which contains a descrip&#8208;
                   tion of the format.

           -D      Disable auto erase for flash.  When the -U option with flash
                   memory is specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before
                   starting any of the programming operations, since it gener&#8208;
                   ally is a mistake to program the flash without performing an
                   erase first.  This option disables that.  Auto erase is not
                   used for ATxmega devices as these devices can use page erase
                   before writing each page so no explicit chip erase is
                   required.  Note however that any page not affected by the
                   current operation will retain its previous contents.

           -e      Causes a chip erase to be executed.  This will reset the con&#8208;
                   tents of the flash ROM and EEPROM to the value &#8216;0xff&#8217;, and
                   clear all lock bits.  Except for ATxmega devices which can
                   use page erase, it is basically a prerequisite command before
                   the flash ROM can be reprogrammed again.  The only exception
                   would be if the new contents would exclusively cause bits to
                   be programmed from the value &#8216;1&#8217; to &#8216;0&#8217;.  Note that in order
                   to reprogram EERPOM cells, no explicit prior chip erase is
                   required since the MCU provides an auto-erase cycle in that
                   case before programming the cell.

           -E exitspec[,exitspec]
                   By default, avrdude leaves the parallel port in the same
                   state at exit as it has been found at startup.  This option
                   modifies the state of the &#8216;/RESET&#8217; and &#8216;Vcc&#8217; lines the paral&#8208;
                   lel port is left at, according to the exitspec arguments pro&#8208;
                   vided, as follows:

                   reset    The &#8216;/RESET&#8217; signal will be left activated at pro&#8208;
                            gram exit, that is it will be held low, in order to
                            keep the MCU in reset state afterwards.  Note in
                            particular that the programming algorithm for the
                            AT90S1200 device mandates that the &#8216;/RESET&#8217; signal
                            is active before powering up the MCU, so in case an
                            external power supply is used for this MCU type, a
                            previous invocation of avrdude with this option
                            specified is one of the possible ways to guarantee
                            this condition.

                   noreset  The &#8216;/RESET&#8217; line will be deactivated at program
                            exit, thus allowing the MCU target program to run
                            while the programming hardware remains connected.

                   vcc      This option will leave those parallel port pins
                            active (i. e. high) that can be used to supply &#8216;Vcc&#8217;
                            power to the MCU.

                   novcc    This option will pull the &#8216;Vcc&#8217; pins of the parallel
                            port down at program exit.

                   d_high   This option will leave the 8 data pins on the paral&#8208;
                            lel port active.  (i. e. high)

                   d_low    This option will leave the 8 data pins on the paral&#8208;
                            lel port inactive.  (i. e. low)

                   Multiple exitspec arguments can be separated with commas.

           -F      Normally, avrdude tries to verify that the device signature
                   read from the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it
                   can happen from time to time that a device has a broken
                   (erased or overwritten) device signature but is otherwise
                   operating normally, this options is provided to override the
                   check.  Also, for programmers like the Atmel STK500 and
                   STK600 which can adjust parameters local to the programming
                   tool (independent of an actual connection to a target con&#8208;
                   troller), this option can be used together with -t to con&#8208;
                   tinue in terminal mode.

           -i delay
                   For bitbang-type programmers, delay for approximately delay
                   microseconds between each bit state change.  If the host sys&#8208;
                   tem is very fast, or the target runs off a slow clock (like a
                   32 kHz crystal, or the 128 kHz internal RC oscillator), this
                   can become necessary to satisfy the requirement that the ISP
                   clock frequency must not be higher than 1/4 of the CPU clock
                   frequency.  This is implemented as a spin-loop delay to allow
                   even for very short delays.  On Unix-style operating systems,
                   the spin loop is initially calibrated against a system timer,
                   so the number of microseconds might be rather realistic,
                   assuming a constant system load while avrdude is running.  On
                   Win32 operating systems, a preconfigured number of cycles per
                   microsecond is assumed that might be off a bit for very fast
                   or very slow machines.

           -n      No-write - disables actually writing data to the MCU (useful
                   for debugging avrdude ).

           -O      Perform a RC oscillator run-time calibration according to
                   Atmel application note AVR053.  This is only supported on the
                   STK500v2, AVRISP mkII, and JTAG ICE mkII hardware.  Note that
                   the result will be stored in the EEPROM cell at address 0.

           -P port
                   Use port to identify the device to which the programmer is
                   attached.  By default the /dev/ppi0 port is used, but if the
                   programmer type normally connects to the serial port, the
                   /dev/cuaa0 port is the default.  If you need to use a differ&#8208;
                   ent parallel or serial port, use this option to specify the
                   alternate port name.

                   On Win32 operating systems, the parallel ports are referred
                   to as lpt1 through lpt3, referring to the addresses 0x378,
                   0x278, and 0x3BC, respectively.  If the parallel port can be
                   accessed through a different address, this address can be
                   specified directly, using the common C language notation (i.
                   e., hexadecimal values are prefixed by &#8216;0x&#8217; ).

                   For the JTAG ICE mkII, if avrdude has been configured with
                   libusb support, port can alternatively be specified as
                   usb[:serialno].  This will cause avrdude to search a JTAG ICE
                   mkII on USB.  If serialno is also specified, it will be
                   matched against the serial number read from any JTAG ICE mkII
                   found on USB.  The match is done after stripping any existing
                   colons from the given serial number, and right-to-left, so
                   only the least significant bytes from the serial number need
                   to be given.

                   As the AVRISP mkII device can only be talked to over USB, the
                   very same method of specifying the port is required there.

                   For the USB programmer &quot;AVR-Doper&quot; running in HID mode, the
                   port must be specified as avrdoper. Libusb support is
                   required on Unix but not on Windows. For more information
                   about AVR-Doper see http://www.obdev.at/avrusb/avrdoper.html.

                   For the USBtinyISP, which is a simplicistic device not imple&#8208;
                   menting serial numbers, multiple devices can be distinguished
                   by their location in the USB hierarchy.  See the the respec&#8208;
                   tive Troubleshooting entry in the detailed documentation for
                   examples.

                   For programmers that attach to a serial port using some kind
                   of higher level protocol (as opposed to bit-bang style pro&#8208;
                   grammers), port can be specified as net:host:port.  In this
                   case, instead of trying to open a local device, a TCP network
                   connection to (TCP) port on host is established.  The remote
                   endpoint is assumed to be a terminal or console server that
                   connects the network stream to a local serial port where the
                   actual programmer has been attached to.  The port is assumed
                   to be properly configured, for example using a transparent
                   8-bit data connection without parity at 115200 Baud for a
                   STK500.  This feature is currently not implemented for Win32
                   systems.

           -q      Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading
                   or writing to the device.  Specify it a second time for even
                   quieter operation.

           -s      Disable safemode prompting.  When safemode discovers that one
                   or more fuse bits have unintentionally changed, it will
                   prompt for confirmation regarding whether or not it should
                   attempt to recover the fuse bit(s).  Specifying this flag
                   disables the prompt and assumes that the fuse bit(s) should
                   be recovered without asking for confirmation first.

           -t      Tells avrdude to enter the interactive ``terminal&apos;&apos; mode
                   instead of up- or downloading files.  See below for a
                   detailed description of the terminal mode.

           -u      Disable the safemode fuse bit checks.  Safemode is enabled by
                   default and is intended to prevent unintentional fuse bit
                   changes.  When enabled, safemode will issue a warning if the
                   any fuse bits are found to be different at program exit than
                   they were when avrdude was invoked.  Safemode won&apos;t alter
                   fuse bits itself, but rather will prompt for instructions,
                   unless the terminal is non-interactive, in which case
                   safemode is disabled.  See the -s option to disable safemode
                   prompting.

           -U memtype:op:filename[:format]
                   Perform a memory operation as indicated.  The memtype field
                   specifies the memory type to operate on.  The available mem&#8208;
                   ory types are device-dependent, the actual configuration can
                   be viewed with the part command in terminal mode.  Typically,
                   a device&apos;s memory configuration at least contains the memory
                   types flash and eeprom.  All memory types currently known
                   are:
                   calibration  One or more bytes of RC oscillator calibration
                                data.
                   eeprom       The EEPROM of the device.
                   efuse        The extended fuse byte.
                   flash        The flash ROM of the device.
                   fuse         The fuse byte in devices that have only a single
                                fuse byte.
                   hfuse        The high fuse byte.
                   lfuse        The low fuse byte.
                   lock         The lock byte.
                   signature    The three device signature bytes (device ID).
                   fuseN        The fuse bytes of ATxmega devices, N is an inte&#8208;
                                ger number for each fuse supported by the
                                device.
                   application  The application flash area of ATxmega devices.
                   apptable     The application table flash area of ATxmega
                                devices.
                   boot         The boot flash area of ATxmega devices.
                   prodsig      The production signature (calibration) area of
                                ATxmega devices.
                   usersig      The user signature area of ATxmega devices.

                   The op field specifies what operation to perform:

                   r        read device memory and write to the specified file

                   w        read data from the specified file and write to the
                            device memory

                   v        read data from both the device and the specified
                            file and perform a verify

                   The filename field indicates the name of the file to read or
                   write.  The format field is optional and contains the format
                   of the file to read or write.  Format can be one of:

                   i    Intel Hex

                   s    Motorola S-record

                   r    raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the
                        flash ROM data

                   m    immediate; actual byte values specified on the command
                        line, separated by commas or spaces.  This is good for
                        programming fuse bytes without having to create a sin&#8208;
                        gle-byte file or enter terminal mode.

                   a    auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input
                        is not provided at stdin.

                   d    decimal; this and the following formats are only valid
                        on output.  They generate one line of output for the
                        respective memory section, forming a comma-separated
                        list of the values.  This can be particularly useful for
                        subsequent processing, like for fuse bit settings.

                   h    hexadecimal; each value will get the string 0x
                        prepended.

                   o    octal; each value will get a 0 prepended unless it is
                        less than 8 in which case it gets no prefix.

                   b    binary; each value will get the string 0b prepended.
&#12;                   The default is to use auto detection for input files, and raw
                   binary format for output files.  Note that if filename con&#8208;
                   tains a colon, the format field is no longer optional since
                   the filename part following the colon would otherwise be mis&#8208;
                   interpreted as format.

                   As an abbreviation, the form -U filename is equivalent to
                   specifying -U flash:w:filename:a.  This will only work if
                   filename does not have a colon in it.

           -v      Enable verbose output.

           -V      Disable automatic verify check when uploading data.

           -x extended_param
                   Pass extended_param to the chosen programmer implementation
                   as an extended parameter.  The interpretation of the extended
                   parameter depends on the programmer itself.  See below for a
                   list of programmers accepting extended parameters.

           -y      Tells avrdude to use the last four bytes of the connected
                   parts&apos; EEPROM memory to track the number of times the device
                   has been erased.  When this option is used and the -e flag is
                   specified to generate a chip erase, the previous counter will
                   be saved before the chip erase, it is then incremented, and
                   written back after the erase cycle completes.  Presumably,
                   the device would only be erased just before being programmed,
                   and thus, this can be utilized to give an indication of how
                   many erase-rewrite cycles the part has undergone.  Since the
                   FLASH memory can only endure a finite number of erase-rewrite
                   cycles, one can use this option to track when a part is near&#8208;
                   ing the limit.  The typical limit for Atmel AVR FLASH is 1000
                   cycles.  Of course, if the application needs the last four
                   bytes of EEPROM memory, this option should not be used.

           -Y cycles
                   Instructs avrdude to initialize the erase-rewrite cycle
                   counter residing at the last four bytes of EEPROM memory to
                   the specified value.  If the application needs the last four
                   bytes of EEPROM memory, this option should not be used.

   Terminal mode
     In this mode, avrdude only initializes communication with the MCU, and then
     awaits user commands on standard input.  Commands and parameters may be
     abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous form.  Terminal mode provides a
     command history using readline(3), so previously entered command lines can
     be recalled and edited.  The following commands are currently implemented:

           dump memtype addr nbytes
                   Read nbytes bytes from the specified memory area, and display
                   them in the usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

           dump    Continue dumping the memory contents for another nbytes where
                   the previous dump command left off.

           write memtype addr byte1 ... byteN
                   Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at
                   address addr, using the values byte1 through byteN.  This
                   feature is not implemented for bank-addressed memories such
                   as the flash memory of ATMega devices.

           erase   Perform a chip erase.

           send b1 b2 b3 b4
                   Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device.  If you need
                   access to a feature of an AVR part that is not directly sup&#8208;
                   ported by avrdude, this command allows you to use it, even
                   though avrdude does not implement the command. When using
                   direct SPI mode, up to 3 bytes can be omitted.

           sig     Display the device signature bytes.

           spi     Enter direct SPI mode.  The pgmled pin acts as slave select.
                   Only supported on parallel bitbang programmers.

           part    Display the current part settings and parameters.  Includes
                   chip specific information including all memory types sup&#8208;
                   ported by the device, read/write timing, etc.

           pgm     Return to programming mode (from direct SPI mode).

           vtarg voltage
                   Set the target&apos;s supply voltage to voltage Volts.  Only
                   supported on the STK500 and STK600 programmer.

           varef [channel] voltage
                   Set the adjustable voltage source to voltage Volts.  This
                   voltage is normally used to drive the target&apos;s Aref input on
                   the STK500.  On the Atmel STK600, two reference voltages are
                   available, which can be selected by the optional channel
                   argument (either 0 or 1).  Only supported on the STK500 and
                   STK600 programmer.

           fosc freq[M|k]
                   Set the master oscillator to freq Hz.  An optional trailing
                   letter M multiplies by 1E6, a trailing letter k by 1E3.  Only
                   supported on the STK500 and STK600 programmer.

           fosc off
                   Turn the master oscillator off.  Only supported on the STK500
                   and STK600 programmer.

                   STK500 and STK600 programmer only: Set the SCK clock period
                   to period microseconds.

                   JTAG ICE only: Set the JTAG ICE bit clock period to period
                   microseconds.  Note that unlike STK500 settings, this setting
                   will be reverted to its default value (approximately 1
                   microsecond) when the programming software signs off from the
                   JTAG ICE.  This parameter can also be used on the JTAG ICE
                   mkII to specify the ISP clock period when operating the ICE
                   in ISP mode.

   debugWire limitations
     The debugWire protocol is Atmel&apos;s proprietary one-wire (plus ground) proto&#8208;
     col to allow an in-circuit emulation of the smaller AVR devices, using the
     &#8216;/RESET&#8217; line.  DebugWire mode is initiated by activating the &#8216;DWEN&#8217; fuse,
     and then power-cycling the target.  While this mode is mainly intended for
     debugging/emulation, it also offers limited programming capabilities.
     Effectively, the only memory areas that can be read or programmed in this
     mode are flash ROM and EEPROM.  It is also possible to read out the signa&#8208;
     ture.  All other memory areas cannot be accessed.  There is no chip erase
     functionality in debugWire mode; instead, while reprogramming the flash
     ROM, each flash ROM page is erased right before updating it.  This is done
     transparently by the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon).  The only way back from
     debugWire mode is to initiate a special sequence of commands to the JTAG
     ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon), so the debugWire mode will be temporarily dis&#8208;
     abled, and the target can be accessed using normal ISP programming.  This
     sequence is automatically initiated by using the JTAG ICE mkII or AVR
     Dragon in ISP mode, when they detect that ISP mode cannot be entered.

           JTAG ICE mkII

           AVR Dragon
                   When using the JTAG ICE mkII or AVR Dragon in JTAG mode, the
                   following extended parameter is accepted:

                         jtagchain=UB,UA,BB,BA
                                 Setup the JTAG scan chain for UB units before,
                                 UA units after, BB bits before, and BA bits
                                 after the target AVR, respectively.  Each AVR
                                 unit within the chain shifts by 4 bits.  Other
                                 JTAG units might require a different bit shift
                                 count.

           AVR910

                         devcode=VALUE
                                 Override the device code selection by using
                                 VALUE as the device code.  The programmer is
                                 not queried for the list of supported device
                                 codes, and the specified VALUE is not verified
                                 but used directly within the &#8216;T&#8217; command sent
                                 to the programmer.  VALUE can be specified
                                 using the conventional number notation of the C
                                 programming language.

                         no_blockmode
                                 Disables the default checking for block trans&#8208;
                                 fer capability.  Use no_blockmode only if your
                                 AVR910 programmer creates errors during initial
                                 sequence.

           buspirate

                         reset={cs,aux,aux2}
                                 The default setup assumes the BusPirate&apos;s CS
                                 output pin connected to the RESET pin on AVR
                                 side. It is however possible to have multiple
                                 AVRs connected to the same BP with MISO, MOSI
                                 and SCK lines common for all of them.  In such
                                 a case one AVR should have its RESET connected
                                 to BusPirate&apos;s CS pin, second AVR&apos;s RESET con&#8208;
                                 nected to BusPirate&apos;s AUX pin and if your Bus&#8208;
                                 Pirate has an AUX2 pin (only available on Bus&#8208;
                                 Pirate version v1a with firmware 3.0 or newer)
                                 use that to activate RESET on the third AVR.

                                 It may be a good idea to decouple the BusPirate
                                 and the AVR&apos;s SPI buses from each other using a
                                 3-state bus buffer. For example 74HC125 or
                                 74HC244 are some good candidates with the
                                 latches driven by the appropriate reset pin
                                 (cs, aux or aux2). Otherwise the SPI traffic in
                                 one active circuit may interfere with program&#8208;
                                 ming the AVR in the other design.

                         speed=&lt;0..7&gt;
                                 BusPirate to AVR SPI speed:

                                 0 ..  30 kHz   (default)
                                 1 .. 125 kHz
                                 2 .. 250 kHz
                                 3 ..   1 MHz
                                 4 ..   2 MHz
                                 5 ..   2.6 MHz
                                 6 ..   4 MHz
                                 7 ..   8 MHz

                         ascii   Use ASCII mode even when the firmware supports
                                 BinMode (binary mode).  BinMode is supported in
                                 firmware 2.7 and newer, older FW&apos;s either don&apos;t
                                 have BinMode or their BinMode is buggy. ASCII
                                 mode is slower and makes the above reset= and
                                 speed= parameters unavailable.

           Wiring  When using the Wiring programmer type, the following optional
                   extended parameter is accepted:

                         snooze=&lt;0..32767&gt;
                                 After performing the port open phase, AVRDUDE
                                 will wait/snooze for snooze milliseconds before
                                 continuing to the protocol sync phase.  No tog&#8208;
                                 gling of DTR/RTS is performed if snooze is
                                 greater than 0.

DIAGNOSTICS
     avrdude: jtagmkII_setparm(): bad response to set parameter command: RSP_FAILED
     avrdude: jtagmkII_getsync(): ISP activation failed, trying debugWire
     avrdude: Target prepared for ISP, signed off.
     avrdude: Please restart avrdude without power-cycling the target.

     If the target AVR has been set up for debugWire mode (i. e. the DWEN fuse
     is programmed), normal ISP connection attempts will fail as the /RESET pin
     is not available.  When using the JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode, the message
     shown indicates that avrdude has guessed this condition, and tried to ini&#8208;
     tiate a debugWire reset to the target.  When successful, this will leave
     the target AVR in a state where it can respond to normal ISP communication
     again (until the next power cycle).  Typically, the same command is going
     to be retried again immediately afterwards, and will then succeed connect&#8208;
     ing to the target using normal ISP communication.

BUGS
     Please report bugs via
           http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=avrdude.

     The JTAG ICE programmers currently cannot write to the flash ROM one byte
     at a time.  For that reason, updating the flash ROM from terminal mode does
     not work.

     Page-mode programming the EEPROM through JTAG (i.e. through an -U option)
     requires a prior chip erase.  This is an inherent feature of the way JTAG
     EEPROM programming works.  This also applies to the STK500 and STK600 in
     parallel programming mode.

     The USBasp and USBtinyISP drivers do not offer any option to distinguish
     multiple devices connected simultaneously, so effectively only a single
     device is supported.

     The avrftdi driver allows to select specific devices using any combination
     of vid,pid serial number (usbsn) vendor description (usbvendoror part
     description (usbproduct) as seen with lsusb or whatever tool used to view
     USB device information. Multiple devices can be on the bus at the same
     time. For the H parts, which have multiple MPSSE interfaces, the interface
     can also be selected.  It defaults to interface &apos;A&apos;.
