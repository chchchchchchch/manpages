DESCRIPTION
       The  grammar::aycock  package implements a parser generator for the class
       of parsers described in John Aycock and R. Nigel Horspool. Practical Ear&#8208;
       ley  Parsing.   The  Computer Journal, 45(6):620-630, 2002.  http://cite&#8208;
       seerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.12.4254

PROCEDURES
       The grammar::aycock package exports the single procedure:

       ::aycock::parser grammar ?-verbose?
              Generates a parser for the given grammar, and  returns  its  name.
              If  the optional -verbose flag is given, dumps verbose information
              relating to the generated parser  to  the  standard  output.   The
              returned  parser  is  an  object that accepts commands as shown in
              OBJECT COMMAND below.

OBJECT COMMAND
       parserName parse symList valList ?clientData?
              Invokes a parser returned from ::aycock::parser. symList is a list
              of  grammar symbols representing the terminals in an input string,
              and valList is a list of their semantic values. The result is  the
              semantic value of the entire string when parsed.

       parserName destroy
              Destroys a parser constructed by ::aycock::parser.

       parserName terminals
              Returns  a  list  of terminal symbols that may be presented in the
              symList argument to the parse object command.

       parserName nonterminals
              Returns a list of nonterminal symbols that  were  defined  in  the
              parser&apos;s grammar.

       parserName save
              Returns  a  Tcl  script  that  will reconstruct the parser without
              needing all the mechanism of the parser  generator  at  run  time.
              The reconstructed parser depends on a set of commands in the pack&#8208;
              age grammar::aycock::runtime, which is also  automatically  loaded
              when the grammar::aycock package is loaded.

DESCRIPTION
       The  grammar::aycock::parser command accepts a grammar expressed as a Tcl
       list.  The list must be structured as  the  concatenation  of  a  set  of
       rules. Each rule comprises a variable number of elements in the list:

       &#183;      The name of the nonterminal symbol that the rule reduces.

       &#183;      The literal string, ::=

       &#183;      Zero  or  more  names of terminal or nonterminal symbols that com&#8208;
              prise the right-hand-side of the rule.

       &#183;      Finally, a Tcl script to execute when the rule is reduced.  Within
              the  given  script,  a  variable  called  _ contains a list of the
              semantic values of the symbols on the right-hand side.  The  value
              returned by the script is expected to be the semantic value of the
              left-hand side.  If the clientData parameter  was  passed  to  the
              parse method, it is available in a variable called clientData.  It
              is permissible for the script to be the  empty  string.   In  this
              case,  the  semantic  value  of  the  rule will be the same as the
              semantic value of the first symbol on the right-hand side.  If the
              right-hand  side  is  also  empty,  the semantic value will be the
              empty string.

       Parsing is done with an Earley parser, which is not terribly efficient in
       speed  or  memory consumption, but which deals effectively with ambiguous
       grammars.  For this reason, the grammar::aycock package is  perhaps  best
       adapted  to natural-language processing or the parsing of extraordinarily
       complex languages in which ambiguity can be tolerated.

EXAMPLE
       The following code demonstrates a trivial desk calculator, admitting only
       +, * and parentheses as its operators.  It also shows the format in which
       the lexical analyzer is expected  to  present  terminal  symbols  to  the
       parser.


              set p [aycock::parser {
                  start ::= E {}
                  E ::= E + T {expr {[lindex $_ 0] + [lindex $_ 2]}}
                  E ::= T {}
                  T ::= T * F {expr {[lindex $_ 0] * [lindex $_ 2]}}
                  T ::= F {}
                  F ::= NUMBER {}
                  F ::= ( E ) {lindex $_ 1}
              }]
              puts [$p parse {(  NUMBER +  NUMBER )  *  ( NUMBER +  NUMBER ) }  {{} 2      {} 3      {} {} {} 7     {} 1      {}}]
              $p destroy

       The example, when run, prints 40.
