NAME
       b2m - convert old Emacs Rmail Babyl format to mbox format

SYNOPSIS
       b2m &lt; babyl-file &gt; mbox-file

DESCRIPTION
       b2m  accepts Babyl format mail (as used by older versions of Rmail in GNU
       Emacs) on standard input, and converts it to mbox format on standard out&#8208;
       put.   Babyl  was  the  storage format used by Rmail prior to Emacs 23.1.
       Since then, it uses standard mbox format.  This  program  is  distributed
       with GNU Emacs.

OPTIONS
       The program accepts unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

SEE ALSO
       The  Babyl format is described in the file etc/BABYL in the Emacs distri&#8208;
       bution.  Rmail is documented in the GNU Emacs  manual,  which   you   can
       read  using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone program.
