BACKTRACE(3)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               BACKTRACE(3)



NAME
       backtrace, backtrace_symbols, backtrace_symbols_fd - support for applica&#8208;
       tion self-debugging

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;execinfo.h&gt;

       int backtrace(void **buffer, int size);

       char **backtrace_symbols(void *const *buffer, int size);

       void backtrace_symbols_fd(void *const *buffer, int size, int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       backtrace() returns a backtrace for the calling  program,  in  the  array
       pointed  to  by  buffer.   A  backtrace is the series of currently active
       function calls for the program.  Each item in the  array  pointed  to  by
       buffer  is of type void *, and is the return address from the correspond&#8208;
       ing stack frame.  The size  argument  specifies  the  maximum  number  of
       addresses  that can be stored in buffer.  If the backtrace is larger than
       size, then the addresses corresponding to the size most  recent  function
       calls are returned; to obtain the complete backtrace, make sure that buf&#8208;
       fer and size are large enough.

       Given the set of addresses  returned  by  backtrace()  in  buffer,  back&#8208;
       trace_symbols()  translates  the  addresses into an array of strings that
       describe the addresses symbolically.  The  size  argument  specifies  the
       number  of  addresses  in  buffer.   The  symbolic representation of each
       address consists of the function name (if  this  can  be  determined),  a
       hexadecimal  offset  into the function, and the actual return address (in
       hexadecimal).  The address of the array of string pointers is returned as
       the function result of backtrace_symbols().  This array is malloc(3)ed by
       backtrace_symbols(), and must be  freed  by  the  caller.   (The  strings
       pointed to by the array of pointers need not and should not be freed.)

       backtrace_symbols_fd()  takes the same buffer and size arguments as back&#8208;
       trace_symbols(), but instead of returning an  array  of  strings  to  the
       caller,  it  writes the strings, one per line, to the file descriptor fd.
       backtrace_symbols_fd() does not call malloc(3), and so can be employed in
       situations where the latter function might fail.

RETURN VALUE
       backtrace()  returns the number of addresses returned in buffer, which is
       not greater than size.  If the return value is less than size,  then  the
       full  backtrace was stored; if it is equal to size, then it may have been
       truncated, in which case the addresses of the oldest stack frames are not
       returned.

       On  success,  backtrace_symbols()  returns  a  pointer  to the array mal&#8208;
       loc(3)ed by the call; on error, NULL is returned.

VERSIONS
       backtrace(), backtrace_symbols(), and backtrace_symbols_fd() are provided
       in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.

NOTES
       These  functions  make  some  assumptions  about  how a function&apos;s return
       address is stored on the stack.  Note the following:
&#12;       *  Omission of the frame pointers (as implied by any of gcc(1)&apos;s  nonzero
          optimization levels) may cause these assumptions to be violated.

       *  Inlined functions do not have stack frames.

       *  Tail-call optimization causes one stack frame to replace another.

       The  symbol  names  may  be unavailable without the use of special linker
       options.  For systems using the GNU linker, it is necessary  to  use  the
       -rdynamic  linker  option.  Note that names of &quot;static&quot; functions are not
       exposed, and won&apos;t be available in the backtrace.

EXAMPLE
       The program below demonstrates the use of backtrace() and  backtrace_sym&#8208;
       bols().  The following shell session shows what we might see when running
       the program:

           $ cc -rdynamic prog.c -o prog
           $ ./prog 3
           backtrace() returned 8 addresses
           ./prog(myfunc3+0x5c) [0x80487f0]
           ./prog [0x8048871]
           ./prog(myfunc+0x21) [0x8048894]
           ./prog(myfunc+0x1a) [0x804888d]
           ./prog(myfunc+0x1a) [0x804888d]
           ./prog(main+0x65) [0x80488fb]
           /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xdc) [0xb7e38f9c]
           ./prog [0x8048711]
