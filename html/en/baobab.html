NAME
       Baobab - A graphical tool to analyse disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       baobab  [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       baobab is able to scan either specific folders or the whole filesystem
       (local and remote), in order to give the user a graphical tree represen&#8208;
       tation including each directory size or percentage in the branch.  It
       also auto-detects in real-time any change made to your home directory as
       far as any mounted/unmounted device. A graphical treemap window is also
       provided for any selected folder.

       A detailed documentation on the program could be read at:
