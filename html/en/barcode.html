BARCODE(3)                         GNU barcode                        BARCODE(3)



NAME
       barcode - a library to create and print bar codes

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;barcode.h&gt;

       struct Barcode_Item *Barcode_Create(char *text);
       int Barcode_Delete(struct Barcode_Item *bc);
       int Barcode_Encode(struct Barcode_Item *bc, int flags);
       int Barcode_Print(struct Barcode_Item *bc, FILE *f, int flags);
       int Barcode_Position(struct Barcode_Item *bc, int wid, int hei, int xoff,
       int yoff , double scalef);
       int Barcode_Encode_and_Print(char *text, FILE *f, int wid, int  hei,  int
       xoff, int yoff, int flags);
       int Barcode_Version(char *versionname);

DESCRIPTION
       The barcode family of library functions is meant to ease creation of bar-
       code printouts.  The information below  is  extracted  from  the  texinfo
       file, which is the preferred source of information.


       The  functions included in the barcode library are declared in the header
       file barcode.h.  They perform the following tasks:

       struct Barcode_Item *Barcode_Create(char *text);
              The function creates a new barcode object to deal with a specified
              text  string.  It returns NULL in case of failure and a pointer to
              a barcode data structure in case of success.

       int Barcode_Delete(struct Barcode_Item *bc);
              Destroy a barcode object. Always returns 0 (success)

       int Barcode_Encode(struct Barcode_Item *bc, int flags);
              Encode the text included in the bc object.  Valid  flags  are  the
              encoding  type  (other  flags are ignored) and BARCODE_NO_CHECKSUM
              (other flags are silently ignored); if the flag argument is  zero,
              bc-&gt;flags  will apply. The function returns 0 on success and -1 in
              case of error. After successful  termination  the  data  structure
              will  host  the description of the bar code and its textual repre&#8208;
              sentation, after a failure the error field will include the reason
              of the failure.

       int Barcode_Print(struct Barcode_Item *bc, FILE *f, int flags);
              Print  the  bar code described by bc to the specified file.  Valid
              flags   are   the   output   type,   BARCODE_NO_ASCII   and   BAR&#8208;
              CODE_OUT_NOHEADERS, other flags are ignored. If any of these flags
              is zero, it will be inherited from bc-&gt;flags which therefore takes
              precedence.  The  function  returns 0 on success and -1 in case of
              error (with bc-&gt;error set accordingly). In case  of  success,  the
              bar  code  is printed to the specified file, which won&apos;t be closed
              after use.

       int Barcode_Position(struct Barcode_Item *bc, int wid, int hei, int xoff,
       int yoff, double scalef);
              The function is a shortcut to assign values to the data structure.

       int  Barcode_Encode_and_Print(char  *text, FILE *f, int wid, int hei, int
       xoff, int yoff, int flags);
              The function deals with the whole life of the  barcode  object  by
              calling the other functions; it uses all the specified flags.
&#12;       int Barcode_Version(char *versionname);
              Returns the current version as an integer number of the form major
              * 10000 + minor * 100 + release. Therefore, version 1.03.5 will be
              returned  as  10305  and version 0.53 as 5300.  If the argument is
              non-null, it will be used  to  return  the  version  number  as  a
              string.  Note that the same information is available from two pre&#8208;
              processor macros: BARCODE_VERSION (the  string)  and  BARCODE_VER&#8208;
              SION_INT (the integer number).
