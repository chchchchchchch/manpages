BASE64(1)                         User Commands                        BASE64(1)



NAME
       base64 - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       base64 [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Base64 encode or decode FILE, or standard input, to standard output.

       -d, --decode
              decode data

       -i, --ignore-garbage
              when decoding, ignore non-alphabet characters

       -w, --wrap=COLS
              wrap  encoded  lines  after COLS character (default 76).  Use 0 to
              disable line wrapping

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       The data are encoded as described for the base64 alphabet  in  RFC  3548.
       When decoding, the input may contain newlines in addition to the bytes of
       the formal base64 alphabet.  Use --ignore-garbage to attempt  to  recover
       from any other non-alphabet bytes in the encoded stream.
