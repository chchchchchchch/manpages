BASENAME(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                BASENAME(3)



NAME
       basename, dirname - parse pathname components

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;libgen.h&gt;

       char *dirname(char *path);

       char *basename(char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       Warning: there are two different functions basename() - see below.

       The  functions  dirname() and basename() break a null-terminated pathname
       string into directory  and  filename  components.   In  the  usual  case,
       dirname() returns the string up to, but not including, the final &apos;/&apos;, and
       basename() returns the component following the final &apos;/&apos;.   Trailing  &apos;/&apos;
       characters are not counted as part of the pathname.

       If  path does not contain a slash, dirname() returns the string &quot;.&quot; while
       basename() returns a copy of path.  If path is the string &quot;/&quot;, then  both
       dirname()  and  basename()  return  the  string  &quot;/&quot;.   If path is a NULL
       pointer or points to an empty string, then both dirname() and  basename()
       return the string &quot;.&quot;.

       Concatenating  the  string  returned  by dirname(), a &quot;/&quot;, and the string
       returned by basename() yields a complete pathname.

       Both dirname() and basename() may modify the contents of path, so it  may
       be desirable to pass a copy when calling one of these functions.

       These  functions may return pointers to statically allocated memory which
       may be overwritten by subsequent calls.  Alternatively, they may return a
       pointer  to  some  part  of  path, so that the string referred to by path
       should not be modified or freed until the pointer returned by  the  func&#8208;
       tion is no longer required.

       The  following  list  of  examples  (taken  from SUSv2) shows the strings
       returned by dirname() and basename() for different paths:

       path         dirname    basename
       &quot;/usr/lib&quot;    &quot;/usr&quot;    &quot;lib&quot;
       &quot;/usr/&quot;       &quot;/&quot;       &quot;usr&quot;
       &quot;usr&quot;         &quot;.&quot;       &quot;usr&quot;
       &quot;/&quot;           &quot;/&quot;       &quot;/&quot;
       &quot;.&quot;           &quot;.&quot;       &quot;.&quot;
       &quot;..&quot;          &quot;.&quot;       &quot;..&quot;

RETURN VALUE
       Both dirname() and basename() return pointers to null-terminated strings.
       (Do not pass these pointers to free(3).)

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       There  are  two  different  versions  of  basename()  - the POSIX version
       described above, and the GNU version, which one gets after

           #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;
&#12;       The GNU version never modifies its argument, and returns the empty string
       when  path  has  a trailing slash, and in particular also when it is &quot;/&quot;.
       There is no GNU version of dirname().

       With glibc, one gets the POSIX version of basename() when  &lt;libgen.h&gt;  is
       included, and the GNU version otherwise.

BUGS
       In the glibc implementation of the POSIX versions of these functions they
       modify their argument, and segfault when called with a static string like
       &quot;/usr/&quot;.  Before glibc 2.2.1, the glibc version of dirname() did not cor&#8208;
       rectly handle pathnames with trailing &apos;/&apos;  characters,  and  generated  a
       segfault if given a NULL argument.

EXAMPLE
           char *dirc, *basec, *bname, *dname;
           char *path = &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;;

           dirc = strdup(path);
           basec = strdup(path);
           dname = dirname(dirc);
           bname = basename(basec);
           printf(&quot;dirname=%s, basename=%s\n&quot;, dname, bname);
