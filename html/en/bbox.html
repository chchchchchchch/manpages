BBOX(1)                                                                  BBOX(1)



NAME
       bbox - prints out the bounding box of a rawppm or rawpbm image

SYNOPSIS
       bbox [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -h ] [ -V ] [ rawpbmfile ]


DESCRIPTION
       bbox reads a rawppm or rawpbm file and prints out the bounding box of the
       image (as postscript comment and in postscript points, i.e.  1/72dpi)  as
       well  as  the  high  resolution bounding box. Input is read from standard
       input if no filename is specified.  Example output:

              %%BoundingBox: 12 253 829 837
              %%HiResBoundingBox: 12.500000 253.000000 828.500000 837.00000


       bbox has only very limited memory requirements as it reads the input line
       by line and thus needs to store only one picture line in memory.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V     Show version of program.

       -r     resolution of picture in dpi

       -l     loose  bounding  box (integer bounding box is expanded by 1 point,
              hires bounding box is expanded by 0.5 points)

   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Special thanks goes to Michael Sharpe from UCSD who suggested  a  lot  of
       improvements  for  bbox to become more precise and robust, especially for
       small drawings.

BUGS
       Though the code is quite small and the probability for bugs is now small,
       there may be some left somewhere between the lines.   In  case  you  find
       one,  please  send  a  short  description  with  bbox  version  number to
       &lt;roland@bless.de&gt; (please allow some time to reply).
