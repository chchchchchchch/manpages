NAME
       beef - flexible Brainfuck interpreter


SYNOPSIS
       beef [OPTIONS] FILE


DESCRIPTION
       beef  is  a Brainfuck interpreter written in C. It is written with flexi&#8208;
       bility and portability in mind: it is not the smallest  nor  the  fastest
       Brainfuck  interpreter  on  Earth, but it has some options to control his
       behavior and doesn&apos;t suffer most of the  limitations  which  are  usually
       present in Brainfuck interpreters.

       One  of  the  best  features of beef is that it has no limitations on the
       length of the tape, which is created dinamically, and allows you to  move
       in any direction, even to move an unlimited amount of cells left when you
       are on the starting cell.

       beef also allows you to control his behavior in case  it  reads  and  EOF
       from the input stream: see below for a list of available options.


OPTIONS
       -d     Enable  debugging.  The  debugging  command  #  is not part of the
              Brainfuck language, but it&apos;s an useful feature for the programmer,
              so most interpreters implement it. Debugging is off by default.

       -e     When  read  an  EOF  from input, store an EOF in the current cell.
              This is for compatibility with programs written for  other  inter&#8208;
              preters;  the default behavior is to store a 0 in the current cell
              when an EOF is read.

       -n     When read an EOF from input,  do  nothing.  This  is  the  default
              behavior in some other interpreters, so it&apos;s supported in beef for
              compatibility reasons.  The default behavior is to store  a  0  on
              the current cell instead.

       --version
              Show the version number and exit successfully.

       --help Show a short help message and exit with success.


EXIT STATUS
       beef returns an exit staus of zero on success, or an exit status of -1 if
       it was unable to perform the requested operation.

       Please note that no checks are performed on the code: if the code you are
       trying to run is buggy, beef will run it anyway and the result will prob&#8208;
       ably differ from what you expected.
