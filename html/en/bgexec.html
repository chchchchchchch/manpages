NAME
       bgexec - Run programs in the background while handling Tk events.

SYNOPSIS
       blt::bgexec varName ?option value?... program ?arg?...
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  bgexec  command  executes programs in the background, allowing Tk to
       handle events.  A global Tcl variable varName is set when the program has
       completed.

INTRODUCTION
       Tcl&apos;s  exec  command  is  very  useful for gathering information from the
       operating system.  It runs a  program  and  returns  the  output  as  its
       result.   This  works well for Tcl-only applications. But for Tk applica&#8208;
       tions, a problem occurs when the program takes time  to  process.   Let&apos;s
       say  we  want  the get the disk usage of a directory.  We&apos;ll use the Unix
       program du to get the summary.

              set out [exec du -s $dir]
              puts &quot;Disk usage for $dir is $out&quot;

       While du is running, scrollbars won&apos;t respond.  None of  the  Tk  widgets
       will  be  redrawn  properly.  The send command won&apos;t work.  And the worst
       part is that the application appears hung up or  dead.   The  problem  is
       that  while  exec is waiting for du to finish, Tk is not able to handle X
       events.

       The bgexec command performs the same functions as exec, but  also  allows
       Tk  to  handle events.  You can execute a long-running program and the Tk
       widgets will behave normally.  When the program finishes, its output  and
       the exit status are written to Tcl variables.  This makes it easy to mon&#8208;
       itor and save the output of a program.

EXAMPLE
       Here is the disk usage example again, this time using bgexec.  The syntax
       to  invoke &quot;du&quot; is exactly the same as the previous example, when we used
       exec.

              global myStatus myOutput
              blt::bgexec myStatus -output myOutput du -s $dir
              puts &quot;Disk usage for $dir is $myOutput&quot;

       Two global variables, myStatus and myOutput, will be set by  bgexec  when
       du  has  completed.  MyStatus  will  contain  the  program&apos;s exit status.
       MyOutput, specified by the -output option, will store the output  of  the
       program.

       You  can also terminate the program by setting the variable myStatus.  If
       myStatus is set before du has completed, the  process  is  killed.  Under
       Unix,  this  is  done  sending  by a configurable signal (by default it&apos;s
       SIGKILL). Under Win32, this is done by calling TerminateProcess. It makes
       no difference what myStatus is set to.

              set myStatus {}

       There  are  several bgexec options to collect different types of informa&#8208;
       tion.
&#12;              global myStatus myOutput myErrs
              blt::bgexec myStatus -output myOutput -error myErrs du -s $dir

       The -error option is similar to -output.  It sets a global variable  when
       the  program  completes.   The  variable will contain any data written to
       stderr by the program.

       The -output and -error variables are set  only  after  the  program  com&#8208;
       pletes.   But  if  the  program takes a long time, to run you may want to
       receive its partial output.  You can gather data as it becomes  available
       using the -onoutput option.  It specifies a Tcl command prefix.  Whenever
       new data is available, this command is executed, with the  data  appended
       as an argument to the command.

              proc GetInfo { data } {
                  puts $data
              }
              blt::bgexec myStatus -onoutput GetInfo du -s $dir

       When  output is available, the procedure GetInfo is called.  The -onerror
       option performs a similar function for the stderr data stream.

       Like exec, bgexec returns an error if the exit code of the program is not
       zero.   If  you think you may get a non-zero exit code, you might want to
       invoke bgexec from within a catch.

              catch { blt::bgexec myStatus -output myOutput du -s $dir }

       By default, bgexec will wait for the program  to  finish.   But  you  can
       detach  the program making ampersand (&amp;) the last argument on the command
       line.

              global myStatus myOutput
              blt::bgexec myStatus -output myOutput du -s $dir &amp;

       Bgexec will return immediately and its result  will  be  a  list  of  the
       spawned  process  ids.  If at some point you need to wait for the program
       to finish up, you can use tkwait.  When the program finishes,  the  vari&#8208;
       able myStatus will be written to, breaking out the tkwait command.

              global myStatus myOutput
              blt::bgexec myStatus -output myOutput du -s $dir &amp;
                ...
              tkwait variable myStatus


SYNTAX
       The bgexec command takes the following form:

         blt::bgexec varName ?option value?... program ?arg?...

       VarName  is  the  name of a global variable which is set when program has
       finished executing.  The exit status of will be stored in  varName.   The
       exit  status  is a list of a status token, the process-id of the program,
       the exit code, and a status message.  You can also prematurely  terminate
       the  program  by setting varName.  Under Unix, the program will be sent a
       signal to terminate it (by default the  signal  is  a  SIGKILL;  see  the
       -killsignal option).

       Program  is the name of the program to be executed and args are any extra
       arguments for program.  The syntax of program and args is the same as the
       exec  command.  So you can redirect I/O, execute pipelines, etc. (see the
       exec manual for further information) just like exec.  If the  last  argu&#8208;
       ment  is  an  ampersand (&amp;), the program will be run detached, and bgexec
       will return immediately.  VarName will still be set with the return  sta&#8208;
       tus when program completes.

OPTIONS
       Option refers to the switch name always beginning with a dash (-).  Value
       is the value of the option.  Option-value pairs are terminated either  by
       the  program  name,  or  double  dashes  (--).  The following options are
       available for bgexec:

       -decodeerror encodingName
              Specifies the encoding of the stderr channel.  This  affects  only
              data  returned  to the Tcl interpreter.  No translation is done on
              file redirection.
              For example if data is to be converted from  Unicode  for  use  in
              Tcl,  you would use the &quot;unicode&quot; encoding. The default is that no
              translation is performed.

       -decodeoutput encodingName
              Specifies the encoding of the stdout channels.  This affects  only
              data  returned  to the Tcl interpreter.  No translation is done on
              file redirection.
              For example if data is to be converted from  Unicode  for  use  in
              Tcl,  you would use the &quot;unicode&quot; encoding. The default is that no
              translation is performed.

       -error varName
              Specifies that a global variable varName is to  be  set  with  the
              contents of stderr after the program has completed.

       -keepnewline boolean
              Specifies  that  a trailing newline should be retained in the out&#8208;
              put. If boolean is true, the trailing newline  is  truncated  from
              the  output  of  the -onoutput and -output variables.  The default
              value is true.

       -killsignal signal
              Specifies the signal to be sent to the program  when  terminating.
              This  is available only under Unix.  Signal can either be a number
              (typically 1-32) or a mnemonic (such as SIGINT). If signal is  the
              empty  string,  then  no  signal is sent.  The default signal is 9
              (SIGKILL).

       -lasterror varName
              Specifies a variable varName that is updated whenever data becomes
              available from standard error of the program.  VarName is a global
              variable. Unlike the -error option, data is available as  soon  as
              it arrives.

       -lastoutput varName
              Specifies a variable varName that is updated whenever data becomes
              available from standard output  of  the  program.   VarName  is  a
              global  variable.  Unlike the -output option, data is available as
              soon as it arrives.

       -linebuffered boolean
              Specifies that updates should be made  on  a  line-by-line  basis.
              Normally  when  new data is available bgexec will set the variable
              (-lastoutput  and  -lasterror  options)  or  invoke  the   command
              (-onoutput  and -onerror options) delivering all the new data cur&#8208;
              rently available.  If boolean is true, only one  line  at  a  time
              will  be  delivered.   This can be useful when you want to process
              the output on a line-by-line basis.  The default value is false.

       -output varName
              Specifies that a global variable varName is to  be  set  with  the
              output  of  the program, once it has completed.  If this option is
              not set, no output will be accumulated.
&#12;       -onerror command
              Specifies the start of a Tcl command that will be  executed  when&#8208;
              ever  new  data  is  available  from  standard  error. The data is
              appended to the command as an extra argument  before  it  is  exe&#8208;
              cuted.

       -onoutput command
              Specifies  the  start of a Tcl command that will be executed when&#8208;
              ever new data is available  from  standard  output.  The  data  is
              appended  to  the  command  as an extra argument before it is exe&#8208;
              cuted.

       -update varName
              Deprecated. This option is replaced by -lasterror.

       --     This marks the end of the options.  The following argument will be
              considered  the  name  of  a program even if it starts with a dash
              (-).

PREEMPTION
       Because bgexec allows Tk to handle events while  a  program  is  running,
       it&apos;s  possible  for  an  application to preempt itself with further user-
       interactions.  Let&apos;s say your application has a button that runs the disk
       usage  example.  And while the du program is running, the user accidently
       presses the button again.  A  second  bgexec  program  will  preempt  the
       first.   What  this  means is that the first program can not finish until
       the second program has completed.

       Care must be taken to prevent an application from  preempting  itself  by
       blocking further user-interactions (such as button clicks).  The BLT busy
       command is very useful for just these situations.  See  the  busy  manual
       for details.

DIFFERENCES WITH FILEEVENT
       Since Tk 4.0, a subset of bgexec can be also achieved using the fileevent
       command.  The steps for running a program in the background are:

       Execute the program with the open command (using the &quot;|&quot; syntax) and save
       the file handle.

              global fileId
              set fileId [open &quot;|du -s $dir&quot; r]

       Next register a Tcl code snippet with fileevent to be run whenever output
       is available on the file handle.  The code snippet  will  read  from  the
       file handle and save the output in a variable.

              fileevent fileId readable {
                  if { [gets $fileId line] &lt; 0 } {
                close $fileId
                set output $temp
                unset fileId temp
                  } else {
                append temp $line
                  }
              }


       The biggest advantage of bgexec is that, unlike fileevent, it requires no
       additional Tcl code to run a program.  It&apos;s simpler and less error prone.
       You  don&apos;t  have to worry about non-blocking I/O.  It&apos;s handled transpar&#8208;
       ently for you.

       Bgexec runs programs that fileevent can not.  Fileevent assumes that  the
       when stdout is closed the program has completed.  But some programs, like
       the Unix compress program, reopen stdout, fooling fileevent into thinking
       the  program  has  terminated.   In the example above, we assume that the
       program will write and flush its output  line-by-line.   However  running
       another program, your application may block in the gets command reading a
       partial line.

       Bgexec lets you get back the exit status of the program. It  also  allows
       you to collect data from both stdout and stderr simultaneously.  Finally,
       since data collection is handled in C code, bgexec  is  faster.  You  get
       back to the Tk event loop more quickly, making your application seem more
       responsive.
