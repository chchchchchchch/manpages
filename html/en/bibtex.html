DESCRIPTION
       This  package provides commands for the parsing of bibliographies in Bib&#8208;
       TeX format.

       ::bibtex::parse ?options? ?text?
              This is the general form of the command for parsing  a  bibliogra&#8208;
              phy.  Depending  on  the  options used to invoke it it will either
              return a token for the parser, or the parsed entries of the  input
              bibliography. Instead of performing an immediate parse returning a
              predefined format the command can also enter an event-based  pars&#8208;
              ing  style  where  all  relevant entries in the input are reported
              through callback commands, in the style of SAX.

       ::bibtex::parse text
              In this form the command will assume that the specified text is  a
              bibliography  in  BibTeX  format, parse it, and then return a list
              containing one element per record found in the bibliography.  Note
              that  comments,  string definitions, preambles, etc. will not show
              up in the result.  Each element will be a list  containing  record
              type,  bibliography key and record data, in this order. The record
              data will be a dictionary, its keys the keys of the  record,  with
              the associated values.

       ::bibtex::parse ?-command cmd? -channel chan
              In  this  form  the  command  will reads the bibliography from the
              specified Tcl channel chan and then returns the same  data  struc&#8208;
              ture as described above.

              If  however  the option -command is specified the result will be a
              handle for the parser instead and all processing will be incremen&#8208;
              tal  and  happen  in  the  background.  When  the  input  has been
              exhausted the callback cmd will be invoked with the result of  the
              parse. The exact definition for the callback is
&#12;
              cmd token parseresult
                     The  parse  result will have the structure explained above,
                     for the simpler forms of the parser.

       Note that the parser will not close the channel after  it  has  exhausted
       it. This is still the responsibility of the user of the parser.

       ::bibtex::parse  ?-recordcommand    recordcmd?  ?-preamblecommand  pream&#8208;
       blecmd? ?-stringcommand   stringcmd? ?-commentcommand  commentcmd? ?-pro&#8208;
       gresscommand progresscmd? (text | -channel chan)
              This  is  the  most  low-level  form  for the parser. The returned
              result will be a handle for the parser. During processing it  will
              invoke the invoke the specified callback commands for each type of
              data found in the bibliography.

              The processing will be incremental and happen  in  the  background
              if,  and  only  if a Tcl channel chan is specified. For a text the
              processing will happen  immediately  and  all  callbacks  will  be
              invoked before the command itself returns.

              The  callbacks,  i.e.  *cmd,  are all command prefixes and will be
              invoked with additional arguments appended to them. The meaning of
              the  arguments depends on the callback and is explained below. The
              first argument will however always be the  handle  of  the  parser
              invoking the callback.

              recordcmd token type key recorddict
                     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects a bib&#8208;
                     liography record in the input. Its arguments are the record
                     type, the bibliography key for the record, and a dictionary
                     containing the keys and values describing the  record.  Any
                     string  macros  known  to  the  parser  have  already  been
                     expanded.

              preamblecmd token preambletext
                     This callback is invoked whenever  the  parser  detects  an
                     @preamble  block in the input. The only additional argument
                     is the text found in the preamble block.  By  default  such
                     entries are ignored.

              stringcmd token stringdict
                     This  callback  is  invoked  whenever the parser detects an
                     @string-based macro definition in the input.  The  argument
                     is  a  dictionary  with  the  macro names as keys and their
                     replacement strings as values. By default such  definitions
                     are  added to the parser state for use in future bibliogra&#8208;
                     phy records.

              commentcmd token commenttext
                     This callback is invoked whenever the parser detects a com&#8208;
                     ment in the input. The only additional argument is the com&#8208;
                     ment text. By default such entries are ignored.

              progresscmd token percent
                     This callback is invoked during processing to tell the user
                     about the progress which has been made. Its argument is the
                     percentage of data processed, as integer number  between  0
                     and  100.   In the case of incremental processing the pere&#8208;
                     centage will always be -1 as the total number of entries is
                     not known beforehand.


       ::bibtex::wait token
              This command waits for the parser represented by the token to com&#8208;
              plete and then returns. The returned result is the empty string.

       ::bibtex::destroy token
              This command cleans up all  internal  state  associated  with  the
              parser represented by the handle token, effectively destroying it.
              This command can be called from within  the  parser  callbacks  to
              terminate processing.

       ::bibtex::addStrings token stringdict
              This  command  adds the macro definitions stored in the dictionary
              stringdict to the parser represented by the handle token.

              The dictionary keys are the  macro  names  and  the  values  their
              replacement  strings.  This  command has the correct signature for
              use as a -stringcommand callback in an invokation of  the  command
              ::bibtex::parse.
