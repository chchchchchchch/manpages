DESCRIPTION
     bibtexconv is a BibTeX file converter which allows one to export BibTeX
     entries to other formats, including customly defined text output. Further&#8208;
     more, it provides the possibility to check URLs (including MD5, size and
     MIME type computations) and to verify ISBN and ISSN numbers.
     bibtexconv provides an interactive mode (usually used in form of export
     scripts) which allows for fine-granular selection of entries, sorting and
     export template specification.

OPTIONS
     The following arguments may be provided:

     BibTeX_File
             The BibTeX input file.

     -export-to-bibtex=file
             Write the results as BibTeX into the given file.

     -export-to-separate-bibtexs=prefix
             Write the results as BibTeX; for each entry, an own file will be
             created. The filename will be generated from given prefix (e.g.
             &quot;/tmp/MyBibTex-&quot;), the entry key and &quot;.bib&quot;.

     -export-to-xml=file
             Write the results as XML (as used by IETF Internet Draft processing
             tools) into the given file.

     -export-to-separate-xmls=prefix
             Write the results as XML; for each entry, an own file will be cre&#8208;
             ated. The filename will be generated from given prefix (e.g.
             &quot;/tmp/MyBibTex-&quot;), the entry key and &quot;.xml&quot;.

     -nbsp=string
             Replace non-breakable space by given string (for example, &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot;
             when writing HTML).

     -check-urls
             Check URLs by downloading the content file and adding MD5, size and
             MIME type entries.

     -only-check-new-urls
             Combined with -check-urls, checks are only performed for new
             entries where MD5, size and/or MIME type are still unknown.

     -store-downloads=directory
             Combined with -check-urls, all checked references are downloaded
             and stored in the given directory. Existing files will be overwrit&#8208;
             ten.

     -add-url-command
             Add \url{} commands to url tags in BibTeX export.

     -skip-notes-with-isbn-and-issn
             When reading the BibTeX file, ignore &quot;note&quot; items with ISBN and
             ISSN.

     -add-notes-with-isbn-and-issn
             When writing a BibTeX file, create &quot;note&quot; items with ISBN and ISSN.

     -non-interactive
             Turns on non-interactive mode. Useful for just performing URL
             checks and ISBN/ISSN verification.

COMMANDS
     After startup, bibtexconv accepts the following commands from standard
     input (not as command-line arguments!):

     cite key custom1 custom2 custom3 custom4 custom5
            Select specific entry in the input BibTeX file, given by key.
            Optionally, up to five custom strings may be attached to the
            selected entry.

     citeAll
            Select all entries in the input BibTeX file.

     clear  Clear all selections.

     echo string
            Write given string to standard output.

EXAMPLES
     Have a look into /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ (or corresponding path
     of your system) for example export scripts. The export scripts contain the
     commands which are read by bibtexconv from standard input.

     bibtexconv \
             /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib \
             -export-to-bibtex=UpdatedReferences.bib \
             -check-urls -only-check-new-urls -non-interactive
             Checks URLs of all entries in /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/exam&#8208;
             ples/ExampleReferences.bib, adds MD5, size and MIME type items and
             writes the results to UpdatedReferences.bib.

     bibtexconv \
             /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib \
             &lt;/usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/web-example.export &gt;MyPublica&#8208;
             tions.html
             Uses export script /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/web-exam&#8208;
             ple.export to export references from /usr/share/doc/bibtex&#8208;
             conv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib to MyPublications.html as XHTML
             1.1.

     bibtexconv \
             /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib \
             &lt;/usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/text-example.export &gt;MyPublica&#8208;
             tions.txt
             Uses export script /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/text-exam&#8208;
             ple.export to export references from /usr/share/doc/bibtex&#8208;
             conv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib to MyPublications.txt as plain
             text.

     bibtexconv \
             /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib \
             -non-interactive -export-to-separate-xmls=reference.
             Convert all references to XML references to be includable in IETF
             Internet Drafts. For each reference, an own file is generated,
             named with the prefix &quot;reference.&quot;, for example reference.Globe&#8208;
             com2010.xml for entry Globecom2010.

     bibtexconv \
             /usr/share/doc/bibtexconv/examples/ExampleReferences.bib \
             -non-interactive -export-to-separate-bibtexs=
             Convert all references to BibTeX references. For each reference, an
             own file is generated, named with the prefix &quot;&quot;, for example Globe&#8208;
             com2010.bib for entry Globecom2010.
