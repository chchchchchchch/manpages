BINDRESVPORT(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            BINDRESVPORT(3)



NAME
       bindresvport - bind a socket to a privileged IP port

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

       int bindresvport(int sockfd, struct sockaddr_in *sin);

DESCRIPTION
       bindresvport() is used to bind a socket descriptor to a privileged anony&#8208;
       mous IP port, that is, a port number arbitrarily selected from the  range
       512 to 1023.

       If  the bind(2) performed by bindresvport() is successful, and sin is not
       NULL, then sin-&gt;sin_port returns the port number actually allocated.

       sin can be NULL, in which case sin-&gt;sin_family is implicitly taken to  be
       AF_INET.   However, in this case, bindresvport() has no way to return the
       port number actually allocated.  (This information can later be  obtained
       using getsockname(2).)

RETURN VALUE
       bindresvport()  returns  0 on success; otherwise -1 is returned and errno
       set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       bindresvport() can fail for any of the same reasons as bind(2).  In addi&#8208;
       tion, the following errors may occur:

       EACCES The  caller  did  not have superuser privilege (to be precise: the
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability is required).

       EADDRINUSE
              All privileged ports are in use.

       EAFNOSUPPORT (EPFNOSUPPORT in glibc 2.7 and earlier)
              sin is not NULL and sin-&gt;sin_family is not AF_INET.

CONFORMING TO
       Not in POSIX.1-2001.  Present on the BSDs, Solaris, and many  other  sys&#8208;
       tems.

NOTES
       Unlike  some  bindresvport()  implementations,  the  glibc implementation
       ignores any value that the caller supplies in sin-&gt;sin_port.
