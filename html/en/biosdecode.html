BIOSDECODE(8)                                                      BIOSDECODE(8)



NAME
       biosdecode - BIOS information decoder

SYNOPSIS
       biosdecode [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       biosdecode parses the BIOS memory and prints information about all struc&#8208;
       tures (or entry points) it knows of. Currently known  entry  point  types
       are:

       &#183; SMBIOS (System Management BIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

       &#183; DMI (Desktop Management Interface, a legacy version of SMBIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

       &#183; SYSID

       &#183; PNP (Plug and Play)

       &#183; ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)

       &#183; BIOS32 (BIOS32 Service Directory)

       &#183; PIR (PCI IRQ Routing)

       &#183; 32OS (BIOS32 Extension, Compaq-specific)
         See ownership for a Compaq ownership tag retrieval tool.

       &#183; SNY (Sony-specific, not decoded)

       &#183; VPD (Vital Product Data, IBM-specific)
         Use vpddecode for a more detailed output.

       &#183; FJKEYINF (Application Panel, Fujitsu-specific)


       biosdecode  started  its  life  as  a part of dmidecode but as more entry
       point types were added, if was moved to a different program.


OPTIONS
       -d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit


FILES
       /dev/mem

BUGS
       Most of the time, biosdecode  prints  too  much  information  (you  don&apos;t
       really  care  about  addresses)  or not enough (because it doesn&apos;t follow
       pointers and has no lookup tables).
