NAME
       bison - GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)

SYNOPSIS
       bison [OPTION]... FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Bison  is  a  parser  generator  in  the  style of yacc(1).  It should be
       upwardly compatible with input files designed for yacc.

       Input files should follow the yacc convention of ending  in  .y.   Unlike
       yacc,  the  generated  files do not have fixed names, but instead use the
       prefix of the input file.  Moreover, if you need to put C++ code  in  the
       input  file, you can end his name by a C++-like extension (.ypp or .y++),
       then bison will follow your extension to name the output  file  (.cpp  or
       .c++).   For  instance,  a grammar description file named parse.yxx would
       produce the generated parser in a file named  parse.tab.cxx,  instead  of
       yacc&apos;s y.tab.c or old Bison version&apos;s parse.tab.c.

       This  description  of  the  options that can be given to bison is adapted
       from the node Invocation in the bison.texinfo  manual,  which  should  be
       taken as authoritative.

       Bison  supports  both traditional single-letter options and mnemonic long
       option names.  Long option names are indicated  with  --  instead  of  -.
       Abbreviations  for  option  names are allowed as long as they are unique.
       When a long option takes an argument,  like  --file-prefix,  connect  the
       option name and the argument with =.

       Generate  a  deterministic  LR  or  generalized LR (GLR) parser employing
       LALR(1), IELR(1), or canonical LR(1) parser tables.  IELR(1) and  canoni&#8208;
       cal LR(1) support is experimental.

       Mandatory  arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       The same is true for optional arguments.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       --print-localedir
              output directory containing locale-dependent data

       --print-datadir
              output directory containing skeletons and XSLT

       -y, --yacc
              emulate POSIX Yacc

       -W, --warnings[=CATEGORY]
              report the warnings falling in CATEGORY

   Parser:
       -L, --language=LANGUAGE
              specify the output programming language (this is  an  experimental
              feature)

       -S, --skeleton=FILE
              specify the skeleton to use
&#12;       -t, --debug
              instrument the parser for debugging

       --locations
              enable location support

       -D, --define=NAME[=VALUE]
              similar to `%define NAME &quot;VALUE&quot;&apos;

       -F, --force-define=NAME[=VALUE]
              override `%define NAME &quot;VALUE&quot;&apos;

       -p, --name-prefix=PREFIX
              prepend PREFIX to the external symbols

       -l, --no-lines
              don&apos;t generate `#line&apos; directives

       -k, --token-table
              include a table of token names

   Output:
       --defines[=FILE]
              also produce a header file

       -d     likewise but cannot specify FILE (for POSIX Yacc)

       -r, --report=THINGS
              also produce details on the automaton

       --report-file=FILE
              write report to FILE

       -v, --verbose
              same as `--report=state&apos;

       -b, --file-prefix=PREFIX
              specify a PREFIX for output files

       -o, --output=FILE
              leave output to FILE

       -g, --graph[=FILE]
              also output a graph of the automaton

       -x, --xml[=FILE]
              also  output  an  XML  report  of the automaton (the XML schema is
              experimental)

   Warning categories include:
       `midrule-values&apos;
              unset or unused midrule values

       `yacc&apos; incompatibilities with POSIX Yacc

       `conflicts-sr&apos;
              S/R conflicts (enabled by default)

       `conflicts-rr&apos;
              R/R conflicts (enabled by default)

       `other&apos;
              all other warnings (enabled by default)

       `all&apos;  all the warnings

       `no-CATEGORY&apos;
              turn off warnings in CATEGORY
&#12;       `none&apos; turn off all the warnings

       `error&apos;
              treat warnings as errors

   THINGS is a list of comma separated words that can include:
       `state&apos;
              describe the states

       `itemset&apos;
              complete the core item sets with their closure

       `lookahead&apos;
              explicitly associate lookahead tokens to items

       `solved&apos;
              describe shift/reduce conflicts solving

       `all&apos;  include all the above information

       `none&apos; disable the report
