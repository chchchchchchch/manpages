NAME
       blkid - locate/print block device attributes

SYNOPSIS
       blkid -L label | -U uuid

       blkid [-dghlv] [-c file] [-w file] [-o format]
             [-s tag] [-t NAME=value] [device ...]

       blkid -p [-O offset] [-S size] [-o format] [-s tag]
                [-n list] [-u list] device ...

       blkid -i [-o format] [-s tag] device ...


DESCRIPTION
       The  blkid program is the command-line interface to working with the lib&#8208;
       blkid(3) library.  It can determine the type of content (e.g.  filesystem
       or  swap)  that  a  block  device  holds,  and  also  attributes (tokens,
       NAME=value pairs) from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL or UUID fields).

       blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching for a device with
       a  specific  NAME=value  pair,  or displaying NAME=value pairs for one or
       more specified devices.

OPTIONS
       The size and offset arguments may be followed by  binary  (2^N)  suffixes
       KiB,  MiB,  GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the &quot;iB&quot; is optional, e.g. &quot;K&quot; has the
       same meaning as &quot;KiB&quot;) or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and EB.

       -c cachefile
              Read from cachefile instead of reading from the default cache file
              /etc/blkid.tab.   If  you  want  to start with a clean cache (i.e.
              don&apos;t report devices previously scanned but not necessarily avail&#8208;
              able at this time), specify /dev/null.

       -d     Don&apos;t  encode non-printing characters. The non-printing characters
              are encoded by ^ and M- notation by default.  Note  that  -o  udev
              output format uses a diffrent encoding and this encoding cannot be
              disabled.

       -g     Perform a garbage collection pass on the  blkid  cache  to  remove
              devices which no longer exist.

       -h     Display a usage message and exit.

       -i     Display  I/O  Limits (aka I/O topology) information.  The &apos;export&apos;
              output format is automatically enabled.  This option can  be  used
              together with the -p option.

       -l     Look  up  only one device that matches the search parameter speci&#8208;
              fied with -t.

       -k     List all known filesystems and RAIDs and exit.

       -t     option.  If there are multiple devices that  match  the  specified
              search  parameter,  then  the  device with the highest priority is
              returned, and/or the first  device  found  at  a  given  priority.
              Device  types  in  order of decreasing priority are Device Mapper,
              EVMS, LVM, MD, and finally regular block devices.  If this  option
              is  not  specified, blkid will print all of the devices that match
              the search parameter.

       -L label
              Look up the device that uses this label (equal to: -l -o device -t
              LABEL=&lt;label&gt;).   This  lookup  method  is  able  to  reliably use
              /dev/disk/by-label  udev  symlinks  (dependent  on  a  setting  in
              /etc/blkid.conf).   Avoid  using  the symlinks directly; it is not
              reliable to use the symlinks without verification.  The -L  option
              works on systems with and without udev.

              Unfortunately,  the  original  blkid(8)  from e2fsprogs use the -L
              option as a synonym for the -o list option.  For better  portabil&#8208;
              ity, use -l -o device -t LABEL=&lt;label&gt; and -o list in your scripts
              rather than the -L option.

       -n list
              Restrict the probing functions to the specified  (comma-separated)
              list  of superblock types (names).  The list items may be prefixed
              with &quot;no&quot; to specify the types which should be ignored.  For exam&#8208;
              ple:

                blkid -p -n vfat,ext3,ext4 /dev/sda1

              probes for vfat, ext3 and ext4 filesystems, and

                blkid -p -n nominix /dev/sda1

              probes  for  all supported formats except minix filesystems.  This
              option is only useful together with -p.

       -o format
              Display blkid&apos;s output using the  specified  format.   The  format
              parameter may be:

              full   print all tags (the default)

              value  print the value of the tags

              list   print  the  devices  in a user-friendly format; this output
                     format is unsupported for low-level probing (-p or -i)

              device print the device name only; this output  format  is  always
                     enabled for -L and -U options

              udev   print key=&quot;value&quot; pairs for easy import into the udev envi&#8208;
                     ronment; the keys are prefixed by ID_FS_ or  ID_PART_  pre&#8208;
                     fixes

                     The  udev  output  returns the ID_FS_AMBIVALENT tag if more
                     superblocks are  detected,  and  ID_PART_ENTRY_*  tags  are
                     always  returned  for all partitions including empty parti&#8208;
                     tions.

              export print key=value pairs for easy import into the environment;
                     this output format is automatically enabled when I/O Limits
                     (-i option) are requested

       -O offset
              Probe at the given offset (only useful with -p).  This option  can
              be used together with the -i option.

       -p     Switch to low-level superblock probing mode (bypass cache).

              Note  that low-level probing also returns information about parti&#8208;
              tion table type (PTTYPE tag) and partitions (PART_ENTRY_* tags).

       -s tag For each (specified) device, show only the tags  that  match  tag.
              It is possible to specify multiple -s options.  If no tag is spec&#8208;
              ified, then all tokens are shown for all (specified) devices.   In
              order to just refresh the cache without showing any tokens, use -s
              none with no other options.

       -S size
              Overwrite device/file size (only useful with -p).

       -t NAME=value
              Search for block devices with tokens  named  NAME  that  have  the
              value value, and display any devices which are found.  Common val&#8208;
              ues for NAME include TYPE, LABEL,  and  UUID.   If  there  are  no
              devices  specified  on the command line, all block devices will be
              searched; otherwise only the specified devices are searched.

       -u list
              Restrict the probing functions to the specified  (comma-separated)
              list  of  &quot;usage&quot;  types.   Supported usage types are: filesystem,
              raid, crypto and other.  The list items may be prefixed with  &quot;no&quot;
              to specify the usage types which should be ignored.  For example:

                blkid -p -u filesystem,other /dev/sda1

              probes for all filesystem and other (e.g. swap) formats, and

                blkid -p -u noraid /dev/sda1

              probes  for  all  supported  formats except RAIDs.  This option is
              only useful together with -p.

       -U uuid
              Look up the device that uses this uuid.  For more details see  the
              -L option.

       -v     Display version number and exit.

       -w writecachefile
              Write  the device cache to writecachefile instead of writing it to
              the default cache file /etc/blkid.tab.  If you don&apos;t want to  save
              the cache at all, specify /dev/null.  If not specified, it will be
              the same file as that given with the -c option.

       device Display tokens from only the specified device.  It is possible  to
              give  multiple  device  options  on  the command line.  If none is
              given, all devices which appear in /proc/partitions are shown,  if
              they are recognized.

RETURN CODE
       If  the specified token was found, or if any tags were shown from (speci&#8208;
       fied) devices, 0 is returned.

       If the specified token was not found, or no (specified) devices could  be
       identified, an exit code of 2 is returned.

       For usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is returned.

       If  the ambivalent low-level probing result was detected, an exit code of
       8 is returned.
