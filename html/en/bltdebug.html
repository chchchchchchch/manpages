NAME
       bltdebug - print Tcl commands before execution

SYNOPSIS
       bltdebug ?level?
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The bltdebug command is a simple tracing facility for Tcl commands.  Each
       command line is printed before it is executed  on  standard  error.   The
       output  consists  of the command line both before and after substitutions
       have occurred.  Level indicates at what level to stop  tracing  commands.
       If level is 0, no tracing is performed. This is the default.  If no level
       argument is given, the current level is printed.
