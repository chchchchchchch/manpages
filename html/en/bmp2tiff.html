BMP2TIFF(1)                                                          BMP2TIFF(1)



NAME
       bmp2tiff - create a TIFF file from a Microsoft Windows Device Independent
       Bitmap image file

SYNOPSIS
       bmp2tiff [ options ] input.bmp [ input2.bmp ... ] output.tiff

DESCRIPTION
       bmp2tiff converts a Microsoft Windows  Device  Independent  Bitmap  image
       file  to TIFF.  If several input BMP files are being specified the multi&#8208;
       page TIFF output file will be created. By default, the TIFF image is cre&#8208;
       ated  with  data  samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with
       the PackBits algorithm (Compression=32773), and with each strip  no  more
       than  8  kilobytes.   These characteristics can overridden, or explicitly
       specified with the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when writing  image  data:  -c
              none  for no compression, -c packbits for the PackBits compression
              algorithm (the default), -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG compression
              algorithm,  -c  zip  for the Deflate compression algorithm, and -c
              lzw for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch.

       -r number
              Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;  by  default
              the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip is approx&#8208;
              imately 8 kilobytes.
