NAME
       bonobo-activation-server - GNOME component tracker

DESCRIPTION
       This  application  tracks information about installed components and bro&#8208;
       kers components, in conjunction with its client library;  libbonobo-acti&#8208;
       vation.

       It      reads      the     component     descriptions     from     ${pre&#8208;
       fix}/lib/bonobo/servers/*.server.  These files provide an XML description
       of  a  components  capabilities  which  can be queried and manipulated by
       clients from the client library.

       Bonobo-activation-server also ensures that the minimum neccessary  number
       of servers for your display setup are running.

       Bonobo-activation-server  executes  all  components  with the environment
       inherited from the first process to start  the  server.  In  addition  to
       using  your  prefix,  it  will examine the BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH and the
       GNOME2_PATH environment variables to find .server files.

       In  addition  it  examines  an   XML   configuration   file   in   ${pre&#8208;
       fix}/etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-config.xml
