BOOT(7)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    BOOT(7)



NAME
       boot-scripts - general description of boot sequence

DESCRIPTION
       The  boot  sequence  varies  in  details among systems but can be roughly
       divided to the following steps: (i) hardware boot, (ii) operating  system
       (OS)  loader,  (iii)  kernel  startup,  (iv)  init  and inittab, (v) boot
       scripts.  We will describe each of these in more detail below.

   Hardware-boot
       After power-on or hard reset, control is given to  a  program  stored  on
       read-only memory (normally PROM).  In PC we usually call this program the
       BIOS.

       This program normally makes a basic self-test of the machine and accesses
       nonvolatile  memory to read further parameters.  This memory in the PC is
       battery-backed CMOS memory, so most people  refer  to  it  as  the  CMOS,
       although outside of the PC world, it is usually called nvram (nonvolatile
       ram).

       The parameters stored in the nvram vary between systems, but as  a  mini&#8208;
       mum,  the  hardware  boot program should know what is the boot device, or
       which devices to probe as possible boot devices.

       Then the hardware boot stage accesses  the  boot  device,  loads  the  OS
       Loader,  which  is  located  on  a fixed position on the boot device, and
       transfers control to it.

       Note:  We do not cover here booting from  network.   Those  who  want  to
              investigate  this  subject  may want to research: DHCP, TFTP, PXE,
              Etherboot.

   OS Loader
       In PC, the OS Loader is located in the first sector of the boot device  -
       this is the MBR (Master Boot Record).

       In  most systems, this primary loader is very limited due to various con&#8208;
       straints.  Even on non-PC systems there are some limitations to the  size
       and complexity of this loader, but the size limitation of the PC MBR (512
       bytes including the  partition  table)  makes  it  almost  impossible  to
       squeeze a full OS Loader into it.

       Therefore,  most  operating  systems  make the primary loader call a sec&#8208;
       ondary OS loader which may be located on a specified disk partition.

       In Linux the OS loader is normally lilo(8) or grub(8).  Both of them  may
       install  either  as secondary loaders (where the DOS installed MBR points
       to them), or as a two part loader where they provide special MBR contain&#8208;
       ing  the  bootstrap  code  to load the second part of the loader from the
       root partition.

       The main job of the OS Loader is to locate the kernel on the  disk,  load
       it and run it.  Most OS loaders allow interactive use, to enable specifi&#8208;
       cation of alternative kernel (maybe a backup in case  the  last  compiled
       one isn&apos;t functioning) and to pass optional parameters to the kernel.

   Kernel Startup
       When  the  kernel  is loaded, it initializes the devices (via their driv&#8208;
       ers), starts the swapper (it is a &quot;kernel process&quot;, called kswapd in mod&#8208;
       ern Linux kernels), and mounts the root file system (/).

       Some  of  the parameters that may be passed to the kernel relate to these
       activities (e.g: You can override the default  root  file  system).   For
       further information on Linux kernel parameters read bootparam(7).

       Only  then the kernel creates the first (user land) process which is num&#8208;
       bered 1.  This process  executes  the  program  /sbin/init,  passing  any
       parameters that weren&apos;t handled by the kernel already.

   init and inittab
       When  init  starts  it reads /etc/inittab for further instructions.  This
       file defines what should be run in different run-levels.

       This gives the system administrator an easy management scheme, where each
       run-level is associated with a set of services (e.g, S is single-user, on
       2 most network services start).  The administrator may change the current
       run-level via init(8) and query the current run-level via runlevel(8).

       However,  since  it  is  not  convenient to manage individual services by
       editing this file, inittab only bootstraps a set of scripts that actually
       start/stop the individual services.

   Boot Scripts
       Note:  The following description applies to System V release 4-based sys&#8208;
              tems,  which  currently  covers  most  commercial   UNIX   systems
              (Solaris, HP-UX, Irix, Tru64) as well as the major Linux distribu&#8208;
              tions (Red Hat, Debian, Mandriva,  SUSE,  Ubuntu).   Some  systems
              (Slackware  Linux,  FreeBSD,  OpenBSD)  have  a somewhat different
              scheme of boot scripts.

       For each managed service (mail, nfs server, cron, etc.) there is a single
       startup  script located in a specific directory (/etc/init.d in most ver&#8208;
       sions of Linux).  Each of these scripts accepts as a single argument  the
       word  &quot;start&quot;  --  causing it to start the service, or the word &quot;stop&quot; --
       causing it to stop the service.  The script may optionally  accept  other
       &quot;convenience&quot;  parameters  (e.g: &quot;restart&quot;, to stop and then start, &quot;sta&#8208;
       tus&quot; do display the service status).  Running the script without  parame&#8208;
       ters displays the possible arguments.

   Sequencing Directories
       To  make  specific  scripts start/stop at specific run-levels and in spe&#8208;
       cific order, there are sequencing directories.   These  are  normally  in
       /etc/rc[0-6S].d.   In  each of these directories there are links (usually
       symbolic) to the scripts in the /etc/init.d directory.

       A primary script (usually /etc/rc) is called from  inittab(5)  and  calls
       the  services  scripts  via the links in the sequencing directories.  All
       links with names that begin with &apos;S&apos; are being called with  the  argument
       &quot;start&quot;  (thereby starting the service).  All links with names that begin
       with &apos;K&apos; are being called with the argument &quot;stop&quot; (thereby stopping  the
       service).

       To  define  the starting or stopping order within the same run-level, the
       names of the links  contain  order-numbers.   Also,  to  make  the  names
       clearer,  they  usually  end  with the name of the service they refer to.
       Example: the link /etc/rc2.d/S80sendmail starts the sendmail  service  on
       runlevel  2.   This  happens after /etc/rc2.d/S12syslog is run but before
       /etc/rc2.d/S90xfs is run.

       To manage the boot order and run-levels, we have to manage  these  links.
       However,  on  many  versions  of Linux, there are tools to help with this
       task (e.g: chkconfig(8)).

   Boot Configuration
       Usually the daemons started may optionally receive  command-line  options
       and  parameters.   To allow system administrators to change these parame&#8208;
       ters without editing the boot scripts themselves, configuration files are
       used.   These  are located in a specific directory (/etc/sysconfig on Red
       Hat systems) and are used by the boot scripts.

       In older UNIX systems, these files  contained  the  actual  command  line
       options for the daemons, but in modern Linux systems (and also in HP-UX),
       these  files  just  contain  shell  variables.   The  boot   scripts   in
       /etc/init.d  source  the  configuration  files, and then use the variable
       values.

FILES
       /etc/init.d/, /etc/rc[S0-6].d/, /etc/sysconfig/
