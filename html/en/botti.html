NAME
       botti &#8212; Run an irssi module, such as a bot, without a UI

SYNOPSIS
       botti [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the botti command.

       Botti  allows  for you to run an irssi module without a UI.  This is most
       useful for bots, and by default botti will load the &quot;bot&quot; module.

       This manual page was written for  the  Debian  distribution  because  the
       original program does not have a manual page.

                 ~/.irssi/config.

       --home
                 Specify the irssi home directory location. By  default,  it  is
                 ~/.irssi.

       -l     --load
                 Specify a module to load. By default, it is &quot;bot&quot;.
