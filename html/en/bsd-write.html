WRITE(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 WRITE(1)

NAME
     write &#8212; send a message to another user

SYNOPSIS
     write user [tty]

DESCRIPTION
     The write utility allows you to communicate with other users, by copying
     lines from your terminal to theirs.

     When you run the write command, the user you are writing to gets a message
     of the form:

           Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...

     Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user&apos;s termi&#8208;
     nal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must run write as well.

     When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other
     user will see the message &#8216;EOF&#8217; indicating that the conversation is over.

     You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you with
     the mesg(1) command.

     If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal,
     you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal name
     as the second operand to the write command.  Alternatively, you can let
     write select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the shortest
     idle time.  This is so that if the user is logged in at work and also
     dialed up from home, the message will go to the right place.

     The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string &#8216;-o&#8217;,
     either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that it is the
     other person&apos;s turn to talk.  The string &#8216;oo&#8217; means that the person
     believes the conversation to be over.

     mesg(1), talk(1), wall(1), who(1)

HISTORY
     A write command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.

BUGS
     The sender&apos;s LC_CTYPE setting is used to determine which characters are
     safe to write to a terminal, not the receiver&apos;s (which write has no way of
     knowing).

     The write utility does not recognize multibyte characters.
