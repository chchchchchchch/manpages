BSD_SIGNAL(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              BSD_SIGNAL(3)



NAME
       bsd_signal - signal handling with BSD semantics

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

       sighandler_t bsd_signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

DESCRIPTION
       The bsd_signal() function takes the same arguments, and performs the same
       task, as signal(2).

       The difference between the two is that bsd_signal() is guaranteed to pro&#8208;
       vide reliable signal semantics, that is: a) the disposition of the signal
       is not reset to the default when the handler is invoked; b)  delivery  of
       further  instances  of  the signal is blocked while the signal handler is
       executing; and c) if the handler interrupts a blocking system call,  then
       the  system call is automatically restarted.  A portable application can&#8208;
       not rely on signal(2) to provide these guarantees.

RETURN VALUE
       The bsd_signal() function returns the previous value of the  signal  han&#8208;
       dler, or SIG_ERR on error.

ERRORS
       As for signal(2).

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of bsd_sig&#8208;
       nal(), recommending the use of sigaction(2) instead.

NOTES
       Use of bsd_signal() should be avoided; use sigaction(2) instead.

       On modern Linux systems, bsd_signal() and signal(2) are equivalent.   But
       on  older  systems,  signal(2)  provided unreliable signal semantics; see
       signal(2) for details.

       The use of sighandler_t is a GNU extension; this type is only defined  if
       the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined.
