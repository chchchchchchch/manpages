BTCFLASH(8)                  firmware flash utility                  BTCFLASH(8)



NAME
       BTCFLASH - firmware flash utility for BTC DRW1008 DVD+/-RW recorder.


SYNOPSIS
       btcflash DEVICE FILE


DESCRIPTION
       BTCFLASH  may also work with other BTC DVD recorders, such as the DRW1004
       and DRW1108, but they have not been tested. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

       Firmware files may be obtained by running BTC&apos;s  Windows  flash  utility,
       then  searching  in  the  WINDOWSTEMP  or WINNTTEMP directory for a *.HEX
       file. It will probably be in a subdirectory named PAC*.tmp.DIR,  and  the
       HEX file will be named Vnnnn.HEX, where nnnn is the firmware version num&#8208;
       ber. You&apos;ll also find IDEFLASH.EXE or BTCFLASH.EXE in the same directory.


OPTIONS
       DEVICE Write the firmware to the given device.

       FILE   Read the firmware from the given  file.  This  utility  will  also
              accept firmware files in &quot;.BIN&quot; format.
