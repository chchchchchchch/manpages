BTOWC(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   BTOWC(3)



NAME
       btowc - convert single byte to wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t btowc(int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The  btowc()  function converts c, interpreted as a multibyte sequence of
       length 1, starting in the initial shift state, to a  wide  character  and
       returns  it.   If c is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1,
       the btowc() function returns WEOF.

RETURN VALUE
       The btowc() function returns the wide character converted from the single
       byte  c.   If  c is EOF or not a valid multibyte sequence of length 1, it
       returns WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of btowc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  current
       locale.

       This function should never be used.  It does not work for encodings which
       have state, and unnecessarily treats single bytes differently from multi&#8208;
       byte  sequences.   Use  either  mbtowc(3)  or  the thread-safe mbrtowc(3)
       instead.
