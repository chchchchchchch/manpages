BUILD-RDEPS(1)                                                    BUILD-RDEPS(1)



NAME
       build-rdeps - find packages that depend on a specific package to build
       (reverse build depends)

SYNOPSIS
       build-rdeps package

DESCRIPTION
       build-rdeps searches for all packages that build-depend on the specified
       package.

OPTIONS
       -u, --update
           Run apt-get update before searching for build-depends.

       -s, --sudo
           Use sudo when running apt-get update. Has no effect if -u is omitted.

       --distribution
           Select another distribution, which is searched for build-depends.

       --only-main
           Ignore contrib and non-free

       --exclude-component
           Ignore the given component (e.g. main, contrib, non-free).

       --origin
           Restrict the search to only the specified origin (such as &quot;Debian&quot;).

       -m, --print-maintainer
           Print the value of the maintainer field for each package.

       -d, --debug
           Run the debug mode

       --help
           Show the usage information.

       --version
           Show the version information.

REQUIREMENTS
       The tool requires apt Sources files to be around for the checked
       components.  In the default case this means that in /var/lib/apt/lists
       files need to be around for main, contrib and non-free.

       In practice this means one needs to add one deb-src line for each
       component, e.g.

       deb-src http://&lt;mirror&gt;/debian &lt;dist&gt; main contrib non-free

       and run apt-get update afterwards or use the update option of this tool.
