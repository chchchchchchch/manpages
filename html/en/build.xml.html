build.xml(5)                                                        build.xml(5)



NAME
       build.xml - configuration file used by ant to build projects


DESCRIPTION
       The  file  build.xml  is  the  default  configuration file used by ant to
       determine target to build for a specific project. It  can  be  considered
       the ant equivalent of Makefile.

       The  format  of  ant  is XML and for each project a separate file is con&#8208;
       structed.  The buildfile consists of one or more  tasks.  An  example  is
       given below.

       &lt;project default=&quot;compile&quot;&gt;

         &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot;&gt;
           &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;src&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/target&gt;

       &lt;/project&gt;

       This  example  has one target and it is defaulted. The target itself con&#8208;
       sists of one task javac which compiles the files in the src directory.


TARGETS
       Targets can depend on other targets. These dependencies are given by  the
       depends attribute of the &lt;target&gt; element.


TASKS
       A  task  is  a  piece  of code that is executed.  Ant recognizes built-in
       task, optional tasks, but one can also write new tasks.

       Built-in tasks

       The built-in tasks are: Ant, AntCall,  AntStructure,  AntVersion,  Apply,
       Apt,  Available,  Basename, BuildNumber, BUnzip2, BZip2, Checksum, Chmod,
       Concat, Condition, Copy,  Componentdef,  Cvs,  CvsChangeLog,  CvsVersion,
       CVSPass,  CvsTagDiff,  Defaultexcludes, Delete, Deltree, Dependset, Diag&#8208;
       nostics, Dirname,  Ear,  Echo,  EchoXML,  Exec,  Fail,  Filter,  FixCRLF,
       GenKey,  Get,  HostInfo, GUnzip, GZip, Import, Include, Input, Jar, Java,
       Javac, Javadoc, Length, LoadFile,  LoadProperties,  LoadResource,  Local,
       MakeURL,  Mail, MacroDef, Manifest, ManifestClassPath, Mkdir, Move, Nice,
       Parallel,  Patch,  PathConvert,  PreSetDef,   Property,   PropertyHelper,
       Record,  Replace, ResourceCount, Retry, Rmic, Sequential, SignJar, Sleep,
       Sql, SubAnt, Sync, Tar, Taskdef, Tempfile, Touch, Truncate, TStamp, Type&#8208;
       def,  Unjar,  Untar, Unwar, Unzip, Uptodate, Waitfor, WhichResource, War,
       XmlProperty, XSLT, Zip


       Java   Executes a Java class within the running (Ant) VM or forks another
              VM  if  specified.  Below  are some of the attibutes to the &lt;java&gt;
              element:

              classname (required) the Java class to execute

              fork if enabled triggers the class execution in another  VM  (dis&#8208;
              abled by default)

              jvm  the  command used to invoke the Java Virtual Machine, default
              is java. The  command  is  resolved  by  java.lang.Runtime.exec().
              Ignored if fork is disabled.

              Other  arguments  are  classpath, classpathref, maxmemory, failon&#8208;
              error, dir and output.


       Javac  Compiles a source tree within the running (Ant) VM.

              srcdir (required) location of the java files

              destdir location to store the class files

              debug indicates whether  source  should  be  compiled  with  debug
              information; defaults to off

              optimize  indicates  whether  source should be compiled with opti&#8208;
              mization; defaults to off

              target generate class files for specific VM version (e.g., 1.1  or
              1.2).

              includes  comma-separated  list  of patterns of files that must be
              included; all files are included when omitted

              excludes comma-separated list of patterns of files  that  must  be
              excluded;  no  files  (except  default excludes) are excluded when
              omitted.

              defaultexcludes indicates whether default excludes should be  used
              (yes | no); default excludes are used when omitted.

              Other  arguments  are includesfile, excludesfile, classpath, boot&#8208;
              classpath, classpathref, bootclasspathref, extdirs, encoding, dep&#8208;
              recation,   verbose,   includeAntRuntime,  includeJavaRuntime  and
              failonerror.


Properties
       A project can have a set of properties, which consist  of  a  name  value
       combination.  Within  tasks they can be used by placing them between &quot;${&quot;
       and &quot;}&quot;, as in &quot;${builddir}/classes&quot;.

       Built-in Properties

       Ant provides access to all system properties as if they had been  defined
       using  a  &lt;property&gt; task. For example, ${os.name} expands to the name of
       the operating system.


       basedir
              the absolute path of  the  project&apos;s  basedir  (as  set  with  the
              basedir attribute of &lt;project&gt;).

       ant.file
              the absolute path of the buildfile.

       ant.version
              the version of Ant.

       ant.project.name
              the  name of the project that is currently executing; it is set in
              the name attribute of &lt;project&gt;.

       ant.java.version
              the JVM version Ant detected; currently it  can  hold  the  values
              &quot;1.1&quot;, &quot;1.2&quot; and &quot;1.3&quot;.


Classpath
       The classpath can be set by using the &lt;classpath&gt; element:

       &lt;classpath&gt;
         &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/helper.jar&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;fileset dir=&quot;lib&quot;&gt;
           &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.jar&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/fileset&gt; &lt;/classpath&gt;
