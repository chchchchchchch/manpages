BUNDLEDOC(1)                      User Commands                     BUNDLEDOC(1)



NAME
       bundledoc - bundle all the files needed by a LaTeX document

SYNOPSIS
       bundledoc [--version] [--help] [--[no]verbose] [--texfile=file]
       [--directory=directory] [--[no]localonly] [--exclude=string]
       [--include=filespec] [--manifest=file] [--listdeps=[yes|no|only|rel]...]
       [--[no]keepdirs] [--config=file] .dep file

DESCRIPTION
       bundledoc is a post-processor for the snapshot package that bundles
       together all the classes, packages, and files needed to build a given
       LaTeX document.  It reads the .dep file that snapshot produces, finds
       each of the files mentioned therein, and packages them into a single
       archive file (e.g., a .tar.gz file), suitable for moving across systems,
       transmitting to a colleague, etc.

       As the simplest example possible, consider a LaTeX file called, say,
       hello.tex:

           \RequirePackage{snapshot}       % Needed by bundledoc
           \documentclass[11pt]{article}

           \begin{document}
           Hello, world!
           \end{document}

       The &quot;\RequirePackage{snapshot}&quot; causes a hello.dep file to be produced.
       When bundledoc is then given &quot;hello.dep&quot; as an argument, it locates the
       dependent files -- snapshot.sty, article.cls, and size11.clo -- and
       bundles them into a single archive file, along with hello.tex and a
       MANIFEST file (described in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;, below).

OPTIONS
       In the following descriptions, somefile refers to the name of your main
       LaTeX document (no extension).

       bundledoc requires the name of the dependency file produced by snapshot
       (normally somefile.dep).  The following options may also be given:

       --version
           Output the bundledoc script&apos;s version number.  This overrides all of
           the remaining options.

       --help
           Give a brief usage message.  This overrides all of the remaining
           options.

       --[no]verbose                    (default: &quot;noverbose&quot;)
           bundledoc normally does not output anything except error messages.
           With &quot;--verbose&quot;, it outputs copious status messages.

       --texfile=main .tex file            (default: somefile.tex)
           snapshot&apos;s dependency file does not list the main LaTeX file (the one
           that gets passed to latex).  In order for bundledoc to find and
           bundle that file, bundledoc assumes it has the same name as the
           snapshot dependency file but with a .tex extension.  If this is not
           the case, then use &quot;--texfile&quot; to specify the correct filename.

       --directory=archive directory       (default: somefile)
           When bundledoc creates an archive (e.g., a .tar or .zip file)
           containing the document&apos;s files, it puts all of them in a directory
           to avoid cluttering the current directory with files.  If the given
           dependency file is called somefile.dep then the resulting archive
           will, by default, store all the dependent files in a somefile
           directory.  To change the directory name use the &quot;--directory&quot;
           option.

       --[no]localonly                  (default: &quot;nolocalonly&quot;)
           Although bundledoc normally archives all of the files named in the
           .dep file, the &quot;--localonly&quot; option tells bundledoc to exclude all
           files located in a directory other than the .tex file&apos;s directory or
           one of its subdirectories.

       --exclude=string                    (default: none)
           While &quot;--localonly&quot; causes files outside of the .tex file&apos;s directory
           tree to be omitted from the archive, &quot;--exclude&quot; provides finer-
           grained control over files to omit from the archive.  The &quot;--exclude&quot;
           option, which can be specified repeatedly on the command line, causes
           all files whose name contains string to be omitted from the archive.

       --include=filespec                  (default: none)
           The &quot;--include&quot; option, which can be specified repeatedly on the
           command line, instructs bundledoc to include in the archive all of
           the files matching filespec, even if they&apos;re not referenced in the
           .dep file.

       --manifest=manifest file            (default: MANIFEST)
           In addition to the dependent files, bundledoc includes in the archive
           file one extra file called, by default, ``MANIFEST&apos;&apos;.  MANIFEST is a
           text file that lists the original filenames of all the dependencies.
           To change the filename from ``MANIFEST&apos;&apos; to something else, use the
           &quot;--manifest&quot; option.  As a special case, &quot;--manifest=&quot;&quot;&quot; tells
           bundledoc not to include a manifest file at all.

       --listdeps=[yes|no|only|rel]...]       (default: &quot;no&quot;)
           &quot;--listdeps&quot; accepts one or more of &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;only&quot;, or &quot;rel&quot; as
           a comma-separated list.  As long as &quot;no&quot; does not appear in this
           list, bundledoc outputs all of the main LaTeX file&apos;s dependencies.
           If the list contains &quot;rel&quot;, then bundledoc outputs the list of
           dependencies with relative pathnames.  If the list contains &quot;only&quot;,
           then bundledoc exits after displaying the list, without producing an
           archive.

       --[no]keepdirs                   (default: &quot;nokeepdirs&quot;)
           Normally, the archive file that bundledoc produces contains a single
           directory -- and subdirectories, if the document refers explicitly to
           them -- in which all the dependent files lie.  If &quot;--keepdirs&quot; is
           specified, all the dependent files are stored with their original
           pathnames.  For example, if somefile.tex depends on
           figures/somefigure.eps, article.cls, and snapshot.sty, then the
           somefile archive will normally contain the following files:

           &#183;   somefile/somefile.tex

           &#183;   somefile/figures/somefigure.eps

           &#183;   somefile/article.cls

           &#183;   somefile/snapshot.sty

           &#183;   somefile/MANIFEST

           However, &quot;--keepdirs&quot; will cause the somefile archive to contain the
           following sorts of filenames instead:

           &#183;   home/me/mydocs/somefile.tex
&#12;           &#183;   home/me/mydocs/figures/somefigure.eps

           &#183;   usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/article.cls

           &#183;   usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/snapshot/snapshot.sty

           &quot;--directory&quot; is not used when &quot;--keepdirs&quot; is in effect.  In
           addition, no manifest file is written to the archive file as it
           contains redundant information.

       --config=configuration file         (default: &lt;none&gt;)
           The &quot;--config&quot; option is used to point bundledoc to the appropriate
           configuration (.cfg) file for your TeX distribution and operating
           system.  bundledoc comes with a few configuration files and it&apos;s easy
           to write more.  See &quot;CONFIGURATION FILES&quot; (below) for a description
           of the configuration file format.

CONFIGURATION FILES
   Format
       Configuration files follow a fairly simple format.  Lines beginning with
       &quot;#&quot; are comments.  Blank lines are ignored.  All other lines are of the
       form:

           variable: value

       The current version of bundledoc recognizes the following variables:

       bundle
           The command to use to bundle a set of files into a single archive
           file

       sink
           The affix to a command to discard its output

       find
           The command to find a file within the TeX tree(s).

       Values that are too long for one line can be split across multiple lines
       by using &quot;\&quot; as the line-continuation symbol.

       There are two environment variables that bundledoc makes available for
       use by configuration-file commands: &quot;BDBASE&quot;, which is set to somefile
       (as in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;), and &quot;BDINPUTS&quot;, which is set to a space-separated list
       of files that a command is to operate upon.  That is, when the command
       associated with &quot;bundle&quot; is running, &quot;BDINPUTS&quot; contains the list of all
       the files that are to be archived.  In contrast, when the command
       associated with &quot;find&quot; is running, &quot;BDINPUTS&quot; contains the name of the
       file to search for.

   Examples
       The following configuration file parallels bundledoc&apos;s default values of
       the various configuration-file variables, which represents a kpathsea-
       based TeX distribution running on a generic Unix system, which doesn&apos;t
       necessarily have any of the GNU tools, such as gzip or GNU tar:

           # &quot;Default&quot; configuration file
           # By Scott Pakin &lt;scott+bdoc@pakin.org&gt;

           bundle: (tar -cvf - $BDINPUTS | compress &gt; $BDBASE.tar.Z)
           sink:   &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
           find:   kpsewhich -progname=latex $BDINPUTS

       The parentheses in the &quot;bundle:&quot; line tell the Unix shell to run the
       command in a subshell.  This is to make the &quot;sink:&quot; affix work properly
       (i.e., so there aren&apos;t two &quot;&gt;&quot;&apos;s in the same command).
&#12;       Notice how the commands treat &quot;BDBASE&quot; and &quot;BDINPUTS&quot; like any other
       environment variables in a Unix shell, using &quot;$&quot; to take their value.
       Other operating systems use different conventions for referring to
       environment variables.  For instance, a configuration file for a Windows-
       based TeX distribution would use &quot;%BDBASE%&quot; and &quot;%BDINPUTS%&quot; instead.

       The value for &quot;sink:&quot; is specific to an operating system.  The value for
       &quot;find:&quot; is specific to a TeX distribution.  &quot;bundle:&quot; is where the most
       opportunity for customization lies.  You can use &quot;bundle:&quot; to specify
       your favorite archive format.  For example, you can produce a shar file
       on Unix with something like:

           bundle: (shar --archive-name=&quot;$BDBASE&quot; $BDINPUTS &gt; $BDBASE.sh)

       or a CAB file on Microsoft Windows with something like:

           bundle: cabarc -r -p N %BDBASE%.cab %BDINPUTS%

EXAMPLES
       Assume that myfile.dep was produced from myfile.tex by following the
       instructions in the Description section.  The following command produces
       a .zip file with the MikTeX TeX distribution running on Microsoft
       Windows:

           bundledoc --config=miktex.cfg myfile.dep

       (In practice, it&apos;s probably necessary to specify to &quot;--config&quot; the
       complete path to bundledoc&apos;s miktex.cfg configuration file.)

       The following builds a .tar.gz archive with the TeX Live distribution
       running on a Unix-like operating system.  bundledoc will produce verbose
       output describing its operations.  All files not in the same directory
       tree as myfile.tex and all files containing &quot;.fd&quot; or &quot;.sty&quot; in their
       names are omitted.  However, all .bib files in the current directory will
       be included in the archive even though none of them are referenced by
       myfile.dep.  Finally, no MANIFEST file will be produced.

           bundledoc --config=texlive-unix.cfg --verbose --localonly \
             --exclude=.fd --exclude=.cfg --include=&quot;*.bib&quot; --manifest=&quot;&quot; \
             myfile.dep

FILES
       The user must have previously installed snapshot.sty and used it to
       produce a dependency file for his document.  Besides that, the set of
       external files needed by bundledoc is system-specific and depends on the
       configuration file used.  (See &quot;CONFIGURATION FILES&quot;, above.)

       bundledoc currently comes with two configuration files:

       texlive-unix.cfg
           Configuration file for TeX Live installations on Unix or Linux.  TeX
           Live is a kpathsea-based TeX distribution that runs on various
           flavors of Unix and Microsoft Windows.  texlive-unix.cfg assumes you
           have gzip and uses it to produce a .tar.gz archive file.  The
           configuration file has bundledoc use kpsewhich to find LaTeX files.

       miktex.cfg
           Configuration file for MikTeX installations.  MikTeX is a popular TeX
           distribution for Microsoft Windows.  miktex.cfg assumes you have zip
           and uses it to produce a .zip archive file.  The configuration file
           has bundledoc use the rather nonstandard initexmf to find LaTeX
           files.

NOTES
   Including and excluding files
       The &quot;--localonly&quot;, &quot;--exclude&quot;, and &quot;--include&quot; options provide control
       over the archive&apos;s contents.  &quot;--exclude&quot; and &quot;--include&quot; can be
       specified repeatedly on the command line.  The order in which these
       options are specified is immaterial; bundledoc processes file inclusions
       and exclusions in the following order:

       1.  All files referenced by the .dep file are added to the list of files
           to archive.

       2.  If &quot;--localonly&quot; is specified, all files not found in the .tex file&apos;s
           directory are removed from the list.

       3.  For each &quot;--exclude&quot; string specified, all files containing that
           string are removed from the list.

       4.  For each &quot;--include&quot; file specification, the set of files designated
           by its expansion are added to the list.

   Issues When Running Under Microsoft Windows
       First, because bundledoc is a Perl script, you should do one of the
       following to run it under Windows:

       &#183;   &quot;perl bundledoc&quot;

       &#183;   Rename bundledoc to bundledoc.pl and run &quot;bundledoc.pl&quot;.  (This is
           assuming you have a file association set up for .pl.)

       &#183;   Run the pl2bat script (if you have it) to convert bundledoc to
           bundledoc.bat, then run &quot;bundledoc&quot;.

       Second, Windows uses a multi-rooted filesystem (i.e., multiple drive
       letters).  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if bad things were to happen if the
       files to be bundled are scattered across drives.  In addition, Windows
       supports ``UNC&apos;&apos; filenames, which have no drive letter at all, just a
       machine and share name.  UNC filenames are also untested waters for
       bundledoc.  Be careful!

   Testing Status
       I have tested bundledoc only with Perl v5.6.0 and later and only on the
       following platforms:

       &#183;   Linux + TeX Live

       &#183;   Linux + teTeX

       &#183;   Windows NT + MiKTeX

       &#183;   Solaris + ??? (something kpathsea-based)

       It is my hope that bundledoc works on many more platforms than those.  I
       tried to make the program itself fairly independent of the operating
       system; only the configuration files should have to change to run
       bundledoc on a different system.

   Future Work
       I&apos;d like bundledoc to work on as wide a variety of TeX distributions as
       possible.  If your platform is significantly different from the ones
       listed in &quot;Testing Status&quot; (e.g., if you&apos;re running MacOS) and you need
       to create a substantially different configuration file from
       texlive-unix.cfg and miktex.cfg, please send it to me at the address
       listed in &quot;AUTHOR&quot; so I can include it in a future version of bundledoc.
       (I make no promises, though).

       Once bundledoc works on all the major operating systems and TeX
       distributions it would be really convenient if I could get bundledoc to
       detect the platform it&apos;s running on and automatically select an
       appropriate configuration file.

       Finally, it would be handy for bundledoc to include fonts in the archive
       file.  At a minimum, it should include .tfm files, but it would be even
       better if it included .mf, .pfb, .ttf, and other common font formats, as
       well.

       Thanks to Fabien Vignes-Tourneret for suggesting what became the
       &quot;--localonly&quot; option and for a discussion that led to the &quot;--exclude&quot; and
       &quot;--include&quot; options; and to Marius Kleiner for updating bundledoc to
       properly handle document subdirectories.
