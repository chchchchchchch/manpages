DESCRIPTION
       The  busy  command provides a simple means to block keyboard, button, and
       pointer events from Tk widgets, while overriding the widget&apos;s cursor with
       a configurable busy cursor.

INTRODUCTION
       There  are  many  times  in  applications  where  you want to temporarily
       restrict what actions the user can take.   For  example,  an  application
       could  have  a  &quot;run&quot;  button that when pressed causes some processing to
       occur.  But while the application is busy processing, you probably  don&apos;t
       want  the  the  user to be able to click the &quot;run&quot; button again.  You may
       also want restrict the user from other tasks such as clicking  a  &quot;print&quot;
       button.

       The  busy  command  lets  you  make Tk widgets busy. This means that user
       interactions such as button clicks, moving the mouse, typing at the  key&#8208;
       board,  etc.  are  ignored  by  the widget.  You can set a special cursor
       (like a watch) that overrides the widget&apos;s normal cursor, providing feed&#8208;
       back that the application (widget) is temporarily busy.

       When  a  widget  is made busy, the widget and all of its descendents will
       ignore events.  It&apos;s easy to make an entire panel of  widgets  busy.  You
       can  simply  make the toplevel widget (such as &quot;.&quot;) busy.  This is easier
       and far much more efficient than recursively traversing the widget  hier&#8208;
       archy, disabling each widget and re-configuring its cursor.

       Often, the busy command can be used instead of Tk&apos;s grab command.  Unlike
       grab which restricts all user interactions to one widget, with  the  busy
       command you can have more than one widget active (for example, a &quot;cancel&quot;
       dialog and a &quot;help&quot; button).

EXAMPLE
       You can make several widgets busy by simply making  its  ancestor  widget
       busy using the hold operation.

              frame .top
              button .top.button; canvas .top.canvas
              pack .top.button .top.canvas
              pack .top
                . . .
              busy hold .top
              update

       All  the widgets within .top (including .top) are now busy.  Using update
       insures that busy command will take effect before any other  user  events
       can occur.

       When  the  application  is  no longer busy processing, you can allow user
       interactions again by the release operation.

         busy release .top

       The busy window has a configurable cursor.  You can change the busy  cur&#8208;
       sor using the configure operation.

         busy configure .top -cursor &quot;watch&quot;

       Finally,  when  you  no longer need to the busy window, invoke the forget
       operation to free any resources it allocated.

         busy forget .top

       Destroying the widget will also clean up any resources allocated  by  the
       busy command.

OPERATIONS
       The following operations are available for the busy command:

       busy hold window ?option value?...
              Makes  the  widget  window  (and  its descendants in the Tk window
              hierarchy) busy.  Window must be a valid path name of a Tk widget.
              The  busy window is mapped the next time idle tasks are processed,
              and the widget and its  descendants  will  be  blocked  from  user
              interactions.  All events in the widget window and its descendants
              are ignored.  Normally update should be called immediately  after&#8208;
              ward  to  insure  that  the hold operation is in effect before the
              application starts its  processing.  The  following  configuration
              options are valid:

              -cursor cursorName
                     Specifies  the  cursor  to  be displayed when the widget is
                     made busy.  CursorName can  be  in  any  form  accepted  by
                     Tk_GetCursor.  The default cursor is watch.

       busy configure window ?option value?...
              Queries  or  modifies  the  busy command configuration options for
              window. Window must be the path name of a widget  previously  made
              busy  by  the hold operation.  If no options are specified, a list
              describing all of the available options for window (see Tk_Config&#8208;
              ureInfo  for  information on the format of this list) is returned.
              If option is specified with no value, then the command  returns  a
              list  describing the one named option (this list will be identical
              to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is
              specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given
              value(s);  in  this  case  the  command  returns the empty string.
              Option may have any of the values accepted by the hold operation.

              Please note that the option database is referenced through window.
              For  example,  if  the  widget .frame is to be made busy, the busy
              cursor can be specified for it by either option command:

                option add *frame.busyCursor gumby
                option add *Frame.BusyCursor gumby


       busy forget window ?window?...
              Releases resources allocated  by  the  busy  command  for  window,
              including  the  busy  window.   User events will again be received
              again by window.  Resources  are  also  released  when  window  is
              destroyed.  Window  must  be the name of a widget specified in the
              hold operation, otherwise an error is reported.

       busy isbusy ?pattern?
              Returns the pathnames of all widgets that are currently busy.   If
              a  pattern  is given, the path names of busy widgets matching pat&#8208;
              tern are returned.

       busy names ?pattern?
              Returns the pathnames of all widgets  that  have  previously  been
              made busy (i.e. a busy window is allocated and associated with the
              widget).  It makes no difference if the window is  currently  busy
              or  not.   If  a  pattern is given, the path names of busy widgets
              matching pattern are returned.

       busy release window ?window?...
              Restores user interactions to the widget window again.  This  dif&#8208;
              fers  from  the  forget  operation  in that the busy window is not
              destroyed, but simply unmapped.  Window must be the name of a wid&#8208;
              get specified in a hold operation, otherwise an error is reported.

       busy status window
              Returns  the  status  of a widget window previously made busy.  An
              error is reported if window was never made  busy,  or  the  forget
              operation  was invoked (i.e. does not currently have a busy window
              associated with it).  If window is presently can not receive  user
              interactions, 1 is returned, otherwise 0.


BINDINGS
       The  event  blocking  feature  is  implemented  by creating and mapping a
       transparent window that completely covers the widget.  When the busy win&#8208;
       dow is mapped, it invisibly shields the widget and its hierarchy from all
       events that may be sent.  Like Tk widgets, busy windows have widget names
       in  the  Tk  window hierarchy.  This means that you can use the bind com&#8208;
       mand, to handle events in the busy window.

              busy hold .frame.canvas
              bind .frame.canvas_Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }


       Normally the busy window is a sibling of the widget.   The  name  of  the
       busy window is &quot;widget_Busy&quot; where widget is the name of the widget to be
       made busy.  In the previous example, the pathname of the busy  window  is
       &quot;.frame.canvas_Busy&quot;  The exception is when the widget is a toplevel wid&#8208;
       get (such as &quot;.&quot;)  where the busy window can&apos;t be made  a  sibling.   The
       busy window is then a child of the widget named &quot;widget._Busy&quot; where wid&#8208;
       get is the name of the toplevel widget.  In the  following  example,  the
       pathname of the busy window is &quot;._Busy&quot;

              busy hold .
              bind ._Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }


ENTER/LEAVE EVENTS
       Mapping  and  unmapping busy windows generates Enter/Leave events for all
       widgets they cover.  Please note this if  you  are  tracking  Enter/Leave
       events in widgets.

KEYBOARD EVENTS
       When a widget is made busy, the widget is prevented from gaining the key&#8208;
       board focus by the busy window. But if the widget already had  focus,  it
       still may received keyboard events.  To prevent this, you must move focus
       to another window.

              busy hold .frame
              label .dummy
              focus .dummy
              update

       The above example moves the focus from .frame immediately after  invoking
       the  hold so that no keyboard events will be sent to .frame or any of its
       descendants.
