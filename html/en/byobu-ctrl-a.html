NAME
       byobu-ctrl-a - Configure Byobu&apos;s ctrl-a behavior


DESCRIPTION
       byobu-ctrl-a  is  an  interactive program that allows a user to configure
       the behavior of the &apos;ctrl-a&apos; key sequence.

       Traditional GNU screen(1) uses ctrl-a as its escape character, while  GNU
       emacs(1)  uses  ctrl-a  to  move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
       This conflict has caused unending amounts of grief among  Screen,  Byobu,
       and Emacs-mode users.

       Thus,  this  program  exists to allow each user to choose the behavior of
       ctrl-a in their local environment.
