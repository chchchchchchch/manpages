NAME
       byobu-layout - Save and restore byobu-tmux laouts


USAGE
       byobu-layout [save|restore] [name]


DESCRIPTION
       byobu-layout will save and restore byobu-tmux(1) split window layouts.

       If &apos;name&apos; is blank, it operates interactively.

       Note  that  this  only  works  with Byobu when backed by tmux(1), and not
       screen(1).
