NAME
       byobu-reconnect-sockets  -  Sourcable  script that updates GPG_AGENT_INFO
       and DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in the environment


DESCRIPTION
       byobu-reconnect-sockets is a sourcable bit of shell code that will update
       the  GPG_AGENT_INFO and DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variables in
       the  current  shell,  such  that  you  may   restablish   connection   to
       gpg-agent(1) and dbus-daemon(1).

       This is often useful when reattaching to a detached Byobu session.
