NAME
       byobu-select-session - select and connect to a byobu session


DESCRIPTION
       byobu-select-session  is  an  application that lists the available screen
       sessions running on the system, and prompts the user to select one.   The
       user  also  has  the  option to create a new Byobu session, or launch the
       default shell without Byobu.

       If an invalid selection is chosen 3 times in a row, the user is connected
       to the youngest session.

       By  default,  if  only  one session exists, the user is connected to that
       session, and if no sessions exist, a new session is created -- such  that
       there  is  no  interactive  prompt in the normal behavior.  However, some
       users may choose to always be prompted, by touching the file  $BYOBU_CON&#8208;
       FIG_DIR/.always-select.

       Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.byobu.

       Named  sessions that begin with a &quot;.&quot; are &quot;hidden&quot; from byobu-select-ses&#8208;
       sion(1).  This is useful, for instance, if you do not want a  session  to
       be automatically selected at login.  Example:
         byobu -S .hidden


FILES
       $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/.always-select
