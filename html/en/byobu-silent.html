NAME
       byobu-silent-  Silence  all  of  Byobu&apos;s status indicators, eliminate the
       hardstatus line, and the window list


USAGE
       byobu-silent [--undo]


DESCRIPTION
       byobu-silent will disable ALL of Byobu&apos;s status indicators, eliminate the
       hardstatus line, and the window list.

       Some  administrators,  in  some  environments, at some times may prefer a
       very minimal, quiet Byobu, without  the  potentially  distracting  status
       indicators and eye candy.

       byobu-silent implies byobu-quiet.
