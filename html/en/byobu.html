byobu(1)                              byobu                             byobu(1)



NAME
       byobu  -  wrapper  script  for  seeding  a user&apos;s byobu configuration and
       launching a text based window manager (either screen or tmux)


SYNOPSIS
       byobu [screen options]

       byobu-screen [screen options]

       byobu-tmux [tmux options]

       Options to byobu are simply passed through screen(1) or tmux(1).


DESCRIPTION
       byobu is a script that launches  a  text  based  window  manager  (either
       screen(1)  or tmux(1)) in the byobu configuration.  This enables the dis&#8208;
       play of system information and status notifications within two  lines  at
       the  bottom of the screen session. It also enables multiple tabbed termi&#8208;
       nal sessions, accessible through simple keystrokes.

       byobu currently defaults to using tmux(1) (if present)  as  the  backend,
       however, this can be overriden with the byobu-select-backend(1) utility.

       Note   that   BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/byobu   if  defined,  and
       $HOME/.byobu otherwise.


STATUS NOTIFICATIONS
       byobu supports a number of unique and  interesting  status  notifications
       across the lowest two lines in the screen.  Each status notification item
       is independently configurable, enabled and disabled by the  configuration
       utility.   The guide below helps identify each status item (in alphabeti&#8208;
       cal order):

       apport - symbol displayed if there are pending crash reports; {!}  symbol
       displayed  on  the lower bar toward the left, in black on an orange back&#8208;
       ground

       arch - system architecture; displayed on the lower bar toward  the  left,
       in the default text color on the default background color

       battery - battery information; display on the lower bar toward the right;
       - indicates discharging, + indicates charging, = indicates fully charged;
       when  charging or discharging, the current battery capacity as a percent&#8208;
       age is displayed;  the colours green, yellow, and red are  used  to  give
       further  indication  of  the battery&apos;s charge state; you may override the
       detected   battery   by   setting   BATTERY=/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0    in
       $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc

       cpu_count  - the number of cpu&apos;s or cores on the system; displayed in the
       lower bar toward the right in the default text color on the default back&#8208;
       ground, followed by a trailing &apos;x&apos;

       cpu_freq  -  the  current  frequency  of the cpu in GHz; displayed in the
       lower bar toward the right in white text on a light blue background

       cpu_temp - the cpu temperature in Celsius (default) or  Fahrenheit,  con&#8208;
       figure  TEMP=F  or TEMP=C in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc; displayed in the
       lower bar toward the right in yellow text on a black background; you  may
       override   the   detected   cpu   temperature  device  by  setting  MONI&#8208;
       TORED_TEMP=/proc/acpi/whatever in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc

       custom - user defined custom scripts; must be executable programs of  any
       kind  in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/bin; must be named N_NAME, where N is the fre&#8208;
       quency in seconds to refresh the status indicator, and NAME is  the  name
       of  the  script;  N  should not be less than 5 seconds; the script should
       echo a small amount of text to standard out, standard error is discarded;
       the indicator will be displayed in the lower panel, in inverted colors to
       your current background/foreground scheme, unless  you  manually  specify
       the  colors in your script&apos;s output; BEWARE, cpu-intensive custom scripts
       may impact your overall system performance and could  upset  your  system
       administrator!
         Example: $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/bin/1000_uname
           #!/bin/sh

       ifying an alternate interface with MONITORED_NETWORK=wlan0 in $BYOBU_CON&#8208;
       FIG_DIR/statusrc


SESSIONS
       Byobu name screen sessions &quot;byobu&quot;, if  unspecified.   To  hide  sessions
       from  byobu-select-session(1), prepend a &quot;.&quot; to the beginning of the ses&#8208;
       sion name, like:

        byobu -S .hidden


WINDOWS
       Each open window in the screen session is  displayed  in  the  upper  bar
       toward  the  far  left.  These are numbered, and include indicators as to
       activity in the window (see &quot;activity&quot; in screen(1)  for  symbol  defini&#8208;
       tions).   The current active window is highlighted by inverting the back&#8208;
       ground/text from the rest of the window bar.

       Users can create a list of windows to launch at  startup  in  $BYOBU_CON&#8208;
       FIG_DIR/windows.   This file is the same syntax as ~/.screenrc, each line
       specifying  a  window  using  the  &quot;screen&quot;  command,  as  described   in
       screen(1).

       User  can  also  launch  Byobu  with unique window sets.  Users can store
       these as $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.[NAME],  and  launch  Byobu  with  the
       environment variable BYOBU_WINDOWS.

       For example:
         $ cat $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.ssh_sessions
         screen -t localhost bash
         screen -t aussie ssh root@aussie
         screen -t beagle ssh root@beagle
         screen -t collie ssh root@collie
         $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=ssh_sessions byobu


UNITS OF MEASURE
       byobu  uses binary for capacity measurements of KB, MB, GB, and TB.  This
       means multiples of 1024 rather than multiples of 1000, in accordance with
       JEDEC Standard 100B.01 for disk and memory capacity measurements.  See:
        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards

       byobu  uses  decimal  for  measurements of network data transfer, meaning
       multiple of 1000, rather than 1024.  See:
        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units


KEYBINDINGS
       byobu keybindings can be user  defined  in  /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/
       (or  within  .screenrc if byobu-export was used). The common key bindings
       are:

       F2 - Create a new window

       F3 - Move to previous window

       F4 - Move to next window

       F5 - Reload profile

       F6 - Detach from this session

       F7 - Enter copy/scrollback mode

       F8 - Re-title a window

       F9 - Configuration Menu

       F12 -  Lock this terminal

       shift-F2 - Split the screen horizontally

       ctrl-F2 - Split the screen vertically

       shift-F3 - Shift the focus to the previous split region

       shift-F4 - Shift the focus to the next split region

       shift-F5 - Join all splits

       ctrl-F6 - Remove this split

       ctrl-F5 - Reconnect GPG and SSH sockets

       shift-F6 - Detach, but do not logout

       alt-pgup - Enter scrollback mode

       alt-pgdn - Enter scrollback mode

       Ctrl-a $ - show detailed status

       Ctrl-a R - Reload profile

       Ctrl-a ! - Toggle key bindings on and off

       Ctrl-a k - Kill the current window

       Ctrl-a ~ - Save the current window&apos;s scrollback buffer


SCROLLBACK, COPY, PASTE MODES
       Each window in Byobu has up to 10,000 lines of scrollback history,  which
       you  can  enter  and navigate using the alt-pgup and alt-pgdn keys.  Exit
       this scrollback mode by hitting enter.  You  can  also  easily  copy  and
       paste  text  from scrollback mode.  To do so, enter scrollback using alt-
       pgup or alt-pgdn, press the spacebar  to  start  highlighting  text,  use
       up/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn  to select the text, and press enter to copy
       the text.  You can then paste the text using alt-insert or ctrl-a-].


BUGS
       For Byobu colors to work properly, older versions of GNU Screen require a
       1-line patch to adjust MAX_WINMSG_REND in screen.c.  The change is in GNU
       Screen&apos;s upstream source control system as of 2010-01-26, but GNU  Screen
       has  not  released a new upstream version in several years.  You can dis&#8208;
       able colors entirely by setting  MONOCHROME=1  in  $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/sta&#8208;
       tusrc.  For more information, see:
        * http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22146

       PuTTY  users  have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not
       working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape  sequences  as  the  linux
       console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY con&#8208;
       fig,  Terminal  -&gt;  Keyboard  -&gt;   Function   keys:   Xterm   R6.    See:
       http://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html

       Apple  Mac OSX terminal users have reported &apos;flashing text&apos;.  You can fix
       this in the advanced settings of the terminal application, with  &apos;Declare
       Terminal As: xterm-color&apos;.

       Apple  Mac  keyboard users may need to specify a vt100 terminal by adding
       this to your OSX profile, in order to get Byobu&apos;s function keys and  col&#8208;
       ors to work:
         alias ssh=&apos;TERM=vt100 ssh&apos;

       Users  of  a non-UTF8 locale (such as cs_CZ charset ISO-8859-2), may need
       to add &quot;defutf8 off&quot; to ~/.screenrc, if some characters are rendering  as
       &quot;?&quot;.

       Users  who  customize  their  PS1  prompt  need  to  put  this setting in
       ~/.bashrc, rather than ~/.profile, in order for it to work correctly with
       Byobu.

       If  you run byobu(1) under sudo(8), you must use the -H option, such that
       the user&apos;s $HOME directory environment variable is set properly.   Other&#8208;
       wise,  byobu(1)  will  create  a bunch of directories in the $SUDO_USER&apos;s
       $HOME, but will be owned  by  root.   To  prevent  this  from  happening,
       byobu(1) will simply refuse to run if $USER does not own $HOME.

       Byobu  requires  a suitable ulimit(3) values to run.  If you get an error
       at startup saying, &apos;pipe: too many open files&apos;, then check your ulimit -a
       values,  as  your  &quot;open  files&quot; or &quot;max user processes&quot; are too low.  In
       this case, you will probably need to run simple screen(1)
