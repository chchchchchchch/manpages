C89(1)                                                                    C89(1)



NAME
       c89 - ANSI (1989) C compiler

SYNOPSIS
       c89 [-pedantic] [-pedantic-errors] [-D_ANSI_SOURCE] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       Calls  the  C  compiler  (cc) with the given options , using a C language
       environment compatible with the -ansiC specification.

       This includes proper handling of trigraphs, disabling  non-ANSI  compiler
       features  (such as asm , inline , typeof , and the $ character in identi&#8208;
       fiers), and definition of the preprocessor symbol __STRICT_ANSI__ .

SEE ALSO
       cc(1) for a description of all options.

HISTORY
       Appeared in NetBSD 1.4 .

BUGS
       Since c89 is a shell wrapper script to cc , compile errors  are  prefixed
       by &quot;cc:&quot;.



                                                                          C89(1)
