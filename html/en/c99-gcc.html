C99(1)                                                                    C99(1)



NAME
       c99 - ANSI (1999) C compiler

SYNOPSIS
       c99 [-pedantic] [-pedantic-errors] [-D_ANSI_SOURCE] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       Calls  the  C  compiler  (cc) with the given options , using a C language
       environment compatible with the -ansiC specification.

       This includes proper handling of trigraphs, disabling  non-ANSI  compiler
       features (such as asm , typeof , and the $ character in identifiers), and
       definition of the preprocessor symbol __STRICT_ANSI__ .

       The  status  of  C99  features  implemented  in  GCC  is   described   at
       http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/c99status.html

SEE ALSO
       cc(1) for a description of all options.

HISTORY
       Appeared in NetBSD 1.4 .

BUGS
       Since  c99  is a shell wrapper script to cc , compile errors are prefixed
       by &quot;cc:&quot;.



                                                                          C99(1)
