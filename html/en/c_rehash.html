C_REHASH(1SSL)                       OpenSSL                      C_REHASH(1SSL)



NAME
       c_rehash - Create symbolic links to files named by the hash values

SYNOPSIS
       c_rehash [directory] ...

DESCRIPTION
       c_rehash scans directories and takes a hash value of each .pem and .crt
       file in the directory. It then creates symbolic links for each of the
       files named by the hash value. This is useful as many programs require
       directories to be set up like this in order to find the certificates they
       require.

       If any directories are named on the command line then these directories
       are processed in turn. If not then and the environment variable
       SSL_CERT_DIR is defined then that is consulted. This variable should be a
       colon (:) separated list of directories, all of which will be processed.
       If neither of these conditions are true then /usr/lib/ssl/certs is
       processed.

       For each directory that is to be processed he user must have write
       permissions on the directory, if they do not then nothing will be printed
       for that directory.

       Note that this program deletes all the symbolic links that look like ones
       that it creates before processing a directory. Beware that if you run the
       program on a directory that contains symbolic links for other purposes
       that are named in the same format as those created by this program they
       will be lost.

       The hashes for certificate files are of the form &lt;hash&gt;.&lt;n&gt; where n is an
       integer. If the hash value already exists then n will be incremented,
       unless the file is a duplicate. Duplicates are detected using the
       fingerprint of the certificate. A warning will be printed if a duplicate
       is detected. The hashes for CRL files are of the form &lt;hash&gt;.r&lt;n&gt; and
       have the same behavior.

       The program will also warn if there are files with extension .pem which
       are not certificate or CRL files.

       The program uses the openssl program to compute the hashes and
       fingerprints. It expects the executable to be named openssl and be on the
       PATH, or in the /usr/lib/ssl/bin directory. If the OPENSSL environment
       variable is defined then this is used instead as the executable that
       provides the hashes and fingerprints. When called as $OPENSSL x509 -hash
       -fingerprint -noout -in $file it must output the hash of $file on the
       first line followed by the fingerprint on the second line, optionally
       prefixed with some text and an equals sign (=).

OPTIONS
       None

ENVIRONMENT
       OPENSSL
           The name (and path) of an executable to use to generate hashes and
           fingerprints (see above).

       SSL_CERT_DIR
           Colon separated list of directories to operate on. Ignored if
           directories are listed on the command line.
