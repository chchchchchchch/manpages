caca-config(1)                                                    caca-config(1)



NAME
       caca-config  -  script  to get information about the installed version of
       libcaca

SYNOPSIS
       caca-config [ --prefix= DIR] [ --exec-prefix= DIR] [ --version ] [ --libs
       ] [ --cflags ]

DESCRIPTION
       caca-config  is  a  tool that is used to configure and determine the com&#8208;
       piler and linker flags that should be used to compile and  link  progams,
       libraries, and plugins that use libcaca.

       The  use  of  caca-config is deprecated. The more generic tool pkg-config
       should be used instead.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile  a  program
              or library that uses libcaca.

       --exec-prefix=DIR
              If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that
              libcaca was build with when computing the output for the  --cflags
              and  --libs  options.  This option must be specified before any of
              the --cflags and --libs options.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to  link  a  program  or
              library that uses libcaca.

       --prefix=DIR
              If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
              libcaca was built with when computing the output for the  --cflags
              and  --libs options.  This option is also used for the exec prefix
              if --exec-prefix was not specified.  This option must be specified
              before any of the --cflags and --libs options.

       --version
              Prints the currently installed version of libcaca on standard out&#8208;
              put.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(caca-config --cflags) -c main.c
              is how you might use caca-config to compile a C source file for an
              executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(caca-config --libs) main.o util.o
              is  how you might use caca-config to link compiled objects into an
              executable program.
