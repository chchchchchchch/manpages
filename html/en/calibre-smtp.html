SYNOPSIS
       calibre-smtp  [options] [from to text]

DESCRIPTION
       Send  mail  using the SMTP protocol. calibre-smtp has two modes of opera&#8208;
       tion. In the compose mode you specify from to and text and these are used
       to  build  and  send  an  email message. In the filter mode, calibre-smtp
       reads a complete email message from STDIN and sends it.

       text is the body of the email message.  If text is not specified, a  com&#8208;
       plete email message is read from STDIN.  from is the email address of the
       sender and to is the email address of  the  recipient.  When  a  complete
       email  is read from STDIN, from and to are only used in the SMTP negotia&#8208;
       tion, the message headers are not modified.
