CATMAN(8)                      Manual pager utils                      CATMAN(8)



NAME
       catman - create or update the pre-formatted manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       catman [-dhV] [-M path] [-C file] [section] ...

DESCRIPTION
       catman  is used to create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual pages
       known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much faster to display  than
       the original manual pages, but require extra storage space.  The decision
       to support cat pages is that of the local administrator, who must provide
       suitable directories to contain them.

       The  options available to catman are the manual page hierarchies and sec&#8208;
       tions to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are those specified as sys&#8208;
       tem  hierarchies  in  the man-db configuration file, and the default sec&#8208;
       tions are either the colon-delimited contents of the environment variable
       $MANSECT  or the standard set compiled into man if $MANSECT is undefined.
       Supplying catman with a set of whitespace-delimited  section  names  will
       override both of the above.

       catman makes use of the index database cache associated with each hierar&#8208;
       chy to determine which files need to be formatted.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate colon-delimited manual page hierarchy  search
              path.   By  default, this is all paths indicated as system hierar&#8208;
              chies in the man-db configuration file.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user  configuration  file  rather  than  the  default  of
              ~/.manpath.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sec&#8208;
              tions and it is used to determine which manual sections to  search
              and in what order.

       MANPATH
              If  $MANPATH  is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-delim&#8208;
              ited manual page hierarchy search path to use.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              A traditional global index database cache.

       /var/catman/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An alternate or FSSTND compliant global index database cache.
