CCOMPS(1)                                                              CCOMPS(1)



NAME
       ccomps - connected components filter for graphs

SYNOPSIS
       ccomps [ -sxvnzC?  ] [ -X[#]v ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       ccomps  decomposes  graphs  into their connected components, printing the
       components to standard output.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -s     No output graph is printed. The return value can be used to  check
              if the graph is connected or not.

       -x     Only the connected components are printed, as separate graphs.

       -v     Counts of nodes, edges and connected components are printed.

       -z     Sort  components  by  size,  with  the largest first. This is only
              effective if either -x or -X#v is present.  Thus, -zX#0 will cause
              the largest component to be printed.

       -C     Use  clusters  in  computing components in addition to normal edge
              connectivity. In essence, this gives the connected  components  of
              the  derived  graph in which nodes top-level clusters and nodes in
              the original graph. This maintains all subgraph structure within a
              component, even if a subgraph does not contain any nodes.

       -n     Do  not  project  subgraph structure. Normally, if ccomps produces
              components as graphs distinct from the input graph, it will define
              subgraphs  which  are  projections of subgraphs of the input graph
              onto the component. (If the projection is empty,  no  subgraph  is
              produced.)   If  this flag is set, the component contains only the
              relevant nodes and edges.

       -X node_name
              Prints only the component containing the node node_name, if any.

       -X# index
              Prints only component number index, if any, starting at 0.

       -o outfile
              If specified, each graph will be written to a different file  with
              the  names  derived from outfile. In particular, if both -o and -x
              flags are used, then each connected component is written to a dif&#8208;
              ferent  file.  If  outfile  does not have a suffix, the first file
              will have the name outfile; then next outfile_1,  then  next  out&#8208;
              file_2,  and  so  on.  If outfile has a suffix, i.e., has the form
              base.sfx, then the  files  will  be  named  base.sfx,  base_1.sfx,
              base_2.sfx, etc.

       By  default,  each  input graph is printed, with each connected component
       given as a subgraph whose name is a concatenation  of  the  name  of  the
       input graph, the string &quot;_component_&quot; and the number of the component.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names  of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If no
               files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

RETURN CODES
       Unless used to extract a single connected component, ccomps returns 0  if
       all  the input graphs are connected; and non-zero if any graph has multi&#8208;
       ple components, or any error occurred.  If just extracting a single  com&#8208;
       ponent, ccomps returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurred.

BUGS
       It is possible, though unlikely, that the names used for connected compo&#8208;
       nents and their subgraphs may conflict with existing subgraph names.
