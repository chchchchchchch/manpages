DESCRIPTION
       cdrdao  creates audio and data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by
       a description file called toc-file.  In DAO mode it is possible to create
       non  standard  track  pre-gaps that have other lengths than 2 seconds and
       contain nonzero audio data. This is for example  useful  to  divide  live
       recordings into tracks where 2 second gaps would be kind of irritating.

       Instead  of a toc-file a cue file (used by a famous DOS/Windows mastering
       tool) may be used. See the CUE FILES section for more details.


COMMANDS
       The first argument must be one of the following commands:

       show-toc
              Print out a summary about what will be written to the CD-R.

       read-toc
              Analyze each track of the inserted CD and create a  toc-file  that
              can  be  used  to  make a more or less exact copy of the CD.  This
              command does not read out the audio or data  tracks,  use  read-cd
              for this purpose.

              You  can  specify  a filename for the data file via the --datafile
              option.

       read-cd
              Copies all tracks of the inserted CD to an image file and  creates
              a  corresponding toc-file.  The name of the image file defaults to
              &quot;data.bin&quot; if no --datafile option is given.

       read-cddb
              Tries to retrieve title and artist data from a CDDB server for the
              CD  represented by the given toc-file. The retrieved data is added
              as CD-TEXT data for language 0 to the toc-file.  Existing  CD-TEXT
              data for language 0 will be overwritten.

       show-data
              Print out all samples that would be written to the CD-R. Each line
              contains the sample number (starting at 0) and the decimal  sample
              value  for the left and right channel. Useful to check if the byte
              order of audio files is correct.

       read-test
              Check if all data can be  read  from  the  audio  files  that  are
              defined  in  the toc-file.  This will also check the communication
              with the slave process that is responsible for writing  the  audio
              data to the CD-recorder. Mainly used for testing.

       disk-info
              Shows information about the inserted CD-R. If the CD-R has an open
              session it will also print the start of the last and current  ses&#8208;
              sion  which  is used by mkisofs to create an image for a second or
              higher session.

       msinfo Shows information required for creating multi session  disks  with
              mkisofs. The output is meant for processing by scripts.

       unlock Tries  to unlock the recorder device after a failed write or simu&#8208;
              lation run. If you cannot eject the CD after a cdrdao run try this
              command.

       blank  Blanks  a  CD-RW.  The  CD-RW is minimally blanked by default. Use
              option --blank-mode to select another  blanking  mode.   Sometimes
              the  blanking  speed  must  be  manually  reduced for a successful
              blanking operation. Use option --speed to select another  blanking
              speed.

       simulate
              Like write but laser stays cold. It is a shortcut for write --sim&#8208;
              ulate.

       write  Write the CD-R according to the specifications in the toc-file.

       copy   Performs all steps to copy a CD. The device containing the  source
              CD  must be specified with option --source-device and the recorder
              device with option --device.  If only a single device is available
              the  option --source-device must be omitted and cdrdao will prompt
              to insert the CD-R after an image of the source CD was created.

              The image file with name &quot;cddata&lt;pid&gt;.bin&quot; will be created in  the
              current  working  directory  if no --datafile option is given. The
              created image will be removed after it has been written.

              If option --on-the-fly is given no image file is created  and  the
              data  will  be  directly  piped  from the reading device to the CD
              recorder.



OPTIONS
       --device [prot:]bus,id,lun
              Sets the SCSI address of the CD-recorder in form of  a  bus/id/lun
              triple, e.g. &apos;0,2,0&apos; for the logical unit 0 of SCSI device with ID
              2 on bus 0. ATAPI devices can be specified  by  using  the  prefix
              &apos;ATAPI:&apos;, e.g. &apos;ATAPI:0,0,0&apos;. On some systems a device node may be
              specified directly, e.g. &apos;/dev/sg0&apos; on Linux  systems.  Linux  2.6
              users  may also try the newer ATAPI interface with the &apos;ATA:&apos; pre&#8208;
              fix.

       --source-device [prot:]bus,id,lun
              Like above but used for the copy command  to  specify  the  source
              device.

       --driver driver-id:option-flags
              Force  usage  of  specified  driver  instead  of the automatically
              determined driver. Available driver IDs:
              cdd2600,  plextor,  plextor-scan,  generic-mmc,   generic-mmc-raw,
              ricoh-mp6200, yamaha-cdr10x, teac-cdr55, sony-cdu920, sony-cdu948,
              taiyo-yuden, toshiba.
              Specifying an illegal driver ID will  give  a  list  of  available
              drivers.   Option flags may be used to modify the behavior of some
              drivers. See README for details.

       --source-driver driver-id:option-flags
              Like above but used for the device specified with option --source-
              device.

       --speed value
              Set  the  writing speed to value.  Default is the highest possible
              speed.

       --blank-mode mode
              Sets the blanking mode. Available  modes  are  full  and  minimal.
              Please  consider  that  the data of minimally blanked disks may be
              easily recovered. Use the full blanking mode for completely  eras&#8208;
              ing all data. The default blanking mode is minimal.

       --datafile file
              Used  for  read-toc,  read-cd and copy.  Set the default data file
              placed in the toc-file by read-toc.  Use &quot;-&quot;  to  indicate  STDIN.
              For commands read-cd and copy it specifies the name of the created
              image file.

       --read-raw
              Only used for commands read-cd and  read-toc.   All  data  sectors
              will  be  written  as 2352 byte blocks including the sector header
              and L-EC data to the image file. The track mode  will  be  set  to
              MODE1_RAW or MODE2_RAW in the created toc-file.

       --read-subchan mode
              Used  by  commands read-cd, read-toc and copy.  Specifies the type
              of sub-channel data that is extracted from the source CD and writ&#8208;
              ten  to the track image or copied to the destination CD.  Mode may
              be rw for reading packed R-W sub-channel data (de-interleaved  and
              error  corrected)  and rw_raw for reading raw R-W sub-channel data
              (not de-interleaved, not error corrected, L-EC  data  included  in
              the  track image).  If this option is not specified no sub-channel
              data will be extracted.

       --no-mode2-mixed
              Only  used  for  commands  read-cd  and  read-toc.   If  we   have
              MODE2_FORM1  or  MODE2_FORM2,  don&apos;t extract it as MODE2_FORM_MIX.
              toc-file.

       --tao-source
              This option indicates to the commands read-toc  and  read-cd  that
              the source CD was written in TAO mode. It will be assumed that the
              pre-gap length  between  all  tracks  (except  between  two  audio
              tracks)  is the standard 150 blocks plus the number of link blocks
              (usually 2). The number of link  blocks  can  be  controlled  with
              option --tao-source-adjust.

              Use this option only if read-toc or read-cd give error messages in
              the transition areas between two tracks. If you  use  this  option
              with  pressed  CDs  or  CDs written in DAO mode you will get wrong
              results.

       --tao-source-adjust link-blocks
              Specifies the number of link blocks  for  tracks  written  in  TAO
              mode.  This  option  has  only an effect if option --tao-source is
              given.

       --fast-toc
              Only used for command read-toc.  This option suppresses  the  pre-
              gap  length and index mark extraction which speeds up the read-toc
              process. Standard 2 second pre-gaps  (but  no  silence!)  will  be
              placed  into  the  toc-file.  The resulting CD will sound like the
              source CD. Only the CD player&apos;s display will behave slightly  dif&#8208;
              ferent in the transition area between two tracks.

              This  option  might  help,  too, if read-toc fails with your drive
              otherwise.


       --buffers buffer-count
              Specifies the number of buffers that are allocated to avoid buffer
              under  runs.   The minimal buffer count is fixed to 10, default is
              32 except on FreeBSD systems, on which default is 20.  Each buffer
              holds  1 second of audio data so that dividing buffer-count by the
              writing speed gives the maximum time for which  reading  of  audio
              data may be stalled.

       --multi
              If  this  option is given the session will not be closed after the
              audio data is successfully  written.  It  is  possible  to  append
              another session on such disks, e.g. to create a CD-EXTRA.

       --overburn
              By  default  cdrdao  will not allow to write more data on a medium
              than specified by the current medium. This option allows to ignore
              this condition.

       --eject
              Eject the CD-R after writing or write simulation.

       --swap Swap  the  byte  order  of  all  samples  that are send to the CD-
              recorder.

       --session session-nr
              Used for read-toc and read-cd to specify the session which  should
              be processed on multi session CDs.

       --reload
              Indicates  that  the  tray  may  be  opened before writing without
              prompting the user to reset the disk  status  after  a  simulation
              run.

       --force
              Forces  the  execution of an operation that otherwise would not be
              performed.

       --paranoia-mode mode
              Sets the correction mode  for  digital  audio  extraction.  0:  No
              checking, data is copied directly from the drive. 1: Perform over&#8208;
              lapped reading to avoid jitter. 2:  Like  1  but  with  additional
              checks  of  the  read  audio  data.  3: Like 2 but with additional
              scratch detection and repair.

              The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.

              Default is the full paranoia mode (3).

       --keepimage
              If a CD is copied with command copy this option  will  cause  that
              the  created  image is not removed after the copy process has fin&#8208;
              ished.

       --on-the-fly
              Perform CD copy on the fly without creating an image file.

       --with-cddb
              Enables the automatic fetching of CDDB data  for  use  as  CD-TEXT
              data for commands copy, read-toc and read-cd.

       --cddb-servers server-list
              Sets  space or &apos;,&apos; separated list of CDDB servers used for command
              read-cddb or for commands where the --with-cddb option is  active.
              A server entry may have the following forms:

       &lt;server&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, default cddbp port (888), use cddbp protocol.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use cddbp protocol.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;
              Connect  to  &lt;server&gt;,  default http port (80), use http protocol,
              url: &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use http  protocol,  url:  &lt;cgi-
              bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;
              Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, default http port (80), use http proto&#8208;
              col, url: http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;:&lt;proxy-port&gt;
              Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, port &lt;proxy-port&gt;, use  http  protocol,
              url: http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

              The &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; is usually &quot;/~cddb/cddb.cgi&quot;.

              All  servers  of  the server list will be tried in the given order
              until a successful connection can be established. For  http  proxy
              servers  the  first successful connected http proxy server will be
              used independent of the ability to  connect  to  the  target  http
              server.

              Example: freedb.freedb.org:/~cddb/cddb.cgi

       --cddb-timeout timeout
              Sets the timeout in seconds used for connections to CDDB servers.

       --cddb-directory directory
              Specifies  the  local  CDDB  database directory where fetched CDDB
              records will be stored. If this option is not given a fetched CDDB
              record will not be stored locally.

       --tmpdir directory
              Specifies  the  directory  in  which to store temporary data files
              created from decoding MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files. By default, &quot;/tmp&quot;
              is used.

       --keep Upon  exit  from cdrdao, do not delete temporary WAV files created
              from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.

       --save Saves  some  of  the  current  options  to   the   settings   file
              &quot;$HOME/.cdrdao&quot; and exit. See section &#180;SETTINGS&#180; for more details.

       -n     Suppresses the 10 second pause before writing or simulating.

       -v verbose-level
              Sets  verbose  level.  Levels &gt; 2 are debug levels which produce a
              lot of output.


TOC FILES
       The toc-file describes what data is written to the CD-R and  allows  con&#8208;
       trol over track/index positions, pre-gaps and sub-channel information. It
       is a simple text file, use your favorite text editor to create it.

       A toc-file contains an optional header and a sequence of track specifica&#8208;
       tions.  Comments  starting  with  &apos;//&apos;  reaching until end of line can be
       placed anywhere.


   Header
       CATALOG &quot;ddddddddddddd&quot;
              Specifies the optional catalog number of the CD. The  string  must
              contain exactly 13 digits.

       The  following flags specify the type of session that will be created. It
       is used to create the correct CD-TOC format and to check the  consistency
       of  the  track  modes for the desired session type. If multiple flags are
       given the last one will take effect.

       CD_DA  The disc contains only audio tracks.

       CD_ROM The disc contains just mode 1 tracks or mode 1  and  audio  tracks
              (mixed mode CD).

       CD_ROM_XA
              The  disc  contains  mode  2 form 1 or mode 2 form 2 tracks. Audio
              tracks are allowed, too. This type must be used if  multi  session
              disks are created (option --multi).

       CD_TEXT { ... }
              Defines global CD-TEXT data like the album title and the used lan&#8208;
              guages.  See the CD-TEXT section below for the syntax of  the  CD-
              TEXT block contents.

   Track Specification
       TRACK &lt;track-mode&gt; [&lt;sub-channel-mode&gt;]
              Starts  a  new  track,  the  track number is incremented by 1. The
              length of a track must be at least 4 seconds. The block length  of
              the input data depends on the &lt;track-mode&gt;: AUDIO: 2352 bytes (588
              samples), MODE1: 2048 bytes, MODE1_RAW: 2352  bytes,  MODE2:  2336
              bytes,   MODE2_FORM1:   2048   bytes,   MODE2_FORM2:  2324  bytes,
              MODE2_FORM_MIX: 2336 bytes including  the  sub-header,  MODE2_RAW:
              2352 bytes.  The &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is optional. If given it spec&#8208;
              ifies the type of sub-channel data for each sector. RW: packed R-W
              sub-channel  data  (96  bytes,  L-EC  data  will  be  generated if
              required), RW_RAW: raw R-W sub-channel data (interleaved and  L-EC
              data  already calculated, 96 bytes). The block length is increased
              by the sub-channel data length if a &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt;  is  speci&#8208;
              fied.   If  the  input  data length is not a multiple of the block
              length  it will be padded with zeros.

       The following flags may follow the track start statement. They  are  used
       to  set  sub-channel  information  for  the  current  track. Each flag is
       optional. If not given the following defaults are used: copy not  permit&#8208;
       ted, no pre emphasis, two channel audio, no ISRC code.

       [ NO ] COPY
              Sets or clears the copy permitted flag.

       [ NO ] PRE_EMPHASIS
              Sets or clears the pre emphasis flag (only for audio tracks).

       TWO_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates  that  track  contains  two channel audio data (only for
              audio tracks).

       FOUR_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates that track contains four channel audio  data  (only  for
              audio tracks).

       ISRC &quot;CCOOOYYSSSSS&quot;
              Sets ISRC code of track (only for audio tracks).
              C: country code (upper case letters or digits)
              O: owner code (upper case letters or digits)
              Y: year (digits)
              S: serial number (digits)

       An  optional  CD-TEXT  block that defines the CD-TEXT data for this track
       may follow. See the CD-TEXT section below for the syntax of  the  CD-TEXT
       block contents.

       CD_TEXT { ... }

       At  least one of the following statements must appear to specify the data
       for the current track. Lengths and start positions may  be  expressed  in
       samples  (1/44100  seconds) for audio tracks or in bytes for data tracks.
       It is also possible to give the length in  blocks  with  the  MSF  format
       &apos;MM:SS:FF&apos;  specifying  minutes,  seconds and frames (0 &lt;= &apos;FF&apos; &lt; 75) . A
       frame equals one block.

       If more than one statement is used the track will be composed by concate&#8208;
       nating the data in the specified order.

       SILENCE &lt;length&gt;
              Adds  zero  audio  data  of  specified length to the current audio
              track.  Useful to create silent pre-gaps.

       ZERO &lt;length&gt;
              Adds zero data to data tracks. Must be  used  to  define  pre-  or
              post-gaps between tracks of different mode.

       [ FILE | AUDIOFILE ] &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; &lt;start&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
              Adds  the audio data of specified file to the current audio track.
              It is possible to select a portion of an audio file  with  &lt;start&gt;
              and  &lt;length&gt; which allows non destructive cutting. The first sam&#8208;
              ple of an audio file is addressed with &lt;start&gt; = 0. If &lt;length&gt; is
              omitted  or  set to 0 all audio data from &lt;start&gt; until the end of
              file is used.

              Audio files may have raw or WAVE format with 16 bits  per  sample,
              44.1  kHz  sampling  rate,  stereo. Raw files must have the layout
              &apos;MSBLeft LSBLeft MSBRight LSBRight ...&apos; (big endian  byte  order).
              WAVE  files  are  expected  to  have little endian byte order. The
              option --swap reverses the expected byte order  for  all  raw  and
              WAVE  files.  Only  filenames  with a &quot;.wav&quot; ending are treated as
              WAVE files, all other names are assumed to be raw audio files. Use
              tools  like sox(1) to convert other file formats to supported for&#8208;
              mats.

              Specifying a &quot;-&quot; as filename causes data to be  read  from  STDIN.
              Currently only raw files are supported from STDIN.

              If you are unsure about the byte order of your audio files try the
              command &apos;show-data&apos;. If the byte order is correct you will  see  a
              sequence  of  increasing  or decreasing numbers for both channels.
              Otherwise numbers are jumping between very high and low  values  -
              high volume static.

       DATAFILE &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
              Adds  data  from given file to the current data track. If &lt;length&gt;
              is omitted the actual file length will be used.

       FIFO &quot;&lt;fifo path&gt;&quot; &lt;length&gt;
              Adds data from specified FIFO path to the current  audio  or  data
              track.  &lt;length&gt; must specify the amount of data that will be read
              from the FIFO. The value is  always  in  terms  of  bytes  (scalar
              value) or in terms of the block length (MSF value).

       START [ MM:SS:FF ]
              Defines  the  length of the pre-gap (position where index switches
              from 0 to 1). If the MSF value is omitted the current track length
              is  used.  If  the  current  track length is not a multiple of the
              block length the pre-gap length will be rounded up to  next  block
              boundary.

              If no START statement is given the track will not have a pre-gap.

       PREGAP MM:SS:FF
              This  is  an  alternate  way  to specify a pre-gap with zero audio
              data. It may appear before the first SILENCE, ZERO or FILE  state&#8208;
              ment. Either PREGAP or START can be used within a track specifica&#8208;
              tion. It is equivalent to the sequence
                SILENCE MM:SS:FF
                START
              for audio tracks or
                ZERO MM:SS:FF
                START
              for data tracks.

       Nothing  prevents  mixing  &apos;DATAFILE&apos;/&apos;ZERO&apos;  and   &apos;AUDIOFILE&apos;/&apos;SILENCE&apos;
       statements within the same track. The results, however, are undefined.


       The end of a track specification may contain zero or more index increment
       statements:

       INDEX MM:SS:FF
              Increments the index number at given position  within  the  track.
              The  first  statement  will increment from 1 to 2. The position is
              relative to the real track start, not counting  an  existing  pre-
              gap.


   CD-TEXT Blocks
       A  CD-TEXT block may be placed in the global section to define data valid
       for the whole CD and in each track  specification  of  a  toc-file.   The
       global section must define a language map that is used to map a language-
       number to country codes. Up to 8 different languages can be defined:

       LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : c1  1 : c2  ...  7 : c7 }
              The country code may be an integer value in the  range  0..255  or
              one of the following countries (the corresponding integer value is
              placed in braces behind the token): EN(9, English)
              It is just necessary to define a mapping for the used languages.

       If no mapping exists for a language-number the  data  for  this  language
       will be ignored.

       For  each  language  a  language block must exist that defines the actual
       data for a certain language.

       LANGUAGE language-number {  cd-text-item  cd-text-data  cd-text-item  cd-
       text-data ... }
              Defines  the CD-TEXT items for given language-number which must be
              defined in the language map.

       The cd-text-data may be either a string enclosed by &quot; or binary data like
            { 0, 10, 255, ... }
       where each integer number must be in the range 0..255.
       The cd-text-item may be one of the following:

       TITLE  String data: Title of CD or track.
&#12;       PERFORMER
              String data.

       SONGWRITER
              String data.

       COMPOSER
              String data.

       ARRANGER
              String data.

       MESSAGE
              String data. Message to the user.

       DISC_ID
              String data: Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT  block.  The
              format is usually: XY12345

       GENRE  Mixture  of  binary data (genre code) and string data. Should only
              appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Useful entries will be created
              by gcdmaster.

       TOC_INFO1
              Binary  data:  Optional table of contents 1. Should only appear in
              the global CD-TEXT block.

       TOC_INFO2
              Binary data: Optional table of contents 2. Should only  appear  in
              the global CD-TEXT block.

       UPC_EAN
              String  data:  This  item should only appear in the global CD-TEXT
              block. Was always an empty string on the CD-TEXT CDs I had  access
              to.

       ISRC   String data: ISRC code of track. The format is usually: CC-OOO-YY-
              SSSSS

       SIZE_INFO
              Binary data: Contains summary about all CD-TEXT  data  and  should
              only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. The data will be automat&#8208;
              ically (re)created when the CD-TEXT data is written.

              If one of the CD-TEXT items  TITLE,  PERFORMER,  SONGWRITER,  COM&#8208;
              POSER,  ARRANGER,  ISRC is defined for at least on track or in the
              global section it must be defined for all tracks and in the global
              section.  If  a  DISC_ID item is defined in the global section, an
              ISRC entry must be defined for each track.

            FILE &quot;data_3.wav&quot; 0


CUE FILES
       Cue files may be used wherever a toc-file is expected. The  corresponding
       bin  file  is  not  taken  from the FILE statement of a cue file but con&#8208;
       structed from the cue file name by replacing &quot;.cue&quot; by  &quot;.bin&quot;.  The  cue
       file must have exactly one FILE statement.

       Currently,  following  track modes are supported: MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352,
       MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The CATALOG,  ISRC  and  POSTGAP  statements  are
       parsed but not evaluated, yet.


SETTINGS
       Some  of  the command line options can be stored as settings at following
       locations. The files will be read on startup of cdrdao in that order:

       1. /etc/cdrdao.conf

       2. /etc/defaults/cdrdao

       3. /etc/default/cdrdao

       4. $HOME/.cdrdao


       Command line options will overwrite the loaded  settings.   The  settings
       file contains name - value pairs separated by a colon. String values must
       be enclosed by &quot;. The file is automatically written if the  command  line
       option --save is used but it is also possible to modify it manually. Fol&#8208;
       lowing values are defined:

       write_device
              Device used for operations simulate, write, copy, blank, disk-info
              and unlock.  Corresponding option: --device

       write_driver
              Driver (including driver options) that is used for operations sim&#8208;
              ulate, write, copy, blank, disk-info  and  unlock.   Corresponding
              option: --driver

       write_speed
              Specifies writing speed. Corresponding option: --speed

       write_buffers

              Device used for operations read-toc,  read-cd  and  copy.   Corre&#8208;
              sponding option: --device or --source-device

       read_driver
              Driver  (including  driver  options) used for operations read-toc,
              read-cd and copy.  Corresponding  option:  --driver  or  --source-
              driver

       read_paranoia_mode
              Paranoia mode used for operations read-cd and copy.  Corresponding
              option: --paranoia-mode

       cddb_server_list
              CDDB server list for  read-cddb.   Corresponding  option:  --cddb-
              servers

       cddb_timeout
              CDDB connection timeout in seconds used by read-cddb.  Correspond&#8208;
