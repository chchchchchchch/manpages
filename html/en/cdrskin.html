CDRSKIN(1)                                                            CDRSKIN(1)



NAME
       cdrskin - burns preformatted data to CD, DVD, and BD via libburn.

SYNOPSIS
       cdrskin [options|track_source_addresses]

DESCRIPTION
       cdrskin  is  a program that provides some of cdrecord&apos;s options in a com&#8208;
       patible way for CD media. With DVD and BD it has its own  ways.   You  do
       not need to be superuser for its daily usage.

   Overview of features:
       Blanking of CD-RW and DVD-RW.
       Formatting of DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD.
       Burning of data or audio tracks to CD,
       either in versatile Track at Once mode (TAO)
       or in Session at Once mode for seamless tracks.
       Multi session on CD (follow-up sessions in TAO only)
       or on DVD-R[W] (in Incremental mode) or DVD+R[/DL] or BD-R.
       Single session Disk-at-once on DVD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-R DL.
       Single session or emulated ISO-9660 multi-session
       on overwriteable DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, BD-RE
       or on data file or block device.
       Bus scan, burnfree, speed options, retrieving media info, padding, fifo.
       See section EXAMPLES at the end of this text.

   Track recording model:
       The input-output entities which get processed are called tracks.  A track
       stores a stream of bytes.
       More than one track can be burned by a single run  of  cdrskin.   In  the
       terms of the MMC standard all tracks written by the same run constitute a
       session.
       Normally, each track is initiated by one track source  address  argument,
       which  may  either be &quot;-&quot; for standard input or the address of a readable
       file.  Alternatively, option cuefile= may  be  used  to  read  a  session
       description  from a text file and to read the session content from a sin&#8208;
       gle data file.
       If no write mode is given  explicitly  then  one  will  be  chosen  which
       matches  the  peculiarities  of track sources and the state of the output
       media.

       Some media types can be kept appendable so that  further  tracks  can  be
       written  to them in subsequent runs of cdrskin (see option -multi).  Info
       about the addresses of burned tracks is kept in a table of content  (TOC)
       on  media and can be retrieved via cdrskin option -toc.  This information
       is also used by the operating systems&apos; CD-ROM read drivers.

       In general there are two types of tracks: data and audio. They differ  in
       sector  size,  throughput and readability via the systems&apos; CD-ROM drivers
       resp. by music CD players. With DVD and BD there is only type data.
       If not explicitly option -audio is given, then any  track  is  burned  as
       type  data, unless the track source is a file with suffix &quot;.wav&quot; or &quot;.au&quot;
       and has a header part which identifies it as MS-WAVE resp. SUN Audio with
       suitable parameters. Such files are burned as audio tracks by default.

       While audio tracks just contain a given time span of acoustic vibrations,
       data tracks may have an arbitray meaning. Nevertheless, ISO-9660 filesys&#8208;
       tems  are  established as a format which can represent a tree of directo&#8208;
       ries and files on all major operating systems. Such filesystem images can
       be produced by programs mkisofs or genisoimage or xorriso.  They can also
       be extended by follow-up tracks if prepared properly.  See the man  pages
       of  said  programs.   cdrskin  is  able  to fulfill the needs about their
       option -C.
       Another type of data track content are archive formats  which  originally
       have  been  developed  for  magnetic  tapes.  Only  formats  which mark a
       detectable end-of-archive in their data are suitable, though. Well tested
       are the archivers afio and star. Not suitable seems GNU tar.

   Write mode selection:
       In general there are two approaches for writing media:
       A  permissive mode depicted by option -tao which needs no predicted track
       size and allows to make use of eventual multi-session capabilities.
       A more restrictive mode -sao (alias -dao) which usually  demands  a  pre&#8208;
       dictable  track  size and is not necessarily capable of multi-session. It
       can be used to write CD-TEXT and it is  the  only  one  that  works  with
       option cuefile=.
       If  none of the options -dao, -tao or -sao is given then the program will
       try to choose a write mode which matches the defined recording  job,  the
       capabilities of the drive and the state of the present media.
       So  the  mentioning of write modes in the following paragraphs and in the
       examples is not so much a demand that the user shall choose  one  explic&#8208;
       itly,  but rather an illustration of what to expect with particular media
       types.

   Recordable CD Media:
       CD-R can be initially written only once  and  eventually  extended  until
       they get closed (or are spoiled because they are overly full). After that
       they are read-only. Closing is done automatically unless option -multi is
       given which keeps the media appendable.
       Write mode -tao allows to use track sources of unpredictable length (like
       stdin) and allows to write further sessions to  appendable  media.   -sao
       produces  audio  sessions  with seamless tracks but needs predicted track
       sizes and cannot append sessions to media.
       CD-RW media can be blanked to make them re-usable for  another  round  of
       overwriting. Usually blank=fast is the appropriate option.  Blanking dam&#8208;
       ages the previous content but does not make it completely unreadable.  It
       is  no  effective  privacy  precaution.   Multiple cycles of blanking and
       overwriting with random numbers might be needed.

   Sequentially Recordable DVD or BD Media:
       Currently DVD-RW, DVD-R[DL], DVD+R[DL], and BD-R  can  be  used  for  the
       Sequential recording model. It resembles the model of CD media. Only DVD-
       RW can be blanked and re-used from scratch.
       DVD-RW are sequential media if they are in state &quot;Sequential  Recording&quot;.
       The media must be either blank or appendable.  Newly purchased DVD-RW and
       DVD-R media are in this state.  Used DVD-RW  get  into  blank  sequential
       state by option blank=deformat_sequential .
       With DVD-R[W] two write modes may be available:
       Mode  DAO  has many restrictions. It does not work with appendable media,
       allows no -multi and only a single track. The size of the track needs  to
       be known in advance. So either its source has to be a disk file of recog&#8208;
       nizable size or the size has to be announced explicitly by options tsize=
       or tao_to_sao_tsize= .
       DAO  is  the  only  mode  for  DVD-R media which do not offer feature 21h
       Incremental Streaming (e.g. DVD-R DL). DAO may also be  selected  explic&#8208;
       itly  by option -sao .  Program growisofs uses DAO on sequential DVD-R[W]
       media for maximum DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility.
       The other mode, Incremental Streaming, is the default write mode if it is
       available  and  if the restrictions of DAO would prevent the job.  Incre&#8208;
       mental Streaming may be selected explicitly by option -tao as  it  resem&#8208;
       bles  much  CD TAO by allowing track sources of unpredicted length and to
       keep media appendable by option -multi . It does not work with  DVD-R  DL
       and  minimally  blanked  DVD-RW.  The only restriction towards CD-R[W] is
       the lack of support for -audio tracks.  Multiple tracks per  session  are
       permissible.
       The  write modes for DVD+R[/DL] and BD-R resemble those with DVD-R except
       that each track gets wrapped in an own session. There is no -dummy  writ&#8208;
       ing with DVD+R[/DL] or BD-R.
       Quite  deliberately  write  mode  -sao insists in the tradition of a pre&#8208;
       dicted track size and blank media, whereas -tao writes  the  tracks  open
       ended and allows appendable media.
       BD-R  may  be  formatted before first use to enable the Defect Management
       which might catch and repair some bad spots at the expense of slow  speed
       even with flawless media.
       Note:  Option  -multi  might  make  DVD  media unreadable in some DVD-ROM
       drives.  Best reader compatibility is achieved without it (i.e. by single
       session media).

   Overwriteable DVD or BD Media:
       Currently  types DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and BD-RE can be overwritten via
       cdrskin.
       Option -audio is not allowed. Only one track is allowed.   Option  -multi
       cannot  mark a recognizable end of overwriteable media.  Therefore -multi
       is banned unless ISO-9660 images shall be expandable by  help  of  option
       --grow_overwriteable_iso  .   Without  this option or without an ISO-9660
       filesystem image present on media, -toc does not return information about
       the  media  content and media get treated as blank regardless wether they
       hold data or not.
       Currently there is no difference between -sao and  -tao.  If  ever,  then
       -tao will be the mode which preserves the current behavior.

       DVD+RW and DVD-RAM media need no special initial formatting. They offer a
       single continuous data area  for  blockwise  random  access.  BD-RE  need
       explicit   formatting  before  use.  See  blank=as_needed  or  blank=for&#8208;
       mat_defectmgt .
       DVD-RW are sold in state &quot;Sequential Recording&quot;. To become  suitable  for
       the Overwriteable DVD recording model they need to get formatted to state
       &quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. Then they behave much like DVD+RW.  This  format&#8208;
       ting can be done by option blank=format_overwrite .
       Several  programs  like  dvd+rw-format,  cdrecord,  wodim, or cdrskin can
       bring a DVD-RW out of overwriteable state so that it has to be  formatted
       again. If in doubt, just give it a try.

   Drive preparation and addressing:
       The  drives, CD, DVD, or BD burners, are accessed via addresses which are
       specific to libburn and the operating system. Those addresses get  listed
       by a run of cdrskin --devices or cdrskin --device_links.
       On  Linux,  they are device files which traditionally do not offer w-per&#8208;
       missions for normal users. Because libburn needs rw-permission, it  might
       be  only  the superuser who is able to get this list without further pre&#8208;
       cautions.
       It is consensus that chmod a+rw /dev/sr0 or chmod a+rw /dev/hdc  is  less
       security  sensitive than chmod u+s,a+x /usr/bin/cdrskin. The risk for the
       drive is somewhat higher but the overall system is much  less  at  stake.
       Consider  to restrict rw-access to a single group which bundles the users
       who are allowed to use the burner drive (like group &quot;floppy&quot;).
       For drive  permission  examples  on  Linux,  FreeBSD,  and  Solaris,  see
       cdrskin/README.

       If  you  only  got  one  CD  capable drive then you may leave out cdrskin
       option dev=. Else you should use this option to  address  the  drive  you
       want.
       cdrskin option dev= not only accepts the listed addresses but also tradi&#8208;
       tional cdrecord SCSI addresses which consist of three  numbers:  Bus,Tar&#8208;
       get,Lun.  On  Linux  there  is  also a related address family &quot;ATA&quot; which
       accesses IDE drives not under control of Linux SCSI drivers: ATA:Bus,Tar&#8208;
       get,Lun.
       See option -scanbus for getting a list of cdrecord style addresses.
       Further  are  accepted:  links  to  libburn-suitable device files, device
       files which have the same major and minor device number, and device files
       which have the same SCSI address parameters (e.g. /dev/sg0).

   Emulated drives:
       Option  --allow_emulated_drives enables addressing of pseudo-drives which
       get emulated on top of filesystem objects. Regular data files  and  block
       devices  result  in pseudo-drives which behave much like DVD-RAM.  If the
       given address does not exist yet but its directory exists, then  it  gets
       created  as  regular  file.   Other  file types like character devices or
       pipes result in pseudo-drives which behave much like  blank  DVD-R.   The
       target file address is given after prefix &quot;stdio:&quot;.
       E.g.: dev=stdio:/tmp/my_pseudo_drive
       Addresses  of  the form &quot;stdio:/dev/fd/&lt;number&gt;&quot; are treated special. The
       number  is  read  literally  and  used  as  open  file  descriptor.  With
       dev=&quot;stdio:/dev/fd/1&quot;  the normal standard output of the program is redi&#8208;
       rected to stderr and the stream data of a burn run will appear on stdout.
       Not good for terminals ! Redirect it.
       Pseudo-drives allow -dummy. Their reply with  --tell_media_space  can  be
       utopic.   -dummy burn runs touch the file but do not modify its data con&#8208;
       tent.
       Note: --allow_emulated_drives is restricted to stdio:/dev/null if cdrskin
       is run by the superuser or if it has changed user identity via the setuid
       bit of its access permissions. The ban for the superuser can be lifted by
       a skillfully created file. See section FILES below.

OPTIONS
       --help Show non-cdrecord compatible options.

       -help  Show cdrecord compatible options.
              Note that some of the help texts are quite wrong - for cdrecord as
              well as for cdrskin (e.g. -format, blank=, -load). They are,  nev&#8208;
              ertheless,  traditional  indicators  for  the  availability of the
              listed options. Some frontend programs make decisions after  read&#8208;
              ing them.

       -version
              Print  cdrskin  id line, compatibility lure line, libburn version,
              cdrskin version, version timestamp,  build  timestamp  (if  avail&#8208;
              able), and then exit.

       Alphabetical  list  of  options  which are intended to be compatible with
       original cdrecord by Joerg Schilling:

       -atip  Retrieve some  info  about  media  state.  With  CD-RW  print  &quot;Is
              erasable&quot;.   With  DVD  media  print &quot;book type:&quot; and a media type
              text. With BD media print &quot;Mounted Media:&quot; and media type text.

       -audio Announces that the subsequent tracks are to be  burned  as  audio.
              The  source  is  supposed to be uncompressed headerless PCM, 44100
              Hz, 16 bit, stereo. For little-endian byte order (which  is  usual
              on  PCs)  use  option  -swab.  Unless  marked explicitly by option
              -data, input files with suffix &quot;.wav&quot;  are  examined  wether  they
              have  a  header  in MS-WAVE format confirming those parameters and
              eventually raw audio data get extracted and burned as audio track.
              Same is done for suffix &quot;.au&quot; and SUN Audio.
              Option  -audio  may be used only with CD media and not with DVD or
              BD.

       blank=type
              Blank a CD-RW, DVD-RW, or format a DVD-RW,  DVD+RW,  DVD-RAM,  BD.
              This  is  combinable with burning in the same run of cdrskin.  The
              type given with blank= selects the particular behavior:

              as_needed
                     Try to make the media ready for writing from scratch. If it
                     needs  formatting, then format it. If it is not blank, then
                     try to apply blank=fast.  It is a reason to  abort  if  the
                     media  cannot assume thoroughly writeable state, e.g. if it
                     is non-blank write-once.
                     This leaves unformatted DVD-RW in unformatted blank  state.
                     To  format  DVD-RW  use  blank=format_overwriteable.  Blank
                     unformatted BD-R stay unformatted.
                     (Note: blank=as_needed is not an original cdrecord option.)

              The  following  blank  types  are  specific  to  particular  media
              familes. Use them if special features are desired.

              all    Blank  an entire CD-RW or an unformatted DVD-RW.  (See also
                     --prodvd_cli_compatible, --grow_overwriteable_iso)

              fast   Minimally blank an entire CD-RW  or  blank  an  unformatted
                     DVD-RW.   (See  also  --prodvd_cli_compatible, --grow_over&#8208;
                     writeable_iso)

              deformat_sequential
                     Like blank=all but with the  additional  ability  to  blank
                     overwriteable  DVD-RW.   This will destroy their formatting
                     and make them sequentially recordable.  Another peculiarity
                     is  the  ability to blank media which appear already blank.
                     This is similar to option -force but does not try to  blank
                     media other than recognizable CD-RW and DVD-RW.
                     (Note: blank=deformat_* are not original cdrecord options.)

              deformat_sequential_quickest
                     Like  blank=deformat_sequential  but  blanking  DVD-RW only
                     minimally.  This is faster than full blanking but may yield
                     media incapable of Incremental Streaming (-tao).

              format_if_needed
                     Format  a  media if it is not formatted yet, and if cdrskin
                     supports formatting for the media type, and  if  formatting
                     will not happen automatically during write.  This currently
                     applies to unformatted DVD-RW, DVD-RAM,  BD-RE,  and  blank
                     unformatted  BD-R.  Eventually the appropriate default for&#8208;
                     matting is chosen.  If other media or  states  are  encoun&#8208;
                     tered then nothing happens.
                     The following formatting types are more specialized to par&#8208;
                     ticular media families.

              format_overwrite
                     Format a DVD-RW to &quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. The user  should
                     bring some patience.
                     (Note: blank=format_* are not original cdrecord options.)

              format_overwrite_quickest
                     Like  format_overwrite  without  creating  a 128 MiB trail&#8208;
                     blazer session.  Leads to &quot;intermediate&quot; state  which  only
                     allows  sequential  write  beginning  from  address 0.  The
                     &quot;intermediate&quot; state ends after the first session of  writ&#8208;
                     ing data.

              format_overwrite_full
                     For  DVD-RW  this  is like format_overwrite but claims full
                     media size rather than just 128 MiB.  Most traditional for&#8208;
                     matting  is  attempted. No data get written.  Much patience
                     is required.
                     This option treats already  formatted  media  even  if  not
                     option -force is given.
                     For  DVD+RW  this is the only supported explicit formatting
                     type. It provides complete &quot;de-icing&quot; so no reader slips on
                     unwritten data areas.

              format_defectmgt
                     Format DVD-RAM or BD to reserve the default amount of spare
                     blocks for defect management.
                     The  following  format_defectmgt_*  allow  to  submit  user
                     wishes  which  nevertheless have to match one of the avail&#8208;
                     able formats. These formats are offered by the drive  after
                     examining the media.

              format_defectmgt_cert_off
                     Disable  the  usual media quality certification in order to
                     save time and format to default  size.   The  certification
                     setting persists even if subsequent blank= options override
                     the size of the format selection.
                     Whether formatting  without  certification  works  properly
                     depends  much  on  the  drive. One should check the &quot;Format
                     status:&quot; from --list_formats afterwards.

              format_defectmgt_cert_on
                     Re-enable the usual media quality certification and  format
                     to  default  size.  The certification setting persists like
                     with format_defectmgt_cert_off.
                     Whether there happens certification at all depends much  on
                     the  media  state and the actually selected format descrip&#8208;
                     tor.

              format_defectmgt_max
                     Format DVD-RAM or BD to reserve a maximum number  of  spare
                     blocks.

              format_defectmgt_min
                     Format  DVD-RAM  or BD to reserve a minimum number of spare
                     blocks.  It might be  necessary  to  format  format_defect&#8208;
                     mgt_none  first  in  order  to  get offered the most minmal
                     spare blocks sizes for format_defectmgt_min.

              format_defectmgt_none
                     Format DVD-RAM or BD-RE to the largest available payload in
                     the  hope  to disable defect management at all. This may or
                     may not have a speed increasing effect.  Unformatted  blank
                     BD-R will be left unformatted.

              format_defectmgt_payload_&lt;size&gt;
                     Format DVD-RAM or BD. The text after &quot;format_defectmgt_pay&#8208;
                     load_&quot; gives a number of bytes,  eventually  with  suffixes
                     &quot;s&quot;,  &quot;k&quot;,  &quot;m&quot;. The largest number of spare blocks will be
                     chosen which allows at least the given payload size.

              format_by_index_&lt;number&gt;
                     Format DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or  BD.   The  number  after
                     &quot;format_by_index_&quot;  is  used as index to the list of avail&#8208;
                     able format descriptors.  This  list  can  be  obtained  by
                     option --list_formats.  The numbers after text &quot;Format idx&quot;
                     are the ones  to  be  used  with  format_by_index_.  Format
                     descriptor  lists  are volatile. Do neither eject nor write
                     the media between the run of --list_formats and the run  of
                     blank=format_by_index_ or else you may get a different for&#8208;
                     mat than desired.

              help   Print this list of blanking types.

       -checkdrive
              Retrieve some info about the addressed drive and then exit.  Exits
              with non-zero value if the drive cannot be found and opened.

       -copy  Create the subsequent tracks with permission for an unlimited num&#8208;
              ber of copies.

       cuefile=path
              Read a session description from a cue sheet file in CDRWIN format.
              Base  the  tracks  on a single file which is given in the sheet by
              command FILE.  To enable CD-TEXT from the cue sheet file,  cdrskin
              option -text has to be present.
              cdrskin  currently  supports  TRACK datatypes AUDIO and MODE1/2048
              which may not be mixed.  Data source may be of FILE  type  BINARY,
              MOTOROLA, or WAVE.
              Non-CDRWIN commands ARRANGER, COMPOSER, MESSAGE are supported.
              Cue  sheet  file  commands  CATALOG  and ISRC may be overridden by
              option mcn= and by input_sheet_v07t=  purpose  specifiers  &quot;UPC  /
              EAN&quot;  and  &quot;ISRC&quot;.   This  does not affect their appearance in CD-
              TEXT, but only on Q sub-channel.
              The track numbers may be overridden by option cd_start_tno=.

       -dao   Alias for option -sao. Write CD in Session at Once  mode  or  DVD-
              R[W] in Disc-at-once mode.

       -data  Subsequent tracks are data tracks. This option is default and only
              needed to mark the end of the range of an eventual  option  -audio
              or -xa1.
              Options  -mode2,  -xa, and -xa2 get mapped to -data, not using the
              desired CD sector formats and thus not taking advantage  of  even&#8208;
              tual  higher payload.  -xa1 Subsequent tracks are data tracks with
              input suitable for CD-ROM XA mode 2  form  1.  This  differs  from
              -data  input by 8 additional header bytes per block.  cdrskin will
              not write CD-ROM XA but rather strip the header bytes and write as
              -data tracks.

       dev=target
              Set  the  address  of  the  drive  to  use. Valid are at least the
              addresses listed with options --devices or  --device_links,  X,Y,Z
              addresses  listed with option -scanbus, ATA:X,Y,Z addresses listed
              with options dev=ATA -scanbus, and volatile libburn drive  numbers
              (numbering starts at &quot;0&quot;).  Other device file addresses which lead
              to the same drive might work too.
              If no dev= is given, volatile address &quot;dev=0&quot; is assumed. That  is
              the first drive found being available. Better avoid this ambiguity
              on systems with more than one drive.
              The special target &quot;help&quot; lists hints about  available  addressing
              formats.   Be  aware  that deprecated option --old_pseudo_scsi_adr
              may change the meaning of Bus,Target,Lun addresses.

       driveropts=opt
              Set &quot;driveropts=noburnfree&quot; to disable the drive&apos;s  eventual  pro&#8208;
              tection mechanism against temporary lack of source data (i.e. buf&#8208;
              fer underrun).  A drive that announces no such  capabilities  will
              not  get  them  enabled  anyway,  even if attempted explicitly via
              &quot;driveropts=burnfree&quot;.

       -dummy Try to perform the drive operations without actually affecting the
              inserted  media.  There  is no warranty that this will work with a
              particular combination of drive, media, and write  mode.  Blanking
              is  prevented reliably, though.  To avoid inadverted real burning,
              -dummy refuses burn runs on anything  but  CD-R[W],  DVD-R[W],  or
              emulated stdio-drives.

       -eject Eject the disc after work is done.

       -force Assume  that  the  user knows better in situations when cdrskin or
              libburn are insecure about drive or media state. This includes the
              attempt  to blank media which are classified as unknown or unsuit&#8208;
              able, and the attempt to use write modes  which  libburn  believes
              they are not supported by the drive.
              Another  application  is  to  enforce blanking or re-formatting of
              media which appear to be in the  desired  blank  or  format  state
              already.
              This  option enables a burn run with option -dummy even if libburn
              believes that drive and media will not simulate the write mode but
              will write for real.
              It  enables  a burn run where cdrskin expects to exceed the avail&#8208;
              able media capacity.
              Caution: Use this only when in urgent need.

       -format
              Same  as  blank=format_overwrite_full  -force  but  restricted  to
              DVD+RW.

       fs=size
              Set  the fifo size to the given value. The value may have appended
              letters which multiply the preceding number:
              &quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; = 1024 , &quot;m&quot; or &quot;M&quot; = 1024k , &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; = 1024m ,  &quot;s&quot;
              or &quot;S&quot; = 2048
              Set size to 0 in order to disable the fifo (default is &quot;4m&quot;).
              The  fifo  buffers  an  eventual temporary surplus of track source
              data in order to provide the drive with  a  steady  stream  during
              times  of  temporary  lack of track source supply.  The larger the
              fifo, the longer periods of poor source supply can be compensated.
              But  a  large fifo needs substantial time to fill up if not curbed
              via option fifo_start_at=size.

       gracetime=seconds
              Set the grace time before starting to write. (Default is 0)

       -immed Equivalent to:
              modesty_on_drive=1:min_percent=75:max_percent=95
              The name of this cdrecord option stems from the &quot;Immed&quot; bit  which
              can  make  some  long running drive commands asynchronous and thus
              eases the load on some wiring hardware types. Regardless of option
              -immed,  cdrskin  uses  asynchronous  commands  where possible and
              appropriate.

       index=list
              Set a comma separated list of index start address numbers for  the
              next track.  This applies to CD SAO sessions only.
              The  addresses count sectors from the start of the next track. The
              first number is for index 1 and must be 0. The  following  numbers
              have  to  be  larger  than their respective predecessors. Up to 99
              numbers are allowed.
              Sector numbers are computed from Min:Sec:Frame addresses by
               Sector = ((Min*60)+Sec)*75+Frame
              E.g.: &quot;0,7512,20408&quot; sets index 2  to  01:40:12  and  index  3  to
              04:32:08.

       -inq   Print the identification of the drive and then exit.

       -isosize
              The next track following this option will try to obtain its source
              size from the header information out of the first  few  blocks  of
              the  source data.  If these blocks indicate an ISO-9660 filesystem
              then its declared size will be used under the assumption  that  it
              is a single session filesystem.
              If not, then the burn run will be aborted.
              The  range of -isosize is exactly one track. Further tracks may be
              preceded by further -isosize options, though. At least  15  blocks
              of padding will be added to each -isosize track. But be advised to
              rather use padsize=300k.
              This option can be performed on track sources  which  are  regular
              files  or block devices. For the first track of the session it can
              be performed on any type of source if there is a fifo of at  least
              64 kiB. See option fs= .

       isrc=text
              Set  the  ISRC  for the next track source to the given text, which
              must be exactly 13 characters long. It must comply to  the  format
              CCOOOYYSSSSS.
              CC is the country code. OOO is the owner code. Both may consist of
              capital letters A to Z and of decimal digits 0 to  9.  YY  depicts
              the year (00 to 99).  SSSSS is the serial number (00000 to 99999).
              This option does not affect CD-TEXT but only the Q sub-channel.

       -load  Load  the media and exit. Exit value is 0 if any kind of media was
              found, non zero else. Note: Option -eject will  unload  the  media
              even if -load is given.

       -lock  Like  option  -load but leave the drive&apos;s eject button disabled if
              there is any media found and not option -eject is given.
              Use program &quot;eject&quot; or cdrskin -eject to get the tray out  of  the
              drive.   Runs of programs like cdrecord, growisofs, wodim, cdrskin
              will not be hampered and normally enable the drive&apos;s eject  button
              when they are done.

       mcn=text
              Set  the CD Media Catalog Number to text, which must be exactly 13
              characters long and should consist of decimal digits.
              This option does not affect CD-TEXT but only the Q sub-channel.

       minbuf=percentage
              Equivalent to:
              modesty_on_drive=1:min_percent=&lt;percentage&gt;:max_percent=95
              Percentage is permissible between 25 and 95.

       -minfo Print information about the  loaded  media.  This  includes  media
              type, writability state, and a quite readable table of content.

       msifile=path
              Run option -msinfo and copy the result line into the file given by
              path.  Unlike -msinfo this option does  not  redirect  all  normal
              output  away  from  standard  output.  But it may be combined with
              -msinfo to achieve this.
              Note: msifile=path is actually an  option  of  wodim  and  not  of
              cdrecord.

       -msinfo
              Retrieve  multi-session  info for preparing a follow-up session by
              option  -C  of  programs  mkisofs,  genisoimage,  or  xorriso  -as
              mkisofs.   Print result to standard output.  This option redirects
              to  stderr  all  message  output  except   the   one   of   option
              --tell_media_space  and  its  own result string, which consists of
              two numbers.  The result string  shall  be  used  as  argument  of
              option  -C  with said programs.  It gives the start address of the
              most recent session and the predicted start address  of  the  next
              session  to  be  appended.  The string is empty if the most recent
              session was not written with option -multi.
              To have a chance for working on overwriteable media,  this  option
              has to be accompanied by option --grow_overwriteable_iso.

       -multi This option keeps CD, unformatted DVD-R[W], DVD+R, or BD-R append&#8208;
              able after the current session has been written.  Without  it  the
              disc gets closed and may not be written any more  - unless it is a
              -RW and gets blanked which causes loss of its content.
              The following sessions can only be written in -tao mode. -multi is
              prohibited  with  DVD-R[W]  DAO  write mode and on DVD-R DL media.
              Option --prodvd_cli_compatible eventually makes  -multi  tolerable
              but cannot make it work.
              In  order  to have all filesystem content accessible, the eventual
              ISO-9660 filesystem of a follow-up session needs to be prepared in
              a  special  way  by  the filesystem formatter program. mkisofs and
              genisoimage expect particular info about the situation  which  can
              be retrieved by cdrskin option -msinfo.
              To  retrieve  an  archive file which was written as follow-up ses&#8208;
              sion, you may use option -toc to learn  about  the  &quot;lba&quot;  of  the
              desired  track  number.   This lba is the address of the 2048 byte
              block where the archive begins.
              With overwriteable DVD or BD media, -multi cannot mark the end  of
              the  session.   So  when  adding  a new session this end has to be
              determined from the payload.  Currently only ISO-9660  filesystems
              can  be  used  that  way.  See option --grow_overwriteable_iso for
              lifting the ban on -multi.
              Note: -multi might make  DVD  media  unreadable  in  some  DVD-ROM
              drives.

       -nocopy
              Create  subsequent  tracks  with  permission for a single level of
              copies.  I.e. those copies would then be marked by -scms as offer&#8208;
              ing no permission for further copies.

       -nopad Do  not add trailing zeros to the data stream. Nevertheless, since
              there seems to be no use for audio  tracks  with  incomplete  last
              sector,  this  option  applies  only  to  data tracks. There it is
              default.

       -nopreemp
              Indicate for subsequent tracks that  they  were  mastered  without
              pre-emphasis.

       -pad   Add 30 kiB of trailing zeros to each data track. (This is not suf&#8208;
              ficient to avoid problems with various CD-ROM read drivers.)

       padsize=size
              Add the given amount of trailing zeros to  the  next  data  track.
              This option gets reset to padsize=0 after that next track is writ&#8208;
              ten. It may be set again before the  next  track  argument.  About
              size specifiers, see option fs=.

       -preemp
              Indicate  for  subsequent tracks that they were mastered with pre-
              emphasis.

       -sao   Write CD in Session At Once mode or sequential DVD-R[W]  in  Disc-
              at-once (DAO) mode.
              With  CD  this  mode  is able to put several audio tracks on media
              without producing audible gaps between them.
              With DVD-R[W] this mode can only write a single track.  No  -multi
              is allowed with DVD-R[W] -sao.
              -sao  is  permissible with overwriteable DVD, or DVD+R[/DL], or BD
              but actually only imposes  restrictions  without  providing  known
              advantages.
              -sao  can  only  be used for tracks of fixely predicted size. This
              implies that track arguments which depict  stdin  or  named  pipes
              need   to   be   preceded   by   option   tsize=   or   by  option
              tao_to_sao_tsize=.
              -sao cannot be used on appendable media.

       -scanbus
              Scan the system for drives. On Linux the drives at /dev/s* and  at
              /dev/hd*  are to be scanned by two separate runs. One without dev=
              for /dev/s* and one with dev=ATA  for  /dev/hd*  devices.  (Option
              --drives lists all available drives in a single run.)
              Drives  which are busy or which offer no rw-permission to the user
              of cdrskin are not listed. Busy drives get  reported  in  form  of
              warning messages.
              The useful fields in a result line are:

       -scms  Create subsequent tracks without permission for being copied. This
              is usually done for tracks which are copies of  tracks  that  were
              marked  with -nocopy (but not yet with -scms). So copies of copies
              are prohibited.
              This option gets reset by option -copy. Thus the combination -copy
              -nocopy means -nocopy surely without -scms.

       speed=number
              Set  speed  of  drive.  With  data  CD,  1x speed corresponds to a
              throughput of 150,000  bytes/second.  With  DVD,  1x  =  1,385,000
              bytes/second.   With BD 1x = 4,495,625 bytes/second.  It is not an
              error to set a speed higher than is suitable for drive and  media.
              One  should  stay within a realistic speed range, though.  Special
              speed settings are:
              0 = minimal speed , -1 = maximal speed  (default),  text  &quot;any&quot;  =
              like -1.

       -swab  Announce  that  the  raw audio data source of subsequent tracks is
              byte swapped versus the expectations of cdrecord. This  option  is
              suitable  for  audio  where the least significant byte of a 16 bit
              word is first (little-endian, Intel).  Most raw audio data  on  PC
              systems  are  available  in  this  byte  order.  Less guesswork is
              needed if track sources are in format MS-WAVE in a file with  suf&#8208;
              fix &quot;.wav&quot;.

       -tao   Write  CD  in  Track  At  Once  (TAO) mode, sequential DVD-R[W] in
              Incremental Streaming mode, or DVD+R[/DL] without traditional -sao
              restrictions.   This  mode also applies pro-forma to overwriteable
              media
              Mode -tao can be used with track sources  of  unpredictable  size,
              like  standard input or named pipes. It is also the only mode that
              can be used for writing to appendable  media  which  already  hold
              data.  With  unformatted DVD-R[W] it is the only mode which allows
              -multi.
              Mode -tao is not usable for minimally blanked DVD-RW and for DVD-R
              DL.

       -text  Enable  writing  of  CD-TEXT  attributes  read by option cuefile=.
              Without option -text, cue sheet file command  CDTEXTFILE  will  be
              ignored and no CD-TEXT attributes will be read from the file. Nev&#8208;
              ertheless, CATALOG and ISRC will have the same effect  as  options
              mcn= and isrc=.

       textfile=path
              Read  CD-TEXT  packs  from  the file depicted by path and put them
              into the Lead-in of the emerging session. This session has  to  be
              done  by  Session  At  Once  (SAO) mode and may only contain audio
              tracks.
              path must lead to a regular file, which consists  of  an  optional
              header  of four bytes and one or more text packs of 18 bytes each.
              Suitable would be the file &apos;cdtext.dat&apos; which gets extracted  from
              CD  media  by options -vv -toc and shown in human readable form by
              -vvv -toc.
              The header, if present, must tell the file size minus  2,  encoded
              as big-endian 16 bit word. The other two bytes must be 0.
              If  there  is no 4-byte header, then a trailing 0-byte, as of Sony
              specification, is tolerated and ignored.
              A text pack consists of a pack type byte, a track number  byte,  a
              counter byte, a Block Number and Character Indicator byte, 12 text
              characters or data bytes, two optional CRC bytes. For details  see
              libburn documentation file doc/cdtext.txt.
              By  default,  the  input file is checked for correct CRC bytes. If
              all CRC  bytes  are  0,  then  the  correct  values  get  silently
              inserted.  If there are non-zero CRC bytes, then a mismatch causes
              the abort of the burn run.  This check can be disabled  by  option
              -force.
              Note that this option overrides option input_sheet_v07t= .

       -toc   Print  the  table  of  content  (TOC)  which  describes the tracks
              recorded on disc.  The output contains all info from option  -atip
              plus  lines  which begin with &quot;track:&quot;, the track number, the word
              &quot;lba:&quot; and a number which gives the start address  of  the  track.
              Addresses  are  counted  in  CD sectors which with SAO or TAO data
              tracks hold 2048 bytes each.
              If verbosity is set to level 2 (-v -v) then the CD-TEXT packs from
              the  lead-in  of  an  audio CD get extracted and written into file
              &apos;cdtext.dat&apos;, if that file does not yet exist. Prepended  is  a  4
              byte header, followed by one or more packs of 18 bytes each.
              Verbosity  level  3  causes the CD-TEXT packs to be printed as hex
              numbers to standard output. Bytes 4 to 15 of  certain  pack  types
              are  printed  as ASCII characters if they have values in the range
              of 32 to 126.
              See option textfile= for more information about the text pack for&#8208;
              mat.

              Example. Retrieve an afio archive from track number 2:
                     tracknumber=2
                     lba=$(cdrskin dev=/dev/cdrom -toc 2&gt;&amp;1 | \
                     grep &apos;^track:[ ]*[ 0-9][0-9]&apos; | \
                     tail +&quot;$tracknumber&quot; | head -1 | \
                     awk &apos;{ print $4}&apos; )
                     dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 skip=&quot;$lba&quot; | \
                     afio -t - | less

       tsize=size
              Announces  the exact size of the next track source. This is neces&#8208;
              sary with any write mode other than -tao if the  track  source  is
              not  a regular disk file, but e.g. &quot;-&quot; (standard input) or a named
              pipe.  About size specifiers, see option fs=.
              If the track source does  not  deliver  the  predicted  amount  of
              bytes,  the  remainder  of the track is padded with zeros. This is
              not considered an error.  If on the other hand  the  track  source
              delivers  more  than  the  announced bytes then the track on media
              gets truncated to the predicted size and cdrskin exits  with  non-
              zero value.

       -v     Increment  verbosity  level  by one. Startlevel is 0 with only few
              messages.  Level 1 prints progress report with long running opera&#8208;
              tions  and  also  causes  some extra lines to be put out with info
              retrieval options.  Level 2 additionally reports about option set&#8208;
              tings  derived  from  arguments  or  startup files. Level 3 is for
              debugging and useful mainly in conjunction with somebody who had a
              look into the program sourcecode.

       -V     Enable  logging  of  SCSI  commands  to stderr. This allows expert
              examination of the interaction between libburn and the drive.  The
              commands are specified in SCSI-3 standards SPC, SBC, MMC.

       -waiti Wait  until  input  data  is  available  at stdin or EOF occurs at
              stdin.  Only then begin to access any drives.
              One should use this if cdrskin is working at the  end  of  a  pipe
              where  the  feeder  process  reads from the drive before it starts
              writing its output into cdrskin. Example:
              mkisofs ... -C 0,12800 -M /dev/sr0 | \
              cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 ... -waiti -
              This option works even if stdin is not among the track sources. If
              no  process is piping in, then the Enter key of your terminal will
              act as trigger for cdrskin. Note that this input line will not  be
              consumed  by  cdrskin  if stdin is not among the track sources. It
              will end up as shell command, usually.

       Alphabetical list of options which are genuine to  cdrskin  and  intended
       for normal use:

       --adjust_speed_to_drive
              Curb  explicitly  given  speed=  values  to  the  maximum which is
              announced by the drive for the loaded media. By default,  such  an
              adjustment  is only made with pseudo-speeds 0 and -1 whereas speed
              settings &gt; 0 are sent unchanged  to  the  drive  which  will  then
              choose an appropriate speed on its own.

       --allow_emulated_drives
              Enable  drive  addresses  of the form dev=stdio:&lt;path&gt;. See above,
              paragraph &quot;Drive preparation and addressing&quot;.

       --allow_setuid
              Disable the loud warning about insecure discrepance between  login
              user  and  effective user which indicates application of chmod u+s
              to the program binary.  One should not do this chmod u+s , but  it
              is an old cdrecord tradition.

       --any_track
              Allow source_addresses to begin with &quot;-&quot; (plus further characters)
              or to contain a &quot;=&quot; character.  By default such arguments are seen
              as  misspelled options. It is nevertheless not possible to use one
              of the options listed with --list_ignored_options.

       assert_write_lba=block_number|byte_address
              Abort if the write address given with this option is not the  same
              as  predicted  immediately  before  the write session starts. This
              option can ensure that a start address which  was  presumed  by  a
              formatter like mkisofs -C is really used by the drive for writing.
              assert_write_lba=0 effectively demands blank  media  and  excludes
              appendables.
              Block  numbering  is peculiar: If the last character of the option
              string is a letter [a-zA-Z] then the usual unit  scaling  by  &quot;s&quot;,
              &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, etc. applies and the result is divided by 2048. Else the
              number value of the string is taken as  plain  block  number  with
              block  size  2048  byte.   (E.g  ...=1000 or ...=1000s means block
              1000, ...=1m means block 512, ...=4096b means block number 2)

       cd_start_tno=number
              Set the number which shall be written as CD track number with  the
              first  track  of  the  session. The following tracks will then get
              written with consecutive CD track numbers. The resulting number of
              the  last track must not exceed 99. The lowest possible start num&#8208;
              ber is 1, which is also the default.
              This setting applies only to CD  SAO  writing.  It  overrides  the
              track    number   settings   caused   by   options   cuefile=   or
              input_sheet_v07t=.

       --demand_a_drive
              Exit with a nonzero value if no drive can be found  during  a  bus
              scan.

       --devices
              List  the  device  file  addresses of all accessible CD drives. In
              order to get listed, a drive has to offer  rw-permission  for  the
              cdrskin  user and it may not be busy. The superuser should be able
              to see all idle drives listed and busy drives reported as  &quot;SORRY&quot;
              messages.
              Each  available drive gets listed by a line containing the follow&#8208;
              ing fields:
              Number dev=&apos;Devicefile&apos; rw-Permissions : &apos;Vendor&apos; &apos;Model&apos;
              Number and Devicefile can both be used with option dev=, but  num&#8208;
              ber is volatile (numbering changes if drives become busy).

       --device_links
              Like  --devices,  but presenting the drives with addresses of sym&#8208;
              bolic links which point to the actual device files.
              Modern GNU/Linux systems may shuffle drive addresses from boot  to
              boot.   The  udev  daemon is supposed to create links which always
              point to the same drive, regardless of its system address.  Option
              --device_links  shows the addresses of such links if they begin by
              &quot;/dev/dvd&quot; or &quot;/dev/cd&quot;.  Precedence is: &quot;dvdrw&quot;,  &quot;cdrw&quot;,  &quot;dvd&quot;,
              &quot;cdrom&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;.

       direct_write_amount=size
              Do  not write a session with tracks but rather make an appropriate
              number of direct write operations with no  preparations.  Flushing
              the  drive  buffer will be the only finalization. It is advised to
              eject the media afterwards because the write operations circumvent
              the  usual  system  i/o  with its caches and buffers. By ejecting,
              those invalid memory copies get surely discarded.
              Only few media can be written this way: DVD-RAM, BD-RE, RVD+RW and
              overwriteable DVD-RW. Writing is restricted to the already format&#8208;
              ted area of the media.
              Writing starts at byte 0 of the media or at the address  given  by
              option write_start_address= .  Only the first track source is used
              as input for the write operations.  The fifo (fs=) is disabled.
              Parameter size controls the amount of data to be written.  Size  0
              means  that  the  track source shall be used up until EOF. In this
              case, the last write transaction gets padded up to  the  necessary
              size by zeros. Size -1 revokes direct writing and switches back to
              normal session oriented writing.
              Both, write_start_address and  direct_write_amount  size  must  be
              aligned  to  a media dependend transaction size. With DVD-RAM, BD-
              RE, DVD+RW this is 2k, with overwriteable DVD-RW it is 32k.

       dvd_obs=default|32k|64k
              Linux specific: Set the number of bytes  to  be  transmitted  with
              each  write  operation to DVD or BD media. Tracks get padded up to
              the next multiple of this write  size.  A  number  of  64  KB  may
              improve  throughput  with bus systems which show latency problems.
              The default depends on media type, option  stream_recording=,  and
              on compile time options.

       fallback_program=command
              Set  a  command  name to be executed if cdrskin encounters a known
              cdrecord option which it does not yet support. If a non-empty com&#8208;
              mand  is given with fallback_program=, and if no essential options
              are given which are specific to cdrskin, then cdrskin  will  dele&#8208;
              gate the job to said command.
              The natural commands to be given are cdrecord or wodim but one may
              well submit the address of an own program.
              The fallback program will get all arguments of  cdrskin  which  do
              not  match the shell patterns --?* or *_*=* . This eventually sup&#8208;
              presses path names of track sources which happen  to  match  those
              patterns. The options from the startup files are not handed to the
              fallback program.
              Fallback program execution is disabled if cdrskin  is  run  setuid
              and  not  option  --allow_setuid is given. In general, the drive&apos;s
              device files and the involved programs should be set  up  so  that
              each  program  runs under its advised conditions. (E.g. cdrskin as
              member of group floppy, cdrecord setuid root.)
              Two alias names for cdrskin are predefined with  default  fallback
              programs:
              unicord implies fallback_program=cdrecord
              codim implies fallback_program=wodim

       --four_channel
              Indicate  for  subsequent tracks that they were mastered with four
              channels.

       fifo_start_at=size
              Do not wait for full fifo but start burning as soon as  the  given
              number  of  bytes is read. This option may be helpful to bring the
              average throughput near to the maximum throughput of  a  drive.  A
              large  fs=  and  a small fifo_start_at= combine a quick burn start
              and a large savings buffer to compensate  for  temporary  lack  of
              source  data. At the beginning of burning, the software protection
              against buffer underun is as weak as the size of fifo_start_at=  .
              So  it  is  best  if the drive offers hardware protection which is
              enabled automatically if not driveropts=noburnfree is given.

       --grow_overwriteable_iso
              Enable emulation of multi-session writing on  overwriteable  media
              which  contain  an  ISO-9660 filesystem. This emulation is learned
              from growisofs -M but adapted to the usage model of
              cdrskin -msinfo
              mkisofs -C -M | cdrskin -waiti [-multi] -
              --grow_overwriteable_iso does not hamper the use  of  true  multi-
              session  media.   I.e.  it  is  possible  to  use the same cdrskin
              options with both kinds of media and to achieve similar results if
              ISO-9660 filesystem images are to be written.  This option implies
              option -isosize and therefore demands that the track source  is  a
              ISO-9660 filesystem image.
              With  overwriteable  media and no option blank=fast|all present it
              expands an eventual ISO-9660 filesystem on media.  It  is  assumed
              that  this image&apos;s inner size description points to the end of the
              valuable data.  Overwriteable media with a  recognizable  ISO-9660
              size  will  be  regarded  as appendable rather than as blank. I.e.
              options -msinfo and -toc will work.  -toc will always show a  sin&#8208;
              gle  session  with  its  size  increasing with every added mkisofs
              image.
              If not overridden by option write_start_address=, the  track  with
              the  new  image  will be placed behind the end of the old one. One
              may use option assert_write_lba= to make sure that media state and
              mkisofs job do match.
              --grow_overwriteable_iso  causes  option blank=fast|all to invali&#8208;
              date an eventual ISO-9660 image by altering the first few bytes of
              block  16  on  overwriteable media.  Option -multi is tolerated in
              order not to hamper true multi-session media.
              An equivalent of growisofs -Z for overwriteable media is:
              mkisofs | cdrskin --grow_overwriteable_iso blank=fast [-multi] -
              With multi-session DVD, blank=fast  will  act  like  dvd+rw-format
              -blank=full .
              growisofs  -dvd-compat  is  roughly  equivalent to cdrskin without
              option -multi.

       input_sheet_v07t=path
              Read CD-TEXT definitions from a Sony Input Sheet version 0.7T.  Up
              to   eight   or   seven  such  sheets  can  be  read  by  multiple
              input_sheet_v07t= options.  Each will define  a  CD-TEXT  language
              block.
              The information in such a sheet is given by text lines of the fol&#8208;
              lowing form:
                purpose specifier [whitespace] = [whitespace] content text
              [whitespace] is zero or more ASCII 32 (space)  or  ASCII  9  (tab)
              characters.   The  purpose specifier tells the meaning of the con&#8208;
              tent text.  Empty content text does not cause a CD-TEXT  attribute
              to be attached.
              The following purpose specifiers apply to the session as a whole:
                Purpose specifier   | Content example
                -------------------------------------------------------------
                Text Code           = 8859

                First Track Number  = 1
                Last Track Number   = 3
              The following purpose specifiers apply to particular tracks:
                Purpose specifier   | Content example
                -------------------------------------------------------------
                Track 01 Title      = Song of Joy

                ISRC 01             = XYCRR1101234
              Track  numbers  are decimal despite the leading 0. There should be
              as many track definitions as there are track source files given.
              See libburn&apos;s doc/cdtext.txt for a detailed definition of 0.7T and
              the possible values for Text Code, Language Code, Genre Code, Text
              Data Copy Protection.
              The Q sub-channel settings by &quot;UPC / EAN&quot; and &quot;ISRC&quot; may be  over&#8208;
              ridden  by  options  mcn=  and  isrc=.  This will not affect their
              appearance as CD-TEXT.  They may override cuefile= commands  CATA&#8208;
              LOG and ISRC in the same way.
              If  options  -text  cuefile=  are  given and if the cue sheet file
              defines CD-TEXT, then only seven input_sheet_v07t= options may  be
              given. They will then be used as CD-TEXT language blocks 1 to 7.
              This  option  will  get into effect only if no option textfile= is
              given.  The write mode must be SAO  on  CD.  All  tracks  must  be
              -audio tracks.
              The track numbers may be overridden by option cd_start_tno=.

       --list_formats
              List the available format descriptors as reported by the drive for
              the loaded media. Each descriptor line begins  with  &quot;Format  idx&quot;
              and  the  descriptor&apos;s  list  index, followed by a &quot;:&quot;, the format
              type, the number of payload blocks and that same number  converted
              to MiB.
              The  meaning  of  the  format types is defined by the MMC standard
              with command FORMAT UNIT. A user will more be  interested  in  the
              sizes than in the types.

       --list_ignored_options
              List  all ignored cdrecord options. The &quot;-&quot; options cannot be used
              as addresses of track sources. No track source address  may  begin
              with  a  text  equal  to  an option which ends by &quot;=&quot;. The list is
              ended by an empty line.

       --long_toc
              Like option -toc but marking each session start by a line  &quot;first:
              X last: Y&quot; and each session end by &quot;track:lout ...&quot;.

       --no_rc
              Only  if  used as first command line argument this option prevents
              reading and interpretation of eventual startup files. See  section
              FILES below.

       --prodvd_cli_compatible
              Activates  behavior  modifications  with some DVD situations which
              bring cdrskin nearer to the behavior of cdrecord-ProDVD:
              Option -multi with unsuitable media is not an error but simply has
              no effect.
              Options  blank=fast  and  blank=all  deformat overwriteable DVD-RW
              media.
              Option blank=fast does indeed minmal blanking  with  DVD-RW.  This
              may  yield media which can only do DAO but not Incremental Stream&#8208;
              ing.

       --single_track
              Accept only the last argument of the command line as track  source
              address.

       stdio_sync=on|off|number
              Set the number of bytes after which to force output to drives with
              prefix &quot;stdio:&quot;. This forcing keeps the memory from being  clogged
              with  lots  of  pending data for slow devices. Default &quot;on&quot; is the
              same as &quot;16m&quot;.  Forced output can be disabled by &quot;off&quot;.

       stream_recording=on|off|number
              By setting &quot;on&quot; request that compliance to the desired speed  set&#8208;
              ting  is  preferred  over management of write errors. With DVD-RAM
              and BD this can bring effective write speed near  to  the  nominal
              write  speed of the media.  But it will also disable the automatic
              use of replacement blocks if write errors occur. It might as  well
              be disliked or ignored by the drive.
              If  a number is given, then error management stays enabled for all
              byte addresses below that number. Any number below 16s is the same
              as &quot;off&quot;.

       tao_to_sao_tsize=size
              Set an exact fixed size for the next track to be in effect only if
              the track source cannot deliver a size prediction  and  no  tsize=
              was  specified  and  an exact track size prediction is demanded by
              the write mode.
              This was the fallback from bad old times when cdrskin  was  unable
              to  burn in mode -tao . It came back with minimally blanked DVD-RW
              which allow no Incremental Streaming (-tao) resp. with  explicitly
              selected write mode -sao for best DVD-ROM compatibility.
              If  the  track  source delivers less bytes than announced then the
              missing ones will be filled with zeros.

       --tell_media_space
              Prepare a recording session, do not perform it but rather  inquire
              the  maximum  number of 2048 byte data blocks which may be written
              in the current state of media with the  prepared  setup.  So  this
              option disables recording of data. It does allow blanking, though,
              and will measure space afterwards.
              It is not mandatory to give track sources  but  their  nature  may
              influence  the  available  capacity. So for most realistic results
              one may set up the full burn session and  add  --tell_media_space.
              But if one has to expect a cdrskin version prior to 0.3.3 no track
              source should be given in order not to start an  involuntary  burn
              session.  In this case set at least -sao or -tao explicitly.
              The result gets printed to standard output. It is 0 or empty if no
              writing is possible with the given options.  This option redirects
              to  stderr  all  message  output  except its own result string and
              eventual output of -msinfo.

       --two_channel
              Indicate for subsequent tracks that they were  mastered  with  two
              channels.

       write_start_address=byte_offset
              Set  the  address  on media where to start writing the track. With
              DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or BD-RE byte_offset must  be  aligned  to  2  kiB
              blocks,  but  better  is  32 kiB.  With DVD-RW 32 kiB alignment is
              mandatory.
              Other media are not suitable for this option yet.

       Alphabetical list of options which are only  intended  for  very  special
       situations and not for  normal use:
&#12;       --abort_handler
              Establish  default  signal  handling  not to leave a drive in busy
              state but rather to shut it down and to wait until  it  has  ended
              the  final  operations.   This  option is only needed for revoking
              eventual --ignore_signals or --no_abort_handler.

       --allow_untested_media
              Enable the use of media profiles which have been  implemented  but
              not yet tested. Currently this option is without effect because no
              media types are under test reservation.
              (If you really test experimental media,  then  please  report  the
              outcome on libburn-hackers@pykix.org)

       --cdtext_dummy
              Prepare a burn run, report the effective array of CD-TEXT packs to
              stdout, and then end the program run without starting to burn  the
              session.   A  blank  CD-R or CD-RW has to be present in the drive,
              nevertheless.
              The output is formatted  in  lines  which  describe  18  bytes  as
              2-digit  hex  numbers or as single printable characters.  See lib&#8208;
              burn document doc/cdtext.txt about the format of these records.

       --cdtext_verbose
              Like --cdtext_dummy but without preventing the burn  run.  Combin&#8208;
              able  with option -dummy to exercise a CD burn run with no persis&#8208;
              tent impact on the medium.

       dev_translation=&lt;sep&gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;to&gt;
              Set drive address alias. This was necessary  before  cdrskin-0.2.4
              to manually translate cdrecord addresses into cdrskin addresses.
              &lt;sep&gt;  is  a  single  character which may not occur in the address
              string &lt;from&gt;. &lt;from&gt; is an address as expected to be given by the
              user via option dev=. &lt;to&gt; is the address to be used instead when&#8208;
              ever &lt;from&gt; is given.  More than one translation  instruction  can
              be given in one cdrskin run.
              E.g.:       dev_translation=+ATA:1,0,0+/dev/sr1       dev_transla&#8208;
              tion=+ATA:1,1,0+/dev/sr2

       --drive_abort_on_busy
              Linux specific: Abort process if a busy drive is encountered.

       --drive_blocking
              Linux specific: Try to wait for a busy drive to become free.  This
              is  not guaranteed to work with all drivers. Some need nonblocking
              i/o.

       --drive_f_setlk
              Linux specific: Try to get exclusive lock on drive device file via
              fcntl(2).

       --drive_not_exclusive
              Linux      specific:      Combine      --drive_not_f_setlk     and
              --drive_not_o_excl.

       --drive_not_f_setlk
              Linux specific: Do not try to get exclusive lock on  drive  device
              file via fcntl(2).

       --drive_not_o_excl
              Linux specific: Do not ask the operating system to prevent opening
              busy drives.  Wether this leads to senseful  behavior  depends  on
              operating system and kernel.

       drive_scsi_dev_family=sr|scd|sg
              Linux specific: Select a SCSI device file family to be scanned for
              by options --devices, --device_links and -scanbus.  Normally  this
              is  /dev/sgN  on  kernel versions &lt; 2.6 and /dev/srN on kernels &gt;=
              2.6 . This option allows to explicitly override  that  default  in
              order  to  meet  other  programs  at a common device file for each
              drive.  On kernel 2.4 families sr and scd will find no drives.
              Device file family /dev/hdX on kernel &gt;= 2.6 is  not  affected  by
              this setting.

       --drive_scsi_exclusive
              Linux  specific: Try to exclusively reserve device files /dev/srN,
              /dev/scdM, /dev/sgK of drives.  This would be helpful  to  protect
              against  collisions  with program growisofs.  Regrettably on Linux
              kernel 2.4 with ide-scsi emulation this seems not to work.  Wether
              it becomes helpful with new Linux systems has to be evaluated.

       --fifo_disable
              Disable fifo despite any fs=.

       --fifo_per_track
              Use a separate fifo for each track.

       --fill_up_media
              Expand  the last track of the session to occupy all remaining free
              space on the media.
              This option overrides option -multi. It will not fill up media  if
              option -sao is given with CD media.
              Caution:  With multi-session media this option might increase rea&#8208;
              datibility on DVD-ROM drives but with some DVD recorders and media
              types  it  might also fail to produce readable media at all. &quot;Your
              mileage may vary&quot;.
              You can expect the best possible read compatibility if you do  not
              use -multi at all.

       grab_drive_and_wait=seconds
              Open  the  addressed  drive,  wait  the  given  number of seconds,
              release the drive, and do normal work as indicated  by  the  other
              options  used.  This  option helps to explore the program behavior
              when faced with busy drives. Just  start  a  second  cdrskin  with
              option --devices while grab_drive_and_wait= is still active.

       --ignore_signals
              Try  to  ignore any signals rather than to abort the program. This
              is not a very good idea. You might end up waiting a very long time
              for cdrskin to finish.

       modesty_on_drive=&lt;mode&gt;[:min_percent=&lt;num&gt;][:max_percent=&lt;num&gt;]
              Mode  1 keeps the program from trying to write to the burner drive
              while its buffer is in danger to be filled by more  than  max_per&#8208;
              cent. If this filling is exceeded then the program will wait until
              the filling is at most min_percent.
              This can ease the load on operating system  and  drive  controller
              and  thus  help  with achieving better input bandwidth if disk and
              burner are not on independent  controllers  (like  hda  and  hdb).
              Unsufficient  input bandwidth is indicated by output &quot;(fifo  xy%)&quot;
              of option -v  if  xy  is  lower  than  90  for  some  time.   mod&#8208;
              esty_on_drive=  might  hamper  output  bandwidth  and cause buffer
              underruns.
              To have max_percent larger than the burner&apos;s  best  actual  buffer
              fill has the same effect as min_percent==max_percent. Some burners
              do not use their full buffer with all media  types.  Watch  output
              &quot;[buf xy%]&quot; of option -v to get an impression of the actual buffer
              usage. Some burners are not suitable because  they  report  buffer
              fill with granularity too large in size or time.
              Mode  0 disables this feature. Mode -1 keeps it unchanged. Default
              is:
              modesty_on_drive=0:min_percent=65:max_percent=95
              Percentages are permissible in the range of 25 to 100.

       --no_abort_handler
              On signals exit even if the drive is in busy state. This is not  a
              very  good  idea. You might end up with a stuck drive that refuses
              to hand out the media.

       --no_blank_appendable
              Refuse to blank appendable CD-RW or DVD-RW. This is a feature that
              was  once  builtin with libburn. No information available for what
              use case it was needed.

       --no_convert_fs_adr
              Do only literal translations of dev=. This prevents  cdrskin  from
              test-opening  device  files  in order to find one that matches the
              given dev= specifier.
              Partly Linux specific: Such opening is needed  for  Bus,Target,Lun
              addresses unless option --old_pseudo_scsi_adr is given. It is also
              needed to resolve device file addresses which are not listed  with
              cdrskin  --devices but nevertheless point to a usable drive. (Like
              /dev/sg0 using the same SCSI address as /dev/sr0.)

       --old_pseudo_scsi_adr
              Linux specific: Use and report  literal  Bus,Target,Lun  addresses
              rather  than  real  SCSI  and pseudo ATA addresses. This method is
              outdated and was never compatible with original cdrecord.

       sao_postgap=off|number
              Define whether a post-gap shall be written at the end of the track
              and  how many sectors this gap shall have. A post-gap occupies the
              range of an additional index of the track. It contains  zeros.  No
              bytes from the track source will be read for writing the post-gap.
              This setting affects only CD SAO write runs.

       sao_pregap=off|number
              Define whether a pre-gap shall be written before the track and how
              many sectors this pre-gap shall have. A pre-gap is written in  the
              range  of track index 0 and contains zeros resp. silence. No bytes
              from the track source will be read for writing the pre-gap.
              This setting affects only CD SAO write runs.
              The first track automatically gets a pre-gap of at least 150  sec&#8208;
              tors. Its size can only be enlarged by this call.

       --xa1-ignore
              Silently  interpret option -xa1 as -data. This may be necessary if
              a frontent does not prepare -xa1  block  headers  but  insists  in
              using option -xa1.

EXAMPLES
   Get an overview of drives and their addresses:
       cdrskin -scanbus
       cdrskin dev=ATA -scanbus
       cdrskin --device_links

   Get info about a particular drive or loaded media:
       cdrskin dev=0,1,0 -checkdrive
       cdrskin dev=ATA:1,0,0 -v -atip
       cdrskin dev=/dev/hdc -minfo

   Prepare CD-RW or DVD-RW for re-use, DVD-RAM or BD-RE for first use:
       cdrskin -v dev=/dev/sg1 blank=as_needed -eject

   Format DVD-RW to avoid need for blanking before re-use:
       cdrskin -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=format_overwrite

   De-format DVD-RW to make it capable of multi-session again:
       cdrskin -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=deformat_sequential

   Write ISO-9660 filesystem image as only one to blank or formatted media:
       cdrskin -v dev=/dev/hdc speed=12 fs=8m \
       blank=as_needed -eject padsize=300k my_image.iso

   Write compressed afio archive on-the-fly (not possible with minimally blanked
       DVD-RW or DVD-R DL):
       find . | afio -oZ - | \
       cdrskin -v dev=0,1,0 fs=32m speed=8 \
       blank=as_needed padsize=300k -

   Write multi-session to the same CD, DVD-R[W], DVD+R[/DL], or BD-R:
       cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v padsize=300k -multi 1.iso
       cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v padsize=300k -multi 2.iso
       cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v padsize=300k -multi 3.iso
       cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v padsize=300k 4.iso

   Get multi-session info for option -C of program mkisofs:
       c_values=$(cdrskin dev=/dev/hdc -msinfo 2&gt;/dev/null)
       mkisofs ... -C &quot;$c_values&quot; ...

   Inquire free space on media for a -multi run:
       x=$(cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -multi \
       --tell_media_space 2&gt;/dev/null)
       echo &quot;Available: $x blocks of 2048 data bytes&quot;

   Write audio tracks to CD:
       cdrskin -v dev=ATA:1,0,0 speed=48 -sao \
       track1.wav track2.au -audio -swab track3.raw

FILES
   Startup files:
       If not --no_rc is given as the first argument then  cdrskin  attempts  on
       startup to read the arguments from the following files:

       /etc/default/cdrskin
       /etc/opt/cdrskin/rc
       /etc/cdrskin/cdrskin.conf
       $HOME/.cdrskinrc

       The  files  are  read  in  the  sequence given above, but none of them is
       required for cdrskin to function properly. Each readable line is  treated
       as  one  single argument. No extra blanks.  A first character &apos;#&apos; marks a
       comment, empty lines are ignored.
       Example content of a startup file:
       # This is the default device
       dev=0,1,0
       # Some more options
       fifo_start_at=0
       fs=16m

   Disabling superuser safety precautions:
       The superuser is normally banned from using any other emulated drive  but
       /dev/null. This ban can be lifted by the existence of file

       /root/cdrskin_permissions/allow_emulated_drives

       where  the directory must be owned by the superuser and must not offer w-
       permissions for group or others.
       Warning: Superusers must take care not to spoil their hard disk  via  its
       raw block device (like stdio:/dev/hda or stdio:/dev/sd0).
