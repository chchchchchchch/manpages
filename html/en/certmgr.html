NAME
       certmgr - Mono Certificate Manager (CLI version)

SYNOPSIS
       certmgr [action] [object type] [options] store [filename] or certmgr -ssl
       [options] url

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allow to list, add, remove or extract certificates, certificate
       revocation  lists  (CRL)  or certificate trust lists (CTL) to/from a cer&#8208;
       tificate store. Certificate stores are used to build  and  validate  cer&#8208;
       tificate  chains  for  Authenticode(r)  code  signing  validation and SSL
       server certificates.

ACTIONS
       -list  List the certificates, CTL or CTL in the specified store.

       -add   Add a certificate, CRL or CTL to specified store. If filename it&apos;s
              a  pkcs12  or  pfx file, and it contains a private key, it will be
              imported to local key pair container.

       -del   Remove a certificate, CRL or CTL from specified  store.  You  must
              specify  the  object to be removed with it&apos;s hash value (and not a
              filename). This hash value is shown when  doing  a  -list  on  the
              store.

       -put   Copy a certificate, CRL or CTL from a store to a file.

       -ssl   Download  and  add  the certificates from a SSL session. You&apos;ll be
              asked to confirm the addition of every certificate  received  from
              the  server.  Note that SSL/TLS protocols do not requires a server
              to send the root certificate.  This action assume  an  certificate
              (-c)  object  type and will import the certificates in appropriate
              stores (i.e. server certificate in the OtherPeople store, the root
              certificate  in  the  Trust store, any other intermediate certifi&#8208;
              cates in the IntermediateCA store).

       -importKey
              Allows importing a private key from a pkcs12 file into a local key
              pair store. (Usefull when you already have the key&apos;s corresponding
              certificate installed at the specific store.)


OBJECT TYPES
       -c , -cert , -certificate
              Add, Delete or  Put  certificates.  That  is  the  specified  file
              must/will contains X.509 certificates in DER binary encoding.

       -crl   Add, Delete or Put certificate revocation lists (CRL). That is the
              specified file must/will contains X.509 CRL in DER  binary  encod&#8208;
              ing.

       -ctl   Add, Delete or Put certificate trust lists (CRL). UNSUPPORTED.


OPTIONS
       -m     Use  the  machine&apos;s  certificate  stores  (instead  of the default
              user&apos;s stores).

       -v     More details displayed on the console.

       -p password
              Use the specify password when accessing a pkcs12 file.

FILES
       WARNING: This details the current  behavior  of  Mono  and  could  change
       between  releases.  The only safe way to interact with certificate stores
       is to use the certmgr tool. The current releases of Mono  keeps  all  the
       user   certificate   stores   in   separates  directories  under  ~/.con&#8208;
       fig/.mono/certs/

       For example the trusted root certificates for a user would be kept under
              ~/.config/.mono/certs/Trust/

       Certificates files are kept in DER (binary) format (extension .cer).

       The filenames either starts with
              tbp (thumbprint) or ski (subject key identifier).

       The rest of the filename is the base64-encoded value (tbp or ski).

       Private key data is stored under
              ~/.config/.mono/keypairs/


EXAMPLES
       mono certmgr.exe -list -c -m Trust
              List all certificates in the machine Trust store. This  will  dis&#8208;
              play  the  hash value for each certificate. This value can be used
              to identify uniquely  a  certificate  for  some  operations  (e.g.
              delete).              E.g.               Unique              Hash:
              FFA3AC0084DA1673B5A031EBB2156B3E8FBBF6D8

       mono         certmgr.exe         -del         -c         -m         Trust
       FFA3AC0084DA1673B5A031EBB2156B3E8FBBF6D8
              Remove  the  certificate,  represented by the hash value, from the
              machine Trust store. Note  that  the  machine  store  is  normally
              restricted. The following error message will appear if the current
              user doesn&apos;t have the minimum access rights to remove the certifi&#8208;
              cate:  Access  to  the  machine &apos;Trust&apos; certificate store has been
              denied.

       certmgr -ssl https://www.verisign.com
              Import certificates from www.verisign.com used for HTTP over  SSL.
              See    KNOWN    ISSUES    (MD2)   if   you&apos;re   downloading   from
              www.verisign.com.

       certmgr -ssl ldaps://www.nldap.com:636
              Import the certificates from www.nldap.com used for  secure  LDAP.
              This works even if we don&apos;t know how to speak LDAP because we stop
              the communication shortly after the SSL handshake (which gives  us
              the certificate).


KNOWN ISSUES
       MD2    Some  Certificate  Authorities  (CA) old root certificates use the
              MD2 hash algorithm. MD2 is old enough not to be part of the  stan&#8208;
              dard .NET framework.  This makes it impossible to validate a digi&#8208;
              tal signature made with MD2. For this reason MD2  is  included  in
              the  Mono.Security.dll  assembly.  However the machine.config file
              must be updated so the OID for MD2 is known at runtime.

              To correct this insert the following XML snippet inside the  &lt;con&#8208;
              figuration&gt; element of your machine.config file.
