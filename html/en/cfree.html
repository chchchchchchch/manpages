CFREE(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   CFREE(3)



NAME
       cfree - free allocated memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       /* In SunOS 4 */
       int cfree(void *ptr);

       /* In glibc or FreeBSD libcompat */
       void cfree(void *ptr);

       /* In SCO OpenServer */
       void cfree(char *ptr, unsigned num, unsigned size);

       /* In Solaris watchmalloc.so.1 */
       void cfree(void *ptr, size_t nelem, size_t elsize);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       cfree(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       This function should never be used.  Use free(3) instead.

   1-arg cfree
       In  glibc, the function cfree() is a synonym for free(3), &quot;added for com&#8208;
       patibility with SunOS&quot;.

       Other systems have other functions with this name.   The  declaration  is
       sometimes in &lt;stdlib.h&gt; and sometimes in &lt;malloc.h&gt;.

   3-arg cfree
       Some  SCO  and  Solaris  versions have malloc libraries with a 3-argument
       cfree(), apparently as an analog to calloc(3).

       If you need it while porting something, add

           #define cfree(p, n, s) free((p))

       to your file.

       A frequently asked question is &quot;Can I use free(3) to  free  memory  allo&#8208;
       cated with calloc(3), or do I need cfree()?&quot;  Answer: use free(3).

       An  SCO  manual  writes: &quot;The cfree routine is provided for compliance to
       the iBCSe2 standard and simply calls free.  The num and size arguments to
       cfree are not used.&quot;

RETURN VALUE
       The  SunOS  version of cfree() (which is a synonym for free(3)) returns 1
       on success and 0 on failure.  In case of error, errno is set  to  EINVAL:
       the value of ptr was not a pointer to a block previously allocated by one
       of the routines in the malloc(3) family.

CONFORMING TO
       The 3-argument version of cfree() as used by SCO conforms to  the  iBCSe2
       standard: Intel386 Binary Compatibility Specification, Edition 2.
