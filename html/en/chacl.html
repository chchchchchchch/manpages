CHACL(1)                      Access Control Lists                      CHACL(1)



NAME
       chacl - change the access control list of a file or directory

SYNOPSIS
       chacl acl pathname...
       chacl -b acl dacl pathname...
       chacl -d dacl pathname...
       chacl -R pathname...
       chacl -D pathname...
       chacl -B pathname...
       chacl -l pathname...
       chacl -r pathname...

DESCRIPTION
       chacl is an IRIX-compatibility command, and is maintained for those users
       who are familiar with its use from either XFS or IRIX.  Refer to the  SEE
       ALSO  section below for a description of tools which conform more closely
       to the (withdrawn draft) POSIX 1003.1e standard  which  describes  Access
       Control Lists (ACLs).

       chacl  changes  the ACL(s) for a file or directory.  The ACL(s) specified
       are applied to each file in the pathname arguments.

       Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the acl_from_text(3) rou&#8208;
       tine.  These strings are made up of comma separated clauses each of which
       is of the form, tag:name:perm.  Where tag can be:

       &quot;user&quot; (or &quot;u&quot;)
              indicating that the entry is a user ACL entry.

       &quot;group&quot; (or &quot;g&quot;)
              indicating that the entry is a group ACL entry.

       &quot;other&quot; (or &quot;o&quot;)
              indicating that the entry is an other ACL entry.

       &quot;mask&quot; (or &quot;m&quot;)
              indicating that the entry is a mask ACL entry.

       name is a string which is the user or group name for the  ACL  entry.   A
       null  name  in  a  user  or group ACL entry indicates the file&apos;s owner or
       file&apos;s group.  perm is the string &quot;rwx&quot; where each of the entries may  be
       replaced  by  a &quot;-&quot; indicating no access of that type, e.g. &quot;r-x&quot;, &quot;--x&quot;,
       &quot;---&quot;.

OPTIONS
       -b     Indicates that there are two ACLs to change, the first is the file
              access ACL and the second the directory default ACL.

       -d     Used to set only the default ACL of a directory.

       -R     Removes the file access ACL only.

       -D     Removes directory default ACL only.

       -B     Remove all ACLs.

       -l     Lists  the access ACL and possibly the default ACL associated with
              the specified files or directories.  This option was added  during
              the Linux port of XFS, and is not IRIX compatible.

       -r     Set  the  access  ACL recursively for each subtree rooted at path&#8208;
              name(s).  This option was also added during the Linux port of XFS,
              and is not compatible with IRIX.

EXAMPLES
       A minimum ACL:

         chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-- file

       The  file ACL is set so that the file&apos;s owner has &quot;rwx&quot;, the file&apos;s group
       has read and execute, and others have read only access to the file.

       An ACL that is not a minimum ACL, that is, one that specifies a  user  or
       group  other  than the file&apos;s owner or owner&apos;s group, must contain a mask
       entry:

         chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r--,u:bob:r--,m::r-x file1 file2

       To set the default and access ACLs on newdir to be the same as on olddir,
       you could type:

         chacl -b `chacl -l olddir | \
             sed -e &apos;s/.*\[//&apos; -e &apos;s#/# #&apos; -e &apos;s/]$//&apos;` newdir

CAUTIONS
       chacl  can  replace the existing ACL.  To add or delete entries, you must
       first do chacl -l to get the existing ACL, and use the output to form the
       arguments to chacl.

       Changing  the  permission  bits of a file will change the file access ACL
       settings  (see  chmod(1)).   However,  file  creation  mode  masks   (see
       umask(1))  will not affect the access ACL settings of files created using
       directory default ACLs.

       ACLs are filesystem extended  attributes  and  hence  are  not  typically
       archived  or  restored  using  the conventional archiving utilities.  See
       attr(5) for more information about extended attributes and see xfsdump(8)
       for a method of backing them up under XFS.
