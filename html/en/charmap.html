CHARMAP(5)                      Linux User Manual                     CHARMAP(5)



NAME
       charmap - character symbols to define character encodings

DESCRIPTION
       A  character  set description (charmap) defines a character set of avail&#8208;
       able characters and their encodings.  All supported character sets should
       have the portable character set as a proper subset.

   Syntax
       The  charmap file starts with a header, that may consist of the following
       keywords:

       &lt;codeset&gt;
              is followed by the name of the codeset.

       &lt;mb_cur_max&gt;
              is followed by the max number of bytes for a  multibyte-character.
              Multibyte  characters  are  currently  not supported.  The default
              value is 1.

       &lt;mb_cur_min&gt;
              is followed by the min number of  bytes  for  a  character.   This
              value must be less or equal than mb_cur_max.  If not specified, it
              defaults to mb_cur_max.

       &lt;escape_char&gt;
              is followed by a character that should be used as the escape-char&#8208;
              acter  for  the rest of the file to mark characters that should be
              interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the backslash ( \ ).

       &lt;comment_char&gt;
              is followed by a character that will be used as the  comment-char&#8208;
              acter  for the rest of the file.  It defaults to the number sign (
              # ).

       The charmap-definition itself starts with the keyword CHARMAP  in  column
       1.

       The following lines may have one of the two following forms to define the
       character-encodings:

       &lt;symbolic-name&gt; &lt;encoding&gt; &lt;comments&gt;
              This form defines exactly one character and its encoding.

       &lt;symbolic-name&gt;...&lt;symbolic-name&gt; &lt;encoding&gt; &lt;comments&gt;
              This form defines a couple of characters.  This is only useful for
              multibyte-characters, which are currently not implemented.

       The last line in a charmap-definition file must contain END CHARMAP.

   Symbolic Names
       A  symbolic name for a character contains only characters of the portable
       character set.  The name  itself  is  enclosed  between  angle  brackets.
       Characters  following  an  &lt;escape_char&gt;  are  interpreted as itself; for
       example, the sequence &lt;\\\&gt;&gt; represents the symbolic name \&gt; enclosed  in
       angle brackets.

   Character Encoding
       The encoding may be in each of the following three forms:

       &lt;escape_char&gt;d&lt;number&gt;
              with a decimal number
&#12;       &lt;escape_char&gt;x&lt;number&gt;
              with a hexadecimal number

       &lt;escape_char&gt;&lt;number&gt;
              with an octal number.

FILES
       /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/*

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2.
