CHATTR(1)                                                              CHATTR(1)



NAME
       chattr - change file attributes on a Linux file system

SYNOPSIS
       chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ mode ] files...

DESCRIPTION
       chattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.

       The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[acdeijstuACDST].

       The operator `+&apos; causes the selected attributes to be added to the exist&#8208;
       ing attributes of the files; `-&apos; causes  them  to  be  removed;  and  `=&apos;
       causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.

       The  letters  `acdeijstuACDST&apos;  select  the new attributes for the files:
       append only  (a),  compressed  (c),  no  dump  (d),  extent  format  (e),
       immutable (i), data journalling (j), secure deletion (s), no tail-merging
       (t), undeletable (u), no atime updates (A), no copy on  write  (C),  syn&#8208;
       chronous  directory  updates  (D),  synchronous  updates  (S), and top of
       directory hierarchy (T).

       The following attributes are read-only, and may be  listed  by  lsattr(1)
       but not modified by chattr: huge file (h), compression error (E), indexed
       directory (I), compression raw access (X), and compressed dirty file (Z).

OPTIONS
       -R     Recursively change attributes of directories and their contents.

       -V     Be verbose with chattr&apos;s output and print the program version.

       -f     Suppress most error messages.

       -v version
              Set the file&apos;s version/generation number.

ATTRIBUTES
       When a file with the &apos;A&apos; attribute set is accessed, its atime  record  is
       not  modified.   This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for laptop sys&#8208;
       tems.

       A file with the `a&apos; attribute set can only be open  in  append  mode  for
       writing.     Only   the   superuser   or   a   process   possessing   the
       CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.

       A file with the `c&apos; attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk
       by the kernel.  A read from this file returns uncompressed data.  A write
       to this file compresses data before storing  them  on  the  disk.   Note:
       please  make  sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of
       this document.

       A file with the &apos;C&apos; attribute set will not be  subject  to  copy-on-write
       updates.  This flag is only supported on file systems which perform copy-
       on-write.  (Note: For btrfs, the &apos;C&apos; flag should be set on new  or  empty
       files.  If it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it is unde&#8208;
       fined when the blocks assigned to the file will be fully stable.  If  the
       &apos;C&apos;  flag is set on a directory, it will have no effect on the directory,
       but new files created in that directory will the No_COW attribute.)

       When a directory with the `D&apos; attribute set is modified, the changes  are
       written  synchronously  on  the disk; this is equivalent to the `dirsync&apos;
       mount option applied to a subset of the files.

       A file with the `d&apos; attribute set is not candidate for  backup  when  the
       dump(8) program is run.

       The  &apos;E&apos;  attribute  is  used  by the experimental compression patches to
       indicate that a compressed file has a compression error.  It may  not  be
       set or reset using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).

       The  &apos;e&apos;  attribute  indicates that the file is using extents for mapping
       the blocks on disk.  It may not be removed using chattr(1).

       The &apos;I&apos; attribute is used by the htree code to indicate that a  directory
       is  being  indexed  using hashed trees.  It may not be set or reset using
       chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).

       The &apos;h&apos; attribute indicates the file is storing its blocks  in  units  of
       the  filesystem  blocksize instead of in units of sectors, and means that
       the file is (or at one time was) larger than 2TB.  It may not be  set  or
       reset using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).

       A file with the `i&apos; attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
       renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can  be  written
       to   the   file.    Only  the  superuser  or  a  process  possessing  the
       CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.

       A file with the `j&apos; attribute has all of its data  written  to  the  ext3
       journal  before  being  written  to the file itself, if the filesystem is
       mounted with the &quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot;  options.   When  the
       filesystem  is  mounted  with  the &quot;data=journal&quot; option all file data is
       already journalled and this attribute has no effect.  Only the  superuser
       or  a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or clear
       this attribute.

       When a file with the `s&apos; attribute set is deleted, its blocks are  zeroed
       and  written  back  to the disk.  Note: please make sure to read the bugs
       and limitations section at the end of this document.

       When a file with the `S&apos; attribute set is modified, the changes are writ&#8208;
       ten  synchronously  on  the  disk; this is equivalent to the `sync&apos; mount
       option applied to a subset of the files.

       A directory with the &apos;T&apos; attribute will be deemed to be the top of direc&#8208;
       tory  hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block allocator.  This is
       a hint to the block allocator used by ext3 and ext4 that the  subdirecto&#8208;
       ries  under  this  directory  are  not related, and thus should be spread
       apart for allocation purposes.   For example it is a very  good  idea  to
       set  the  &apos;T&apos;  attribute  on  the /home directory, so that /home/john and
       /home/mary are placed into separate block groups.  For directories  where
       this  attribute  is  not set, the Orlov block allocator will try to group
       subdirectories closer together where possible.

       A file with the &apos;t&apos; attribute will not have a partial block  fragment  at
       the  end of the file merged with other files (for those filesystems which
       support tail-merging).  This is necessary for applications such  as  LILO
       which  read  the  filesystem  directly,  and which don&apos;t understand tail-
       merged files.  Note: As of this writing, the ext2 or ext3 filesystems  do
       not (yet, except in very experimental patches) support tail-merging.

       When  a  file  with  the  `u&apos;  attribute set is deleted, its contents are
       saved.  This allows the user to ask for  its  undeletion.   Note:  please
       make  sure  to  read  the bugs and limitations section at the end of this
       document.

       The &apos;X&apos; attribute is used by  the  experimental  compression  patches  to
       indicate  that  a  raw  contents  of  a  compressed  file can be accessed
       directly.  It currently may not be set or reset using chattr(1), although
       it can be displayed by lsattr(1).

       The  &apos;Z&apos;  attribute  is  used  by the experimental compression patches to
       indicate a compressed file is dirty.  It may not be set  or  reset  using
       chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).

AUTHOR
       chattr  was  written by Remy Card &lt;Remy.Card@linux.org&gt;.  It is currently
       being maintained by Theodore Ts&apos;o &lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       The `c&apos;, &apos;s&apos;,  and `u&apos; attributes are not honored by the  ext2  and  ext3
       filesystems as implemented in the current mainline Linux kernels.

       The `j&apos; option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted as ext3.

       The `D&apos; option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.

AVAILABILITY
       chattr   is   part  of  the  e2fsprogs  package  and  is  available  from
       http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net.
