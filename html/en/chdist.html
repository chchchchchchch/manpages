CHDIST(1)                                                              CHDIST(1)



NAME
       chdist - script to easily play with several distributions

SYNOPSIS
       chdist [options] [command] [command parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       chdist is a rewrite of what used to be known as &apos;MultiDistroTools&apos; (or
       mdt). Its use is to create &apos;APT trees&apos; for several distributions, making
       it easy to query the status of packages in other distribution without
       using chroots, for instance.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Provide a usage message.

       -d, --data-dir DIR
           Choose data directory (default: $HOME/.chdist/).

       -a, --arch ARCH
           Choose architecture (default: `dpkg --print-architecture`).

       --version
           Display version information.
