CHECK-REGEXP(1)                   User Commands                  CHECK-REGEXP(1)



NAME
       check-regexp -  test regular expressions from the command line

SYNOPSIS
       check-regexp &apos;regular expression&apos; &apos;string1&apos; &apos;string2&apos; ...

DESCRIPTION
       check-regexp (GNU Source-highlight)

       You simply pass as the first command line argument the regular expression
       and then the strings you want to try to match.
       It is crucial, in order to avoid shell substitutions, to enclose both the
       expression and the strings in single quotes.

       The  program  then  prints some information about the possibly successful
       matching.
       In the output the what[0]  part  represents  the  whole  match,  and  the
       what[i] part represents the i-th marked subexpression that matched.

       The program also prints possible prefix and suffix.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;).  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit
