CHECKBASHISMS(1)                                                CHECKBASHISMS(1)



NAME
       checkbashisms - check for bashisms in /bin/sh scripts

SYNOPSIS
       checkbashisms script ...
       checkbashisms --help|--version

DESCRIPTION
       checkbashisms,  based  on one of the checks from the lintian system, per&#8208;
       forms basic checks on /bin/sh shell scripts for the possible presence  of
       bashisms.   It  takes the names of the shell scripts on the command line,
       and outputs warnings if possible bashisms are detected.

       Note that the definition of a bashism in this context roughly equates  to
       &quot;a  shell  feature  that  is not required to be supported by POSIX&quot;; this
       means that some issues flagged may be permitted under  optional  sections
       of POSIX, such as XSI or User Portability.

       In cases where POSIX and Debian Policy disagree, checkbashisms by default
       allows extensions permitted by Policy but may also  provide  options  for
       stricter checking.

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
              Show a summary of options.

       --newline, -n
              Check for &quot;echo -n&quot; usage (non POSIX but required by Debian Policy
              10.4.)

       --posix, -p
              Check for issues which are non POSIX but required to be  supported
              by Debian Policy 10.4 (implies -n).

       --force, -f
              Force  each script to be checked, even if it would normally not be
              (for instance, it has a bash or non POSIX shell shebang or appears
              to be a shell wrapper).

       --extra, -x
              Highlight lines which, whilst they do not contain bashisms, may be
              useful in determining whether a particular issue is a false  posi&#8208;
              tive  which  may  be ignored.  For example, the use of &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot;
              may be preceded by checking whether &quot;$BASH&quot; is set.

       --version, -v
              Show version and copyright information.

EXIT VALUES
       The exit value will be 0 if no possible bashisms or other  problems  were
       detected.  Otherwise it will be the sum of the following error values:

       1      A possible bashism was detected.

       2      A  file  was  skipped for some reason, for example, because it was
              unreadable or not found.  The warning message will give details.

AUTHOR
       checkbashisms was originally written as a shell  script  by  Yann  Dirson
       &lt;dirson@debian.org&gt;  and  rewritten  in  Perl  with many more features by
       Julian Gilbey &lt;jdg@debian.org&gt;.
