DESCRIPTION
       chips is an Xorg driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.  The
       majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets  are  supported  by  this
       driver.  In general the limitation on the capabilities of this driver are
       determined by the chipset on which it is run. Where possible, this driver
       provides  full  acceleration  and supports the following depths: 1, 4, 8,
       15, 16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an 8+16 overlay  mode.  All  visual
       types  are  supported for depth 1, 4 and 8 and both TrueColor and Direct&#8208;
       Color visuals are supported where possible. Multi-head configurations are
       supported on PCI or AGP buses.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The  chips driver supports video processors on most of the bus types cur&#8208;
       rently available.  The chipsets supported fall into one of  three  archi&#8208;
       tectural  classes. A basic architecture, the WinGine architecture and the
       newer HiQV architecture.

       Basic Architecture

       The supported chipsets are ct65520, ct65525, ct65530,  ct65535,  ct65540,
       ct65545, ct65546 and ct65548

       Color  depths  1, 4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15,
       16 and 24 are supported  only  on  the  65540,  65545,  65546  and  65548
       chipsets.  The  driver  is accelerated when used with the 65545, 65546 or
       65548 chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.

       Wingine Architecture

       The supported chipsets are ct64200 and ct64300

       Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on both chipsets, while depths  15,
       16  and 24 are supported only on the 64300 chipsets. The driver is accel&#8208;
       erated when used with the 64300 chipsets, however the DirectColor  visual
       is not available.

       HiQV Architecture

       The  supported  chipsets  are ct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554, ct69000
       and ct69030

       Color depths 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and 8+16 are supported on all  chipsets.
       The  DirectColor  visual is supported on all color depths except the 8+16
       overlay mode. Full acceleration is supplied for all chipsets.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet names
       may optionally be specified in the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
       override the auto-detection:

           &quot;ct65520&quot;,  &quot;ct65525&quot;,  &quot;ct65530&quot;,  &quot;ct65535&quot;,  &quot;ct65540&quot;, &quot;ct65545&quot;,
           &quot;ct65546&quot;, &quot;ct65548&quot;,  &quot;ct65550&quot;,  &quot;ct65554&quot;,  &quot;ct65555&quot;,  &quot;ct68554&quot;,
           &quot;ct69000&quot;, &quot;ct69030&quot;, &quot;ct64200&quot;, &quot;ct64300&quot;.

       The  driver  will  auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chipsets.  But maybe overridden with the VideoRam  entry  in  the  config
       file &quot;Device&quot; section.

       The  following  driver  Options are supported, on one or more of the sup&#8208;
       ported chipsets:

       Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Set the colormap index used for the transparency key for the depth
              8 plane when operating in 8+16 overlay mode.  The value must be in
              the range 2-255.  Default: 255.

       Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;

              Default: undefined.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              off.

       Option &quot;SyncOnGreen&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable combining the sync signals with the  green  sig&#8208;
              nal.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;ShowCache&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable  viewing  offscreen memory. Used for debugging
              only Default: off.

       Option &quot;18bitBus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force the driver to assume that the flat panel has an  18bit  data
              bus.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;Crt2Memory&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              In a dual-head mode (69030 only) this option selects the amount of
              memory to set aside for the second head. If  not  specified,  half
              the memory is used.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;DualRefresh&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              The  69030  supports  independent refresh rates on its two display
              channels.  This mode of operations uses  additional  memory  band&#8208;
              width  and  thus  limits the maximum colour depth and refresh rate
              that can be achieved, and so is off by default.  Using this option
              forces  the use of an independent refresh rate on the two screens.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;FpMode&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              The driver probes the chip to find out if a flat  panel  (LCD)  is
              connected  and  active.  If  this  is  true it limits the possible
              screen size to the maximum resolution of the panel. The  chips  is
              initialized by the BIOS which may set the chip to &apos;dual&apos; mode even
              if no panel is connected. In this case the available resolution on
              the CRT is limited to the panel size the BIOS has set. To tell the
              driver that no panel is connected despite of what the BIOS is say&#8208;
              ing set this option to off. Don&apos;t set it to off if a panel is con&#8208;
              nected.  Default: value probed by BIOS.
