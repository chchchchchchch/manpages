CHMOD(1)                          User Commands                         CHMOD(1)



NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the
       file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be  either
       a  symbolic  representation of changes to make, or an octal number repre&#8208;
       senting the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic  mode  is  [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...],  where
       perms  is  either  zero  or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single
       letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated
       by commas.

       A  combination  of  the  letters ugoa controls which users&apos; access to the
       file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file&apos;s
       group (g), other users not in the file&apos;s group (o), or all users (a).  If
       none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits  that
       are set in the umask are not affected.

       The  operator  +  causes  the  selected file mode bits to be added to the
       existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and  =
       causes  them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except
       that a directory&apos;s unmentioned  set  user  and  group  ID  bits  are  not
       affected.

       The  letters  rwxXst  select  file mode bits for the affected users: read
       (r), write (w), execute (or search for directories)  (x),  execute/search
       only  if  the  file  is a directory or already has execute permission for
       some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion
       flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can
       specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions  granted  to  the
       user  who  owns  the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who
       are members of the file&apos;s group (g), and the permissions granted to users
       that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A  numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding
       up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are  assumed  to  be
       leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group
       ID (2) and restricted deletion or  sticky  (1)  attributes.   The  second
       digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write
       (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for  other  users  in
       the  file&apos;s  group,  with the same values; and the fourth for other users
       not in the file&apos;s group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the  chmod  system
       call  cannot  change  their permissions.  This is not a problem since the
       permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic
       link  listed  on  the  command line, chmod changes the permissions of the
       pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic  links  encountered
       during recursive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod  clears  the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file&apos;s group
       ID does not match the user&apos;s effective group ID or one of the user&apos;s sup&#8208;
       plementary  group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Addi&#8208;
       tional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and  set-group-ID  bits  of
       MODE  or  RFILE  to  be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and
       functionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt,  check
       the underlying system behavior.

       chmod  preserves  a  directory&apos;s set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless
       you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or  clear  the  bits  with
       symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but not clear) the bits
       with a numeric mode.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose  inter&#8208;
       pretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents unpriv&#8208;
       ileged users from removing or renaming a file  in  the  directory  unless
       they  own  the file or the directory; this is called the restricted dele&#8208;
       tion flag for the directory, and  is  commonly  found  on  world-writable
       directories  like /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit
       saves the program&apos;s text image on the swap device so it  will  load  more
       quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat `/&apos; specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on `/&apos;

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE&apos;s mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form `[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+&apos;.
