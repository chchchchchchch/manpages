CIFS.IDMAP(8)              System Administration tools             CIFS.IDMAP(8)



NAME
       cifs.idmap - Userspace helper for mapping ids for Common Internet File
       System (CIFS)

SYNOPSIS
       cifs.idmap [--version|-v] {keyid}

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.

       cifs.idmap is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client
       filesystem. There are a number of activities that the kernel cannot
       easily do itself. This program is a callout program that does these
       things for the kernel and then returns the result.

       cifs.idmap is generally intended to be run when the kernel calls
       request-key(8) for a particular key type. While it can be run directly
       from the command-line, it is not generally intended to be run that way.

       cifs.idmap works in conjuction with winbind facility of Samba suite to
       map owner and group SIDs to uids and gids respectively.  It is best
       utilized when
       - a mount option of cifsacl is specified when mounting a cifs share
       - winbind is specified as one of the search entries for passwd and group
       databases in file /etc/nsswitch.conf
       - file smb.conf has winbind specific entries
       - winbind daemon program is running

       In case winbind and cifs.idmap facilities are unavailable, file objects
       in a mounted share are assigned uid and gid of the credentials of the
       process that mounted the share. So it is strongly recomemended to use
       mount options of uid and gid to specify a default uid and gid to map
       owner SIDs and group SIDs respectively in case services of winbind and
       cifs.idmap facility are unavailable.

OPTIONS
       --version|-v
           Print version number and exit.

CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL
       cifs.idmap is designed to be called from the kernel via the request-key
       callout program. This requires that request-key be told where and how to
       call this program. Currently cifs.idmap handles a key type of:

       cifs.idmap
           This keytype is for mapping a SID to either an uid or a gid

       To make this program useful for CIFS, you will need to set up entry for
       it in request-key.conf(5). Here is an example of an entry for this key
       type:

           #OPERATION  TYPE           D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2...
           #=========  =============  = = ================================
           create      cifs.idmap     * * /usr/sbin/cifs.idmap %k

       See request-key.conf(5) for more info on each field.

NOTES
       Support for upcalls to cifs.idmap was initially introduced in the 3.0
       kernel.
