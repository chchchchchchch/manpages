NAME
       cilc - Mono CIL-to-C binding generator

SYNOPSIS
       cilc [options] assembly target

DESCRIPTION
       cilc  is  the Mono CIL-to-C binding generator. It takes a CIL assembly as
       input and generates a directory of C sources which, when  compiled,  pro&#8208;
       vide a C interface to the classes contained within that assembly by means
       of a shared object library.

       Generated sources make use of the Mono embedding  API.  Thus  a  complete
       Mono  development environment must be available on the development system
       and a complete Mono runtime environment must be available on target  sys&#8208;
       tems.
