NAME

SYNOPSIS
       ciptool [ options ] &lt; command &gt;

DESCRIPTION
       ciptool is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the CIP configuration of
       the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel.

OPTIONS
       -h     Gives a list of possible commands.

       -i &lt;hciX&gt; | &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              The command is applied to device hciX , which must be the name  or
              the  address  of  an installed Bluetooth device. If not specified,
              the command will be use the first available Bluetooth device.

COMMANDS
       show   Display information about the connected devices.

       search Search for Bluetooth devices and connect to first one that  offers
              CIP support.

       connect &lt;bdaddr&gt; [psm]
              Connect  the  local  device  to the remote Bluetooth device on the
              specified PSM number. If no PSM is specified, it will use the  SDP
              to retrieve it from the remote device.

       release [bdaddr]
              Release  a  connection  to  the  specific device. If no address is
              given and only one device is connected this will be released.

       loopback &lt;bdaddr&gt; [psm]
              Create a connection to the remote device  for  Bluetooth  testing.
              This  command  will  not  provide a CAPI controller, because it is
              only for testing the CAPI Message Transport Protocol.
