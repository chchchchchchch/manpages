CJET(1)                                                                  CJET(1)



NAME
       cjet - converts HP PCL to Canon CaPSL format

SYNOPSIS
       cjet [options]&lt;input.pcl&gt;output

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the cjet command.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does
       not have a manual page.

       cjet  converts  the  common  HP  PCL page description language to Canon&apos;s
       CaPSL, which was used in the mid-1990s by some Canon laser printers.   It
       is  normally  used  as part of a printer filter script, like the Foomatic
       system.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -f     Use full paint mode instead of partial paint mode.  This  requires
              the printer to have at least 1.5 MB of memory to work correctly.

       -p     Ignore  paper  size commands.  Useful for printing files formatted
              for paper size X on printers with paper size Y.

       -q     Quiet mode. Suppresses all warning messages.

       -x X   Shift output on paper by X dots horizontally. Positive values of X
              shift  to  the right; negative values to the left.  Dots are 1/300
              inch (0.085 mm).

       -y Y   Shift output on paper by Y dots vertically. Positive values  of  Y
              shift downwards; negative values shift upwards.
