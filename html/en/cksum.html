NAME
       cksum - Calculate a cksum(1) compatible checksum

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.2

       package require cksum  ?1.1.3?

       ::crc::cksum  ?-format format? ?-chunksize size? [ -channel chan | -file&#8208;
       name file | string ]

       ::crc::CksumInit

       ::crc::CksumUpdate token data

       ::crc::CksumFinal token

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a Tcl  implementation  of  the  cksum(1)  algorithm
       based upon information provided at in the GNU implementation of this pro&#8208;
       gram as part of the GNU Textutils 2.0 package.

COMMANDS
       ::crc::cksum ?-format format? ?-chunksize size? [ -channel chan |  -file&#8208;
       name file | string ]
              The  command  takes  string  data  or  a  channel or file name and
              returns a checksum value calculated using the cksum(1)  algorithm.
              The  result is formatted using the format(3tcl) specifier provided
              or as an unsigned integer (%u) by default.

OPTIONS
       -channel name
              Return a checksum for the data read from a  channel.  The  command
              will read data from the channel until the eof is true. If you need
              to be able to process events during this calculation see the  PRO&#8208;
              GRAMMING INTERFACE section

       -filename name
              This  is  a convenience option that opens the specified file, sets
              the encoding to binary and then acts as if the -channel option had
              been used. The file is closed on completion.

       -format string
              Return the checksum using an alternative format template.

PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
       The  cksum  package  implements  the checksum using a context variable to
       which additional data can be added at any time. This is expecially useful
       in  an  event  based environment such as a Tk application or a web server
       package. Data to be checksummed may be  handled  incrementally  during  a
       fileevent  handler  in  discrete chunks. This can improve the interactive
       nature of a GUI application and can help to avoid excessive  memory  con&#8208;
       sumption.

       ::crc::CksumInit
              Begins  a  new cksum context. Returns a token ID that must be used
              for the remaining functions. An optional seed may be specified  if
              required.

       ::crc::CksumUpdate token data
              Add  data to the checksum identified by token. Calling CksumUpdate
              $token &quot;abcd&quot; is equivalent to  calling  CksumUpdate  $token  &quot;ab&quot;
              followed by CksumUpdate $token &quot;cb&quot;. See EXAMPLES.

       ::crc::CksumFinal token
              Returns the checksum value and releases any resources held by this
              token. Once this command completes the token will be invalid.  The
              result is a 32 bit integer value.

EXAMPLES
              % crc::cksum &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
              2609532967


              % crc::cksum -format 0x%X &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
              0x9B8A5027


              % crc::cksum -file cksum.tcl
              1828321145


              % set tok [crc::CksumInit]
              % crc::CksumUpdate $tok &quot;Hello, &quot;
              % crc::CksumUpdate $tok &quot;World!&quot;
              % crc::CksumFinal $tok
