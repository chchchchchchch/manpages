NAME
       clc-(un)register-user-package - registers a user asdf system


SYNOPSIS
       clc-register-user-package package-file

       clc-unregister-user-package package-file


DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  user defined system into the common lisp controller system.
       This means that any Common Lisp implementation will know how to find  the
       system.

       The  system  file itself will be symlinked from the ~/.clc/systems direc&#8208;
       tory and the system will be recorded in the ~/.clc/user-packages.db file.

       No removal of old fasl files during upgrades of Common  Lisp  Implementa&#8208;
       tions  will be done, nor will the fasls of different implementations will
       be separated by clc , it is expected that the users who require this will
       create  a  full  Debian package or create a symlink in /usr/share/common-
       lisp/systems/ to the system file.


BUGS
       Bug reports should be sent to the Debian BTS, preferably with reportbug.
