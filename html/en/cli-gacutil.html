gacutil(Mono 1.0)                                              gacutil(Mono 1.0)



NAME
       gacutil - Global Assembly Cache management utility.

SYNOPSIS
       gacutil [-user] [command] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       gacutil is a tool used by developers to install versioned assemblies into
       the system Global Assembly Cache (GAC) to become part of  the  assemblies
       that are available for all applications at runtime.

       Notice  that they are not directly available to the compiler. The conven&#8208;
       tion is that assemblies must also be placed in a separate directory to be
       accessed  by  the  compiler.  This is done with the -package directive to
       gacutil.

       The tool allows for installation, removal, and listing of the contents of
       the assembly cache.

       The   GAC   is  relative  to  the  Mono  installation  prefix:  mono_pre&#8208;
       fix/lib/mono.

COMMANDS
       -i &lt;assembly_path&gt; [-check_refs] [-package NAME] [-root ROOTDIR] [-gacdir
       GACDIR]

        Installs  an assembly into the global assembly cache. &lt;assembly_path&gt; is
       the name of the file that contains the assembly manifest

       The -package option can be used to also create a  directory  in  in  pre&#8208;
       fix/lib/mono   with  the  name  NAME,  and  a  symlink  is  created  from
       NAME/assembly_name to the assembly on the GAC.  This is used so  develop&#8208;
       ers can reference a set of libraries at once.

       The -root option is used to specify the &quot;libdir&quot; value of an installation
       prefix which differs from the prefix of the system GAC.  Typical automake
       usage is &quot;-root $(DESTDIR)$(prefix)/lib&quot;.  To access assemblies installed
       to a prefix other than the mono  prefix,  it  is  necessary  to  set  the
       MONO_GAC_PREFIX environment variable.

       The -gacdir option is included for backward compatibility but is not rec&#8208;
       ommended for new code. Use the -root option instead.

       The -check_refs  option  is  used  to  ensure  that  the  assembly  being
       installed  into  the  GAC  does not reference any non strong named assem&#8208;
       blies. Assemblies being installed to the GAC  should  not  reference  non
       strong named assemblies, however the is an optional check.

       -l [assembly_name] [-root ROOTDIR] [-gacdir GACDIR]

       Lists the contents of the global assembly cache. When the &lt;assembly_name&gt;
       parameter is specified only matching assemblies are listed.

       -u  &lt;assembly_display_name&gt;  [-package  NAME]  [-root  ROOTDIR]  [-gacdir
       GACDIR]

       Uninstalls  an  assembly  from the global assembly cache.  &lt;assembly_dis&#8208;
       play_name&gt; is the name of the assembly (partial or  fully  qualified)  to
       remove from the global assembly cache. If a partial name is specified all
       matching assemblies will be uninstalled. As opposed to the install option
       that takes a filename, this takes as an argument the assembly name, which
       looks like this:
            MyLibrary.Something, version=1.0.0.0, publicKeyToken=xxxx,culture=neutral

       Notice that you can have spaces in the command line. There is no need  to
       quote them.

       Performs a greedy removal. If you only specify one component like, &quot;MyLi&#8208;
       brary.Something&quot;, it will remove all versions of the library.

       -us &lt;assembly_path&gt; [-package  NAME]  [-root  ROOTDIR]  [-gacdir  GACDIR]
       Uninstalls an assembly using the specified assembly&apos;s full name.  &lt;assem&#8208;
       bly path&gt; is the path to an assembly. The full assembly name is retrieved
       from  the  specified  assembly  if there is an assembly in the GAC with a
       matching name, it is removed. Unlike the -u option this  option  takes  a
       file name, like this:
               Example: -us myDll.dll

       -ul &lt;assembly_list_file&gt; [-package NAME] [-root ROOTDIR] [-gacdir GACDIR]
       Uninstalls one  or  more  assemblies  from  the  global  assembly  cache.
       &lt;assembly_list_file&gt;  is  the  path  to  a test file containing a list of
       assembly names on separate lines.
       Example -ul assembly_list.txt
       assembly_list.txt contents:
           assembly1,Version=1.0.0.0,Culture=en,PublicKeyToken=0123456789abcdef
           assembly2,Version=2.0.0.0,Culture=en,PublicKeyToken=0123456789abcdef

FILES
       On Unix assemblies are loaded from the installation  lib  directory.   If
       you set `prefix&apos; to /usr, the assemblies will be located in /usr/lib.  On
       Windows, the assemblies are loaded from the directory where mono and mint
       live.

       /etc/mono/config, ~/.mono/config

       Mono  runtime configuration file.  See the mono-config(5) manual page for
       more information.
