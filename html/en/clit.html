CLIT(1)                                                                  CLIT(1)



NAME
       clit - program to manipulate Microsoft Reader .LIT files

SYNOPSIS
       1.  clit [options] litfile.lit subdir/
       2.  clit [options] oldfile.lit newfile.lit
       3.  clit [options] oldfile.lit newfile.lit inscription

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clit command.

       ConvLIT is a program to convert Microsoft Reader format eBooks [LIT] into
       an open format.  clit supports three modes of operation:

       1.     Explosion: expanding a LIT file into an OEBPS  compliant  package,
              that is the original XML / HTML source.

       2.     Downconverting: converts to DRM1 format, also known as sealing the
              LIT file.

       3.     Inscribing: similar to #2, this adds a label, or  inscription,  to
              the ebook to mark that it belongs to you.

OPTIONS
       A  summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, run
       the program without any arguments.

       -d     Disable creating multiple subdirectories.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -k   /path/to/keys.txt
              The DRM5 key file is assumed to be called keys.txt and located  in
              the  current  directory.  If not, use this option to instruct Con&#8208;
              vLIT where to find the key file.
