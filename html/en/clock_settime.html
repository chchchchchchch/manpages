CLOCK_GETRES(2)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            CLOCK_GETRES(2)



NAME
       clock_getres, clock_gettime, clock_settime - clock and time functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int clock_getres(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *res);

       int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *tp);

       int clock_settime(clockid_t clk_id, const struct timespec *tp);

       Link with -lrt (only for glibc versions before 2.17).

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       clock_getres(), clock_gettime(), clock_settime():
              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 199309L

DESCRIPTION
       The function clock_getres() finds the resolution (precision) of the spec&#8208;
       ified clock clk_id, and, if res is non-NULL,  stores  it  in  the  struct
       timespec  pointed  to  by  res.   The resolution of clocks depends on the
       implementation and cannot be configured by a particular process.  If  the
       time value pointed to by the argument tp of clock_settime() is not a mul&#8208;
       tiple of res, then it is truncated to a multiple of res.

       The functions clock_gettime() and clock_settime() retrieve  and  set  the
       time of the specified clock clk_id.

       The  res  and  tp  arguments  are  timespec  structures,  as specified in
       &lt;time.h&gt;:

           struct timespec {
               time_t   tv_sec;        /* seconds */
               long     tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
           };

       The clk_id argument is the identifier of the particular clock on which to
       act.   A clock may be system-wide and hence visible for all processes, or
       per-process if it measures time only within a single process.

       All implementations support the system-wide  real-time  clock,  which  is
       identified  by  CLOCK_REALTIME.  Its time represents seconds and nanosec&#8208;
       onds since the Epoch.  When its time is changed, timers  for  a  relative
       interval  are  unaffected,  but  timers for an absolute point in time are
       affected.

       More clocks may be implemented.  The interpretation of the  corresponding
       time values and the effect on timers is unspecified.

       Sufficiently  recent  versions  of glibc and the Linux kernel support the
       following clocks:

       CLOCK_REALTIME
              System-wide clock that  measures  real  (i.e.,  wall-clock)  time.
              Setting this clock requires appropriate privileges.  This clock is
              affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g.,  if  the
              system  administrator  manually  changes  the  clock),  and by the
              incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3) and NTP.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC
              Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic time since  some
              unspecified starting point.  This clock is not affected by discon&#8208;
              tinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the system  administra&#8208;
              tor  manually changes the clock), but is affected by the incremen&#8208;
              tal adjustments performed by adjtime(3) and NTP.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
              Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw hardware-
              based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments or the incremen&#8208;
              tal adjustments performed by adjtime(3).

       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
              High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.

       CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
              Thread-specific CPU-time clock.

RETURN VALUE
       clock_gettime(), clock_settime() and clock_getres() return 0 for success,
       or -1 for failure (in which case errno is set appropriately).

ERRORS
       EFAULT tp points outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL The clk_id specified is not supported on this system.

       EPERM  clock_settime()  does  not  have permission to set the clock indi&#8208;
              cated.

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

AVAILABILITY
       On POSIX systems on which  these  functions  are  available,  the  symbol
       _POSIX_TIMERS  is  defined  in &lt;unistd.h&gt; to a value greater than 0.  The
       symbols  _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK,  _POSIX_CPUTIME,   _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME
       indicate       that       CLOCK_MONOTONIC,      CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID,
       CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are available.  (See also sysconf(3).)

NOTES
   Note for SMP systems
       The CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks are real&#8208;
       ized on many platforms using timers from the CPUs (TSC on i386, AR.ITC on
       Itanium).  These registers may differ between CPUs and as  a  consequence
       these clocks may return bogus results if a process is migrated to another
       CPU.

       If the CPUs in an SMP system have different clock sources then  there  is
       no  way  to maintain a correlation between the timer registers since each
       CPU will run at a slightly different frequency.  If that is the case then
       clock_getcpuclockid(0) will return ENOENT to signify this condition.  The
       two clocks will then only be useful if it can be ensured that  a  process
       stays on a certain CPU.

       The processors in an SMP system do not start all at exactly the same time
       and therefore the timer registers are typically  running  at  an  offset.
       Some  architectures  include code that attempts to limit these offsets on
       bootup.  However, the code cannot guarantee to accurately tune  the  off&#8208;
       sets.   Glibc  contains  no provisions to deal with these offsets (unlike
       the Linux Kernel).  Typically these offsets are small and  therefore  the
       effects may be negligible in most cases.

BUGS
       According  to  POSIX.1-2001,  a process with &quot;appropriate privileges&quot; may
       set the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks using
       clock_settime().   On  Linux,  these  clocks  are  not settable (i.e., no
       process has &quot;appropriate privileges&quot;).
