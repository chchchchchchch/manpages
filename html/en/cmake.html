NAME
         cmake - Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.


USAGE
         cmake [options] &lt;path-to-source&gt;
         cmake [options] &lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       The  &quot;cmake&quot;  executable  is the CMake command-line interface.  It may be
       used to configure projects in scripts.   Project  configuration  settings
       may  be  specified on the command line with the -D option.  The -i option
       will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.


       CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
       build  process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
       directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users  build  a
       project  by  using  CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on
       their platform.


OPTIONS
       -C &lt;initial-cache&gt;
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When cmake is first run in an  empty  build  tree,  it  creates  a
              CMakeCache.txt  file  and  populates it with customizable settings
              for the project.  This option may be used to specify a  file  from
              which  to  load  cache  entries  before the first pass through the
              project&apos;s cmake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority  over
              the  project&apos;s  default  values.  The given file should be a CMake
              script containing SET commands that use the CACHE  option,  not  a
              cache-format file.


       -D &lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
              Create a cmake cache entry.

              When  cmake  is  first  run  in  an empty build tree, it creates a
              CMakeCache.txt file and populates it  with  customizable  settings
              for  the  project.   This  option may be used to specify a setting
              that takes priority over the project&apos;s default value.  The  option
              may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.


       -U &lt;globbing_expr&gt;
              Remove matching entries from CMake cache.

              This  option  may be used to remove one or more variables from the
              CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ?  are  sup&#8208;
              ported.  The  option  may be repeated for as many cache entries as
              desired.


              Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.


       -G &lt;generator-name&gt;
              Specify a makefile generator.
&#12;              CMake may support multiple native build systems on  certain  plat&#8208;
              forms.   A makefile generator is responsible for generating a par&#8208;
              ticular build system.  Possible generator names are  specified  in
              the Generators section.


       -Wno-dev
              Suppress developer warnings.

              Suppress  warnings  that  are  meant  for the author of the CMake&#8208;
              Lists.txt files.


       -Wdev  Enable developer warnings.

              Enable warnings that are  meant  for  the  author  of  the  CMake&#8208;
              Lists.txt files.


       -E     CMake command mode.

              For  true platform independence, CMake provides a list of commands
              that can be used on all systems. Run with -E help  for  the  usage
              information.  Commands  available are: chdir, compare_files, copy,
              copy_directory, copy_if_different, echo, echo_append, environment,
              make_directory,  md5sum,  remove,  remove_directory,  rename, tar,
              time, touch, touch_nocreate. In addition, some  platform  specific
              commands   are   available.   On  Windows:  comspec,  delete_regv,
              write_regv. On UNIX: create_symlink.


       -i     Run in wizard mode.

              Wizard mode runs cmake interactively without a GUI.  The  user  is
              prompted to answer questions about the project configuration.  The
              answers are used to set cmake cache values.


       -L[A][H]
              List non-advanced cached variables.

              List cache variables will run CMake and  list  all  the  variables
              from  the CMake cache that are not marked as INTERNAL or ADVANCED.
              This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can be
              then  changed  with  -D  option. Changing some of the variable may
              result in more variables being created. If A is specified, then it
              will  display  also advanced variables. If H is specified, it will
              also display help for each variable.


       --build &lt;dir&gt;
              Build a CMake-generated project binary tree.

              This abstracts a native build tool&apos;s command-line  interface  with
              the following options:


                &lt;dir&gt;          = Project binary directory to be built.
                --target &lt;tgt&gt; = Build &lt;tgt&gt; instead of default targets.
                --config &lt;cfg&gt; = For multi-configuration tools, choose &lt;cfg&gt;.
                --clean-first  = Build target &apos;clean&apos; first, then build.
                                 (To clean only, use --target &apos;clean&apos;.)
                --use-stderr  =  Don&apos;t merge stdout/stderr.
                --             = Pass remaining options to the native tool.

              Run cmake --build with no options for quick help.


       -N     View mode only.

              Only  load  the  cache. Do not actually run configure and generate
              steps.


       -P &lt;file&gt;
              Process script mode.

              Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake lan&#8208;
              guage.   No  configure or generate step is performed and the cache
              is not modified. If variables are defined using -D, this  must  be
              done before the -P argument.


       --find-package
              Run in pkg-config like mode.

              Search  a  package  using  find_package()  and print the resulting
              flags to stdout. This can be used to use cmake instead of pkg-con&#8208;
              fig  to  find installed libraries in plain Makefile-based projects
              or in autoconf-based projects (via share/aclocal/cmake.m4).


       --graphviz=[file]
              Generate graphviz of dependencies.

              Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all  the  library
              and executable dependencies in the project.


       --system-information [file]
              Dump information about this system.

              Dump  a wide range of information about the current system. If run
              from the top of a binary tree for a CMake  project  it  will  dump
              additional information such as the cache, log files etc.


       --debug-trycompile
              Do  not  delete  the  try_compile  build  tree. Only useful on one
              try_compile at a time.

              Do not delete the files and directories  created  for  try_compile
              calls.  This  is  useful  in debugging failed try_compiles. It may
              however change the results of the try-compiles as old junk from  a
              previous  try-compile may cause a different test to either pass or
              fail incorrectly.  This option is best used for one try-compile at
              a time, and only when debugging.


       --debug-output
              Put cmake in a debug mode.

              Print extra stuff during the cmake run like stack traces with mes&#8208;
              sage(send_error ) calls.


       --trace
              Put cmake in trace mode.

              Print a  trace  of  all  calls  made  and  from  where  with  mes&#8208;
              sage(send_error ) calls.
&#12;
       --warn-uninitialized
              Warn about uninitialized values.

              Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.


       --warn-unused-vars
              Warn about unused variables.

              Find variables that are declared or set, but not used.


       --no-warn-unused-cli
              Don&apos;t warn about command line options.

              Don&apos;t  find  variables  that are declared on the command line, but
              not used.


       --check-system-vars
              Find problems with variable usage in system files.

              Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are searched for only
              in CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR. This flag tells CMake to
              warn about other files as well.

GENERATORS
       The following generators are available on this platform:


       Ninja  Generates build.ninja files (experimental).

              A  build.ninja  file is generated into the build tree. Recent ver&#8208;
              sions of the ninja program can build the project through the &quot;all&quot;
              target.  An &quot;install&quot; target is also provided.


       Unix Makefiles
              Generates standard UNIX makefiles.

              A  hierarchy  of  UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.
              Any standard UNIX-style make program can build the project through
              the  default  make  target.   A &quot;make install&quot; target is also pro&#8208;

COMMANDS
       add_custom_command
              Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.

              There are two main signatures  for  add_custom_command  The  first
              signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.


                add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                                   COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                                   [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                                   [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                                   [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                                   [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1 ...]
                                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                                   [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])

              This  defines  a  command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s).  A
              target created in the same directory  (CMakeLists.txt  file)  that
              specifies  any  output  of  the custom command as a source file is
              given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.
              Do  not  list  the output in more than one independent target that
              may build in parallel or the two instances of the  rule  may  con&#8208;
              flict (instead use add_custom_target to drive the command and make
              the other targets depend on that one).  If an  output  name  is  a
              relative  path  it  will be interpreted relative to the build tree
              directory corresponding to the current source directory. Note that
              MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and is used as a suggestion
              to visual studio about where to hang the custom command. In  make&#8208;
              file terms this creates a new target in the following form:
&#12;
                OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
                        COMMAND

              If  more  than  one  command is specified they will be executed in
              order. The optional ARGS argument is  for  backward  compatibility
              and will be ignored.


              The  second  signature adds a custom command to a target such as a
              library or executable. This is useful for performing an  operation
              before  or  after building the target. The command becomes part of
              the target and will only execute when the target itself is  built.
              If the target is already built, the command will not execute.


                add_custom_command(TARGET target
                                   PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                                   COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                                   [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                                   [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])

              This  defines  a new command that will be associated with building
              the specified target. When the command will happen  is  determined
              by which of the following is specified:


                PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies
                PRE_LINK - run after other dependencies
                POST_BUILD - run after the target has been built

              Note  that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio
              7 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated  as
              PRE_LINK.


              If  WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in
              the directory given. If it is a relative path it  will  be  inter&#8208;
              preted  relative  to the build tree directory corresponding to the
              current source directory. If COMMENT is set,  the  value  will  be
              displayed  as  a message before the commands are executed at build
              time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values
              are appended to the custom command for the first output specified.
              There must have already been a previous call to this command  with
              the  same  output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPEN&#8208;
              DENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but  may
              be used in the future.


              If  VERBATIM  is  given then all arguments to the commands will be
              escaped properly for the build tool so that  the  invoked  command
              receives  each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes
              is still used by the  CMake  language  processor  before  add_cus&#8208;
              tom_command  even  sees  the  arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recom&#8208;
              mended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not  given
              the  behavior  is platform specific because there is no protection
              of tool-specific special characters.


              If the output of the custom command is not actually created  as  a
              file   on   disk   it   should   be   marked   as   SYMBOLIC  with
              SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.


              The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of  implicit  depen&#8208;
              dencies  of  an input file.  The language given specifies the pro&#8208;
              gramming language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be
              used.   Currently  only C and CXX language scanners are supported.
              Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added  to  those  of
              the  custom command at build time.  Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS
              option is currently supported only  for  Makefile  generators  and
              will be ignored by other generators.


              If  COMMAND  specifies  an  executable target (created by ADD_EXE&#8208;
              CUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the location of  the
              executable  created  at  build  time.  Additionally a target-level
              dependency will be added so that the  executable  target  will  be
              built  before  any target using this custom command.  However this
              does NOT add a file-level dependency that would cause  the  custom
              command to re-run whenever the executable is recompiled.


              Arguments to COMMAND may use &quot;generator expressions&quot; with the syn&#8208;
              tax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.  Generator expressions  are  evaluted  during  build
              system  generation  to  produce information specific to each build
              configuration.  Valid expressions are:


                $&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;          = configuration name
                $&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt;        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
                $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
                $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with soname (.so.3)

              where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target.  Target file expressions pro&#8208;
              duce  a  full  path,  but  _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the
              directory and file name components:


                $&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
                $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
                $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;

              References to target names in  generator  expressions  imply  tar&#8208;
              get-level  dependencies,  but  NOT  file-level dependencies.  List
              target names with the DEPENDS option to add file dependencies.


              The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the  command  depends.
              If  any  dependency  is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the
              same directory (CMakeLists.txt file)  CMake  automatically  brings
              the  other custom command into the target in which this command is
              built.  If DEPENDS is not specified the command will run  whenever
              the OUTPUT is missing; if the command does not actually create the
              OUTPUT then the rule will always run.  If  DEPENDS  specifies  any
              target  (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level dependency is
              created to make sure the target is built before any  target  using
              this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an executable
              or library a file-level dependency is created to cause the  custom
              command to re-run whenever the target is recompiled.



       add_custom_target
              Add a target with no output so it will always be built.

                add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
                                  [COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...]
                                  [DEPENDS depend depend depend ... ]
                                  [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                                  [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM]
                                  [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])

              Adds  a  target  with  the given name that executes the given com&#8208;
              mands. The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED  OUT
              OF DATE even if the commands try to create a file with the name of
              the target. Use ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with  depen&#8208;
              dencies.  By  default  nothing  depends  on the custom target. Use
              ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other targets.  If
              the  ALL  option is specified it indicates that this target should
              be added to the default build target so that it will be run  every
              time (the command cannot be called ALL). The command and arguments
              are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created.
              If  WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that
              directory. If it is a relative path it will be  interpreted  rela&#8208;
              tive  to  the  build  tree  directory corresponding to the current
              source directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will  be  displayed
              as  a  message  before  the  commands  are executed at build time.
              Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument may reference  files
              and  outputs  of custom commands created with add_custom_command()
              in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file).


              If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the  commands  will  be
              escaped  properly  for  the build tool so that the invoked command
              receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of  escapes
              is  still  used  by  the  CMake language processor before add_cus&#8208;
              tom_target even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended
              as  it  enables  correct  behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the
              behavior is platform specific because there is  no  protection  of
              tool-specific special characters.


              The  SOURCES  option  specifies  additional  source  files  to  be
              included in the custom target.  Specified  source  files  will  be
              added to IDE project files for convenience in editing even if they
              have not build rules.


       add_definitions
              Adds -D define flags to the compilation of source files.

                add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

              Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in the current
              directory  and  below.  This command can be used to add any flags,
              but it was originally intended to  add  preprocessor  definitions.
              Flags  beginning  in  -D or /D that look like preprocessor defini&#8208;
              tions are automatically added to the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  property
              for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trival values may
              be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons
              of  backwards  compatibility.  See documentation of the directory,
              target, and source file COMPILE_DEFINITIONS properties for details
              on adding preprocessor definitions to specific scopes and configu&#8208;
              rations.


       add_dependencies
              Add a dependency between top-level targets.

                add_dependencies(target-name depend-target1
                                 depend-target2 ...)

              Make a top-level target depend  on  other  top-level  targets.   A
              top-level target is one created by ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or
              ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET.  Adding dependencies with this command  can  be
              used  to  make  sure  one  target  is built before another target.
              Dependencies added to an IMPORTED target are followed transitively
              in  its  place  since  the  target itself does not build.  See the
              DEPENDS option of  ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET  and  ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND  for
              adding   file-level   dependencies   in  custom  rules.   See  the
              OBJECT_DEPENDS  option  in  SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES   to   add
              file-level dependencies to object files.


       add_executable
              Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.

                add_executable(&lt;name&gt; [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
                               [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                               source1 source2 ... sourceN)

              Adds  an  executable  target  called  &lt;name&gt;  to be built from the
              source files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt;  corre&#8208;
              sponds  to  the  logical  target  name and must be globally unique
              within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is
              constructed  based  on conventions of the native platform (such as
              &lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).


              By default the executable file will be created in the  build  tree
              directory  corresponding to the source tree directory in which the
              command  was  invoked.   See  documentation  of  the  RUNTIME_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_DIRECTORY  target property to change this location.  See docu&#8208;
              mentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the  &lt;name&gt;
              part of the final file name.


              If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be set on the
              target created.  See documentation of  that  target  property  for
              details.


              If  MACOSX_BUNDLE  is given the corresponding property will be set
              on the created target.  See  documentation  of  the  MACOSX_BUNDLE
              target property for details.


              If  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL  is  given the corresponding property will be
              set  on  the   created   target.    See   documentation   of   the
              EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.


              The  add_executable  command  can  also create IMPORTED executable
              targets using this signature:


                add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED [GLOBAL])

              An  IMPORTED  executable  target  references  an  executable  file
              located  outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.
              The target name has scope in the directory in which it is  created
              and  below,  but  the GLOBAL option extends visibility.  It may be
              referenced like any target built  within  the  project.   IMPORTED
              executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like
              add_custom_command.  Details about  the  imported  executable  are
              specified  by setting properties whose names begin in &quot;IMPORTED_&quot;.
              The most important such property  is  IMPORTED_LOCATION  (and  its
              per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which speci&#8208;
              fies the location of the main executable file on disk.  See  docu&#8208;
              mentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.


       add_library
              Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

                add_library(&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                            [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                            source1 source2 ... sourceN)

              Adds  a  library  target called &lt;name&gt; to be built from the source
              files listed in the command invocation.  The &lt;name&gt; corresponds to
              the  logical  target  name  and  must  be globally unique within a
              project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed
              based  on  conventions of the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a
              or &lt;name&gt;.lib).


              STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given  to  specify  the  type  of
              library  to  be  created.  STATIC libraries are archives of object
              files for use when linking other targets.   SHARED  libraries  are
              linked  dynamically  and  loaded at runtime.  MODULE libraries are
              plugins that are not linked into other targets but may  be  loaded
              dynamically  at  runtime  using  dlopen-like functionality.  If no
              type is given explicitly the type is STATIC  or  SHARED  based  on
              whether  the  current  value  of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is
              true.


              By default the library file will be  created  in  the  build  tree
              directory  corresponding to the source tree directory in which the
              command  was  invoked.   See  documentation  of  the  ARCHIVE_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIREC&#8208;
              TORY target properties to change this location.  See documentation
              of  the  OUTPUT_NAME  target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of
              the final file name.


              If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding  property  will  be
              set   on   the   created   target.    See   documentation  of  the
              EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.


              The add_library command can also create IMPORTED  library  targets
              using this signature:


                add_library(&lt;name&gt; &lt;SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN&gt; IMPORTED
                            [GLOBAL])

              An  IMPORTED library target references a library file located out&#8208;
              side the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target
              name  has scope in the directory in which it is created and below,
              but the GLOBAL option extends visibility.  It  may  be  referenced
              like  any target built within the project.  IMPORTED libraries are
              useful  for  convenient  reference   from   commands   like   tar&#8208;
              get_link_libraries.  Details about the imported library are speci&#8208;
              fied by setting properties whose names begin in &quot;IMPORTED_&quot;.   The
              most   important  such  property  is  IMPORTED_LOCATION  (and  its
              per-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which speci&#8208;
              fies  the location of the main library file on disk.  See documen&#8208;
              tation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.


              The signature


                add_library(&lt;name&gt; OBJECT &lt;src&gt;...)

              creates a special &quot;object library&quot; target.  An object library com&#8208;
              piles source files but does not archive or link their object files
              into a library.  Instead other targets created by  add_library  or
              add_executable  may  reference  the objects using an expression of
              the form $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; as a source, where  &quot;objlib&quot;  is
              the object library name.  For example:


                add_library(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)
                add_executable(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)

              will  include objlib&apos;s object files in a library and an executable
              along  with  those  compiled  from  their  own  sources.    Object
              libraries  may  contain only sources (and headers) that compile to
              object files.  They may contain custom  commands  generating  such
              sources,  but  not  PRE_BUILD,  PRE_LINK,  or POST_BUILD commands.
              Object libraries  cannot  be  imported,  exported,  installed,  or
              linked.


       add_subdirectory
              Add a subdirectory to the build.

                add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir]
                                 [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

              Add  a  subdirectory  to  the  build. The source_dir specifies the
              directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt and  code  files  are
              located.  If  it  is  a  relative  path  it will be evaluated with
              respect to the current directory (the typical usage), but  it  may
              also  be  an absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory
              in which to place the output files. If it is a  relative  path  it
              will  be  evaluated  with respect to the current output directory,
              but it may also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is  not  speci&#8208;
              fied, the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path,
              will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file  in  the
              specified  source directory will be processed immediately by CMake
              before processing in the current input file continues beyond  this
              command.


              If  the  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then targets in the
              subdirectory will not be included in the ALL target of the  parent
              directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.
              Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This  is
              meant  for  use  when the subdirectory contains a separate part of
              the project that is useful but not necessary, such  as  a  set  of
              examples.   Typically  the  subdirectory  should  contain  its own
              project() command invocation so that a full build system  will  be
              generated  in  the  subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).
              Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this exclusion.   If
              a  target  built  by the parent project depends on a target in the
              subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in  the  parent
              project build system to satisfy the dependency.


       add_test
              Add a test to the project with the specified arguments.

                add_test(testname Exename arg1 arg2 ... )

              If  the  ENABLE_TESTING  command has been run, this command adds a
              test target to the current directory. If  ENABLE_TESTING  has  not
              been  run,  this  command  does nothing.  The tests are run by the
              testing subsystem by executing Exename with  the  specified  argu&#8208;
              ments.   Exename can be either an executable built by this project
              or an arbitrary executable on the system (like tclsh).   The  test
              will  be  run with the current working directory set to the CMake&#8208;
              List.txt files corresponding directory in the binary tree.





                add_test(NAME &lt;name&gt; [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                         [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                         COMMAND &lt;command&gt; [arg1 [arg2 ...]])
&#12;              If COMMAND specifies an executable  target  (created  by  add_exe&#8208;
              cutable)  it will automatically be replaced by the location of the
              executable created at build time.  If a CONFIGURATIONS  option  is
              given  then  the test will be executed only when testing under one
              of the named configurations.  If  a  WORKING_DIRECTORY  option  is
              given then the test will be executed in the given directory.


              Arguments  after  COMMAND may use &quot;generator expressions&quot; with the
              syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.  Generator expressions are evaluted during  build
              system  generation  to  produce information specific to each build
              configuration.  Valid expressions are:


                $&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;          = configuration name
                $&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt;        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
                $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
                $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with soname (.so.3)

              where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target.  Target file expressions pro&#8208;
              duce  a  full  path,  but  _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the
              directory and file name components:


                $&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
                $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
                $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;

              Example usage:


                add_test(NAME mytest
                         COMMAND testDriver --config $&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;
                                            --exe $&lt;TARGET_FILE:myexe&gt;)

              This creates a test &quot;mytest&quot; whose command runs a testDriver  tool
              passing the configuration name and the full path to the executable
              file produced by target &quot;myexe&quot;.


       aux_source_directory
              Find all source files in a directory.

                aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Collects the names of all the source files in the specified direc&#8208;
              tory and stores the list in the &lt;variable&gt; provided.  This command
              is intended to be used by  projects  that  use  explicit  template
              instantiation.   Template  instantiation  files can be stored in a
              &quot;Templates&quot; subdirectory and collected  automatically  using  this
              command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.


              It  is  tempting  to use this command to avoid writing the list of
              source files for a library or executable target.  While this seems
              to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that
              knows when a new source file has been added.  Normally the  gener&#8208;
              ated  build  system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the
              CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a  new  source.   When  the
              source is just added to the directory without modifying this file,
              one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build  system
              incorporating the new file.


       break  Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

       build_command
              Get the command line to build this project.

                build_command(&lt;variable&gt;
                              [CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;]
                              [PROJECT_NAME &lt;projname&gt;]
                              [TARGET &lt;target&gt;])

              Sets  the given &lt;variable&gt; to a string containing the command line
              for building one configuration of a target in a project using  the
              build tool appropriate for the current CMAKE_GENERATOR.


              If  CONFIGURATION  is  omitted, CMake chooses a reasonable default
              value   for  multi-configuration  generators.   CONFIGURATION   is
              ignored for single-configuration generators.


              If  PROJECT_NAME is omitted, the resulting command line will build
              the top level PROJECT in the current build tree.


              If TARGET is omitted, the resulting command line will build every&#8208;
              thing, effectively using build target &apos;all&apos; or &apos;ALL_BUILD&apos;.


                build_command(&lt;cachevariable&gt; &lt;makecommand&gt;)

              This second signature is deprecated, but still available for back&#8208;
              wards compatibility. Use the first signature instead.


              Sets the given &lt;cachevariable&gt; to a string containing the  command
              to  build  this  project from the root of the build tree using the
              build tool given by &lt;makecommand&gt;.  &lt;makecommand&gt;  should  be  the
              full  path  to  msdev,  devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user
              build tools.


       cmake_minimum_required
              Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

                cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
                                       [FATAL_ERROR])

              If the current version of CMake is lower  than  that  required  it
              will stop processing the project and report an error.  When a ver&#8208;
              sion higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])

              which sets the cmake policy version level to  the  version  speci&#8208;
              fied.   When  version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly
              invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)

              which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.


              The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by  CMake  2.6  and
              higher.   It  should  be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower
              fail with an error instead of just a warning.


       cmake_policy
              Manage CMake Policy settings.

              As CMake evolves it is  sometimes  necessary  to  change  existing
              behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of exist&#8208;
              ing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep
              existing  projects  building  as  new  versions of CMake introduce
              changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given
              an identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where &quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer
              index.  Documentation associated with each  policy  describes  the
              OLD  and  NEW  behavior  and the reason the policy was introduced.
              Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When
              CMake  needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting
              specified by the project.  If no  setting  is  available  the  OLD
              behavior  is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the
              policy be set.


              The cmake_policy command is used to set policies  to  OLD  or  NEW
              behavior.   While  setting  policies individually is supported, we
              encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.


                cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])

              Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the  given
              version  of  CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified ver&#8208;
              sion or earlier will be set to use  NEW  behavior.   All  policies
              introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless vari&#8208;
              able CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This  effec&#8208;
              tively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and
              tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.   The
              policy  version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will
              report an error.  In order to get compatibility features  support&#8208;
              ing versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.


                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)

              Tell  CMake  to  use  the  OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.
              Projects depending on the old  behavior  of  a  given  policy  may
              silence  a  policy  warning  by  setting  the policy state to OLD.
              Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new  behav&#8208;
              ior and set the policy state to NEW.


                cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Check  whether  a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The
              output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot; or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set,
              and empty otherwise.


              CMake  keeps  policy  settings  on a stack, so changes made by the
              cmake_policy command affect only the top  of  the  stack.   A  new
              entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdi&#8208;
              rectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a
              new  entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() com&#8208;
              mands except when invoked with  the  NO_POLICY_SCOPE  option  (see
              also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an inter&#8208;
              face to manage custom entries on the policy stack:


                cmake_policy(PUSH)
                cmake_policy(POP)

              Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This  is
              useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.


              Functions  and macros record policy settings when they are created
              and use the pre-record policies when they  are  invoked.   If  the
              function  or macro implementation sets policies, the changes auto&#8208;
              matically propagate up through callers until they reach the  clos&#8208;
              est nested policy stack entry.


       configure_file
              Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

                configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
                               [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                               [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

              Copies  a  file  &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and substitutes variable
              values referenced in the file content.  If &lt;input&gt; is  a  relative
              path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory.
              The &lt;input&gt; must be a file, not a directory.   If  &lt;output&gt;  is  a
              relative  path  it is evaluated with respect to the current binary
              directory.  If &lt;output&gt; names an existing directory the input file
              is placed in that directory with its original name.


              This  command  replaces any variables in the input file referenced
              as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a
              variable  is  not  defined,  it will be replaced with nothing.  If
              COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.
              If  ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be
              C-style escaped.  The file will be  configured  with  the  current
              values  of  CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables
              of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and  ${VAR}  will  be  ignored.
              This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occur&#8208;
              rences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced  with  either  #define
              VAR  or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake.
              Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either
              #define  VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates
              to TRUE or FALSE in CMake.


              With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be adjusted:


                  &apos;UNIX&apos; or &apos;LF&apos; for \n, &apos;DOS&apos;, &apos;WIN32&apos; or &apos;CRLF&apos; for \r\n.

              COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.



       create_test_sourcelist
              Create a test driver and source list for building test programs.

                create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName
                                       test1 test2 test3
                                       EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h
                                       FUNCTION function)

              A test driver is a program that links together  many  small  tests
              into  a  single  executable.   This is useful when building static
              executables with large libraries  to  shrink  the  total  required
              size.   The  list  of source files needed to build the test driver
              will be in sourceListName.  DriverName is the  name  of  the  test
              driver  program.   The  rest of the arguments consist of a list of
              test source files, can be semicolon separated.  Each  test  source
              file  should  have  a  function in it that is the same name as the
              file  with  no  extension  (foo.cxx  should  have   int   foo(int,
              char*[]);)  DriverName  will  be able to call each of the tests by
              name on the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then  the
              next  argument is included into the generated file. If FUNCTION is
              specified, then the next argument is taken as a function name that
              is  passed  a pointer to ac and av.  This can be used to add extra
              command  line  processing  to  each  test.  The   cmake   variable
              CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that will
              be  placed  directly  before  calling  the  test  main   function.
              CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN  can be set to have code that will
              be placed directly after the call to the test main function.


       define_property
              Define and document custom properties.

                define_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE |
                                 TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE&gt;
                                 PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [INHERITED]
                                 BRIEF_DOCS &lt;brief-doc&gt; [docs...]
                                 FULL_DOCS &lt;full-doc&gt; [docs...])

              Define one property in a scope for use with the  set_property  and
              get_property commands.  This is primarily useful to associate doc&#8208;
              umentation with property names that  may  be  retrieved  with  the
              get_property  command.   The first argument determines the kind of
              scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of the
              following:


                GLOBAL    = associated with the global namespace
                DIRECTORY = associated with one directory
                TARGET    = associated with one target
                SOURCE    = associated with one source file
                TEST      = associated with a test named with add_test
                VARIABLE  = documents a CMake language variable
                CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable

              Note  that  unlike  set_property  and get_property no actual scope
              needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.


              The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by  the  name
              of the property being defined.


              If  the  INHERITED option then the get_property command will chain
              up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set
              in  the  scope  given  to  the command.  DIRECTORY scope chains to
              GLOBAL.  TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST chain to DIRECTORY.


              The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by strings to be
              associated  with the property as its brief and full documentation.
              Corresponding options to the get_property  command  will  retrieve
              the documentation.


       else   Starts the else portion of an if block.

                else(expression)

              See the if command.


       elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.

       enable_language
              Enable a language (CXX/C/Fortran/etc)

                enable_language(languageName [OPTIONAL] )

              This command enables support for the named language in CMake. This
              is the same as the project command but does not create any of  the
              extra  variables  that are created by the project command. Example
              languages are CXX, C,  Fortran.  If  OPTIONAL  is  used,  use  the
              CMAKE_&lt;languageName&gt;_COMPILER_WORKS  variable to check whether the
              language has been enabled successfully.


       enable_testing
              Enable testing for current directory and below.

                enable_testing()

              Enables testing for  this  directory  and  below.   See  also  the
              add_test  command.  Note that ctest expects to find a test file in
              the build directory root.  Therefore, this command  should  be  in
              the source directory root.


       endforeach
              Ends a list of commands in a FOREACH block.

                endforeach(expression)

              See the FOREACH command.


       endfunction
              Ends a list of commands in a function block.

                endfunction(expression)

       endmacro
              Ends a list of commands in a macro block.

                endmacro(expression)

              See the macro command.


       endwhile
              Ends a list of commands in a while block.

                endwhile(expression)

&#12;       execute_process
              Execute one or more child processes.

                execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
                                [COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]]
                                [WORKING_DIRECTORY &lt;directory&gt;]
                                [TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;]
                                [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
                                [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
                                [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
                                [INPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [OUTPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                                [ERROR_QUIET]
                                [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                                [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])

              Runs  the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard
              output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A
              single  standard  error  pipe is used for all processes.  If WORK&#8208;
              ING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  of  the  child processes.  If TIMEOUT is
              given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish
              in  the  specified  number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If
              RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to  contain  the
              result  of  running the processes.  This will be an integer return
              code from the last child or a string describing  an  error  condi&#8208;
              tion.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable
              named will be set with the contents of  the  standard  output  and
              standard  error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is named
              for both pipes their output will be merged in the order  produced.
              If  INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named
              will be attached to the standard input of the first process, stan&#8208;
              dard  output  of  the  last process, or standard error of all pro&#8208;
              cesses respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then
              the  standard  output  or  standard  error results will be quietly
              ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for
              the  same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or
              ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the  cor&#8208;
              responding pipes of the CMake process itself.


              The  execute_process  command  is a newer more powerful version of
              exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.


       export Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.

                export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;]
                       [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt;)

              Create a file &lt;filename&gt; that may be included by outside  projects
              to  import targets from the current project&apos;s build tree.  This is
              useful during cross-compiling to build  utility  executables  that
              can  run  on the host platform in one project and then import them
              into another project being compiled for the target  platform.   If
              the  NAMESPACE  option  is  given  the  &lt;namespace&gt; string will be
              prepended to all target names written to the file.  If the  APPEND
              option  is  given  the generated code will be appended to the file
              instead of overwriting it.  If a library target is included in the
              export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior
              is unspecified.


              The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and
              should  never  be  installed.   See the install(EXPORT) command to
              export targets from an installation tree.


              Do not set properties that affect the location of a  target  after
              passing  it to this command.  These include properties whose names
              match    &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;)?&quot;  or  &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.   Failure to follow this
              rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target  unde&#8208;
              fined.


                export(PACKAGE &lt;name&gt;)

              Store  the  current build directory in the CMake user package reg&#8208;
              istry for package &lt;name&gt;.  The find_package command  may  consider
              the  directory  while  searching  for  package &lt;name&gt;.  This helps
              dependent projects  find  and  use  a  package  from  the  current
              project&apos;s  build  tree  without help from the user.  Note that the
              entry in the package registry that this command creates works only
              in  conjunction  with  a  package  configuration  file (&lt;name&gt;Con&#8208;
              fig.cmake) that works with the build tree.


       file   File manipulation command.

                file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
                file(APPEND filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
                file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset] [HEX])
                file(&lt;MD5|SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512&gt; filename variable)
                file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
                     [LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
                     [LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
                     [NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex]
                     [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])
                file(GLOB variable [RELATIVE path] [globbing expressions]...)
                file(GLOB_RECURSE variable [RELATIVE path]
                     [FOLLOW_SYMLINKS] [globbing expressions]...)
                file(RENAME &lt;oldname&gt; &lt;newname&gt;)
                file(REMOVE [file1 ...])
                file(REMOVE_RECURSE [file1 ...])
                file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [directory1 directory2 ...])
                file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
                file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result)
                file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path result)
                file(DOWNLOAD url file [INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT timeout]
                     [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log] [SHOW_PROGRESS]
                     [EXPECTED_MD5 sum])
                file(UPLOAD filename url [INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT timeout]
                     [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log] [SHOW_PROGRESS])

              WRITE will write a message into a file called &apos;filename&apos;. It over&#8208;
              writes  the  file if it already exists, and creates the file if it
              does not exist.


              APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,  except  it
              will append it to the end of the file


              READ  will  read the content of a file and store it into the vari&#8208;
              able. It will start at the given offset and read up  to  numBytes.
              If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to
              hexadecimal representation and this will be stored  in  the  vari&#8208;
              able.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the content of a file.
&#12;
              STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file  and  store
              it  in  a  variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage
              return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also  for  Intel  Hex
              and  Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to
              binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVER&#8208;
              SION.


              LIMIT_COUNT   sets  the  maximum  number  of  strings  to  return.
              LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of  bytes  to  read  from  the
              input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store
              in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length  of
              a  string  to  return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM
              sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are
              split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CON&#8208;
              SUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead  of  termi&#8208;
              nating them.


              REGEX  specifies  a regular expression that a string must match to
              be returned. Typical usage


                file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

              stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in which  each  item  is  a
              line from the input file.


              GLOB  will  generate  a  list of all files that match the globbing
              expressions and store it into the variable.  Globbing  expressions
              are  similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE
              flag is specified for an expression, the results will be  returned
              as  a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using
              GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.   If
              no  CMakeLists.txt  file changes when a source is added or removed
              then the generated build system cannot know when to ask  CMake  to
              regenerate.)


              Examples of globbing expressions include:


                 *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
                 *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
                 f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

              GLOB_RECURSE  will  generate  a  list similar to the regular GLOB,
              except it will traverse all  the  subdirectories  of  the  matched
              directory  and  match  the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks
              are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is  given  or  cmake  policy
              CMP0009  is  not  set  to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for
              more information.


              Examples of recursive globbing include:


                 /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

              MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories,  also  if  their
              parent directories don&apos;t exist yet


              RENAME  moves  a  file or directory within a filesystem, replacing
              the destination atomically.
&#12;
              REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories


              REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and  directories,  also
              non-empty directories


              RELATIVE_PATH  will  determine relative path from directory to the
              given file.


              TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with  unix
              /.   The  input  can  be  a  single  path  or  a  system path like
              &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;.   Note  the  double  quotes  around  the  ENV   call
              TO_CMAKE_PATH  only  takes   one  argument. This command will also
              convert the native list delimiters for a list of  paths  like  the
              PATH environment variable.


              TO_NATIVE_PATH  works  just  like  TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert
              from  a cmake style path into the native path style \ for  windows
              and / for UNIX.


              DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var
              is specified a log of the download will be put in var.  If  STATUS
              var  is  specified the status of the operation will be put in var.
              The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is
              the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element
              is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no  error
              in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will
              timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as  an  inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of inactivity after  which  the  operation  should  terminate.  If
              EXPECTED_MD5  sum is specified, the operation will verify that the
              downloaded file&apos;s actual md5 sum matches the expected value. If it
              does   not   match,   the   operation  fails  with  an  error.  If
              SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will  be  printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.


              UPLOAD  will upload the given file to the given URL. If LOG var is
              specified a log of the upload will be put in var. If STATUS var is
              specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The sta&#8208;
              tus is returned in a list of length 2. The first  element  is  the
              numeric  return value for the operation, and the second element is
              a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error  in
              the  operation.  If  TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will
              timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as  an  inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of inactivity after  which  the  operation  should  terminate.  If
              SHOW_PROGRESS  is  specified, progress information will be printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.


              The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:


                file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                     [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
                     [FILES_MATCHING]
                     [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                      [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

              The COPY signature copies files, directories, and  symlinks  to  a
              destination  folder.   Relative  input  paths  are  evaluated with
              respect to the current source directory, and a  relative  destina&#8208;
              tion  is  evaluated  with  respect to the current build directory.
              Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a  file
              if  it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying
              preserves  input  permissions  unless  explicit   permissions   or
              NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS  are  given  (default  is USE_SOURCE_PERMIS&#8208;
              SIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for  documentation  of
              permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.


              The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status
              messages,  and  NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS  is  default.   Installation
              scripts  generated  by  the  install()  command use this signature
              (with some undocumented options for internal use).


       find_file
              Find the full path to a file.

                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many  cases.   It  is the same as find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_file(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find a full path to named  file.  A  cache
              entry  named  by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this com&#8208;
              mand.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in
              the  variable and the search will not be repeated unless the vari&#8208;
              able is  cleared.   If  nothing  is  found,  the  result  will  be
              &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,  and  the  search will be attempted again the next
              time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the
              full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names
              listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can
              be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the
              HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will  be  read
              and  converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style
              list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way  to  list  the
              system  path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
              documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies  addi&#8208;
              tional subdirectories to check below each search path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.
&#12;              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       find_library
              Find a library.

                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many cases.  It is the same as find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_library(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find a library. A  cache  entry  named  by
              &lt;VAR&gt;  is  created  to  store  the result of this command.  If the
              library is found the result is stored  in  the  variable  and  the
              search  will  not  be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If
              nothing is found, the  result  will  be  &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,  and  the
              search  will  be  attempted  again  the  next time find_library is
              invoked with the same variable.  The name of the library  that  is
              searched  for  is  specified  by  the names listed after the NAMES
              argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the
              PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
              the environment variable var will be read  and  converted  from  a
              system  environment  variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For
              example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path  variable.
              The  argument  after DOC will be used for the documentation string
              in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies  additional  subdirectories
              to check below each search path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 LIB

              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set  to  the
              full  path  to  the  framework &lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full
              path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -frame&#8208;
              work A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the target.


              If  the  global  property  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is set all
              search paths will be tested as normal, with  &quot;64/&quot;  appended,  and
              with  all  matches of &quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;. This property
              is automatically set for the platforms that are known to  need  it
              if  at least one of the languages supported by the PROJECT command
              is enabled.


       find_package
              Load settings for an external project.

                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Finds  and  loads  settings  from  an  external  project.   &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND  will be set to indicate whether the package was found.
              When the package is found package-specific information is provided
              through  variables  documented  by  the package itself.  The QUIET
              option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The MOD&#8208;
              ULE  option  disables  the second signature documented below.  The
              REQUIRED option stops processing with  an  error  message  if  the
              package cannot be found.


              A package-specific list of required components may be listed after
              the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED option  if  present).
              Additional optional components may be listed after OPTIONAL_COMPO&#8208;
              NENTS.  Available components and  their  influence  on  whether  a
              package  is considered to be found are defined by the target pack&#8208;
              age.


              The [version] argument requests a version with which  the  package
              found       should       be       compatible       (format      is
              major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT  option  requests  that
              the  version be matched exactly.  If no [version] and/or component
              list is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module,  the
              corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer
              call (including the EXACT flag for [version]).  Version support is
              currently  provided  only  on  a package-by-package basis (details
              below).


              User code should generally look for packages using the above  sim&#8208;
              ple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation speci&#8208;
              fies the full command signature and details of the search process.
              Project  maintainers  wishing  to provide a package to be found by
              this command are encouraged to read on.


              The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: &quot;Mod&#8208;
              ule&quot;  mode  and  &quot;Config&quot; mode.  Module mode is available when the
              command is  invoked  with  the  above  reduced  signature.   CMake
              searches for a file called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the CMAKE_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_PATH followed by the  CMake  installation.   If  the  file  is
              found,  it  is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for
              finding the package,  checking  the  version,  and  producing  any
              needed  messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no support
              for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no  module  is
              found  and  the MODULE option is not given the command proceeds to
              Config mode.


              The complete Config mode command signature is:


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
                             [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
                             [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
                             [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                             [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                             [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                              ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

              The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode  explicitly  and
              switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Con&#8208;
              fig mode is also implied by use of options not  specified  in  the
              reduced signature.


              Config  mode  attempts  to locate a configuration file provided by
              the package to be found.  A cache entry  called  &lt;package&gt;_DIR  is
              created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the
              command searches for a package with the name  &lt;package&gt;.   If  the
              NAMES  option  is given the names following it are used instead of
              &lt;package&gt;.  The command searches for  a  file  called  &quot;&lt;name&gt;Con&#8208;
              fig.cmake&quot; or &quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each name spec&#8208;
              ified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may
              be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is speci&#8208;
              fied below.  Once found, the configuration file is read  and  pro&#8208;
              cessed  by  CMake.   Since  the file is provided by the package it
              already knows the location of package contents.  The full path  to
              the  configuration  file  is  stored  in the cmake variable &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_CONFIG.


              All configuration files which have been considered by CMake  while
              searching  for  an installation of the package with an appropriate
              version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CON&#8208;
              FIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.


              If  the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will gen&#8208;
              erate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is
              specified.   If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found
              a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.
              If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a con&#8208;
              figuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.


              When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find  a
              version   of  the  package  that  claims  compatibility  with  the
              requested version (format is  major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).   If
              the  EXACT  option is given only a version of the package claiming
              an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake  does
              not  establish  any convention for the meaning of version numbers.
              Package version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files provided by
              the  packages  themselves.   For a candidate package configuration
              file  &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot;  the  corresponding  version  file  is
              located  next to it and named either &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot;
              or &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;.   If  no  such  version  file  is
              available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compat&#8208;
              ible with any requested version.  A basic version file  containing
              generic  version  matching  code  can  be  created using the macro
              write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more
              details.   When  a version file is found it is loaded to check the
              requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a  nested
              scope in which the following variables have been defined:


                PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version
              and sets these variables:


                PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
                PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
                PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
                PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version

              These variables are checked by the find_package command to  deter&#8208;
              mine  whether  the  configuration file provides an acceptable ver&#8208;
              sion.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.
              If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:


                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION       = full provided version string
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              and  the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When
              multiple package configuration files are available  whose  version
              files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspec&#8208;
              ified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest
              or closest version number.


              Config  mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.
              Much of the interface is provided for  completeness  and  for  use
              internally  by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code
              should simply call


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

              in order to find a package.  Package maintainers  providing  CMake
              package  configuration  files  are  encouraged to name and install
              them such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
              requiring use of additional options.


              CMake  constructs  a set of possible installation prefixes for the
              package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
              configuration   file.   The  tables  below  show  the  directories
              searched.  Each entry is meant for  installation  trees  following
              Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A) conventions.


                &lt;prefix&gt;/                                               (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/                                       (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/          (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/                (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)

              On  systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the
              following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles  con&#8208;
              taining a configuration file:


                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/                    (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

              In  all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as case-insensitive and corre&#8208;
              sponds to any of the names specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given  by
              NAMES).  Paths with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURE is set.  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified  the  suffixes  are
              appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.


              This  set  of  directories is intended to work in cooperation with
              projects that provide configuration files  in  their  installation
              trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for instal&#8208;
              lations on Windows where the prefix may point at  the  top  of  an
              application&apos;s  installation  directory.  Those marked with (U) are
              intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the  prefix  is
              shared  by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so all
              (W) and (U) directories  are  still  searched  on  all  platforms.
              Directories  marked  with  (A)  are  intended for installations on
              Apple platforms.  The  cmake  variables  CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  and
              CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE  determine  the order of preference as speci&#8208;
              fied below.


              The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the  follow&#8208;
              ing  steps.   If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_* options are
              enabled.


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;package&gt;_DIR
                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should  be
              paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by
              the location of another item already  found.   Hard-coded  guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH  is  passed.   Path  entries
              ending  in  &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot; are automatically converted to their
              parent directories.


                 PATH

              5. Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake  GUI.
              This  can  be  skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed.  It is
              intended for the case when a user is building  multiple  dependent
              projects one after another.


              6.  Search  paths stored in the CMake user package registry.  This
              can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On Windows
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as  a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory containing the package configuration file.  On UNIX platforms
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory


                ~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;

              as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory  containing  the  package  configuration   file.    See   the
              export(PACKAGE)  command  to  create user package registry entries
              for project build trees.


              7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package registry.  This
              can  be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On
              Windows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the  direc&#8208;
              tory  containing the package configuration file.  There is no sys&#8208;
              tem package registry on non-Windows platforms.


              9. Search paths specified by the PATHS option.   These  are  typi&#8208;
              cally hard-coded guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_package(&lt;package&gt;)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by  setting
              the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
              documentation for the  CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt;  vari&#8208;
              able for more information.


              When   loading   a  find  module  or  package  configuration  file
              find_package defines variables to provide  information  about  the
              call  arguments  (and restores their original state before return&#8208;
              ing):


               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;  = true if component &lt;c&gt; is required
                                              false if component &lt;c&gt; is optional

              In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor  the
              request  detailed  by  these  variables;  see  the find module for
              details.  In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and
              version options automatically but leaves it to the package config&#8208;
              uration file to handle components in a way that  makes  sense  for
              the  package.   The  package  configuration  file  may  set &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND to false to tell find_package that  component  require&#8208;
              ments are not satisfied.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       find_path
              Find the directory containing a file.
&#12;                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many  cases.   It  is the same as find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_path(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find  a  directory  containing  the  named
              file.  A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result
              of this command.  If the file in a directory is found  the  result
              is  stored  in  the  variable  and the search will not be repeated
              unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found,  the  result
              will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the
              next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.   The  name
              of  the  file  in a directory that is searched for is specified by
              the names listed after the  NAMES  argument.    Additional  search
              locations  can  be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var
              is found in the HINTS or PATHS section  the  environment  variable
              var  will be read and converted from a system environment variable
              to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would  be  a
              way  to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will
              be used for the documentation string in the cache.   PATH_SUFFIXES
              specifies  additional  subdirectories  to  check below each search
              path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              When  searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h,
              then the framework search will look  for  A.framework/Headers/b.h.
              If  that  is  found the path will be set to the path to the frame&#8208;
              work. CMake will convert this to the correct -F option to  include
              the file.


       find_program
              Find an executable program.

                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This  is  the  short-hand signature for the command that is suffi&#8208;
              cient in many cases.  It is the same as  find_program(&lt;VAR&gt;  name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_program(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This  command  is  used  to find a program. A cache entry named by
              &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the pro&#8208;
              gram  is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
              will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.   If  nothing
              is  found,  the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will
              be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with  the
              same  variable.   The  name of the program that is searched for is
              specified by the names listed after the  NAMES  argument.    Addi&#8208;
              tional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
              If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the  environment
              variable  var will be read and converted from a system environment
              variable to a cmake style list of paths.   For  example  ENV  PATH
              would  be  a  way  to  list the system path variable. The argument
              after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the  cache.
              PATH_SUFFIXES  specifies  additional subdirectories to check below
              each search path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH


              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       fltk_wrap_ui
              Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.

                fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1
                             source2 ... sourceN )

              Produce  .h  and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed.
              The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a variable  named
              resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS  which  should  be added to your
              library.


       foreach
              Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

                foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endforeach(loop_var)

              All commands between  foreach  and  the  matching  endforeach  are
              recorded without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated,
              the recorded list of commands is invoked once  for  each  argument
              listed  in the original foreach command.  Before each iteration of
              the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot; will be set as a variable with the  current
              value in the list.


                foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
                foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

              Foreach  can also iterate over a generated range of numbers. There
              are three types of this iteration:


              * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to
              &quot;total&quot;.


              *  When  specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from
              the first number to the second number.


              * The third optional number is the increment used to iterate  from
              the first number to the second number.


                foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                                    [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

              Iterates  over  a  precise  list of items.  The LISTS option names
              list-valued variables to be traversed,  including  empty  elements
              (an  empty  string  is a zero-length list).  The ITEMS option ends
              argument parsing and includes all arguments following  it  in  the
              iteration.


       function
              Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

                function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define  a  function  named  &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1
              arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after function, but  before  the
              matching  endfunction,  are  not  invoked  until  the  function is
              invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in  the  func&#8208;
              tion  are  first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1})
              with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In
              addition  to  referencing  the formal parameters you can reference
              the variable ARGC which will be set to  the  number  of  arguments
              passed  into  the  function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which
              will have the actual values  of  the  arguments  passed  in.  This
              facilitates  creating functions with optional arguments. Addition&#8208;
              ally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given  to  the  function
              and  ARGN  holds the list of argument past the last expected argu&#8208;
              ment.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the  behavior  of
              policies inside functions.


       get_cmake_property
              Get a property of the CMake instance.

                get_cmake_property(VAR property)

              Get a property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property
              is stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found,  VAR
              will  be  set  to  &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;.  Some supported properties include:
              VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS, and COMPONENTS.


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_directory_property
              Get a property of DIRECTORY scope.

                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)

              Store a property of directory scope in the named variable.  If the
              property  is not defined the empty-string is returned.  The DIREC&#8208;
              TORY argument specifies another directory from which  to  retrieve
              the  property  value.   The  specified directory must have already
              been traversed by CMake.


                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                                       DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)

              Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form  is  useful
              to get a variable definition from another directory.
&#12;
              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_filename_component
              Get a specific component of a full filename.

                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH
                                       [CACHE])

              Set  &lt;VAR&gt; to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file extension
              (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, the full
              path  (ABSOLUTE),  or  the  full  path  with all symlinks resolved
              (REALPATH).  Note that the path is converted to Unix slashes  for&#8208;
              mat  and  has  no  trailing slashes. The longest file extension is
              always considered. If the optional CACHE  argument  is  specified,
              the result variable is added to the cache.


                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;]
                                       [CACHE])

              The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or
              left as a full path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS  is  present  with  PROGRAM,
              then any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are
              split from the program name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;.  This is used
              to  separate  a  program name from its arguments in a command line
              string.


       get_property
              Get a property.

                get_property(&lt;variable&gt;
                             &lt;GLOBAL             |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                              TARGET    &lt;target&gt; |
                              SOURCE    &lt;source&gt; |
                              TEST      &lt;test&gt;   |
                              CACHE     &lt;entry&gt;  |
                              VARIABLE&gt;
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
                             [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

              Get one property from one object in a scope.  The  first  argument
              specifies  the  variable in which to store the result.  The second
              argument determines the scope from which to get the property.   It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY  scope  defaults  to  the  current directory but another
              directory (already processed by CMake) may be  named  by  full  or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope must name one existing target.


              SOURCE scope must name one source file.


              TEST scope must name one existing test.


              CACHE scope must name one cache entry.


              VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              The  required  PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name
              of the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value
              is  returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to a
              boolean value indicating whether the property has  been  set.   If
              the DEFINED option is given the variable is set to a boolean value
              indicating whether the property has  been  defined  such  as  with
              define_property.  If  BRIEF_DOCS  or  FULL_DOCS  is given then the
              variable is set to  a  string  containing  documentation  for  the
              requested  property.  If documentation is requested for a property
              that has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.


       get_source_file_property
              Get a property for a source file.

                get_source_file_property(VAR file property)

              Get a property from a source file.  The value of the  property  is
              stored  in  the  variable  VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR
              will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use set_source_files_properties to  set
              property  values.   Source file properties usually control how the
              file is built. One property that is always there is LOCATION


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_target_property
              Get a property from a target.

                get_target_property(VAR target property)

              Get a property from a target.    The  value  of  the  property  is
              stored  in  the  variable  VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR
              will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;.  Use set_target_properties to set prop&#8208;
              erty  values.  Properties are usually used to control how a target
              is built, but some query the target instead.  This command can get
              properties  for any target so far created. The targets do not need
              to be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_test_property
              Get a property of the test.

                get_test_property(test property VAR)

              Get a property from the Test.  The value of the property is stored
              in  the  variable  VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be
              set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. For a list of standard properties you can  type
              cmake --help-property-list


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       if     Conditionally execute a group of commands.

                if(expression)
                  # then section.

                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endif(expression)

              Evaluates  the  given expression.  If the result is true, the com&#8208;
              mands in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in
              the  else  section  are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are
              optional. You may have multiple  elseif  clauses.  Note  that  the
              expression  in the else and endif clause is optional. Long expres&#8208;
              sions can be used and there is a traditional order of  precedence.
              Parenthetical  expressions  are  evaluated first followed by unary
              operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED.  Then  any  EQUAL,
              LESS,  GREATER,  STRLESS,  STRGREATER,  STREQUAL,  MATCHES will be
              evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR  operators  will
              be evaluated. Possible expressions are:


                if(&lt;constant&gt;)

              True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
              False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, &quot;&quot;, or ends
              in   the   suffix   &apos;-NOTFOUND&apos;.    Named  boolean  constants  are
              case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these  constants,
              it is treated as a variable:


                if(&lt;variable&gt;)

              True  if  the  variable  is defined to a value that is not a false
              constant.  False otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are  not  vari&#8208;
              ables.)


                if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)

              True if the expression is not true.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if both expressions would be considered true individually.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if either expression would be considered true individually.


                if(COMMAND command-name)

              True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
              invoked.


                if(POLICY policy-id)

              True if the  given  name  is  an  existing  policy  (of  the  form
              CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).


                if(TARGET target-name)
&#12;              True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.


                if(EXISTS file-name)
                if(EXISTS directory-name)

              True   if  the  named  file  or  directory  exists.   Behavior  is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)

              True if file1 is newer than file2 or  if  one  of  the  two  files
              doesn&apos;t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)

              True  if  the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined
              only for full paths.


                if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)

              True  if  the  given  name  is  a  symbolic  link.   Behavior   is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)

              True if the given path is an absolute path.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)

              True  if  the  given  string or variable&apos;s value matches the given
              regular expression.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True if the given string or variable&apos;s value is a valid number and
              the inequality or equality is true.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True  if the given string or variable&apos;s value is lexicographically
              less (or greater, or equal) than the string  or  variable  on  the
              right.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              Component-wise  integer  version number comparison (version format
              is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).


                if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)

              True if the given variable is defined. It does not matter  if  the
              variable is true or false just if it has been set.
&#12;                if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))

              The  expressions  inside  the  parenthesis are evaluated first and
              then the remaining expression is  evaluated  as  in  the  previous
              examples.  Where  there  are  nested parenthesis the innermost are
              evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.


              The if command was written very early in CMake&apos;s history,  predat&#8208;
              ing the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evalu&#8208;
              ates variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signa&#8208;
              tures.   Note  that  normal  variable  evaluation with ${} applies
              before the if command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code
              like


                set(var1 OFF)
                set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;)
                if(${var2})

              appears to the if command as


                if(var1)

              and  is  evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;) case documented
              above.  The result is OFF which is false.  However, if  we  remove
              the ${} from the example then the command sees


                if(var2)

              which  is  true  because  var2 is defined to &quot;var1&quot; which is not a
              false constant.


              Automatic evaluation applies  in  the  other  cases  whenever  the
              above-documented signature accepts &lt;variable|string&gt;:


              1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it
              is a defined variable, if so the variable&apos;s value is used,  other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              2)  If  the  left  hand  argument to MATCHES is missing it returns
              false without error


              3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS  GREATER  EQUAL  are
              independently  tested  to see if they are defined variables, if so
              their defined values are used  otherwise  the  original  value  is
              used.


              4)  Both  left  and  right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STR&#8208;
              GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined  vari&#8208;
              ables,  if so their defined values are used otherwise the original
              value is used.


              5) Both left  and  right  hand  argumemnts  to  VERSION_LESS  VER&#8208;
              SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they
              are defined variables, if so their defined values are used  other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              6)  The  right  hand  argument  to NOT is tested to see if it is a
              boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed
              to be a variable and it is dereferenced.


              7)  The  left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently
              tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they  are  used
              as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are deref&#8208;
              erenced.



       include
              Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

                include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;VAR&gt;]
                                      [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Reads CMake listfile code from the given file.   Commands  in  the
              file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of
              the include command.  If OPTIONAL is present,  then  no  error  is
              raised  if  the  file does not exist.  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given
              the variable will be set to  the  full  filename  which  has  been
              included or NOTFOUND if it failed.


              If  a  module  is  specified instead of a file, the file with name
              &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in
              the CMake module directory. There is one exception to this: if the
              file which calls include() is located itself in the  CMake  module
              directory,  then  first the CMake module directory is searched and
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       include_directories
              Add include directories to the build.

                include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2 ...)

              Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for
              include files. These directories are added to the directory  prop&#8208;
              erty INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES for the current CMakeLists file. They are
              also added to the target  property  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES  for  each
              target  in the current CMakeLists file. The target property values
              are the ones used by the generators.


              By default the directories are appended onto the current  list  of
              directories.  This  default  behavior  can  be  changed by setting
              CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE to ON. By using AFTER  or  BEFORE
              explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, inde&#8208;
              pendent of the default. If the SYSTEM option is  given,  the  com&#8208;
              piler  will  be  told  the directories are meant as system include
              directories on some platforms.


       include_external_msproject
              Include an external Microsoft project file in a workspace.

                include_external_msproject(projectname location
                                           [TYPE projectTypeGUID]
                                           [GUID projectGUID]
                                           [PLATFORM platformName]
                                           dep1 dep2 ...)

              Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated  workspace
              file.   Currently  does nothing on UNIX. This will create a target
              named [projectname].  This can be  used  in  the  add_dependencies
              command to make things depend on the external project.


              TYPE,  GUID and PLATFORM are optional parameters that allow one to
              specify the type of project, id (GUID) of the project and the name
              of  the  target  platform.   This is useful for projects requiring
              values other than the default (e.g. WIX projects).  These  options
              are not supported by the Visual Studio 6 generator.


       include_regular_expression
              Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.

                include_regular_expression(regex_match [regex_complain])

              Set  the  regular  expressions  used in dependency checking.  Only
              files matching regex_match will be traced as  dependencies.   Only
              files  matching regex_complain will generate warnings if they can&#8208;
              not be found  (standard  header  paths  are  not  searched).   The
              defaults are:


                regex_match    = &quot;^.*$&quot; (match everything)
                regex_complain = &quot;^$&quot; (match empty string only)


       install
              Specify rules to run at install time.

              This  command  generates  installation rules for a project.  Rules
              specified by calls to this command within a source  directory  are
              executed  in order during installation.  The order across directo&#8208;
              ries is not defined.


              There are multiple signatures for  this  command.   Some  of  them
              define  installation properties for files and targets.  Properties
              common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are  valid
              only for signatures that specify them.


              DESTINATION  arguments  specify  the  directory on disk to which a
              file will be installed.  If a full path (with a leading  slash  or
              drive letter) is given it is used directly.  If a relative path is
              given   it   is   interpreted   relative   to   the    value    of
              CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


              PERMISSIONS  arguments  specify  permissions  for installed files.
              Valid  permissions  are  OWNER_READ,  OWNER_WRITE,  OWNER_EXECUTE,
              GROUP_READ,  GROUP_WRITE,  GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE,
              WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.  Permissions that do  not  make
              sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.


              The  CONFIGURATIONS  argument specifies a list of build configura&#8208;
              tions for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).


              The COMPONENT argument specifies an  installation  component  name
              with  which  the  install rule is associated, such as &quot;runtime&quot; or
              &quot;development&quot;.   During   component-specific   installation   only
              install  rules  associated  with  the given component name will be
              executed.   During  a  full  installation   all   components   are
              installed.  If  COMPONENT  is  not  provided  a  default component
              &quot;Unspecified&quot; is created. The default component name may  be  con&#8208;
              trolled with the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME variable.


              The  RENAME  argument  specifies a name for an installed file that
              may be different from the original file.  Renaming is allowed only
              when a single file is installed by the command.


              The  OPTIONAL  argument  specifies  that it is not an error if the
              file to be installed does not exist.


              The TARGETS signature:


                install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
                        [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
                          PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
                         [DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
                         [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                         [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                         [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                         [OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
                        ] [...])

              The TARGETS form specifies rules for  installing  targets  from  a
              project.   There  are  five  kinds  of  target  files  that may be
              installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and BUNDLE.  Exe&#8208;
              cutables  are treated as RUNTIME targets, except that those marked
              with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are treated as BUNDLE  targets  on
              OS X. Static libraries are always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Mod&#8208;
              ule libraries are always treated as LIBRARY targets.  For  non-DLL
              platforms  shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except
              that those marked with  the  FRAMEWORK  property  are  treated  as
              FRAMEWORK  targets  on  OS X.  For DLL platforms the DLL part of a
              shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the  correspond&#8208;
              ing  import  library  is  treated  as  an ARCHIVE target. All Win&#8208;
              dows-based systems including Cygwin are  DLL  platforms.  The  AR&#8208;
              CHIVE,  LIBRARY,  RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK arguments change the type
              of target to which the subsequent properties apply.   If  none  is
              given  the  installation properties apply to all target types.  If
              only one is given then only targets of that type will be installed
              (which  can  be  used  to  install  just  a  DLL or just an import
              library).


              The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and  RESOURCE  arguments  cause
              subsequent  properties  to  be  applied  to installing a FRAMEWORK
              shared library target&apos;s associated files on  non-Apple  platforms.
              Rules  defined  by  these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms
              because the associated files are installed  into  the  appropriate
              locations  inside  the framework folder.  See documentation of the
              PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties  for
              details.


              Either  NAMELINK_ONLY  or  NAMELINK_SKIP  may  be  specified  as a
              LIBRARY option.  On some platforms a versioned shared library  has
              a symbolic link such as


                lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1

              where   &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1&quot;   is   the  soname  of  the  library  and
              &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so&quot; is  a  &quot;namelink&quot;  allowing  linkers  to  find  the
              library  when  given  &quot;-l&lt;name&gt;&quot;.  The NAMELINK_ONLY option causes
              installation of  only  the  namelink  when  a  library  target  is
              installed.    The  NAMELINK_SKIP  option  causes  installation  of
              library files other than the namelink when  a  library  target  is
              installed.   When  neither  option  is  given  both  portions  are
              installed.  On platforms where versioned shared libraries  do  not
              have   namelinks   or   when   a  library  is  not  versioned  the
              NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library  and  the  NAMELINK_ONLY
              option  installs  nothing.   See  the VERSION and SOVERSION target
              properties for details on creating versioned shared libraries.


              One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call
              to  the  TARGETS  form of this command.  A target may be installed
              more than once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical tar&#8208;
              gets &quot;myExe&quot;, &quot;mySharedLib&quot;, and &quot;myStaticLib&quot;.  The code


                  install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
                          RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
                          LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
                          ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
                  install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)

              will  install  myExe  to  &lt;prefix&gt;/bin  and  myStaticLib  to &lt;pre&#8208;
              fix&gt;/lib/static.   On  non-DLL  platforms  mySharedLib   will   be
              installed  to  &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.  On DLL platforms
              the  mySharedLib  DLL  will  be  installed  to  &lt;prefix&gt;/bin   and
              /some/full/path  and its import library will be installed to &lt;pre&#8208;
              fix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path.


              The EXPORT option associates the installed target  files  with  an
              export  called  &lt;export-name&gt;.  It must appear before any RUNTIME,
              LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options.  To actually install the export  file
              itself,   call   install(EXPORT).    See   documentation   of  the
              install(EXPORT ...) signature below for details.


              Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to  true  has  unde&#8208;
              fined behavior.


              The FILES signature:


                install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                        [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                        [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                        [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                        [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])

              The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for a project.
              File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to
              the current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by
              default given permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and
              WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argument is given.


              The PROGRAMS signature:


                install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                        [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                        [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                        [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                        [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])

              The  PROGRAMS  form is identical to the FILES form except that the
              default permissions for the installed file also include OWNER_EXE&#8208;
              CUTE,  GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.  This form is intended to
              install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use
              the TARGETS form to install targets built within the project.


              The DIRECTORY signature:


                install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                        [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                        [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                        [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]
                        [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                        [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [FILES_MATCHING]
                        [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                         [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

              The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more directories to
              a given destination.  The directory structure is  copied  verbatim
              to  the destination.  The last component of each directory name is
              appended to the destination directory but a trailing slash may  be
              used  to  avoid  this  because it leaves the last component empty.
              Directory names given  as  relative  paths  are  interpreted  with
              respect  to  the  current source directory.  If no input directory
              names are given the destination  directory  will  be  created  but
              nothing  will  be  installed  into  it.   The FILE_PERMISSIONS and
              DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given  to  files
              and  directories in the destination.  If USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is
              specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is not, file  permissions  will  be
              copied from the source directory structure.  If no permissions are
              specified files will be given the default permissions specified in
              the  FILES  form of the command, and the directories will be given
              the default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the com&#8208;
              mand.


              Installation  of directories may be controlled with fine granular&#8208;
              ity using the PATTERN or REGEX  options.   These  &quot;match&quot;  options
              specify a globbing pattern or regular expression to match directo&#8208;
              ries or files encountered within input directories.  They  may  be
              used to apply certain options (see below) to a subset of the files
              and directories encountered.  The full path to each input file  or
              directory  (with  forward  slashes) is matched against the expres&#8208;
              sion.  A PATTERN will match only complete file names: the  portion
              of the full path matching the pattern must occur at the end of the
              file name and be preceded by a slash.  A REGEX will match any por&#8208;
              tion  of  the full path but it may use &apos;/&apos; and &apos;$&apos; to simulate the
              PATTERN behavior.   By  default  all  files  and  directories  are
              installed  whether  or  not  they are matched.  The FILES_MATCHING
              option may be given before  the  first  match  option  to  disable
              installation  of  files  (but  not directories) not matched by any
              expression.  For example, the code


                install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
                        FILES_MATCHING PATTERN &quot;*.h&quot;)

              will extract and install header files from a source tree.


              Some options may follow a PATTERN  or  REGEX  expression  and  are
              applied  only  to files or directories matching them.  The EXCLUDE
              option will skip the matched file or directory.   The  PERMISSIONS
              option  overrides  the permissions setting for the matched file or
              directory.  For example the code


                install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
                        PATTERN &quot;CVS&quot; EXCLUDE
                        PATTERN &quot;scripts/*&quot;
                        PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                                    GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)

              will install the icons directory  to  share/myproj/icons  and  the
              scripts  directory  to  share/myproj.   The icons will get default
              file permissions, the scripts will be given specific  permissions,
              and any CVS directories will be excluded.


              The SCRIPT and CODE signature:


                install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]] [...])

              The  SCRIPT  form  will invoke the given CMake script files during
              installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it  will
              be  interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The
              CODE form will invoke the given CMake  code  during  installation.
              Code  is  specified  as  a  single argument inside a double-quoted
              string. For example, the code


                install(CODE &quot;MESSAGE(\&quot;Sample install message.\&quot;)&quot;)

              will print a message during installation.


              The EXPORT signature:


                install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                        [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE &lt;name&gt;.cmake]
                        [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                        [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
                        [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])

              The EXPORT form generates and installs  a  CMake  file  containing
              code  to  import  targets  from the installation tree into another
              project.  Target installations  are  associated  with  the  export
              &lt;export-name&gt;  using the EXPORT option of the install(TARGETS ...)
              signature documented above.  The  NAMESPACE  option  will  prepend
              &lt;namespace&gt;  to the target names as they are written to the import
              file.   By   default   the   generated   file   will   be   called
              &lt;export-name&gt;.cmake  but  the FILE option may be used to specify a
              different name.  The value given to the FILE option must be a file
              name  with  the &quot;.cmake&quot; extension.  If a CONFIGURATIONS option is
              given then the file will only be installed when one of  the  named
              configurations  is  installed.  Additionally, the generated import
              file will reference only the matching target configurations.  If a
              COMPONENT  option  is  specified that does not match that given to
              the targets associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the  behavior  is  unde&#8208;
              fined.  If a library target is included in the export but a target
              to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.


              The EXPORT form is useful to help  outside  projects  use  targets
              built and installed by the current project.  For example, the code


                install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
                install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)

              will  install  the  executable  myexe  to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and code to
              import it in the file &quot;&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake&quot;.  An out&#8208;
              side  project may load this file with the include command and ref&#8208;
              erence the myexe executable from the installation tree  using  the
              imported  target  name mp_myexe as if the target were built in its
              own tree.


              NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS command and  the
              target  properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT.  It
              also  replaces  the  FILES  forms   of   the   INSTALL_FILES   and
              INSTALL_PROGRAMS  commands.  The processing order of these install
              rules   relative   to   those   generated   by    INSTALL_TARGETS,
              INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands is not defined.



       link_directories
              Specify directories in which the linker will look for libraries.
&#12;                link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)

              Specify the paths in which the linker should search for libraries.
              The command will apply only to targets created after it is called.
              For  historical  reasons, relative paths given to this command are
              passed to the linker unchanged (unlike many CMake  commands  which
              interpret them relative to the current source directory).


              Note  that  this  command  is rarely necessary.  Library locations
              returned by find_package() and find_library() are absolute  paths.
              Pass  these  absolute  library  file  paths  directly  to the tar&#8208;
              get_link_libraries() command.  CMake will ensure the linker  finds
              them.


       list   List operations.

                list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element index&gt; ...]
                     &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(APPEND &lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_ITEM &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;)
                list(REVERSE &lt;list&gt;)
                list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)

              LENGTH will return a given list&apos;s length.


              GET  will  return  list  of elements specified by indices from the
              list.


              APPEND will append elements to the list.


              FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or
              -1 if it wasn&apos;t found.


              INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.


              REMOVE_AT  and  REMOVE_ITEM  will  remove items from the list. The
              difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items,  while
              REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.


              REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.


              REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.


              SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.


              The  list  subcommands  APPEND,  INSERT,  REMOVE_AT,  REMOVE_ITEM,
              REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for  the
              list  within  the current CMake variable scope. Similar to the SET
              command, the LIST command creates new variable values in the  cur&#8208;
              rent  scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a par&#8208;
              ent scope. To propagate the results of these  operations  upwards,
              use  SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other
              means of value propagation.


              NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To  cre&#8208;
              ate a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c
              d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) cre&#8208;
              ates a string or a list with one item in it.


              When  specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or greater,
              it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0  representing
              the  first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is
              indexed from the end of the list, with -1  representing  the  last
              list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they
              do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the  first  list  ele&#8208;
              ment.



       load_cache
              Load in the values from another project&apos;s CMake cache.

                load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX
                           prefix entry1...)

              Read  the  cache and store the requested entries in variables with
              their name prefixed with the given prefix.  This  only  reads  the
              values, and does not create entries in the local project&apos;s cache.


                load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
                           [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])

              Load  in the values from another cache and store them in the local
              project&apos;s cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project
              that  depends  on  another  project  built  in  a  different tree.
              EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a  list  of  entries  to  be
              excluded.   INCLUDE_INTERNALS  can  be  used  to provide a list of
              internal entries to be included.  Normally,  no  internal  entries
              are  brought in.  Use of this form of the command is strongly dis&#8208;
              couraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility.


       load_command
              Load a command into a running CMake.

                load_command(COMMAND_NAME &lt;loc1&gt; [loc2 ...])

              The given locations are searched  for  a  library  whose  name  is
              cmCOMMAND_NAME.   If  found, it is loaded as a module and the com&#8208;
              mand is added to the set of available  CMake  commands.   Usually,
              TRY_COMPILE  is used before this command to compile the module. If
              the command is successfully loaded a variable named


                CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_&lt;COMMAND_NAME&gt;

              will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded.   Oth&#8208;
              erwise the variable will not be set.


       macro  Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

                macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define  a  macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1 arg2
              arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the  matching
              endmacro,  are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is
              invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified  by
              replacing  formal  parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed,
              and then invoked as normal commands. In  addition  to  referencing
              the  formal  parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which
              will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as
              well  as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual
              values of the  arguments  passed  in.  This  facilitates  creating
              macros  with  optional  arguments.  Additionally ${ARGV} holds the
              list of all arguments given to the macro  and  ${ARGN}  holds  the
              list  of  argument  past the last expected argument. Note that the
              parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in
              the  usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the
              c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake vari&#8208;
              ables you should look at the function command.


              See  the  cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of
              policies inside macros.


       mark_as_advanced
              Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

                mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)

              Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
              will  not  be  displayed  in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show
              advanced option is on.  If CLEAR is the  first  argument  advanced
              variables  are  changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is the first
              argument, then the variable is made advanced.   If  neither  FORCE
              nor CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but
              if the variable already has  an  advanced/non-advanced  state,  it
              will not be changed.


              It does nothing in script mode.


       math   Mathematical expressions.

                math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math expression&gt;)

              EXPR  evaluates  mathematical  expression and return result in the
              output variable. Example mathematical expression is &apos;5 * ( 10 + 13
              )&apos;.   Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %.  They
              have the same meaning  as they do in c code.


       message
              Display a message to the user.

                message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
                        &quot;message to display&quot; ...)

              The optional keyword determines the type of message:

              The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and
              all  other  message  types  on stderr.  The CMake GUI displays all
              messages in its log area.  The  interactive  dialogs  (ccmake  and
              CMakeSetup)  show  STATUS  messages one at a time on a status line
              and other messages in interactive pop-up boxes.


              CMake Warning and Error  message  text  displays  using  a  simple

       option Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

                option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string describing option&quot;
                       [initial value])

              Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no ini&#8208;
              tial value is provided, OFF is used.


              If you have options that depend on the values  of  other  options,
              see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.


       project
              Set a name for the entire project.

                project(&lt;projectname&gt; [languageName1 languageName2 ... ] )

              Sets  the  name  of the project.  Additionally this sets the vari&#8208;
              ables &lt;projectName&gt;_BINARY_DIR and &lt;projectName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR to the
              respective values.


              Optionally  you can specify which languages your project supports.
              Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C, Fortran, etc. By  default
              C  and  CXX  are enabled.  E.g. if you do not have a C++ compiler,
              you can disable the check for it by explicitly  listing  the  lan&#8208;
              guages you want to support, e.g. C.  By using the special language
              &quot;NONE&quot; all checks for any language can be disabled. If a  variable
              exists   called   CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;projectName&gt;_INCLUDE,   the  file
              pointed to by that variable will be included as the last  step  of
              the project command.


       qt_wrap_cpp
              Create Qt Wrappers.

                qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName
                            SourceLists ...)

              Produce  moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.
              The moc files will be added to  the  library  using  the  DestName
              source list.


       qt_wrap_ui
              Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.

                qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
                           SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)

              Produce  .h  and  .cxx  files  for all the .ui files listed in the
              SourceLists.  The .h files will be added to the library using  the
              HeadersDestNamesource  list.   The .cxx files will be added to the
              library using the SourcesDestNamesource list.


       remove_definitions
              Removes -D define flags added by add_definitions.

                remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

              Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the compiler command
              line for sources in the current directory and below.


       return Return from a file, directory or function.

                return()

              Returns  from  a file, directory or function. When this command is
              encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()),
              it  causes  processing  of the current file to stop and control is
              returned to the including file. If it is  encountered  in  a  file
              which is not included by another file, e.g. a CMakeLists.txt, con&#8208;
              trol is returned to the parent  directory  if  there  is  one.  If
              return  is called in a function, control is returned to the caller
              of the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does  not
              handle return like a function does.


       separate_arguments
              Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

                separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt; &lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)

              Parses  a  unix- or windows-style command-line string &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; and
              stores a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;.   The
              entire command line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; argument.


              The  UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.
              It recognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs.   A  back&#8208;
              slash  escapes  the next literal character (\&quot; is &quot;); there are no
              special escapes (\n is just n).


              The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line  using  the
              same syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.
              It separates arguments by whitespace that  is  not  double-quoted.
              Backslashes  are  literal  unless they precede double-quotes.  See
              the MSDN article &quot;Parsing C Command-Line Arguments&quot; for details.


                separate_arguments(VARIABLE)

              Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list.  All
              spaces  are replaced with &apos;;&apos;.  This helps with generating command
              lines.


       set    Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a given value.

                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;
                    [[CACHE &lt;type&gt; &lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])

              Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the  value  &lt;value&gt;.   &lt;value&gt;  is
              expanded before &lt;variable&gt; is set to it.  Normally, set will set a
              regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then  the  &lt;variable&gt;
              is  put  in  the cache instead, unless it is already in the cache.
              See section &apos;Variable types in CMake&apos; below for details of regular
              and  cache  variables  and  their  interactions. If CACHE is used,
              &lt;type&gt; and &lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by  the  CMake
              GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value. The value
              for &lt;type&gt; may be one of


                FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
                PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
                STRING   = Arbitrary string.
                BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
                INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).

              If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked  as  internal,
              and will not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui. This is
              intended for values that should be persisted  in  the  cache,  but
              which users should not normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.


              Normally,  set(...CACHE...)  creates cache variables, but does not
              modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of the  cache  vari&#8208;
              able  is  set,  even if the variable is already in the cache. This
              should normally be avoided, as it will remove any changes  to  the
              cache variable&apos;s value by the user.


              If  PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope
              above the current scope. Each new directory or function creates  a
              new  scope. This command will set the value of a variable into the
              parent directory or calling function (whichever is  applicable  to
              the case at hand). PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.


              If  &lt;value&gt;  is not specified then the variable is removed instead
              of set.  See also: the unset() command.


                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ... &lt;valueN&gt;)

              In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon  separated  list  of
              values.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )

              in which case the environment variable will be set.


              *** Variable types in CMake ***


              In  CMake  there  are two types of variables: normal variables and
              cache variables. Normal variables are meant for the  internal  use
              of the script (just like variables in most programming languages);
              they are not persisted across CMake runs. Cache variables  (unless
              set  with INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings
              where the first CMake run determines  a  suitable  default  value,
              which  the user can then override, by editing the cache with tools
              such as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables  are  stored  in  the
              CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.


              Both  types can exist at the same time with the same name but dif&#8208;
              ferent values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks  for  a
              normal  variable &apos;FOO&apos; in scope and uses it if set. If and only if
              no normal variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              Some examples:


              The  code  &apos;set(FOO  &quot;x&quot;)&apos; sets the normal variable &apos;FOO&apos;. It does
              not touch the cache, but it will hide  any  existing  cache  value
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              The  code  &apos;set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...)&apos; checks for &apos;FOO&apos; in the cache,
              ignoring any normal variable of the same name. If &apos;FOO&apos; is in  the
              cache  then  nothing  happens to either the normal variable or the
              cache variable. If &apos;FOO&apos; is not in the cache, then it is added  to
              the cache.


              Finally,  whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a com&#8208;
              mand, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of  the  same  name
              from the current scope so that an immediately following evaluation
              of it will expose the newly cached value.


              Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of
              the same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow. However,
              in some situations it can be useful. One  example  (used  by  some
              projects):


              A  project  has a subproject in its source tree. The child project
              has its own CMakeLists.txt, which  is  included  from  the  parent
              CMakeLists.txt  using  add_subdirectory().  Now, if the parent and
              the child project provide the same option (for example a  compiler
              option),  the  parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable
              option to the cache. Normally, the child would then use  the  same
              value  that  the  parent  uses.  However,  it  may be necessary to
              hard-code the value for the child  project&apos;s  option  while  still
              allowing  the  user  to edit the value used by the parent project.
              The parent project can achieve this simply  by  setting  a  normal
              variable with the same name as the option in a scope sufficient to
              hide the option&apos;s cache variable from the  child  completely.  The
              parent  has  already  set  the  cache  variable,   so  the child&apos;s
              set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the option  vari&#8208;
              able  will use the value from the normal variable, which hides the
              cache variable.


       set_directory_properties
              Set a property of the directory.

                set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

              Set a property for the current directory  and  subdirectories.  If
              the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The proper&#8208;
              ties include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, INCLUDE_REGU&#8208;
              LAR_EXPRESSION,     and     ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.     ADDI&#8208;
              TIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as
              a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       set_property
              Set a named property in a given scope.

                set_property(&lt;GLOBAL                            |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                              TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                              SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                              TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]     |
                              CACHE     [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
                             [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1 [value2 ...]])

              Set  one  property  on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first
              argument determines the scope in which the property  is  set.   It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY  scope  defaults  to  the  current directory but another
              directory (already processed by CMake) may be  named  by  full  or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.


              SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
              file properties are visible only to  targets  added  in  the  same
              directory (CMakeLists.txt).


              TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.


              CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.


              The  required  PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name
              of the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used  to  compose
              the  property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.  If
              the APPEND option is given the list is appended  to  any  existing
              property  value.If the APPEND_STRING option is given the string is
              append to any existing property value as string, i.e.  it  results
              in a longer string and not a list of strings.


       set_source_files_properties
              Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

                set_source_files_properties([file1 [file2 [...]]]
                                            PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                                            [prop2 value2 [...]])

              Set  properties  associated  with  source  files using a key/value
              paired list.  See properties  documentation  for  those  known  to
              CMake.   Unrecognized properties are ignored.  Source file proper&#8208;
              ties are visible only to  targets  added  in  the  same  directory
              (CMakeLists.txt).


       set_target_properties
              Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

                set_target_properties(target1 target2 ...
                                      PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                                      prop2 value2 ...)

              Set  properties on a target. The syntax for the command is to list
              all the files you want to change, and then provide the values  you
              want  to  set  next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and
              extract it later with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.


              Properties that affect the name of a target&apos;s output file  are  as
              follows.   The  PREFIX  and SUFFIX properties override the default
              target name prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) and  suffix  (such  as  &quot;.so&quot;).
              IMPORT_PREFIX  and IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for
              the import library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library tar&#8208;
              gets).   OUTPUT_NAME  sets  the  real  name of a target when it is
              built and can be used to help create two targets of the same  name
              even  though CMake requires unique logical target names.  There is
              also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set  the  output  name  on  a
              per-configuration  basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the
              real name of the target when it is built under  the  configuration
              named  by  &lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as &quot;DEBUG_POSTFIX&quot;).  The
              value of this property is initialized when the target  is  created
              to  the  value  of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for
              executable targets because earlier CMake versions  which  did  not
              use this variable for executables).


              The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
              step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to  the  configura&#8208;
              tion &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDE&#8208;
              BINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the  name  of  the  preprocessor  symbol
              defined  when  compiling  sources  in a shared library. If not set
              here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with  some  sub&#8208;
              stitutions  if  the  target  is not a valid C identifier). This is
              useful for headers to know whether they are  being  included  from
              inside   their   library  or  outside  to  properly  setup  dllex&#8208;
              port/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets  addi&#8208;
              tional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  It
              may also be used to pass additional preprocessor definitions.


              The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the  tool  used  to
              link  an executable or shared library. The default is set the lan&#8208;
              guage to match the files in the library. CXX and C are common val&#8208;
              ues for this property.


              For  shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify
              the build version and api version respectively. When  building  or
              installing  appropriate  symlinks are created if the platform sup&#8208;
              ports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If  only  one  of
              both  is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version
              number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify  the  build
              version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are cre&#8208;
              ated if the platform supports symlinks. For shared  libraries  and
              executables  on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract
              a &quot;major.minor&quot; version number. These  numbers  are  used  as  the
              image version of the binary.


              There   are   a  few  properties  used  to  specify  RPATH  rules.
              INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying  the  rpath
              to  use  in  installed  targets  (for  platforms that support it).
              INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true  will
              append  directories  in  the  linker  search  path and outside the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH. SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean speci&#8208;
              fying  whether  to  skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing
              the target to run from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is
              a  boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree
              with   the   INSTALL_RPATH.    This    takes    precedence    over
              SKIP_BUILD_RPATH  and avoids the need for relinking before instal&#8208;
              lation.  INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a  string  specifying  the  directory
              portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries on Mac OSX
              to use in the installed targets. When the target  is  created  the
              values       of       the      variables      CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH,
              CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH,         CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH,
              CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH,   and  CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR  are
              used to initialize these properties.


              PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target  in  an
              IDE  like visual studio.  VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the vis&#8208;
              ual studio keyword, for example QT  integration  works  better  if
              this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.


              VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME,    VS_SCC_LOCALPATH,    VS_SCC_PROVIDER    and
              VS_SCC_AUXPATH can be set to add support for source control  bind&#8208;
              ings in a  Visual Studio project file.


              VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;   can   be   set   to  add  a  Visual  Studio
              project-specific global variable. Qt integration works  better  if
              VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion  is set to the Qt version FindQt4.cmake found.
              For example, &quot;4.7.3&quot;


              The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are  the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS  command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL com&#8208;
              mand instead.


              The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual stu&#8208;
              dio  generators.  If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of
              the default build when you select &quot;Build Solution&quot;.


       set_tests_properties
              Set a property of the tests.

                set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

              Set a property for the tests. If the property is not found,  CMake
              will report an error. The properties include:


              WILL_FAIL:  If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of
              the test.


              PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will  be  checked
              against  the specified regular expressions and at least one of the
              regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will fail.


                Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION &quot;TestPassed;All ok&quot;

              FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will match  to  one
              of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.


                Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION &quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;

              Both  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION expect a
              list of regular expressions.


              TIMEOUT: Setting this will limit the test runtime to the number of
              seconds specified.



       site_name
              Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

                site_name(variable)


       source_group
              Define a grouping for sources in the makefile.

                source_group(name [REGULAR_EXPRESSION regex] [FILES src1 src2 ...])

              Defines  a  group  into  which  sources  will be placed in project
              files.  This is mainly used to setup file tabs in  Visual  Studio.
              Any  file  whose  name is listed or matches the regular expression
              will be placed in this group.  If a file matches multiple  groups,
              the  LAST group that explicitly lists the file will be favored, if
              any.  If no group explicitly lists the file, the LAST group  whose
              regular expression matches the file will be favored.


              The  name  of  the  group  may contain backslashes to specify sub&#8208;
              groups:


                source_group(outer\\inner ...)

              For backwards compatibility, this command  is  also  supports  the
              format:


                source_group(name regex)


       string String operations.

                string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt;
                       &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
                string(REGEX MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt;
                       &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
                string(REGEX REPLACE &lt;regular_expression&gt;
                       &lt;replace_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
                       &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
                string(REPLACE &lt;match_string&gt;
                       &lt;replace_string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
                       &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
                string(&lt;MD5|SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512&gt;
                       &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt;)
                string(COMPARE EQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(COMPARE LESS &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(COMPARE GREATER &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(ASCII &lt;number&gt; [&lt;number&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(CONFIGURE &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
                       [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])
                string(TOUPPER &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(TOLOWER &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(LENGTH &lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(SUBSTRING &lt;string&gt; &lt;begin&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(STRIP &lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(RANDOM [LENGTH &lt;length&gt;] [ALPHABET &lt;alphabet&gt;]
                       [RANDOM_SEED &lt;seed&gt;] &lt;output variable&gt;)
                string(FIND &lt;string&gt; &lt;substring&gt; &lt;output variable&gt; [REVERSE])

              REGEX  MATCH  will match the regular expression once and store the
              match in the output variable.


              REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times  as
              possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.


              REGEX  REPLACE  will match the regular expression as many times as
              possible and substitute the replacement expression for  the  match
              in  the  output.  The replace expression may refer to paren-delim&#8208;
              ited subexpressions of the match using \1, \2, ..., \9.  Note that
              two  backslashes  (\\1)  are required in CMake code to get a back&#8208;
              slash through argument parsing.


              REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the  input
              with replace_string and store the result in the output.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the input string.


              COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the  strings  and
              store true or false in the output variable.


              ASCII  will  convert  all numbers into corresponding ASCII charac&#8208;
              ters.


              CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a
              file.


              TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.


              LENGTH will return a given string&apos;s length.


              SUBSTRING  will return a substring of a given string. If length is
              -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin will be returned.


              STRIP will return a substring of a given string with  leading  and
              trailing spaces removed.


              RANDOM  will  return a random string of given length consisting of
              characters from the given alphabet. Default length is 5 characters
              and  default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case let&#8208;
              ters.  If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be  used
              to seed the random number generator.


              FIND  will return the position where the given substring was found
              in the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was used, the  command
              will  search for the position of the last occurrence of the speci&#8208;
              fied substring.


              The following characters have special meaning in  regular  expres&#8208;
              sions:


                 ^         Matches at beginning of a line
                 $         Matches at end of a line
                 .         Matches any single character
                 [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
                 [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
                  -        Matches any character in range on either side of a dash
                 *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
                 +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
                 ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
                 |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
                 ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced
                           in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved
                           by all regular expression-related commands, including
                           e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).


       target_link_libraries
              Link a target to given libraries.

                target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; [item1 [item2 [...]]]
                                      [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;item&gt;] ...)

              Specify  libraries  or  flags  to use when linking a given target.
              The named &lt;target&gt; must have been created in the current directory
              by a command such as add_executable or add_library.  The remaining
              arguments specify library names or flags.  Repeated calls for  the
              same &lt;target&gt; append items in the order called.


              If  a library name matches that of another target in the project a
              dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make
              sure  the  library  being  linked  is up-to-date before the target
              links.  Item names starting with &apos;-&apos;, but  not  &apos;-l&apos;  or  &apos;-frame&#8208;
              work&apos;, are treated as linker flags.


              A  &quot;debug&quot;,  &quot;optimized&quot;,  or &quot;general&quot; keyword indicates that the
              library immediately following it is to be used only for the corre&#8208;
              sponding  build configuration.  The &quot;debug&quot; keyword corresponds to
              the  Debug  configuration  (or  to  configurations  named  in  the
              DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS  global  property  if it is set).  The &quot;opti&#8208;
              mized&quot; keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The &quot;gen&#8208;
              eral&quot;  keyword  corresponds  to  all configurations, and is purely
              optional (assumed if omitted).  Higher granularity may be achieved
              for  per-configuration  rules  by creating and linking to IMPORTED
              library targets.  See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command
              for more information.


              Library  dependencies are transitive by default.  When this target
              is linked into another target then the libraries  linked  to  this
              target will appear on the link line for the other target too.  See
              the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override  the  set
              of transitive link dependencies for a target.


                target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
                                      [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...)

              The  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  mode  appends  the libraries to the
              LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration equivalent tar&#8208;
              get properties instead of using them for linking.  Libraries spec&#8208;
              ified  as  &quot;debug&quot;   are   appended   to   the   the   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG  property (or to the properties corresponding
              to configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global  prop&#8208;
              erty  if  it  is  set).   Libraries  specified  as &quot;optimized&quot; are
              appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.   Libraries
              specified  as &quot;general&quot; (or without any keyword) are treated as if
              specified for both &quot;debug&quot; and &quot;optimized&quot;.


                target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
                                      &lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt;
                                        [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...
                                      [&lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt;
                                        [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...])

              The LINK_PUBLIC and LINK_PRIVATE modes can be used to specify both
              the  link  dependencies  and  the  link  interface in one command.
              Libraries and targets following LINK_PUBLIC are linked to, and are
              made  part  of the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES. Libraries and targets
              following LINK_PRIVATE are linked to, but are not made part of the
              LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.


              The  library  dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in
              the case of mutually-dependent STATIC libraries CMake  allows  the
              graph  to  contain  cycles  (strongly connected components).  When
              another target links to one of the  libraries  CMake  repeats  the
              entire connected component.  For example, the code


                add_library(A STATIC a.c)
                add_library(B STATIC b.c)
                target_link_libraries(A B)
                target_link_libraries(B A)
                add_executable(main main.c)
                target_link_libraries(main A)

              links  &apos;main&apos; to &apos;A B A B&apos;.  (While one repetition is usually suf&#8208;
              ficient, pathological object  file  and  symbol  arrangements  can
              require more.  One may handle such cases by manually repeating the
              component in the last target_link_libraries call.  However, if two
              archives are really so interdependent they should probably be com&#8208;
              bined into a single archive.)


       try_compile
              Try building some code.

                try_compile(RESULT_VAR &lt;bindir&gt; &lt;srcdir&gt;
                            &lt;projectName&gt; [targetName] [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]
                            [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;])

              Try building a project.  In this form,  srcdir  should  contain  a
              complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file and all sources.
              The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted after  this  command  is
              run.  Specify targetName to build a specific target instead of the
              &apos;all&apos; or &apos;ALL_BUILD&apos; target.


                try_compile(RESULT_VAR &lt;bindir&gt; &lt;srcfile&gt;
                            [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]
                            [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS flags...]
                            [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                            [COPY_FILE &lt;fileName&gt;])

              Try building a source file into an executable.  In this  form  the
              user  need only supply a source file that defines a &apos;main&apos;.  CMake
              will create a CMakeLists.txt file to build the source as  an  exe&#8208;
              cutable.  Specify COPY_FILE to get a copy of the linked executable
              at the given fileName.


              In this version all files in  bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp  will  be
              cleaned  automatically.  For  debugging, --debug-trycompile can be
              passed to cmake to avoid this clean. However, multiple  sequential
              try_compile  operations reuse this single output directory. If you
              use --debug-trycompile, you can only debug one try_compile call at
              a  time.  The recommended procedure is to configure with cmake all
              the way through once, then delete the cache entry associated  with
              the try_compile call of interest, and then re-run cmake again with
              --debug-trycompile.


              Some extra flags that can be included  are,   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,
              LINK_DIRECTORIES,  and  LINK_LIBRARIES.   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  are
              -Ddefinition that will be passed to the compile line.  try_compile
              creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that looks like this:


                add_definitions( &lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from calling cmake&gt;)
                include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
                link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
                add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
                target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})

              In  both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified,
              then the output from the build process  is  stored  in  the  given
              variable.  The success or failure of the try_compile, i.e. TRUE or
              FALSE respectively, is returned in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can  be
              used  to pass -DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run dur&#8208;
              ing the build.  Set  variable  CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION  to
              choose a build configuration.


       try_run
              Try compiling and then running some code.

                try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR
                        bindir srcfile [CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;]
                        [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS &lt;flags&gt;]
                        [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE comp]
                        [RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE run]
                        [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var]
                        [ARGS &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt;...])

              Try  compiling  a  srcfile.   Return  TRUE or FALSE for success or
              failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR.  Then if the compile succeeded, run
              the  executable and return its exit code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the
              executable was built, but failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR  will
              be  set  to  FAILED_TO_RUN.  COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the
              variable where the output from the  compile  step  goes.  RUN_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the run&#8208;
              ning executable goes.


              For compatibility  reasons  OUTPUT_VARIABLE  is  still  supported,
              which gives you the output from the compile and run step combined.


              Cross compiling issues


              When  cross  compiling,  the executable compiled in the first step
              usually cannot be run on the  build  host.  try_run()  checks  the
              CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect whether CMake is in cross&#8208;
              compiling mode. If that&apos;s the case, it will still try  to  compile
              the executable, but it will not try to run the executable. Instead
              it will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or
              by  presetting  them  in  some CMake script file to the values the
              executable would have produced if it would have been  run  on  its
              actual target platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (expla&#8208;
              nation see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or  OUTPUT_VARIABLE)
              was   used,  an  additional  cache  variable  RUN_RESULT_VAR__COM&#8208;
              PILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is intended to hold stdout and
              stderr from the executable.


              In  order to make cross compiling your project easier, use try_run
              only if really required. If you use try_run, use  RUN_OUTPUT_VARI&#8208;
              ABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really required. Using them will
              require that when crosscompiling, the cache variables will have to
              be  set  manually  to  the  output of the executable. You can also
              &quot;guard&quot; the calls to  try_run  with  if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING)  and
              provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.


              Set  variable  CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION  to  choose a build
              configuration.


       unset  Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

                unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])

              Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If
              CACHE  is  present  then  the  variable  is removed from the cache
              instead of the current scope.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})

              in which case the variable will be removed from the current  envi&#8208;
              ronment.


       variable_watch
              Watch the CMake variable for change.

                variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to execute&gt;])

              If  the  specified  variable  changes, the message will be printed
              about the variable being changed. If the command is specified, the
              command  will  be executed. The command will receive the following
              arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
              &lt;stack&gt;)


       while  Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

                while(condition)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endwhile(condition)

              All  commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded
              without being  invoked.   Once  the  endwhile  is  evaluated,  the
              recorded  list  of commands is invoked as long as the condition is
              true. The condition is evaluated using the same logic  as  the  if
              command.


PROPERTIES
         CMake Properties - Properties supported by CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.


       This  is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake. Proper&#8208;
       ties can have different scopes. They can either be assigned to  a  source
       file, a directory, a target or globally to CMake. By modifying the values
       of properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.


PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
       ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
              Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

              Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a  project  have
              globally  unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is nec&#8208;
              essary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode  and  VS
              IDE  generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
              unambiguously.


              Makefile generators are capable  of  supporting  duplicate  custom
              target  names.  For projects that care only about Makefile genera&#8208;
              tors and do not wish to support Xcode or VS  IDE  generators,  one
              may  set  this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.
              The property allows multiple add_custom_target  command  calls  in
              different  directories  to specify the same target name.  However,
              setting this property will cause non-Makefile generators  to  pro&#8208;
              duce an error and refuse to generate the project.


       DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
              Specify which configurations are for debugging.

              The  value  must  be  a semi-colon separated list of configuration
              names.   Currently  this  property  is  used  only  by  the   tar&#8208;
              get_link_libraries  command  (see  its documentation for details).
              Additional uses may be defined in the future.


              This property must be set at the top  level  of  the  project  and
              before the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any
              entry in the list does not match a  valid  configuration  for  the
              project the behavior is undefined.


       DISABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

              List  of  features  which  are  disabled  during the CMake run. By
              default it contains the names  of  all  packages  which  were  not
              found.  This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Pack&#8208;
              ages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A  project  can  add
              its own features to this list. This property is used by the macros
              in FeatureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

              List of features which  are  enabled  during  the  CMake  run.  By
              default  it  contains  the names of all packages which were found.
              This is determined  using  the  &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND  variables.  Packages
              which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own
              features to this list. This property is used by the macros in Fea&#8208;
              tureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_LANGUAGES
              Read-only  property  that  contains  the list of currently enabled
              languages

              Set to list of currently enabled languages.


       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
              Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically  search  lib64  directo&#8208;
              ries.

              FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS  is  a boolean specifying whether the
              FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant
              of  directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit
              binaries.


       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
              Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.

              This property is a boolean  specifying  whether  the  FIND_LIBRARY
              command  should find shared libraries with OpenBSD-style versioned
              extension: &quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;.  The property is set to true  on
              OpenBSD and false on other platforms.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
              Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

              CMake  automatically  analyzes  the global inter-target dependency
              graph at the beginning of native build  system  generation.   This
              property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
              Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

              CMake  automatically  analyzes  the global inter-target dependency
              graph at the beginning of  native  build  system  generation.   It
              reports  an  error  if  the dependency graph contains a cycle that
              does not consist of all STATIC  library  targets.   This  property
              tells  CMake  to disallow all cycles completely, even among static
              libraries.


       IN_TRY_COMPILE
              Read-only property that is true during  a  try-compile  configura&#8208;
              tion.

              True  when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN com&#8208;
              mand.


       PACKAGES_FOUND
              List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

              List of packages which were found during the CMake run. Whether  a
              package  has been found is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND vari&#8208;
              ables.


       PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
              List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

              List of packages which  were  not  found  during  the  CMake  run.
              Whether   a  package  has  been  found  is  determined  using  the
              &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.


       PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
              Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

              If not set, CMake uses &quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value
              for  this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS
              will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the documentation for
              the FOLDER target property.


       REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
              If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

              If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
              report any properties or variables  that  were  accessed  but  not
              defined into the filename specified in this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              Makefile  generators  prefix  compiler  commands  with  the  given
              launcher command line.  This is intended  to  allow  launchers  to
              intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile gen&#8208;
              erators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher
              command  line.   This  is intended to allow launchers to intercept
              build problems with  high  granularity.   Non-Makefile  generators
              currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              Makefile  generators  prefix  link  and  archive commands with the
              given launcher command line.  This is intended to allow  launchers
              to  intercept  build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile
              generators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_MESSAGES
              Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

              This property specifies whether Makefile generators should  add  a
              progress  message  describing  what  each build rule does.  If the
              property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
              disable  granular  messages  and  report  only as each target com&#8208;
              pletes.  This is intended to allow scripted builds  to  avoid  the
              build  time  cost  of  detailed reports.  If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES
              cache entry exists its value initializes the value of  this  prop&#8208;
              erty.  Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.


       TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
              Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

              On AIX shared libraries may be named &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;.  This property
              is set to true on such platforms.


       TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
              Does the target platform support shared libraries.

              TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean  specifying  whether  the
              target  platform  supports shared libraries. Basically all current
              general general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embed&#8208;
              ded systems with no or special OSs.


       USE_FOLDERS
              Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.

              If  not  set,  CMake treats this property as OFF by default. CMake
              generators that are capable of  organizing  into  a  hierarchy  of
              folders use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those
              folders. See also the documentation for the  FOLDER  target  prop&#8208;
              erty.


       __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
              Internal property
&#12;              Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.


PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
       ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
              Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

              A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the &quot;make clean&quot;
              stage.


       CACHE_VARIABLES
              List of cache variables available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  cache  vari&#8208;
              ables currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


       CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
              Should the output of custom commands be left.

              If  this  is  true  then  the  outputs of custom commands for this
              directory will not be removed during the &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;  is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).
              This property will be initialized in each directory by  its  value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              This  property  will be initialized in each directory by its value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.



       DEFINITIONS
              For  CMake  2.4  compatibility  only.    Use   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              instead.

              This  read-only  property specifies the list of flags given so far
              to the add_definitions command.  It is intended for debugging pur&#8208;
              poses.  Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

              A  property  on  a  directory  that  indicates  if its targets are
              excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with  a
              Makefile  for  example  typing  make  will cause the targets to be
              built. The same concept applies to the default build of other gen&#8208;
              erators.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form


                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to


                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This  property  applies  to sources in all targets within a direc&#8208;
              tory.  The property value is initialized in each directory by  its
              value in the directory&apos;s parent.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This  property  specifies  the list of directories given so far to
              the include_directories command. This property exists on  directo&#8208;
              ries  and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from the
              include_directories command, values may be  set  directly  on  any
              directory  or  any target using the set_property command. A target
              gets its initial value for this property from  the  value  of  the
              directory  property.  A  directory gets its initial value from its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The  target  property values are used by the generators to set the
              include paths for the compiler. See also  the  include_directories
              command.
&#12;       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              Include file scanning regular expression.

              This read-only property specifies the regular expression used dur&#8208;
              ing dependency scanning to match include files that should be fol&#8208;
              lowed.  See the include_regular_expression command.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LINK_DIRECTORIES
              List of linker search directories.

              This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so
              far to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
              purposes.


       LISTFILE_STACK
              The current stack of listfiles being processed.

              This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
              CMake  scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently
              being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an INCLUDE com&#8208;
              mand  then  that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto
              the stack.


       MACROS List of macro commands available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  macros  cur&#8208;
              rently  defined.   It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the
              macro command.


       PARENT_DIRECTORY
              Source directory that added current subdirectory.

              This read-only property specifies the source directory that  added
              the  current  source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In
              the top-level directory the value is the empty-string.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.
&#12;              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
              A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

              If  you  specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
              processed when ctest is run on the directory.


       VARIABLES
              List of variables defined in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables cur&#8208;
              rently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME
              Old per-configuration target file base name.

              This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.  Use OUT&#8208;
              PUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.


       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the value of this prop&#8208;
              erty is appended to the target  file  name  built  on  disk.   For
              non-executable  targets, this property is initialized by the value
              of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a  target
              is  created.   This  property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
              and App Bundles.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  archive  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property is initialized by the value  of  the  variable  CMAKE_AR&#8208;
              CHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the base name for archive target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.


       AUTOMOC
              Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).

              AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle  the  Qt
              moc  preprocessor  automatically,  i.e.  without having to use the
              QT4_WRAP_CPP() macro. Currently Qt4 is supported. When this  prop&#8208;
              erty  is  set  to  TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build
              time and invoke moc accordingly. If  an  #include  statement  like
              #include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT class declaration is
              expected in the header, and moc is run on the header file.  If  an
              #include  statement  like  #include  &quot;foo.moc&quot;  is  found,  then a
              Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run  on
              the  file  itself.  Additionally,  all header files are parsed for
              Q_OBJECT macros, and if found,  moc  is  also  executed  on  those
              files.  The  resulting  moc files, which are not included as shown
              above in any of the source files are included in a generated &lt;tar&#8208;
              getname&gt;_automoc.cpp  file,  which is compiled as part of the tar&#8208;
              get.This property is initialized by  the  value  of  the  variable
              CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.


              Additional  command  line options for moc can be set via the AUTO&#8208;
              MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.


              By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE  variable  to  TRUE  the
              rules  for  searching the files which will be processed by moc can
              be relaxed. See the  documentation  for  this  variable  for  more
              details.


       AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional  options  for  moc  when using automoc (see the AUTOMOC
              property)

              This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is set to  TRUE
              for  this  target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
              options which will be used when moc is executed during the  build,
              i.e.  it  is  equivalent  to  the optional OPTIONS argument of the
              qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.


              By default it is empty.


       BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

              BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether  to  link
              the  target  in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
              precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
              before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is  set  when  a
              target is created.
&#12;       BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.

              If  a  module library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac.  It  will  have  the
              directory  structure  required for a CFBundle and will be suitable
              to be used for  creating  Browser  Plugins  or  other  application
              resources.


       BUNDLE_EXTENSION
              The file extension used to name a BUNDLE target on the Mac.

              The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also use &quot;plugin&quot; or what&#8208;
              ever file extension is required by the host app for your bundle.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.


       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used  to
              build  sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
              additional preprocessor definitions.


       DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See target property &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.
&#12;              This property is a special case of the more-general &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POST&#8208;
              FIX property for the DEBUG configuration.


       DEFINE_SYMBOL
              Define a symbol when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              DEFINE_SYMBOL  sets  the  name  of the preprocessor symbol defined
              when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set  here  then
              it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if
              the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for  head&#8208;
              ers  to  know  whether  they  are being included from inside their
              library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport  decora&#8208;
              tions.


       ENABLE_EXPORTS
              Specify  whether  an  executable exports symbols for loadable mod&#8208;
              ules.

              Normally an executable does not export any symbols because  it  is
              the  final  program.   It  is possible for an executable to export
              symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set
              to true CMake will allow other targets to &quot;link&quot; to the executable
              with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms  a  tar&#8208;
              get-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that
              link to it.  For DLL platforms an import library will  be  created
              for  the  exported  symbols  and  then used for linking.  All Win&#8208;
              dows-based  systems  including  Cygwin  are  DLL  platforms.   For
              non-DLL  platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link
              time, such as Mac OS X, the module will &quot;link&quot; to  the  executable
              using  a  flag like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;.  For other non-DLL platforms
              the link rule is simply ignored  since  the  dynamic  loader  will
              automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the target from the all target.

              A  property  on  a target that indicates if the target is excluded
              from the default build target. If it is not, then with a  Makefile
              for  example  typing  make will cause this target to be built. The
              same concept applies to the default  build  of  other  generators.
              Installing  a  target  with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has unde&#8208;
              fined behavior.


       EchoString
              A message to be displayed when the target is built.

              A message to display on some generators (such as  makefiles)  when
              the target is built.


       FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

              Targets  with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities
              in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same FOLDER  property
              value  will appear next to each other in a folder of that name. To
              nest folders, use FOLDER values such  as  &apos;GUI/Dialogs&apos;  with  &apos;/&apos;
              characters separating folder levels.


       FRAMEWORK
              This target is a framework on the Mac.

              If  a  shared library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a framework when built on the mac. It  will  have  the
              directory  structure required for a framework and will be suitable
              to be used with the -framework option


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.
&#12;              This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source  files  in  a
              target  use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the cor&#8208;
              responding format flag to the compiler.  Use  the  source-specific
              Fortran_FORMAT  property to change the format of a specific source
              file.  If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when  a  target
              is created its value is used to initialize this property.


       Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Specify  output directory for Fortran modules provided by the tar&#8208;
              get.

              If the target contains Fortran source files that  provide  modules
              and the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies
              the directory in which the modules  will  be  placed.   When  this
              property is not set the modules will be placed in the build direc&#8208;
              tory corresponding to the target&apos;s source directory.  If the vari&#8208;
              able  CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY  is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated its value is used to initialize this property.


              Note that some compilers will automatically search the module out&#8208;
              put  directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will
              not.  If your sources USE modules their location must be specified
              by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.


       GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
              Generator&apos;s file for this target.

              An internal property used by some generators to record the name of
              project or dsp file associated with this target.


       GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              When linking a shared library or executable that  exports  symbols
              using  GNU  tools  on  Windows  (MinGW/MSYS)  with  Visual  Studio
              installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS  for&#8208;
              mat   (.lib).    Both   import  libraries  will  be  installed  by
              install(TARGETS) and exported by install(EXPORT) and  export()  to
              be linked by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.


              If  the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
              value is used to initialize this property.  The variable  must  be
              set  prior  to  the  first command that enables a language such as
              project() or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an
              option  to the user automatically when configuring on Windows with
              GNU tools.


       HAS_CXX
              Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

              This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
              See that property&apos;s documentation for details.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form


                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to


                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.


       IMPORTED
              Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

              The  boolean  value  of  this property is true for targets created
              with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It  is
              false for targets built within the project.


       IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
              Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

              Set  this  to  the  list  of  configuration names available for an
              IMPORTED target.  The names correspond to  configurations  defined
              in  the project from which the target is imported.  If the import&#8208;
              ing project uses a different set of configurations the  names  may
              be   mapped   using   the  MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_IMPLIB
              Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot;  part  of  a  windows  DLL.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
              Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

              Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries  as  part
              of  their  implementation.   On some platforms the linker searches
              for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including
              in  the  link.   Set this property to the list of dependent shared
              libraries of an imported library.  The  list  should  be  disjoint
              from  the  list of interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES property.  On platforms requiring dependent  shared
              libraries  to  be  found  at link time CMake uses this list to add
              appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.  If  set,  this  property  com&#8208;
              pletely  overrides  the  generic property for the named configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
              Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.
&#12;              Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to pro&#8208;
              duce  a  STATIC  IMPORTED  library  (such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;).  CMake
              accounts for these languages when computing how to link  a  target
              to  the  imported library.  For example, when a C executable links
              to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker  to
              satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library.


              This   property  is  ignored  for  targets  that  are  not  STATIC
              libraries.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when
              an IMPORTED library target  is  linked  to  another  target.   The
              libraries  will  be  included  on  the  link  line for the target.
              Unlike  the  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  property,   this   property
              applies  to all imported target types, including STATIC libraries.
              This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

              This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.

              If  set,  this  property completely overrides the generic property
              for the named configuration.


       IMPORTED_LOCATION
              Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.   For
              executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bun&#8208;
              dles on OS X this is the location of the  executable  file  inside
              Contents/MacOS  under  the  application bundle folder.  For static
              libraries and modules this is the location of the library or  mod&#8208;
              ule.   For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the loca&#8208;
              tion of the shared library.  For frameworks on OS X  this  is  the
              location  of  the  library  file symlink just inside the framework
              folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part  of  the
              library.   For  UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file
              to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets.


              Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the  configuration-specific
              property  IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  is set.  To get the location
              of an imported target read one of the LOCATION  or  LOCATION_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt; properties.
&#12;
       IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
              Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no &quot;soname&quot;.

              Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that
              has  no  &quot;soname&quot; field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands
              for some platforms to prevent the linker from using  the  path  to
              the   library  in  place  of  its  missing  soname.   Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_SONAME
              The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

              Set  this  to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an imported shared library.
              This is meaningful  only  on  platforms  supporting  the  feature.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORT_PREFIX
              What comes before the import library name.

              Similar to  the  target  property  PREFIX,  but  used  for  import
              libraries  (typically  corresponding  to a DLL) instead of regular
              libraries. A target property that can be set to override the  pre&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       IMPORT_SUFFIX
              What comes after the import library name.

              Similar  to  the  target  property  SUFFIX,  but  used  for import
              libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL)  instead  of  regular
              libraries.  A target property that can be set to override the suf&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This property specifies the list of directories given  so  far  to
              the  include_directories command. This property exists on directo&#8208;
              ries and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from  the
              include_directories  command,  values  may  be set directly on any
              directory or any target using the set_property command.  A  target
              gets  its  initial  value  for this property from the value of the
              directory property. A directory gets its initial  value  from  its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The target property values are used by the generators to  set  the
              include  paths  for the compiler. See also the include_directories
              command.


       INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory  portion  of
              the  &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in
              the installed targets.


       INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed  targets (for platforms that support it).  This property
              is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if
              it is set when a target is created.


       INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH  is a boolean that if set to true will
              append directories in the  linker  search  path  and  outside  the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if  it  is
              set when a target is created.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

              Target label semantics are currently unspecified.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  library  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target
              is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the base name for library target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.


       LINKER_LANGUAGE
              Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

              For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the lan&#8208;
              guage  whose  compiler  is used to link the target (such as &quot;C&quot; or
              &quot;CXX&quot;).  A typical value for an executable is the language of  the
              source file providing the program entry point (main).  If not set,
              the language with the  highest  linker  preference  value  is  the
              default.    See  documentation  of  CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              variables.


       LINK_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

              Specifies a semicolon-separated list of  full-paths  to  files  on
              which  the  link  rule for this target depends.  The target binary
              will be linked if any of the named files is newer than it.


              This property  is  ignored  by  non-Makefile  generators.   It  is
              intended  to  specify  dependencies on &quot;linker scripts&quot; for custom
              Makefile link rules.


       LINK_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when linking this target.

              The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
              step  of  a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to the configura&#8208;
              tion &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDE&#8208;
              BINFO.


       LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              List  public  interface  libraries  for  a  shared library or exe&#8208;
              cutable.

              By default linking to a shared library target  transitively  links
              to  targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an exe&#8208;
              cutable with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no  default
              transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the
              default transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.   When
              the target is linked into another target the libraries listed (and
              recursively their link interface libraries) will  be  provided  to
              the  other  target  also.  If the list is empty then no transitive
              link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is  linked
              into  another  target  even if the default set is non-empty.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.  This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

              This  is  the  configuration-specific   version   of   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES.   If  set,  this property completely overrides the
              generic property for the named configuration.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

              When linking to a STATIC library target with  cyclic  dependencies
              the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in
              the strongly connected component of the dependency  graph.   CMake
              by  default  constructs the link line so that the linker will scan
              through the component at least twice.  This property specifies the
              minimum  number  of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake
              uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

              This is the configuration-specific version of  LINK_INTERFACE_MUL&#8208;
              TIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic
              property for the named configuration.


       LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
              End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds
              an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the
              linker search type back  to  its  starting  type.   This  property
              switches  the  final  linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of
              how it started.  See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.


       LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
              Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker
              search  type  is  assumed  to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the
              library list.  This property switches the assumption to  -Bstatic.
              It is intended for use when linking an executable statically (e.g.
              with the GNU -static option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.


       LOCATION
              Read-only location of a target on disk.

              For an imported target, this read-only property returns the  value
              of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.


              For a non-imported target, this property is provided for  compati&#8208;
              bility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location
              of an executable target&apos;s output file for use  in  add_custom_com&#8208;
              mand.   The  path may contain a build-system-specific portion that
              is replaced at build time with  the  configuration  getting  built
              (such  as  &quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot;  in  VS). In CMake 2.6 and above
              add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name  in  its
              COMMAND  and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
              CMake 2.8.4  and  above  add_custom_command  recognizes  generator
              expressions  to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
              Therefore this property is not needed  for  creating  custom  com&#8208;
              mands.


              Do  not  set properties that affect the location of a target after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.  Failure to follow this rule  is  not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

              A  read-only property that indicates where a target&apos;s main file is
              located on disk for the configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.  The  property  is
              defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported tar&#8208;
              get may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
              importing  project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
              otherwise uses an  arbitrary  available  configuration.   Use  the
              MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property  to map imported configura&#8208;
              tions explicitly.


              Do not set properties that affect the location of a  target  after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.   Failure  to follow this rule is not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

              When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac
              OS  X  will  be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a
              GUI executable that can be launched  from  the  Finder.   See  the
              MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST  target  property  for  information about
              creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.   This
              property   is   initialized   by   the   value   of  the  variable
              CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when a target is created.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.

              An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be  built  as
              an application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file
              is  created  by  configuring  a  template   called   MacOSXBundle&#8208;
              Info.plist.in  located  in  the  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property
              specifies an alternative template file name which may  be  a  full
              path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.

              An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a frame&#8208;
              work on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file  is  created  by
              configuring a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located
              in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an  alternative
              template file name which may be a full path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target&apos;s configuration.

              Set  this to the list of configurations of an imported target that
              may be used for  the  current  project&apos;s  &lt;CONFIG&gt;  configuration.
              Targets imported from another project may not provide the same set
              of configuration names available in the current project.   Setting
              this  property  tells CMake what imported configurations are suit&#8208;
              able for use when building the &lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration.  The  first
              configuration  in  the  list  found to be provided by the imported
              target is selected.  If this property is set and no matching  con&#8208;
              figurations  are available, then the imported target is considered
              to be not found.  This property is ignored for  non-imported  tar&#8208;
              gets.


       NO_SONAME
              Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking a shared library or module.

              Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library or mod&#8208;
              ule should not have &quot;soname&quot; set. Default is to  set  &quot;soname&quot;  on
              all  shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports
              it. Generally, use this property only for leaf  private  libraries
              or  plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other
              targets link against, on some platforms a  linker  will  insert  a
              full  path  to  the  library  (as specified at link time) into the
              dynamic  section  of  the  dependent   binary.   Therefore,   once
              installed,  dynamic  loader  may  eventually  fail  to  locate the
              library for the binary.


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES
              Target specific architectures for OS X.

              The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture
              for targets on OS X.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
              created.   Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the binary archi&#8208;
              tectures on a per-configuration basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an  upper-case
              name (ex: &quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.
&#12;              This  property is the configuration-specific version of OSX_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURES.


       OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for target files.

              This sets the base name for output files created for an executable
              or library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
              default.


       OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration target file base name.

              This is the configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.


       POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              Whether to create a position-independent target

              The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines whether position
              independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
              property is true by default for SHARED and MODULE library  targets
              and false otherwise.


       POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The  PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL  com&#8208;
              mand instead.


       PREFIX What comes before the library name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
              &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.


       PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are  the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS  command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL com&#8208;
              mand instead.


       PRIVATE_HEADER
              Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  PrivateHeaders  directory  inside  the  framework folder.  On
              non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the  PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       PROJECT_LABEL
              Change the name of a target in an IDE.

              Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
              Studio.


       PUBLIC_HEADER
              Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  Headers  directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
              platforms these headers may be installed using  the  PUBLIC_HEADER
              option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RESOURCE
              Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This  property  may  be set to a list of files to be placed in the
              Resources directory inside the  framework  folder.   On  non-Apple
              platforms  these  files may be installed using the RESOURCE option
              to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the directory into which runtime target
              files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS,  Xcode)
              append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory to the specified direc&#8208;
              tory.  There are three kinds of target files that  may  be  built:
              archive,  library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as
              runtime targets. Static libraries are always  treated  as  archive
              targets.  Module  libraries are always treated as library targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets.  For  DLL  platforms  the  DLL  part  of a shared library is
              treated as a runtime target and the corresponding  import  library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value  of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set
              when a target is created.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target files.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but  multi-configuration  generators  (VS,  Xcode) do NOT append a
              per-configuration subdirectory to the specified  directory.   This
              property  is  initialized  by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN&#8208;
              TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is  cre&#8208;
              ated.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the base name for runtime target files.
              It  overrides  OUTPUT_NAME  and  OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  properties.
              There  are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive,
              library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as  runtime
              targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive targets.
              Module libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets.  For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime  target and the corresponding import library is treated as
              an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin  are
              DLL platforms.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.


       SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

              SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
              generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from  the  build
              tree.   This  property is initialized by the value of the variable
              CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.


       SOURCES
              Source names specified for a target.

              Read-only list of sources  specified  for  a  target.   The  names
              returned  are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_proper&#8208;
              ties command.


       SOVERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  SOVERSION  is  ignored  if NO_SONAME property is set. For
              shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION  attribute
              is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version number. These numbers
              are used as the image version of the binary.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
              Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

              Extra flags to use when linking a static library.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration flags for creating a static library.

              This     is     the     configuration-specific     version      of
              STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.


       SUFFIX What comes after the target name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
              &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of a library, module or executable.


       TYPE   The type of the target.

              This read-only property can be used to test the type of the  given
              target.   It   will  be  one  of  STATIC_LIBRARY,  MODULE_LIBRARY,
              SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.


       VERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  For  executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
              version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are cre&#8208;
              ated  if  the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and
              executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to  extract
              a  &quot;major.minor&quot;  version  number.  These  numbers are used as the
              image version of the binary.


       VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio managed project .NET references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to  a  gener&#8208;
              ated  Visual  Studio  project.  For  example,  &quot;System;System.Win&#8208;
              dows.Forms&quot;.


       VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;
              Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

              Tell the Visual  Studio  generator  to  set  the  global  variable
              &apos;&lt;variable&gt;&apos;  to  a  given  value  in  the generated Visual Studio
              project. Ignored on other generators. Qt integration works  better
              if  VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.
              For example, &quot;4.7.3&quot;


       VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Sets  the  &quot;keyword&quot;  attribute  for  a  generated  Visual  Studio
              project.  Defaults  to  &quot;Win32Proj&quot;. You may wish to override this
              value with &quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio managed
              C++ unit test project.


       VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
              Visual Studio project type(s).

              Can  be  set  to  one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
              indicate the type of project. This value is copied  verbatim  into
              the generated project file. Example for a managed C++ unit testing
              project:


               {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

              UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.


       VS_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Can be set to change the visual studio  keyword,  for  example  QT
              integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.


       VS_SCC_AUXPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
              property.


       VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code  control  local
              path property.


       VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
              name property.
&#12;       VS_SCC_PROVIDER
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

              Can be set  to  change  the  visual  studio  source  code  control
              provider property.


       VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
              Visual  Studio project C++/CX language extensions for Windows Run&#8208;
              time

              Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.


       VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a  gener&#8208;
              ated   Visual   Studio   project.   For   example,   &quot;Windows;Win&#8208;
              dows.UI.Core&quot;.


       WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

              When this property is set to true the executable  when  linked  on
              Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of
              just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead  of  a  console
              application.   See  the  CMAKE_MFC_FLAG  variable documentation to
              configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.   This  property  is
              initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if
              it is set when a target is created.


       XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;
              Set Xcode target attributes directly.

              Tell the Xcode generator to set &apos;&lt;an-attribute&gt;&apos; to a given  value
              in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.


PROPERTIES ON TESTS
       ATTACHED_FILES
              Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

              Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and sub&#8208;
              mitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.


       ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
              Attach a list of files to  a  dashboard  submission  if  the  test
              fails.

              Same  as  ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if
              the test does not pass.


       COST   Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test  set  will  be
              run in descending order of cost.

              This property describes the cost of a test. You can explicitly set
              this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.


       DEPENDS
              Specifies that this test should only be run  after  the  specified
              list of tests.

              Set  this  to a list of tests that must finish before this test is
              run.


       ENVIRONMENT
              Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a
              test.

              If  set  to a list of environment variables and values of the form
              MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while run&#8208;
              ning  the  test. The environment is restored to its previous state
              after the test is done.


       FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

              If set, if the output matches one  of  specified  regular  expres&#8208;
              sions,  the  test  will  fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              &quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

              The list is reported in dashboard submissions.


       MEASUREMENT
              Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

              If set to a name then that name will be reported  to  CDASH  as  a
              named  measurement with a value of 1. You may also specify a value
              by setting MEASUREMENT to &quot;measurement=value&quot;.


       PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              The output must match this regular  expression  for  the  test  to
              pass.

              If set, the test output will be checked against the specified reg&#8208;
              ular expressions and at least one of the regular  expressions  has
              to match, otherwise the test will fail.


       PROCESSORS
              How many process slots this test requires

              Denotes the number of processors that this test will require. This
              is typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction
              with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.


       REQUIRED_FILES
              List of files required to run the test.

              If  set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of
              the files exist.


       RESOURCE_LOCK
              Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

              If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaran&#8208;
              teed not to run concurrently.


       RUN_SERIAL
              Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

              Use  this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
              option to specify that this test should not  be  run  in  parallel
              with any other tests.


       TIMEOUT
              How many seconds to allow for this test.

              This  property  if set will limit a test to not take more than the
              specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds  that  the  test
              process  will be killed and ctest will move to the next test. This
              setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.


       WILL_FAIL
              If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.
&#12;              This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail  and
              return a non zero return code.


       WORKING_DIRECTORY
              The directory from which the test executable will be called.

              If  this  is not set it is called from the directory the test exe&#8208;
              cutable is located in.


PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
       ABSTRACT
              Is this source file an abstract class.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file rep&#8208;
              resents  a  class that is abstract. This only makes sense for lan&#8208;
              guages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
              by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

              The  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  property may be set to a semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated list of preprocessor definitions using  the  syntax  VAR  or
              VAR=value.   Function-style  definitions are not supported.  CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system  (note  that  CMake  language syntax may require escapes to
              specify some values).  This property may be set on a  per-configu&#8208;
              ration  basis  using  the  name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).


              CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are  not  sup&#8208;
              ported  by  the  native  build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).   Xcode  does  not
              support per-configuration definitions on source files.


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              Note  that  Xcode  does  not support per-configuration source file
              flags so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.


       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

              These flags will be added to the list of compile flags  when  this
              source  file  builds.   Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional
              preprocessor definitions.
&#12;
       EXTERNAL_OBJECT
              If set to true then this is an object file.

              If this property is set to true then the source file is really  an
              object  file  and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked
              into the target though.


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
              fixed-format  or  free-format.   CMake will pass the corresponding
              format flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide  For&#8208;
              tran_FORMAT  property  if  all  source files in a target share the
              same format.


       GENERATED
              Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

              If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will han&#8208;
              dle  it differently in terms of dependency checking etc. Otherwise
              having a non-existent source file could create problems.


       HEADER_FILE_ONLY
              Is this source file only a header file.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
              header  file  with no associated implementation. This is set auto&#8208;
              matically based on the file extension and  is  used  by  CMake  to
              determine is certain dependency information should be computed.


       KEEP_EXTENSION
              Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

              If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
              will be the same as that of the source file. Normally  the  output
              file  extension  is  computed  based on the language of the source
              file, for example .cxx will go to a .o extension.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

              This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
              target  whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
              currently specified.


       LANGUAGE
              What programming language is the file.

              A property that can be set to indicate what  programming  language
              the  source  file  is. If it is not set the language is determined
              based on the file extension. Typical values are CXX C etc. Setting
              this  property for a file means this file will be compiled. Do not
              set this for header or files that should not be compiled.


       LOCATION
              The full path to a source file.

              A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full  path
              to the source file.


       MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
              Place  a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle, CFBundle, or frame&#8208;
              work.

              Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set  are  built
              as  Mac  OS  X  application  bundles  on  Apple platforms.  Shared
              library targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built  as  Mac
              OS  X  frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
              the BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles  on
              Apple  platforms.   Source  files  listed  in the target with this
              property set will be copied to a directory inside  the  bundle  or
              framework  content  folder  specified  by the property value.  For
              bundles the content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;.   For  frame&#8208;
              works the content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;.
              For  cfbundles  the  content  folder  is  &quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Contents&quot;
              (unless  the  extension  is changed).  See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for  specifying  files
              meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or Resources directories.


       OBJECT_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

              Specifies  a  semicolon-separated  list  of full-paths to files on
              which any object files compiled from this source file depend.   An
              object  file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer
              than it.


              This property need not be used to  specify  the  dependency  of  a
              source file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although
              the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is  no
              longer  necessary.   If  the generated header file is created by a
              custom command in the same target as the source  file,  the  auto&#8208;
              matic  dependency  scanning process will recognize the dependency.
              If the generated header file is  created  by  another  target,  an
              inter-target  dependency  should be created with the add_dependen&#8208;
              cies command (if one does not already exist due to  linking  rela&#8208;
              tionships).


       OBJECT_OUTPUTS
              Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

              Additional  outputs created by compilation of this source file. If
              any of these outputs is missing the  object  will  be  recompiled.
              This  is supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored
              on other generators.


       SYMBOLIC
              Is this just a name for a rule.

              If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true  the  build  system  will  be
              informed  that the source file is not actually created on disk but
              instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.


       WRAP_EXCLUDE
              Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

              Some packages can wrap source files into  alternate  languages  to
              provide  additional  functionality.  For  example, C++ code can be
              wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
              set  to  true  (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should
              not be wrapped.


PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
       ADVANCED
              True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

              This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
              interesting     only     for    advanced    configuration.     The
              mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.


       HELPSTRING
              Help associated with entry in GUIs.

              This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help  users  set
              it through a CMake GUI.


       MODIFIED
              Internal management property.  Do not set or get.
&#12;              This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
              interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.


       STRINGS
              Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

              For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of  val&#8208;
              ues.   CMake  GUIs  may  use  this  to  provide a selection widget
              instead of a generic string entry field.  This is for  convenience
              only.   CMake does not enforce that the value matches one of those
              listed.


       TYPE   Widget type for entry in GUIs.

              Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present wid&#8208;
              gets  to  help  users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a
              hint to determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:


                BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
                PATH          = Path to a directory.
                FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
                STRING        = Generic string value.
                INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
                STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
                UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

              Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by  the  command
              which creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).


       VALUE  Value of a cache entry.

              This  property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting
              this property always sets the value without checking, so use  with
              care.


COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS
         CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.


       This  is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previ&#8208;
       ous CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility  reasons.
       You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;-)


       build_name
              Deprecated.    Use   ${CMAKE_SYSTEM}   and   ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
              instead.

                build_name(variable)

              Sets the specified variable to a string representing the  platform
              and compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
              CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.


       exec_program
              Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.

              Run an executable program during  the  processing  of  the  CMake&#8208;
              List.txt file.


                exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
                             [ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;]
                             [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                             [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])

              The  executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
              executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
              better  to  use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to
              the program.   This is because cmake will then be able  to  escape
              spaces  in the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARI&#8208;
              ABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture
              the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUT&#8208;
              PUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output  will  go  to  the  std&#8208;
              out/stderr of the console running cmake.



       export_library_dependencies
              Deprecated.  Use INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.

              This  command  generates  an  old-style library dependencies file.
              Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the  command.
              Use  instead  the  install(EXPORT)  command to help export targets
              from an installation tree and the export() command to export  tar&#8208;
              gets from a build tree.


              The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account
              per-configuration  names   of   libraries   or   the   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES target property.


                export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])

              Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included into a CMake list&#8208;
              file with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number  of
              SET  commands  that  will set all the variables needed for library
              dependency information.  This should be the last  command  in  the
              top  level  CMakeLists.txt  file  of  the  project.  If the APPEND
              option is specified, the SET commands  will  be  appended  to  the
              given file instead of replacing it.


       install_files
              Deprecated.  Use the install(FILES ) command instead.

              This  command  has  been superceded by the install command.  It is
              provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES  form
              is  directly  replaced  by  the FILES form of the install command.
              The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB  form
              of the file command.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)

              Create  rules to install the listed files with the given extension
              into the given directory.  Only  files  existing  in  the  current
              source  tree  or its corresponding location in the binary tree may
              be listed.  If a file specified already  has  an  extension,  that
              extension  will  be  removed  first.  This is useful for providing
              lists of source files such as foo.cxx when  you  want  the  corre&#8208;
              sponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is &apos;.h&apos;.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

              Any  files  in the current source directory that match the regular
              expression will be installed.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)

              Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be installed explic&#8208;
              itly from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.


              The  directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix, which
              is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


       install_programs
              Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS ) command instead.

              This command has been superceded by the install  command.   It  is
              provided  for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form
              is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the INSTALL  command.
              The  regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form
              of the FILE command.


                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])

              Create rules to install the listed programs into the given  direc&#8208;
              tory.  Use the FILES argument to guarantee that the file list ver&#8208;
              sion of the command will be used even when there is only one argu&#8208;
              ment.


                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

              In  the  second  form  any program in the current source directory
              that matches the regular expression will be installed.


              This command is intended to install programs that are not built by
              cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the TARGETS form of the INSTALL
              command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.


              The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix,  which
              is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


       install_targets
              Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )  command instead.

              This  command  has  been superceded by the install command.  It is
              provided for compatibility with older CMake code.


                install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)

              Create rules to install the listed targets into the  given  direc&#8208;
              tory.  The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix,
              which is stored in  the  variable  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  If  RUN&#8208;
              TIME_DIRECTORY  is specified, then on systems with special runtime
              files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.


       link_libraries
              Deprecated. Use the target_link_libraries() command instead.

              Link libraries to all targets added later.


                link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt; library2 ...)

              Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any  following  tar&#8208;
              gets  (typically  added  with  the  add_executable  or add_library
              calls).  This command is passed down to all  subdirectories.   The
              debug  and optimized strings may be used to indicate that the next
              library listed is to be used only for that specific type of build.


       make_directory
              Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.

                make_directory(directory)

              Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
              parent  directories  that  do not exist will also be created.  Use
              with care.


       output_required_files
              Deprecated.  Approximate C preprocessor dependency scanning.

              This command exists only because ancient CMake  versions  provided
              it.   CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning automatically
              using a more advanced scanner.


                output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)

              Outputs a list of all the source files that are  required  by  the
              specified  srcfile.  This list is written into outputfile. This is
              similar to writing out the dependencies for srcfile except that it
              jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c and .cpp files if possible.
&#12;
       remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.

                remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

              Removes  VALUE  from  the variable VAR.  This is typically used to
              remove entries from a  vector  (e.g.  semicolon  separated  list).
              VALUE is expanded.


       subdir_depends
              Deprecated.  Does nothing.

                subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)

              Does  not  do  anything.  This command used to help projects order
              parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.


       subdirs
              Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command instead.

              Add a list of subdirectories to the build.


                subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
                        [PREORDER] )

              Add a list of subdirectories to the  build.  The  add_subdirectory
              command  should  be  used instead of subdirs although subdirs will
              still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files  in  the  sub
              directories  to  be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the
              PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER
              flag  has  no  effect  on IDE projects.  Any directories after the
              EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be  included  in  the  top  level
              makefile  or  project file. This is useful for having CMake create
              makefiles or projects for a set of  examples  in  a  project.  You
              would  want  CMake  to generate makefiles or project files for all
              the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show
              up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from
              the top.


       use_mangled_mesa
              Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

                use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

              The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.   The  mesa
              headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
              mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by  being  added
              to the include directory path earlier.


       utility_source
              Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.

                utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                               path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])

              When  a  third-party utility&apos;s source is included in the distribu&#8208;
              tion, this command specifies its location  and  name.   The  cache
              entry  will  not  be  set unless the path_to_source and all listed
              files exist.  It is assumed that the source tree  of  the  utility
              will have been built before it is needed.


              When  cross  compiling  CMake  will  print  a  warning  if a util&#8208;
              ity_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used
              to  build  an  executable which is executed later on. This doesn&apos;t
              work when cross compiling, since the executable can  run  only  on
              their  target  platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be
              adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is  runnable
              on the build host.


       variable_requires
              Deprecated. Use the if() command instead.
&#12;              Assert satisfaction of an option&apos;s required variables.


                variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)

              The  first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the variable to
              be tested, if that variable is false  nothing  else  is  done.  If
              TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is
              a variable that is set to true if all the required  variables  are
              set.  The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or
              not set to NOTFOUND to avoid an error.  If any are  not  true,  an
              error is reported.


       write_file
              Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.

                write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;... [APPEND])

              The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
              messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified,  then  the
              message will be appended.


              NOTE  1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as
              this one but add some more functionality.


              NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used  as
              an  input  to  CMake  (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it
              will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you  want  to
              generate input files to CMake.


MODULES
       The  following  modules  are  provided  with CMake. They can be used with
       INCLUDE(ModuleName).


         CMake Modules - Modules coming with CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.


       This is the documentation for the modules and scripts coming with  CMake.
       Using these modules you can check the computer system for installed soft&#8208;
       ware packages, features of the compiler and the existance of  headers  to
       name just a few.


       AddFileDependencies
              ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file depend_files...)

              Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file



       BundleUtilities
              Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

              A  collection  of  CMake utility functions useful for dealing with
              .app bundles on the Mac and bundle-like directories on any OS.


              The following functions are provided by this module:


                 fixup_bundle
                 copy_and_fixup_bundle
                 verify_app
                 get_bundle_main_executable
                 get_dotapp_dir
                 get_bundle_and_executable
                 get_bundle_all_executables
                 get_item_key
                 clear_bundle_keys
                 set_bundle_key_values
                 get_bundle_keys
                 copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
                 copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
                 fixup_bundle_item
                 verify_bundle_prerequisites
                 verify_bundle_symlinks

              Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break  and
              PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on GetPrerequisites.cmake.


                FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

              Fix  up a bundle in-place and make it standalone, such that it can
              be drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run on  that  machine
              as long as all of the system libraries are compatible.


              If  you  pass  plugins  to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you
              should install them or copy them into the  bundle  before  calling
              fixup_bundle.  The  &quot;libs&quot;  parameter  is a list of libraries that
              must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined  by  otool  output
              analysis. (i.e., plugins)


              Gather  all  the  keys  for all the executables and libraries in a
              bundle, and then, for each key, copy each  prerequisite  into  the
              bundle.  Then fix each one up according to its own list of prereq&#8208;
              uisites.


              Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final bundle to
              ensure that it is truly standalone.


                COPY_AND_FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

              Makes  a copy of the bundle &lt;src&gt; at location &lt;dst&gt; and then fixes
              up the new copied bundle in-place at &lt;dst&gt;...


                VERIFY_APP(&lt;app&gt;)

              Verifies that an application &lt;app&gt; appears valid based on  running
              analysis  tools on it. Calls &quot;message(FATAL_ERROR&quot; if the applica&#8208;
              tion is not verified.


                GET_BUNDLE_MAIN_EXECUTABLE(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)

              The result will be the full path name of the  bundle&apos;s  main  exe&#8208;
              cutable  file  or  an  &quot;error:&quot; prefixed string if it could not be
              determined.


                GET_DOTAPP_DIR(&lt;exe&gt; &lt;dotapp_dir_var&gt;)

              Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with  &quot;.app&quot;  given
              the  full  path  to an executable. If there is no such parent dir,
              then simply return the dir containing the executable.


              The returned directory may or may not exist.


                GET_BUNDLE_AND_EXECUTABLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;bundle_var&gt; &lt;executable_var&gt; &lt;valid_var&gt;)

              Takes either a &quot;.app&quot; directory name or the name of an  executable
              nested  inside  a  &quot;.app&quot;  directory  and  returns the path to the
              &quot;.app&quot; directory in &lt;bundle_var&gt; and the path  to  its  main  exe&#8208;
              cutable in &lt;executable_var&gt;


                GET_BUNDLE_ALL_EXECUTABLES(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;exes_var&gt;)

              Scans  the  given  bundle recursively for all executable files and
              accumulates them into a variable.


                GET_ITEM_KEY(&lt;item&gt; &lt;key_var&gt;)
&#12;              Given a file (item) name, generate a key  that  should  be  unique
              considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to
              make a bundle  standalone.  This  is  essentially  the  file  name
              including extension with &quot;.&quot; replaced by &quot;_&quot;


              This  key  is  used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can
              associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.


                CLEAR_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;keys_var&gt;)

              Loop over the list of keys, clearing all the variables  associated
              with each key. After the loop, clear the list of keys itself.


              Caller  of get_bundle_keys should call clear_bundle_keys when done
              with list of keys.


                SET_BUNDLE_KEY_VALUES(&lt;keys_var&gt; &lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
                                      &lt;copyflag&gt;)

              Add a key to the list (if necessary) for the given item. If added,
              also set all the variables associated with that key.


                GET_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;keys_var&gt;)

              Loop  over  all the executable and library files within the bundle
              (and given as extra &lt;libs&gt;) and accumulate a list of  keys  repre&#8208;
              senting them. Set values associated with each key such that we can
              loop over all of them and copy prerequisite libs into  the  bundle
              and then do appropriate install_name_tool fixups.


                COPY_RESOLVED_ITEM_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt; &lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)

              Copy  a  resolved  item  into the bundle if necessary. Copy is not
              necessary  if   the   resolved_item   is   &quot;the   same   as&quot;   the
              resolved_embedded_item.


                COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt; &lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)

              Copy  a  resolved  framework into the bundle if necessary. Copy is
              not  necessary  if  the  resolved_item  is  &quot;the  same   as&quot;   the
              resolved_embedded_item.


              By  default,  BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS  is  not set. If you
              want   full   frameworks   embedded   in   your    bundles,    set
              BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling fixup_bundle.
              By default, COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the  frame&#8208;
              work dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.


                FIXUP_BUNDLE_ITEM(&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

              Get  the  direct/non-system prerequisites of the resolved embedded
              item. For each prerequisite, change the way it  is  referenced  to
              the  value of the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable for that prerequi&#8208;
              site. (Most likely changing to an &quot;@executable_path&quot; style  refer&#8208;
              ence.)


              This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item be &quot;inside&quot;
              the bundle already.  In  other  words,  if  you  pass  plugins  to
              fixup_bundle  as  the  libs  parameter, you should install them or
              copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The  &quot;libs&quot;
              parameter  is  a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that
              cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)


              Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own  _EMBED&#8208;
              DED_ITEM value.


              Accumulate  changes  in  a  local  variable and make *one* call to
              install_name_tool at the end of the function with all the  changes
              at once.


              If  the  BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS  variable  is set then bundle items
              will be marked writable before install_name_tool tries  to  change
              them.


                VERIFY_BUNDLE_PREREQUISITES(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)

              Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the
              bundle are contained within the bundle or are &quot;system&quot;  libraries,
              presumed to exist everywhere.


                VERIFY_BUNDLE_SYMLINKS(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)

              Verifies  that  any  symlinks  found  in the bundle point to other
              files that are already also in the bundle... Anything that  points
              to an external file causes this function to fail the verification.


       CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory
              Use MinGW gfortran from VS if a fortran compiler is not found.

              The  &apos;add_fortran_subdirectory&apos;  function adds a subdirectory to a
              project that contains a fortran only sub-project. The module  will
              check  the  current compiler and see if it can support fortran. If
              no fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC,  then  this
              module will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external
              project to build with  the  MinGW  tools.   It  will  also  create
              imported  targets  for the libraries created.  This will only work
              if the fortran code is built into a dll, so  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS  is
              turned on in the project.  In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS option is
              set to on, so that the MS .lib files are created. Usage is as fol&#8208;
              lows:


                cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory(
                 &lt;subdir&gt;                # name of subdirectory
                 PROJECT &lt;project_name&gt;  # project name in subdir top CMakeLists.txt
                 ARCHIVE_DIR &lt;dir&gt;       # dir where project places .lib files
                 RUNTIME_DIR &lt;dir&gt;       # dir where project places .dll files
                 LIBRARIES &lt;lib&gt;...      # names of library targets to import
                 LINK_LIBRARIES          # link interface libraries for LIBRARIES
                  [LINK_LIBS &lt;lib&gt; &lt;dep&gt;...]...
                 CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ...  # extra command line flags to pass to cmake
                 NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL     # skip installation of external project
                 )

              Relative paths in ARCHIVE_DIR and RUNTIME_DIR are interpreted with
              respect to the build directory corresponding to the source  direc&#8208;
              tory in which the function is invoked.


              Limitations:


              NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL  is  required for forward compatibility with a
              future version that supports installation of the external  project
              binaries during &quot;make install&quot;.


       CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
              define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

                CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++

       CMakeDependentOption
              Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

              This  macro  presents an option to the user only if a set of other
              conditions are true.  When the option is not presented  a  default
              value is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when
              the option is presented again. Example invocation:


                CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO &quot;Use Foo&quot; ON
                                       &quot;USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT&quot; OFF)

              If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides  an  option
              called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to
              OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any  value
              for  the  USE_FOO  option  is  saved  so  that  when the option is
              re-enabled it retains its old value.


       CMakeDetermineVSServicePack
              Includes a public function for assisting users in trying to deter&#8208;
              mine the

              Sets  the  passed in variable to one of the following values or an
              empty string if unknown.

                                                   [CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;] )




              CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes  a  list  of  libraries  and
              replaces  all  imported  targets contained in this list with their
              actual file paths of the referenced libraries on  disk,  including
              the  libraries  from  their link interfaces. If a CONFIGURATION is
              given, it uses the respective configuration of the  imported  tar&#8208;
              gets if it exists. If no CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first
              configuration from ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set,  otherwise
              ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}.  This macro is used by all Check*.cmake files
              which    use    TRY_COMPILE()    or    TRY_RUN()    and    support
              CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES  ,  so that these checks support imported
              targets in CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES:

       CMakeFindFrameworks
              helper module to find OSX frameworks


       CMakeFindPackageMode


              This file is executed by cmake when invoked  with  --find-package.
              It expects that the following variables are set using -D:


                 NAME = name of the package
                 COMPILER_ID = the CMake compiler ID for which the result is, i.e. GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc.
                 LANGUAGE = language for which the result will be used, i.e. C/CXX/Fortan/ASM
                 MODE = EXIST : only check for existance of the given package
                        COMPILE : print the flags needed for compiling an object file which uses the given package
                        LINK : print the flags needed for linking when using the given package
                 QUIET = if TRUE, don&apos;t print anything


       CMakeForceCompiler


              This  module  defines  macros  intended for use by cross-compiling
              toolchain files when CMake is not able to automatically detect the
              compiler identification.


              Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:


                 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

              It  sets  CMAKE_C_COMPILER  to  the  given  compiler and the cmake
              internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id. It
              also  bypasses  the  check for working compiler and basic compiler
              information tests.


              Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:


                 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

              It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given  compiler  and  the  cmake
              internal  variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.
              It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler
              information tests.


              Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following signature:


                 CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

              It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake
              internal variable  CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID  to  the  given  com&#8208;
              piler-id.  It  also  bypasses  the  check for working compiler and
              basic compiler information tests.


              So a simple toolchain file could look like this:


                 INCLUDE (CMakeForceCompiler)
                 SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
                 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
                 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)

                                                                 [NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
                                                                 [NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO])




              CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()  should  be  used  instead  of the
              plain  CONFIGURE_FILE()  command  when  creating  the   &lt;Name&gt;Con&#8208;
              fig.cmake  or &lt;Name&gt;-config.cmake file for installing a project or
              library. It helps making  the  resulting  package  relocatable  by
              avoiding hardcoded paths in the installed Config.cmake file.


              In  a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to make the
              install destinations know to the using project:


                 set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   &quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@&quot; )
                 set(FOO_DATA_DIR   &quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@&quot; )
                 set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   &quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons&quot; )
                 ...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
                 set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  &quot;${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot; )

              All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since  the  first  3
              hardcode  the absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works
              only if the logic to determine the installedPrefix is correct, and
              if  CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR  contains a relative path, which in general
              cannot be guaranteed. This  has  the  effect  that  the  resulting
              FooConfig.cmake  file  would  work  poorly  under Windows and OSX,
              where users are used to choose the install location  of  a  binary
              package at install time, independent from how CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
              was set at build/cmake time.


              Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used correctly, it
              makes the resulting FooConfig.cmake file relocatable. Usage:


                 1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to
                 2. insert a line containing only the string &quot;@PACKAGE_INIT@&quot;
                 3. instead of SET(FOO_DIR &quot;@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;), use SET(FOO_DIR &quot;@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)
                    (this must be after the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line)
                 4. instead of using the normal CONFIGURE_FILE(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()




              The  &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt; arguments are the input and output file,
              the same way as in CONFIGURE_FILE().


              The &lt;path&gt; given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must  be  the  destination
              where  the  FooConfig.cmake  file  will  be installed to. This can
              either be a relative or absolute path, both work.


              The variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; given as PATH_VARS  are  the  vari&#8208;
              ables  which  contain  install  destinations. For each of them the
              macro will create a helper variable PACKAGE_&lt;var...&gt;. These helper
              variables  must be used in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for setting
              the installed location. They  are  calculated  by  CONFIGURE_PACK&#8208;
              AGE_CONFIG_FILE()   so  that  they  are  always  relative  to  the
              installed location of the package. This works  both  for  relative
              and  also  for absolute locations. For absolute locations it works
              only   if   the   absolute   location   is   a   subdirectory   of
              CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


              By  default  configure_package_config_file()  also  generates  two
              helper  macros,  set_and_check()  and  check_required_components()
              into the FooConfig.cmake file.
&#12;              set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal set() command
              for setting directories and file locations. Additionally  to  set&#8208;
              ting  the  variable  it  also  checks  that the referenced file or
              directory actually exists and fails with a FATAL_ERROR  otherwise.
              This  makes  sure  that  the created FooConfig.cmake file does not
              contain wrong references. When using  the  NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO,
              this macro is not generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.


              check_required_components(&lt;package_name&gt;)  should be called at the
              end of the FooConfig.cmake file if  the  package  supports  compo&#8208;
              nents.  This macro checks whether all requested, non-optional com&#8208;
              ponents have been found, and if this is not  the  case,  sets  the
              Foo_FOUND  variable to FALSE, so that the package is considered to
              be not found. It does that by  testing  the  Foo_&lt;Component&gt;_FOUND
              variables  for  all  requested required components. When using the
              NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is  not  generated
              into the FooConfig.cmake file.


              For  an  example see below the documentation for WRITE_BASIC_PACK&#8208;
              AGE_VERSION_FILE().





                WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )




              Writes a file for  use  as  &lt;package&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake  file  to
              &lt;filename&gt;. See the documentation of FIND_PACKAGE() for details on
              this.


                  filename is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
                  major.minor.patch is the version number of the project to be installed

              The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means  that  the  installed
              package  version  will  be considered compatible if it is newer or
              exactly the same as the requested version.  This  mode  should  be
              used for packages which are fully backward compatible, also across
              major versions. If SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the  be&#8208;
              haviour  differs  from  AnyNewerVersion  in that the major version
              number must be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be
              considered  compatible  if  1.0  is requested. This mode should be
              used for packages which guarantee  backward  compatibility  within
              the  same major version. If ExactVersion is used, then the package
              is only considered compatible if  the  requested  version  matches
              exactly  its  own  version  number (not considering the tweak ver&#8208;
              sion). For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only  considered
              compatible  to  requested version 1.2.3. This mode is for packages
              without compatibility guarantees. If your project has more  elabo&#8208;
              rated version matching rules, you will need to write your own cus&#8208;
              tom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using this macro.


              Internally, this macro executes  configure_file()  to  create  the
              resulting  version file. Depending on the COMPATIBLITY, either the
              file   BasicConfigVersion-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in   or    Basic&#8208;
              ConfigVersion-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in  is  used. Please note that
              these two files are internal to CMake and you should not call con&#8208;
              figure_file()  on  them yourself, but they can be used as starting
              point  to  create  more  sophisticted  custom  ConfigVersion.cmake
              files.





              Example    using    both    configure_package_config_file()    and
              write_basic_package_version_file(): CMakeLists.txt:


                 set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
                 set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
                 set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE )
                 ...
                 include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
                 configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
                                               INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake
                                               PATH_VARS INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
                 write_basic_package_version_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
                                                  VERSION 1.2.3
                                                  COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion )
                 install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
                         DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )




              With a FooConfig.cmake.in:


                 set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z)
                 ...
                 @PACKAGE_INIT@
                 ...
                 set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR &quot;@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)
                 set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR &quot;@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)




                 check_required_components(Foo)


       CMakeParseArguments


              CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS(&lt;prefix&gt;   &lt;options&gt;    &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;
              &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; args...)


              CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS()  is intended to be used in macros or func&#8208;
              tions for parsing the arguments given to that macro  or  function.
              It  processes  the  arguments and defines a set of variables which
              hold the values of the respective options.


              The &lt;options&gt; argument contains all  options  for  the  respective
              macro,  i.e.  keywords  which  can  be used when calling the macro
              without any value following, like e.g. the OPTIONAL keyword of the
              install() command.


              The  &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;  argument contains all keywords for this
              macro which are followed by one value, like e.g. DESTINATION  key&#8208;
              word of the install() command.


              The &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all keywords for this
              macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g.  the
              TARGETS or FILES keywords of the install() command.


              When  done,  CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will have defined for each of
              the  keywords  listed  in  &lt;options&gt;,   &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;   and
              &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;  a  variable composed of the given &lt;prefix&gt;
              followed by &quot;_&quot; and the name  of  the  respective  keyword.  These
              variables  will  then  hold the respective value from the argument
              list. For the &lt;options&gt; keywords this will be TRUE or FALSE.


              All  remaining  arguments  are  collected  in  a  variable   &lt;pre&#8208;
              fix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS,  this  can  be  checked afterwards to see
              whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.


              As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes similar argu&#8208;
              ments as the real install() command:


                 function(MY_INSTALL)
                   set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
                   set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
                   set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
                   cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL &quot;${options}&quot; &quot;${oneValueArgs}&quot; &quot;${multiValueArgs}&quot; ${ARGN} )
                   ...




              Assume my_install() has been called like this:


                 my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub)




              After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will have set the
              following variables:


                 MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
                 MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this option was not used when calling my_install()
                 MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = &quot;bin&quot;
                 MY_INSTALL_RENAME = &quot;&quot; (was not used)
                 MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = &quot;foo;bar&quot;
                 MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = &quot;&quot; (was not used)
                 MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = &quot;blub&quot; (no value expected after &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;




              You can the continue and process these variables.


              Keywords terminate lists of  values,  e.g.  if  directly  after  a
              one_value_keyword  another  recognized  keyword  follows,  this is
              interpreted  as  the   beginning   of   the   new   option.   E.g.
              my_install(TARGETS  foo  DESTINATION  OPTIONAL)  would  result  in
              MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION set to &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, but  MY_INSTALL_DESTINA&#8208;
              TION  would  be empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE
              therefor.

       CMakePushCheckState


              This  module  defines  two  macros:  CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()  and
              CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() These two macros can be used to  save  and
              restore   the   state   of   the  variables  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS,
              CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS,      CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES      and
              CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES  used  by  the  various Check-files coming
              with CMake, like e.g. check_function_exists()  etc.  The  variable
              contents  are  pushed  on  a stack, pushing multiple times is sup&#8208;
              ported. This is  useful  e.g.  when  executing  such  tests  in  a
              Find-module,  where they have to be set, but after the Find-module
              has been executed they should have the  same  value  as  they  had
              before.


              Usage:


                 cmake_push_check_state()
                 set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS} -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
                 check_function_exists(...)
                 cmake_pop_check_state()


       CMakeVerifyManifest


              CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake
&#12;
              This  script  is used to verify that embeded manifests and side by
              side manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd  to  a
              directory  and  run  the script with cmake -P. On the command line
              you can pass in versions that are OK even  if  not  found  in  the
              .manifest  files. For example,  cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0
              -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embeded man&#8208;
              ifest  of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version
              was not found in the .manifest file.


       CPack  Build binary and source package installers.

              The CPack module generates binary and source installers in a vari&#8208;
              ety  of  formats  using  the cpack program. Inclusion of the CPack
              module adds two new targets to the  resulting  makefiles,  package
              and  package_source, which build the binary and source installers,
              respectively. The generated binary installers  contain  everything
              installed   via   CMake&apos;s  INSTALL  command  (and  the  deprecated
              INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).


              For certain kinds of binary installers  (including  the  graphical
              installers  on  Mac  OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers
              that allow users to select individual  application  components  to
              install. See CPackComponent module for that.


              The  CPACK_GENERATOR  variable has different meanings in different
              contexts. In your CMakeLists.txt file, CPACK_GENERATOR is a  *list
              of generators*: when run with no other arguments, CPack will iter&#8208;
              ate over that list and produce one package for each generator.  In
              a  CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERATOR is a *string
              naming a single generator*. If you need per-cpack- generator logic
              to   control   *other*   cpack   settings,   then   you   need   a
              CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


              The CMake source tree itself contains a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
              See the top level file CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.


              If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included automatically on
              a per-generator basis. It only need contain overrides.


              Here&apos;s how it works:


                - cpack runs
                - it includes CPackConfig.cmake
                - it iterates over the generators listed in that file&apos;s
                  CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
                  specific one via -G on the command line...)




                - foreach generator, it then
                  - sets CPACK_GENERATOR to the one currently being iterated
                  - includes the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
                  - produces the package for that generator




              This is the key: For each generator listed in  CPACK_GENERATOR  in
              CPackConfig.cmake,  cpack  will *reset* CPACK_GENERATOR internally
              to  *the  one  currently  being  used*  and   then   include   the
              CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


              Before  including  this  CPack module in your CMakeLists.txt file,
              there are a variety of variables that can be set to customize  the
              resulting installers. The most commonly-used variables are:


                CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or application). If
                not specified, defaults to the project name.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor. (e.g.,
                &quot;Kitware&quot;).




                CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY - The directory in which CPack is doing its
                packaging. If it is not set then this will default (internally) to the
                build dir. This variable may be defined in CPack config file or from
                the cpack command line option &quot;-B&quot;. If set the command line option
                override the value found in the config file.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR - Package major Version




                CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR - Package minor Version




                CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH - Package patch Version




                CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE - A text file used to describe the
                project. Used, for example, the introduction screen of a
                CPack-generated Windows installer to describe the project.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY - Short description of the
                project (only a few words).




                CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the package file to generate,
                not including the extension. For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686.
                The default value is




                ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY - Installation directory on the
                target system. This may be used by some CPack generators
                like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g., &quot;CMake 2.5&quot;
                below the installation prefix. All installed element will be
                put inside this directory.




                 CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON - A branding image that will be displayed inside
                 the installer (used by GUI installers).




                CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - CPack-time project CPack configuration
                file. This file included at cpack time, once per
                generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator
                being used. It allows per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at
                cpack time.




                CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE - License to be embedded in the installer. It
                will typically be displayed to the user by the produced installer
                (often with an explicit &quot;Accept&quot; button, for graphical installers)
                prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
                file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you want
                to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
                along with your project you must add an appropriate CMake INSTALL
                command in your CMakeLists.txt.




                CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README - ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer. It
                typically describes in some detail the purpose of the project
                during the installation. Not all CPack generators uses
                this file.




                CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME - Welcome file to be embedded in the
                installer. It welcomes users to this installer.
                Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.




                CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based
                installation mechanism. When set the component specification is ignored
                and all installed items are put in a single &quot;MONOLITHIC&quot; package.
                Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by default and
                may be asked to do component packaging by setting
                CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.




                CPACK_GENERATOR - List of CPack generators to use. If not
                specified, CPack will create a set of options CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g.,
                CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user to enable/disable individual
                generators. This variable may be used on the command line
                as well as in:




                  cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR=&quot;ZIP;TGZ&quot; /path/to/build/tree




                CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack binary configuration
                file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module
                for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES - Lists each of the executables and associated
                text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts. For example,
                setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will
                create a shortcut named &quot;CMake&quot; that will execute the installed
                executable ccmake. Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and
                OSXX11 do).




                CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped. Starting with
                CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
                enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE
                in CMake, so this change is compatible).
&#12;
              The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and
              will not affect binary packages:


                CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source package. For
                example cmake-2.6.1.




                CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES - List of files in the source tree that
                will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0
                CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which enables
                stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake,
                so this change is compatible).




                CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the source
                packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then
                CPack will create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP)
                allowing users to select which packages will be generated.




                CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack source
                configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration generated by the
                CPack module for source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.




                CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES - Pattern of files in the source tree
                that won&apos;t be packaged when building a source package. This is a
                list of regular expression patterns (that must be properly escaped),
                e.g., /CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*




              The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:


                CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR - What CMake generator should be used if the
                project is CMake project. Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR
                few users will want to change this setting.




                CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS - List of four values that specify
                what project to install. The four values are: Build directory,
                Project Name, Project Component, Directory. If omitted, CPack will
                build an installer that installers everything.




                CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME - System name, defaults to the value of
                ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.




                CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package full version, used internally. By
                default, this is built from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR,
                CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR, and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.




                CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG - Directory for the installed files.
&#12;                CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra commands to install components.




                CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES - Extra directories to install.




                 CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY - Registry key used when
                 installing this project. This is only used
                 by installer for Windows.
                 CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS - List of desktop links to create.





       CPackBundle
              CPack Bundle generator (Mac OS X) specific options




              Installers built on Mac OS X using the Bundle  generator  use  the
              aforementioned  DragNDrop (CPACK_DMG_xxx) variables, plus the fol&#8208;
              lowing Bundle-specific parameters (CPACK_BUNDLE_xxx).


                CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME - The name of the generated bundle. This
                appears in the OSX finder as the bundle name. Required.




                CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST - Path to an OSX plist file that will be used
                for the generated bundle. This assumes that the caller has generated
                or specified their own Info.plist file. Required.




                CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON - Path to an OSX icon file that will be used as
                the icon for the generated bundle. This is the icon that appears in the
                OSX finder for the bundle, and in the OSX dock when the bundle is opened.
                Required.




                CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_COMMAND - Path to a startup script. This is a path to
                an executable or script that will be run whenever an end-user double-clicks
                the generated bundle in the OSX Finder. Optional.


       CPackComponent
              Build binary and source package installers




              The CPackComponent module is the module which handles  the  compo&#8208;
              nent part of CPack. See CPack module for general information about
              CPack.


              For certain kinds of binary installers  (including  the  graphical
              installers  on  Mac  OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers
              that allow users to select individual  application  components  to
              install.  The contents of each of the components are identified by
              the COMPONENT argument of CMake&apos;s INSTALL  command.  These  compo&#8208;
              nents  can be annotated with user-friendly names and descriptions,
              inter-component dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to
              customize  the  resulting installer. See the cpack_add_* commands,
              described below, for  more  information  about  component-specific
              installations.
&#12;              Component-specific  installation  allows  users to select specific
              sets of components to install during the install process.  Instal&#8208;
              lation  components  are  identified  by  the COMPONENT argument of
              CMake&apos;s INSTALL commands, and should be further described  by  the
              following CPack commands:


                CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL - The list of component to install.




                The default value of this variable is computed by CPack
                and contains all components defined by the project. The
                user may set it to only include the specified components.




                CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL - Enable/Disable component install for
                CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.




                Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy
                default behavior. e.g. RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds component.
                One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.
                CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING - Specify how components are grouped for multi-package
                component-aware CPack generators.




                Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates several
                packages files when asked for component packaging. They group the component
                differently depending on the value of this variable:
                   - ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
                   - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
                   - IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group
                One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by using
                a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
                CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME - The name to be displayed for a component.
                CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION - The description of a component.
                CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP - The group of a component.
                CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS - The dependencies (list of components)
                on which this component depends.
                CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED - True is this component is required.
                 cpack_add_component - Describes a CPack installation component
                 named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL command.




                   cpack_add_component(compname
                                       [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                       [DESCRIPTION description]
                                       [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                                       [GROUP group]
                                       [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                                       [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                                       [DOWNLOADED]
                                       [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])




                 The cmake_add_component command describes an installation
                 component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of
                 the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the
                 component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more
                 CMake INSTALL commands.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in
                 graphical installers to display the component name. This value can
                 be any string.




                 DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
                 graphical installers to give the user additional information about
                 the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;\n&quot; as
                 the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no
                 more than a few lines long.




                 HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the
                 graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change
                 whether it is installed or not.




                 REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore
                 will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical
                 installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required
                 components are shown greyed out).




                 DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled
                 (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component
                 for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.




                 DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If
                 this component is selected, then each of the components listed
                 must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded
                 within the installer itself, so that users cannot install
                 inconsitent sets of components.




                 GROUP names the component group of which this component is a
                 part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone
                 component, not part of any component group. Component groups are
                 described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed
                 below.




                 INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component
                 is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this
                 component will automatically be selected. Installation types are
                 described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.




                 DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
                 on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
                 installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads
                 command.




                 ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack
                 to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will
                 create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and
                 the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more
                 information.




                 cpack_add_component_group - Describes a group of related CPack
                 installation components.




                   cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                                            [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                            [DESCRIPTION description]
                                            [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                                            [EXPANDED]
                                            [BOLD_TITLE])




                 The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
                 components, which will be placed together within the listing of
                 options. Typically, component groups allow the user to
                 select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
                 single group-level option. Use component groups to reduce the
                 complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an
                 arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of
                 the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
                 component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with
                 the name of any component.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
                 graphical installers to display the component group name. This
                 value can be any string.




                 DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group,
                 used in graphical installers to give the user additional
                 information about the components within that group. Descriptions
                 can span multiple lines using &quot;\n&quot; as the line
                 separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a
                 few lines long.




                 PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group.
                 Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups,
                 providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.




                 EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
                 &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user immediately sees all of the
                 components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially
                 show up as a single entry.




                 BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold,
                 to call the user&apos;s attention to the group.




                 cpack_add_install_type - Add a new installation type containing a
                 set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.




                   cpack_add_install_type(typename
                                          [DISPLAY_NAME name])
&#12;                 The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
                 components that represents a common use case for an
                 application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot; install type might include
                 an application along with its header and library files, while an
                 &quot;End user&quot; install type might just include the application&apos;s
                 executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more
                 install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
                 cpack_add_component.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
                 typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical
                 installer. This value can be any string.




                 cpack_configure_downloads - Configure CPack to download selected
                 components on-the-fly as part of the installation process.




                   cpack_configure_downloads(site
                                             [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                                             [ALL]
                                             [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])




                 The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time
                 downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component,
                 CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
                 component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the
                 user selects that component for installation, the installer will
                 download and extract the component in place. This feature is
                 useful for creating small installers that only download the
                 requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the
                 installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of
                 the normal installation process, and the &quot;Change&quot; button in
                 Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or
                 remove parts of the application after the original
                 installation. On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality
                 requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:




                   http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in




                 On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can
                 only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or
                 later.




                 The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
                 components will reside, e.g., http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/
                 All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.




                 UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
                 various archives for each of the components. The contents of this
                 directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
                 in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory
                 CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
                 archives.
&#12;
                 The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only
                 those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified
                 ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies
                 ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).




                 ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
                 that can be called from Windows&apos; Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
                 &quot;Modify&quot; button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE
                 turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.


       CPackCygwin
              Cygwin CPack generator (Cygwin).

              The  following  variable is specific to installers build on and/or
              for Cygwin:


                 CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_NUMBER - The Cygwin patch number.
                 FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.
                 CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_FILE - The Cygwin patch file.
                 FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.
                 CPACK_CYGWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT - The Cygwin build script.
                 FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.


       CPackDMG
              DragNDrop CPack generator (Mac OS X).

              The following variables are specific to the  DragNDrop  installers
              built on Mac OS X:


                CPACK_DMG_VOLUME_NAME - The volume name of the generated disk
                image. Defaults to CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME.




                CPACK_DMG_FORMAT - The disk image format. Common values are UDRO
                (UDIF read-only), UDZO (UDIF zlib-compressed) or UDBZ (UDIF
                bzip2-compressed). Refer to hdiutil(1) for more information on
                other available formats.




                CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE - Path to a custom DS_Store file. This .DS_Store
                file e.g. can be used to specify the Finder window
                position/geometry and layout (such as hidden toolbars, placement of the
                icons etc.). This file has to be generated by the Finder (either manually or
                through OSA-script) using a normal folder from which the .DS_Store
                file can then be extracted.




                CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE - Path to a background image file. This
                file will be used as the background for the Finder Window when the disk
                image is opened.  By default no background image is set. The background
                image is applied after applying the custom .DS_Store file.




                CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL - Path to the hdiutil(1) command used to
                operate on disk image files on Mac OS X. This variable can be used
                to override the automatically detected command (or specify its
                location if the auto-detection fails to find it.)




                CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE - Path to the SetFile(1) command used to set
                extended attributes on files and directories on Mac OS X. This
                variable can be used to override the automatically detected
                command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to
                find it.)




                CPACK_COMMAND_REZ - Path to the Rez(1) command used to compile
                resources on Mac OS X. This variable can be used to override the
                automatically detected command (or specify its location if the
                auto-detection fails to find it.)


       CPackDeb
              The builtin (binary) CPack Deb generator (Unix only)

              CPackDeb  may  be used to create Deb package using CPack. CPackDeb
              is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX variables used  by
              CPack : http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration. CPack&#8208;
              Deb generator should work on any linux host but  it  will  produce
              better  deb  package  when  Debian  specific  tools &apos;dpkg-xxx&apos; are
              usable on the build system.


              CPackDeb  has  specific  features  which  are  controlled  by  the
              specifics  CPACK_DEBIAN_XXX variables.You&apos;ll find a detailed usage
              on the wiki:


                http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#DEB_.28UNIX_only.29

              CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS


                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps
                   When one binary package declares a conflict with another using a Conflicts field,
                   dpkg will refuse to allow them to be installed on the system at the same time.

              CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PROVIDES

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps
                   Packages can declare in their control file that they should overwrite
                   files in certain other packages, or completely replace other packages.

              CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS


                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

                   Default   : -
                   see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps
                   Allows packages to declare a suggested package install grouping.

              CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA


                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   This variable allow advanced user to add custom script to the control.tar.gz
                   Typical usage is for conffiles, postinst, postrm, prerm.

              The  following  variables are specific to the graphical installers
              built on Windows using the Nullsoft Installation System.


                 CPACK_NSIS_INSTALL_ROOT - The default installation directory presented
                 to the end user by the NSIS installer is under this root dir. The full
                 directory presented to the end user is:
                 ${CPACK_NSIS_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY}




                 CPACK_NSIS_MUI_ICON - An icon filename.
                 The name of a *.ico file used as the main icon for the generated

                 CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra NSIS commands that
                 will be added to the end of the install Section, after your
                 install tree is available on the target system.




                 CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_UNINSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra NSIS commands that will
                 be added to the uninstall Section, before your install tree is

                 CPACK_NSIS_MODIFY_PATH - Modify PATH toggle.
                 If this is set to &quot;ON&quot;, then an extra page
                 will appear in the installer that will allow the user to choose
                 whether the program directory should be added to the system PATH
                 variable.

                 about the installation process.




                 CPACK_NSIS_CREATE_ICONS_EXTRA - Additional NSIS commands for
                 creating start menu shortcuts.




                 CPACK_NSIS_DELETE_ICONS_EXTRA -Additional NSIS commands to
                 uninstall start menu shortcuts.




                 CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLES_DIRECTORY - Creating NSIS start menu links
                 assumes that they are in &apos;bin&apos; unless this variable is set.
                 For example, you would set this to &apos;exec&apos; if your executables are
                 in an exec directory.




                 CPACK_NSIS_MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN - Specify an executable to add an option
                 to run on the finish page of the NSIS installer.
                 CPACK_NSIS_MENU_LINKS - Specify links in [application] menu.
                 This should contain a list of pair &quot;link&quot; &quot;link name&quot;. The link
                 may be an URL or a path relative to installation prefix.
                 Like:

       CPackPackageMaker
              PackageMaker CPack generator (Mac OS X).

              The following variable is specific to installers build on Mac OS X
              using PackageMaker:


                CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION - The version of Mac OS X that the
                resulting PackageMaker archive should be compatible with. Different
                versions of Mac OS X support different
                features. For example, CPack can only build component-based
                installers for Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build
                installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X 10.5
                or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the minimum
                version of Mac OS X that supports the requested features. Set this
                variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to guarantee
                that your installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and
                don&apos;t mind missing extra features available in the installer
                shipping with later versions of Mac OS X.


       CPackRPM
              The builtin (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix only)

              CPackRPM  may  be used to create RPM package using CPack. CPackRPM
              is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX variables used  by
              CPack : http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration


              However CPackRPM has specific features which are controlled by the
              specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables. CPackRPM is a  component  aware
              generator  so  when  CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL  is  ON some more
              CPACK_RPM_&lt;ComponentName&gt;_XXXX variables may be used in  order  to
              have  component specific values. Note however that &lt;componentName&gt;
              refers to the **grouping name**. This may be  either  a  component
              name  or  a component GROUP name. Usually those vars correspond to
              RPM spec file entities, one may find information about spec  files
              here http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs. You&apos;ll find a detailed usage of
              CPackRPM on the wiki:


                http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#RPM_.28Unix_Only.29

              However as a handy reminder here comes the list of specific  vari&#8208;
              ables:


                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY - The RPM package summary.
                   Mandatory : YES

                   Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION - The RPM package version.
                   Mandatory : YES
                   Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE - The RPM package architecture.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   This may be set to &quot;noarch&quot; if you
                   know you are building a noarch package.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE - The RPM package release.
                   Mandatory : YES
                   Default   : 1
                   This is the numbering of the RPM package
                   itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the
                   content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default
                   value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here
                   a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE - The RPM package license policy.
                   Mandatory : YES
                   Default   : &quot;unknown&quot;
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP - The RPM package group.
                   Mandatory : YES
                   Default   : &quot;unknown&quot;
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The RPM package vendor.
                   Mandatory : YES

                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_URL - The projects URL.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -

                   Mandatory : YES
                   Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or &quot;no package description available&quot;
                CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE - RPM compression type.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to override RPM compression type to be used
                   to build the RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default
                   to lzma or xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM.
                   Using this one can enforce compression type to be used.
                   Possible value are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES - RPM spec requires field.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).
                   Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes,
                   for example:
                   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES &quot;python &gt;= 2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8&quot;)
                   The required package list of an RPM file could be printed with
                   rpm -qp --requires file.rpm
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS - RPM spec suggest field.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to set weak RPM dependencies (suggests).
                   Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_PROVIDES - RPM spec provides field.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to set RPM dependencies (provides).
                   The provided package list of an RPM file could be printed with
                   rpm -qp --provides file.rpm
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_OBSOLETES - RPM spec obsoletes field.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to set RPM packages that are obsoleted by this one.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE - build a relocatable RPM.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE
                   If this variable is set to TRUE or ON CPackRPM will try
                   to build a relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may
                   be installed using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to
                   install it at an alternate place see rpm(8).
                   Note that currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
                   If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning message
                   but if there is file installed with absolute path you&apos;ll get
                   unexpected behavior.
                CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST - [deprecated].
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   This way of specifying post-install script is deprecated use
                   CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   May be used to set an RPM post-install command inside the spec file.
                   For example setting it to &quot;/bin/true&quot; may be used to prevent
                   rpmbuild to strip binaries.
                CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE - RPM extended spec definitions lines.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec file.
                CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG - Toggle CPackRPM debug output.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information
                   during CPack RPM run. For example you may launch CPack like this
                   cpack -D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM
                CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE - A user provided spec file.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file
                   to be used by CPackRPM instead of generating the file.
                   The specified file will be processed by CONFIGURE_FILE( @ONLY).
                CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE - Spec file template.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
                   spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this
                   cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
                   The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own
                   binary spec file which may be used with CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
                CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the spec file.
                   The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
                   put after the %pre or %preun section
                   If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
                   each component can be overridden with
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
                    rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm
                CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
                   The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
                   put after the %post or %postun section
                   If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
                   each component can be overridden with
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
                    rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm
                CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
                CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to explicitly specify %(&lt;directive&gt;) file line
                   in the spec file. Like %config(noreplace) or any other directive
                   that be found in the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating
                   the list of files (and directories) the user specified files of
                   the CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST list will be removed from the generated list.
                CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE - RPM changelog file.
                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to embed a changelog in the spec file.
                   The refered file will be read and directly put after the %changelog
                   section.


       CTest  Configure a project for testing with CTest/CDash

              Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a project to
              enable testing with CTest and dashboard submissions to CDash:


                 project(MyProject)
                 ...
                 include(CTest)

              The module  automatically  creates  a  BUILD_TESTING  option  that
              selects  whether to enable testing support (ON by default).  After
              including the module, use code like


                 if(BUILD_TESTING)
                   # ... CMake code to create tests ...
                 endif()

              to creating tests when testing is enabled.


              To enable submissions  to  a  CDash  server,  create  a  CTestCon&#8208;
              fig.cmake file at the top of the project with content such as


                 set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME &quot;MyProject&quot;)
                 set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME &quot;01:00:00 UTC&quot;)
                 set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD &quot;http&quot;)
                 set(CTEST_DROP_SITE &quot;my.cdash.org&quot;)
                 set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION &quot;/submit.php?project=MyProject&quot;)
                 set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)

              (the  CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator
              who configures &apos;MyProject&apos;).  Settings  in  the  config  file  are
              shared by both this CTest module and the CTest command-line tool&apos;s
              dashboard script mode (ctest -S).


              While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans  the
              build  output  for  errors and warnings and reports them with sur&#8208;
              rounding context from the build log.  This generic approach  works
              for  all  build tools, but does not give details about the command
              invocation that produced  a  given  problem.   One  may  get  more
              detailed reports by adding


                 set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)

              to  the  CTestConfig.cmake file.  When this option is enabled, the
              CTest module tells CMake&apos;s Makefile  generators  to  invoke  every
              command  in  the  generated  build system through a CTest launcher
              program.  (Currently the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored  on
              non-Makefile  generators.)   During  a  manual build each launcher
              transparently runs the command it wraps.   During  a  CTest-driven
              build  for  submission  to  CDash  each  launcher reports detailed
              information  when   its   command   fails   or   warns.   (Setting
              CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS  in  CTestConfig.cmake is convenient, but also
              adds the launcher  overhead  even  for  manual  builds.   One  may
              instead set it in a CTest dashboard script and add it to the CMake
              cache for the build tree.)


       CTestScriptMode


              This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)


       CheckCCompilerFlag
              Check whether the C compiler supports a given flag.

              CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)


                &lt;flag&gt; - the compiler flag
                &lt;var&gt;  - variable to store the result

              This internally calls the check_c_source_compiles macro. See  help
              for  CheckCSourceCompiles for a listing of variables that can mod&#8208;
              ify the build.


       CheckCSourceCompiles
              Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable

              CHECK_C_SOURCE_COMPILES(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt; [FAIL_REGEX &lt;fail-regex&gt;])


                &lt;code&gt;       - source code to try to compile, must define &apos;main&apos;
                &lt;var&gt;        - variable to store whether the source code compiled
                &lt;fail-regex&gt; - fail if test output matches this regex

              The following variables may be set before calling  this  macro  to
              modify the way the check is run:

                &lt;var&gt;  - variable to store the result

              This internally calls the  check_cxx_source_compiles  macro.   See
              help  for  CheckCXXSourceCompiles  for a listing of variables that
              can modify the build.


       CheckCXXSourceCompiles
              Check if given C++ source compiles and links into an executable

              CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt; [FAIL_REGEX &lt;fail-regex&gt;])


                &lt;code&gt;       - source code to try to compile, must define &apos;main&apos;
                &lt;var&gt;        - variable to store whether the source code compiled

                &lt;code&gt;   - source code to try to compile
                &lt;var&gt;    - variable to store the result

       CheckCXXSymbolExists
              Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro in C++

              CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)


              Check that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after including given  header
              &lt;files&gt; and store the result in a &lt;variable&gt;.  Specify the list of
              files   in   one   argument   as   a   semicolon-separated   list.
              CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS()  can  be  used to check in C++ files, as
              opposed to CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which works only for C.


              If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is  considered
              available  and  assumed  to work.  If the header files declare the
              symbol as a function or variable then  the  symbol  must  also  be
              available  for  linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum value it
              will not be recognized (consider using  CheckTypeSize  or  CheckC&#8208;
              SourceCompiles).

       CheckFortranFunctionExists
              macro which checks if the Fortran function exists

              CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(FUNCTION VARIABLE)


                FUNCTION - the name of the Fortran function
                VARIABLE - variable to store the result

              Check if a C function can be linked

              CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(&lt;function&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)


              Check  that  the &lt;function&gt; is provided by libraries on the system
              and store the result in a &lt;variable&gt;.  This does not  verify  that
              any  system header file declares the function, only that it can be
              found at link time (considure using CheckSymbolExists).


              The following variables may be set before calling  this  macro  to

              CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(INCLUDE VARIABLE)


                INCLUDE  - name of include file
                VARIABLE - variable to return result


              an  optional  third  argument  is the CFlags to add to the compile
              line  or you can use CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS

                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories





       CheckIncludeFileCXX
              Check if the include file exists.

                CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX(INCLUDE VARIABLE)




                INCLUDE  - name of include file
                VARIABLE - variable to return result


              An  optional  third  argument  is the CFlags to add to the compile
              line  or you can use CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS.

       CheckIncludeFiles
              Check if the files can be included




              CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES(INCLUDE VARIABLE)


                INCLUDE  - list of files to include
                VARIABLE - variable to return result

                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories


       CheckLanguage
              Check if a language can be enabled

              Usage:


                check_language(&lt;lang&gt;)

              where &lt;lang&gt; is a language that may be passed to enable_language()
              such  as  &quot;Fortran&quot;.   If CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER is already defined
              the check does nothing.  Otherwise it tries enabling the  language
              in  a test project.  The result is cached in CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER
              as the compiler that was found, or NOTFOUND if the language cannot
              be enabled.


              Example:


                check_language(Fortran)
                if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
                  enable_language(Fortran)
                else()
                  message(STATUS &quot;No Fortran support&quot;)
                endif()


       CheckLibraryExists
              Check if the function exists.

              CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS (LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION VARIABLE)


                LIBRARY  - the name of the library you are looking for
                FUNCTION - the name of the function
                LOCATION - location where the library should be found
                VARIABLE - variable to store the result




              The  following  variables  may be set before calling this macro to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link


       CheckPrototypeDefinition
              Check if the protoype we expect is correct.

              check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN HEADER  VARI&#8208;
              ABLE)


                FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if prototype exists)
                PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check.
                RETURN - The return value of the function.
                HEADER - The header files required.
                VARIABLE - The variable to store the result.

              Example:
&#12;                check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r
                 &quot;struct passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int buflen)&quot;
                 &quot;NULL&quot;
                 &quot;unistd.h;pwd.h&quot;
                 SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)

              The  following  variables  may be set before calling this macro to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link


       CheckStructHasMember
              Check if the given struct or class has the specified member  vari&#8208;
              able

              CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER (STRUCT MEMBER HEADER VARIABLE)


                STRUCT - the name of the struct or class you are interested in
                MEMBER - the member which existence you want to check
                HEADER - the header(s) where the prototype should be declared
                VARIABLE - variable to store the result




              The  following  variables  may be set before calling this macro to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories




              Example:    CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(&quot;struct    timeval&quot;     tv_sec
              sys/select.h HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC)


       CheckSymbolExists
              Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro

              CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)


              Check  that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after including given header
              &lt;files&gt; and store the result in a &lt;variable&gt;.  Specify the list of
              files in one argument as a semicolon-separated list.


              If  the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
              available and assumed to work.  If the header  files  declare  the
              symbol  as  a  function  or  variable then the symbol must also be
              available for linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum  value  it
              will  not  be  recognized (consider using CheckTypeSize or CheckC&#8208;
              SourceCompiles). If the check needs to be done  in  C++,  consider
              using CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which does the same as CHECK_SYM&#8208;
              BOL_EXISTS(), but in C++.


              The following variables may be set before calling  this  macro  to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link


       CheckTypeSize
              Check sizeof a type
&#12;                CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY])

              Check  if  the  type  exists  and  determine  its size. On return,
              &quot;HAVE_${VARIABLE}&quot; holds the existence of the type,  and  &quot;${VARI&#8208;
              ABLE}&quot; holds one of the following:


                 &lt;size&gt; = type has non-zero size &lt;size&gt;
                 &quot;0&quot;    = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
                 &quot;&quot;     = type does not exist

              Furthermore,  the variable &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot; holds C preprocessor
              code to define the macro &quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; to the size of the type, or
              leave the macro undefined if the type does not exist.


              The variable &quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; may be &quot;0&quot; when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
              has multiple architectures for building OS X  universal  binaries.
              This  indicates that the type size varies across architectures. In
              this case &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot; contains C preprocessor tests mapping
              from  each  architecture macro to the corresponding type size. The
              list of architecture macros is stored in  &quot;${VARIABLE}_KEYS&quot;,  and
              the value for each key is stored in &quot;${VARIABLE}-${KEY}&quot;.


              If  the  BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY  option is not given, the macro checks
              for headers &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, &lt;stdint.h&gt;, and &lt;stddef.h&gt;,  and  saves
              results  in  HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H,  HAVE_STDINT_H,  and HAVE_STDDEF_H.
              The type size check automatically includes the available  headers,
              thus supporting checks of types defined in the headers.


              The  following  variables  may be set before calling this macro to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
                CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
                CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to include


       CheckVariableExists
              Check if the variable exists.

                CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)




                VAR      - the name of the variable
                VARIABLE - variable to store the result




              This macro is only for C variables.


              The following variables may be set before calling  this  macro  to
              modify the way the check is run:


                CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags

       Dart   Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

              This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest mod&#8208;
              ule. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dash&#8208;
              board  submissions  as  well  as  testing with CTest.  This module
              should be included in the CMakeLists.txt file  at  the  top  of  a
              project.  Typical usage:


                INCLUDE(Dart)
                IF(BUILD_TESTING)
                  # ... testing related CMake code ...
                ENDIF(BUILD_TESTING)

              The  BUILD_TESTING  option is created by the Dart module to deter&#8208;
              mine whether testing support should be enabled.   The  default  is
              ON.


       DeployQt4
              Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4 executable.

              A  collection  of CMake utility functions useful for deploying Qt4
              executables.


              The following functions are provided by this module:


                 write_qt4_conf
                 resolve_qt4_paths
                 fixup_qt4_executable
                 install_qt4_plugin_path
                 install_qt4_plugin
                 install_qt4_executable

              Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses  function  and  PAR&#8208;
              ENT_SCOPE. Also depends on BundleUtilities.cmake.


                WRITE_QT4_CONF(&lt;qt_conf_dir&gt; &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;)

              Writes   a   qt.conf   file   with   the  &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;  into
              &lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;.


                RESOLVE_QT4_PATHS(&lt;paths_var&gt; [&lt;executable_path&gt;])

              Loop through &lt;paths_var&gt; list and if any don&apos;t exist resolve  them
              relative   to   the   &lt;executable_path&gt;   (if   supplied)  or  the
              CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


                FIXUP_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt; [&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;])

              Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed)  and
              fixes  up  a  Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is stand&#8208;
              alone and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine  as  long
              as all of the system libraries are compatible.


              &lt;executable&gt; should point to the executable to be fixed-up.


              &lt;qtplugins&gt;  should contain a list of the names or paths of any Qt
              plugins to be installed.


              &lt;libs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and should be a  list  of
              any already installed plugins, libraries or executables to also be
              fixed-up.


              &lt;dirs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and  should  contain  and
              directories to be searched to find library dependencies.


              &lt;plugins_dir&gt; allows an custom plugins directory to be used.


              &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;  will force a qt.conf file to be written even if
              not needed.


                INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;component&gt; &lt;configurations&gt;)

              Install (or copy) a  resolved  &lt;plugin&gt;  to  the  default  plugins
              directory  (or  &lt;plugins_dir&gt;)  relative to &lt;executable&gt; and store
              the result in &lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;.
&#12;              If &lt;copy&gt; is set to TRUE then the plugins will  be  copied  rather
              than  installed.  This is to allow this module to be used at CMake
              time rather than install time.


              If &lt;component&gt; is set then anything installed will use this COMPO&#8208;
              NENT.


                INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;component&gt;)

              Install  (or  copy)  an unresolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the default plugins
              directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative to  &lt;executable&gt;  and  store
              the  result  in  &lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;. See documentation of
              INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.


                INSTALL_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt; [&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt; &lt;component&gt;])

              Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration  file  (if  needed)
              and  fixes  up  a  Qt4  executable  using BundleUtilities so it is
              standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to another  machine  as
              long as all of the system libraries are compatible. The executable
              will be fixed-up at install time.  &lt;component&gt;  is  the  COMPONENT
              used  for  bundle fixup and plugin installation. See documentation
              of FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.

       ExternalProject
              Create custom targets to build projects in external trees

              The  &apos;ExternalProject_Add&apos;  function  creates  a  custom target to
              drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install  and  test
              steps of an external project:

                  [LOG_CONFIGURE 1]           # Wrap configure in script to log output
                  [LOG_BUILD 1]               # Wrap build in script to log output
                  [LOG_TEST 1]                # Wrap test in script to log output

                  [STEP_TARGETS st1 st2 ...]  # Generate custom targets for these steps
                  )

              The  *_DIR  options  specify  directories  for  the  project, with
              default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX  option  is
              given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX directory property
              is set, then an external project is built and installed under  the
              specified prefix:


                 TMP_DIR      = &lt;prefix&gt;/tmp
                 STAMP_DIR    = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp
                 DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/src
                 SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;
                 BINARY_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build
                 INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;prefix&gt;

              Otherwise,  if  the  EP_BASE directory property is set then compo&#8208;
              nents of an external project are stored under the specified base:


                 TMP_DIR      = &lt;base&gt;/tmp/&lt;name&gt;
                 STAMP_DIR    = &lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt;
                 DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt;
                 SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt;
                 BINARY_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt;
                 INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;

              If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then the  default
              is  to  set  PREFIX  to &quot;&lt;name&gt;-prefix&quot;. Relative paths are inter&#8208;
              preted with respect to the build directory  corresponding  to  the
              source directory in which ExternalProject_Add is invoked.


              If  SOURCE_DIR  is  explicitly  set  to  an existing directory the
              project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step  must  be
              specified  using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*, SVN_*, or URL
              options. The URL option may refer locally to a directory or source
              tarball, or refer to a remote tarball (e.g. http://.../src.tgz).


              The  &apos;ExternalProject_Add_Step&apos;  function adds a custom step to an
              external project:


                ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; # Names of project and custom step
                  [COMMAND cmd...]        # Command line invoked by this step
                  [COMMENT &quot;text...&quot;]     # Text printed when step executes
                  [DEPENDEES steps...]    # Steps on which this step depends
                  [DEPENDERS steps...]    # Steps that depend on this step
                  [DEPENDS files...]      # Files on which this step depends
                  [ALWAYS 1]              # No stamp file, step always runs
                  [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command
                  [LOG 1]                 # Wrap step in script to log output
                  )

              The command line, comment, and working directory of every standard
              and  custom  step  is  processed  to  replace tokens &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;,
              &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;,  &lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;,  and  &lt;TMP_DIR&gt;  with  corresponding
              property values.


              The  &apos;ExternalProject_Get_Property&apos;  function  retrieves  external
              project target properties:
&#12;                ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; [prop1 [prop2 [...]]])

              It stores property values in variables of the same name.  Property
              names  correspond  to  the keyword argument names of &apos;ExternalPro&#8208;
              ject_Add&apos;.


              The &apos;ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets&apos;  function  generates  custom
              targets for the steps listed:


                ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; [step1 [step2 [...]]])




              If  STEP_TARGETS  is  set  then ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets is
              automatically called at the end of matching calls to  ExternalPro&#8208;
              ject_Add_Step.  Pass  STEP_TARGETS explicitly to individual Exter&#8208;
              nalProject_Add calls, or  implicitly  to  all  ExternalProject_Add
              calls by setting the directory property EP_STEP_TARGETS.


              If STEP_TARGETS is not set, clients may still manually call Exter&#8208;
              nalProject_Add_StepTargets after  calling  ExternalProject_Add  or
              ExternalProject_Add_Step.


              This  functionality is provided to make it easy to drive the steps
              independently of each other by specifying targets on build command
              lines.  For  example, you may be submitting to a sub-project based
              dashboard, where you want to drive the configure  portion  of  the
              build,  then  submit  to the dashboard, followed by the build por&#8208;
              tion, followed by tests.  If  you  invoke  a  custom  target  that
              depends  on a step halfway through the step dependency chain, then
              all the previous steps will also run to ensure everything is up to
              date.


              For  example,  to  drive  configure, build and test steps indepen&#8208;
              dently for each ExternalProject_Add call in  your  project,  write
              the  following line prior to any ExternalProject_Add calls in your
              CMakeLists file:


                 set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS configure build test)


       FeatureSummary
              Macros for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features




              This  module  provides  the  macros  feature_summary(),  set_pack&#8208;
              age_properties() and add_feature_info(). For compatibility it also
              still     provides     set_package_info(),     set_feature_info(),
              print_enabled_features() and print_disabled_features().


              These macros can be used to generate a summary of enabled and dis&#8208;
              abled packages and/or feature for a build tree:

                                 )




              The FEATURE_SUMMARY() macro can be used to print information about
              enabled or disabled packages or features of a project. By default,
              only the names of the features/packages will be printed and  their
              required  version  when one was specified. Use SET_PACKAGE_PROPER&#8208;
              TIES() to add more useful information, like e.g.  a  download  URL
              for the respective package or their purpose in the project.


              The  WHAT  option  is  the only mandatory option. Here you specify
              what information will be printed:


                  ALL: print everything
                  ENABLED_FEATURES: the list of all features which are enabled
                  DISABLED_FEATURES: the list of all features which are disabled
                  PACKAGES_FOUND: the list of all packages which have been found
                  PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: the list of all packages which have not been found
                  OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type OPTIONAL
                  OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type OPTIONAL
                  RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
                  RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
                  REQUIRED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type REQUIRED
                  REQUIRED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type REQUIRED
                  RUNTIME_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been found which have the type RUNTIME
                  RUNTIME_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have not been found which have the type RUNTIME




              If a FILENAME is given, the information is printed into this file.
              If APPEND is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file
              is overwritten if it already existed. If the VAR option  is  used,
              the information is &quot;printed&quot; into the specified variable. If FILE&#8208;
              NAME is not used, the information  is  printed  to  the  terminal.
              Using  the DESCRIPTION option a description or headline can be set
              which   will   be   printed   above   the   actual   content.   If
              INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES is given, packages which have been searched
              with find_package(... QUIET) will also be listed. By default  they
              are skipped. If FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES is given, CMake
              will abort if a package which is marked as REQUIRED has  not  been
              found.


              Example 1, append everything to a file:

                                 FILENAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)




              Example  2,  print the enabled features into the variable enabled&#8208;
              FeaturesText, including QUIET packages:


                 feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
                                 INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES
                                 DESCRIPTION &quot;Enabled Features:&quot;
                                 VAR enabledFeaturesText)
                 message(STATUS &quot;${enabledFeaturesText}&quot;)
&#12;

                  SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES(&lt;name&gt; PROPERTIES [ URL &lt;url&gt; ]
                                                           [ DESCRIPTION &lt;description&gt; ]
                                                           [ TYPE (RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ]
                                                           [ PURPOSE &lt;purpose&gt; ]
                                        )




              Use this macro to set up  information  about  the  named  package,
              which  can  then  be  displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY(). This can be
              done either directly in the Find-module or in  the  project  which
              uses  the  module  after the FIND_PACKAGE() call. The features for
              which information can  be  set  are  added  automatically  by  the
              find_package() command.


              URL: this should be the homepage of the package, or something sim&#8208;
              ilar. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.


              DESCRIPTION: A short description what that package is, at most one
              sentence. Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.


              TYPE:  What type of dependency has the using project on that pack&#8208;
              age. Default is OPTIONAL. In this case it is a package  which  can
              be  used  by  the project when available at buildtime, but it also
              work without. RECOMMENDED is similar to OPTIONAL, i.e. the project
              will build if the package is not present, but the functionality of
              the resulting binaries will be  severly  limited.  If  a  REQUIRED
              package  is  not  available at buildtime, the project may not even
              build.   This   can   be   combined   with   the    FATAL_ON_MISS&#8208;
              ING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary(). Last, a RUN&#8208;
              TIME package is a package which is actually not used at all during
              the  build, but which is required for actually running the result&#8208;
              ing binaries. So if such a package is  missing,  the  project  can
              still be built, but it may not work later on. If set_package_prop&#8208;
              erties() is called multiple times for the same package  with  dif&#8208;
              ferent TYPEs, the TYPE is only changed to higher TYPEs ( RUNTIME &lt;
              OPTIONAL &lt; RECOMMENDED &lt; REQUIRED ), lower TYPEs are ignored.  The
              TYPE  property  is  project-specific,  so  it cannot be set by the
              Find-module, but must be set in the project.


              PURPOSE: This describes which features this package enables in the
              project,  i.e. it tells the user what functionality he gets in the
              resulting binaries. If set_package_properties() is called multiple
              times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list
              of purposes of the package in the project. As the  TYPE  property,
              also the PURPOSE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set
              by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.





              Example for setting the info for a package:


                 find_package(LibXml2)
                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES DESCRIPTION &quot;A XML processing library.&quot;
                                                           URL &quot;http://xmlsoft.org/&quot;)




                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE RECOMMENDED
                                                           PURPOSE &quot;Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor&quot;)
                 ...
                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE OPTIONAL
                                                           PURPOSE &quot;Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor&quot;)




                 find_package(DBUS)
                 set_package_properties(DBUS PROPERTIES TYPE RUNTIME
                                                           PURPOSE &quot;Necessary to disable the screensaver during a presentation&quot; )




                  ADD_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;enabled&gt; &lt;description&gt;)

              Use this macro to add information about a feature with  the  given
              &lt;name&gt;. &lt;enabled&gt; contains whether this feature is enabled or not,
              &lt;description&gt; is a text describing the  feature.  The  information
              can  be displayed using feature_summary() for ENABLED_FEATURES and
              DISABLED_FEATURES respectively.


              Example for setting the info for a feature:


                 option(WITH_FOO &quot;Help for foo&quot; ON)
                 add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO &quot;The Foo feature provides very cool stuff.&quot;)







              The following macros are provided for compatibility with  previous
              CMake versions:


                  SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; [&lt;url&gt; [&lt;purpose&gt;] ] )

              Use  this  macro  to  set  up information about the named package,
              which can then be displayed via  FEATURE_SUMMARY().  This  can  be
              done  either  directly  in the Find-module or in the project which
              uses the module after the FIND_PACKAGE() call.  The  features  for
              which  information  can  be  set  are  added  automatically by the
              find_package() command.


                  PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()

              Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT  ENABLED_FEATURES   DESCRIP&#8208;
              TION &quot;Enabled features:&quot;)


                  PRINT_DISABLED_FEATURES()

              Does  the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES  DESCRIP&#8208;
              TION &quot;Disabled features:&quot;)


                  SET_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; [&lt;url&gt;] )

              Does the same as SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;url&gt; )


       FindALSA
              Find alsa

              Find the alsa libraries (asound)


                This module defines the following variables:

                   ALSA_LIBRARIES   - Set when ALSA_LIBRARY is found
                   ALSA_INCLUDE_DIRS - Set when ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR is found




                   ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find asoundlib.h, etc.
                   ALSA_LIBRARY     - the asound library
                   ALSA_VERSION_STRING - the version of alsa found (since CMake 2.8.8)





       FindASPELL
              Try to find ASPELL
&#12;              Once done this will define


                ASPELL_FOUND - system has ASPELL
                ASPELL_EXECUTABLE - the ASPELL executable
                ASPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the ASPELL include directory
                ASPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use ASPELL
                ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using ASPELL


       FindAVIFile
              Locate AVIFILE library and include paths

              AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of libraries for
              i386 machines to use various AVI codecs. Support is limited beyond
              Linux. Windows provides native AVI support, and  so  doesn&apos;t  need
              this library. This module defines


                AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
                AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
                AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
                AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don&apos;t try to use AVIFILE


       FindArmadillo
              Find Armadillo

              Find the Armadillo C++ library


              Using Armadillo:


                find_package(Armadillo REQUIRED)
                include_directories(${ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
                add_executable(foo foo.cc)
                target_link_libraries(foo ${ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES})

              This module sets the following variables:


                ARMADILLO_FOUND - set to true if the library is found
                ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS - list of required include directories
                ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to be linked
                ARMADILLO_VERSION_MAJOR - major version number
                ARMADILLO_VERSION_MINOR - minor version number

                ARMADILLO_VERSION_STRING - version number as a string (ex: &quot;1.0.4&quot;)
                ARMADILLO_VERSION_NAME - name of the version (ex: &quot;Antipodean Antileech&quot;)


       FindBISON
              Find bison executable and provides macros to generate custom build
              rules

              The module defines the following variables:


                BISON_EXECUTABLE - path to the bison program
                BISON_VERSION - version of bison
                BISON_FOUND - true if the program was found




              The minimum required version of bison can be specified  using  the
              standard CMake syntax, e.g. find_package(BISON 2.1.3)


              If bison is found, the module defines the macros:


                BISON_TARGET(&lt;Name&gt; &lt;YaccInput&gt; &lt;CodeOutput&gt; [VERBOSE &lt;file&gt;]
                            [COMPILE_FLAGS &lt;string&gt;])

              which  will  create  a custom rule to generate  a parser. &lt;YaccIn&#8208;
              put&gt; is the path to  a yacc file. &lt;CodeOutput&gt; is the name  of the
              source  file generated by bison.  A header file is also  be gener&#8208;
              ated, and contains the  token  list.  If  COMPILE_FLAGS  option is
              specified,   the   next  parameter is  added in the bison  command
              line.  if  VERBOSE option is specified,  &lt;file&gt;  is  created   and
              contains verbose descriptions of the grammar and parser. The macro
              defines a set of variables:


                BISON_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully
                BISON_${Name}_INPUT - The input source file, an alias for &lt;YaccInput&gt;
                BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_SOURCE - The source file generated by bison
                BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - The header file generated by bison
                BISON_${Name}_OUTPUTS - The sources files generated by bison
                BISON_${Name}_COMPILE_FLAGS - Options used in the bison command line




                ====================================================================
                Example:




                 find_package(BISON)
                 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
                 add_executable(Foo main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})
                ====================================================================


       FindBLAS
              Find BLAS library

              This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the
              BLAS  linear-algebra  interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/).
              The list of libraries searched for  is  taken  from  the  autoconf
              macro  file, acx_blas.m4 (distributed at http://ac-archive.source&#8208;
              forge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).


              This module sets the following variables:


                BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS interface
                  is found
                BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of required linker flags (excluding -l
                  and -L).
                BLAS_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
                  link against to use BLAS
                BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of libraries (using full path name)
                  to link against to use BLAS95 interface
                BLAS95_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the BLAS f95 interface
                  is found
                BLA_STATIC  if set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
                BLA_VENDOR  if set checks only the specified vendor, if not set checks
                   all the possibilities
                BLA_F95     if set on tries to find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK

              C/CXX should be enabled to use Intel mkl


       FindBZip2
              Try to find BZip2

              Once done this will define


                BZIP2_FOUND - system has BZip2
                BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR - the BZip2 include directory
                BZIP2_LIBRARIES - Link these to use BZip2
                BZIP2_NEED_PREFIX - this is set if the functions are prefixed with BZ2_
                BZIP2_VERSION_STRING - the version of BZip2 found (since CMake 2.8.8)


       FindBoost
              Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries

              Usage of this module as follows:


              NOTE: Take note of the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  variable  below.
              Due to Boost naming conventions and limitations in CMake this find
              module is NOT future safe with respect to Boost  version  numbers,
              and may break.
&#12;              == Using Header-Only libraries from within Boost: ==


                 find_package( Boost 1.36.0 )
                 if(Boost_FOUND)
                    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
                    add_executable(foo foo.cc)
                 endif()







              == Using actual libraries from within Boost: ==


                 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        ON)
                 set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      ON)
                 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME    OFF)
                 find_package( Boost 1.36.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ... )




                 if(Boost_FOUND)
                    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
                    add_executable(foo foo.cc)
                    target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
                 endif()







              The  components  list  needs  to  contain  actual  names  of boost
              libraries only, such as &quot;date_time&quot; for &quot;libboost_date_time&quot;.   If
              you&apos;re  using  parts of Boost that contain header files only (e.g.
              foreach) you do not need to specify COMPONENTS.


              You should provide a minimum version number that should  be  used.
              If  you  provide  this  version  number  and  specify the REQUIRED
              attribute, this module will fail if it can&apos;t find the specified or
              a later version. If you specify a version number this is automati&#8208;
              cally put into the considered list of  version  numbers  and  thus
              doesn&apos;t  need  to  be  specified  in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
              variable (see below).


              NOTE for Visual Studio Users:


                   Automatic linking is used on MSVC &amp; Borland compilers by default when
                   #including things in Boost.  It&apos;s important to note that setting
                   Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF is NOT enough to get you dynamic linking,
                   should you need this feature.  Automatic linking typically uses static
                   libraries with a few exceptions (Boost.Python is one).




                   Please see the section below near Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS for
                   more details.  Adding a TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES() as shown in the example
                   above appears to cause VS to link dynamically if Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS
                   gets set to OFF.  It is suggested you avoid automatic linking since it
                   will make your application less portable.




              =========== The mess that  is  Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  (sorry?)
              ============


              OK, so the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to spec&#8208;
              ify a list of boost version numbers  that  should  be  taken  into
              account  when  searching  for  Boost. Unfortunately boost puts the
              version number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this
              variable  will  certainly  be  needed in the future when new Boost
              versions are released.


              Currently this module searches for the following version  numbers:
              1.33,  1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1,

              Variables used by this module, they can change the default  behav&#8208;
              iour and need to be set before calling find_package:


                 Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      Can be set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded
                                              boost libraries.  If not specified, defaults
                                              to ON.




                 Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        Can be set to ON to force the use of the static
                                              boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.




                 Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS        Set to TRUE to suppress searching in system
                                              paths (or other locations outside of BOOST_ROOT
                                              or BOOST_INCLUDEDIR).  Useful when specifying
                                              BOOST_ROOT. Defaults to OFF.
                                                [Since CMake 2.8.3]




                 Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE         Do not do a find_package call in config mode
                                              before searching for a regular boost install.
                                              This will avoid finding boost-cmake installs.
                                              Defaults to OFF.
                                                [Since CMake 2.8.6]




                 Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME     If enabled, searches for boost libraries

                                              if not specified is platform dependent
                                              for backwards compatibility.

              Other Variables used by this module which you may want to set.


                 Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS    A list of version numbers to use for searching
                                              the boost include directory.  Please see
                                              the documentation above regarding this
                                              annoying, but necessary variable :(




                 Boost_DEBUG                  Set this to TRUE to enable debugging output
                                              of FindBoost.cmake if you are having problems.
                                              Please enable this before filing any bug
                                              reports.




                 Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG   FindBoost doesn&apos;t output detailed information

                                              unless this is set to TRUE or the REQUIRED
                                              keyword is specified in find_package().
                                                [Since CMake 2.8.0]




                 Boost_COMPILER               Set this to the compiler suffix used by Boost
                                              (e.g. &quot;-gcc43&quot;) if FindBoost has problems finding
                                              the proper Boost installation




                 Boost_THREADAPI                When building boost.thread, sometimes the name of the
                                              library contains an additional &quot;pthread&quot; or &quot;win32&quot;
                                              string known as the threadapi.  This can happen when
                                              compiling against pthreads on Windows or win32 threads
                                              on Cygwin.  You may specify this variable and if set
                                              when FindBoost searches for the Boost threading library
                                              it will first try to match the threadapi you specify.
                                                For Example: libboost_thread_win32-mgw45-mt-1_43.a
                                              might be found if you specified &quot;win32&quot; here before
                                              falling back on libboost_thread-mgw45-mt-1_43.a.

                 Boost_REALPATH               Resolves symbolic links for discovered boost libraries
                                              to assist with packaging.  For example, instead of
                                              Boost_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_RELEASE being resolved to
                                              &quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so&quot; it would be
                                              &quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.42.0&quot; instead.
                                              This does not affect linking and should not be
                                              enabled unless the user needs this information.

       FindBullet
              Try to find the Bullet physics engine
&#12;


                This module defines the following variables




                BULLET_FOUND - Was bullet found
                BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Bullet include directories
                BULLET_LIBRARIES - Link to this, by default it includes
                                   all bullet components (Dynamics,
                                   Collision, LinearMath, &amp; SoftBody)




                This module accepts the following variables




                BULLET_ROOT - Can be set to bullet install path or Windows build path





       FindCABLE
              Find CABLE

              This  module  finds if CABLE is installed and determines where the
              include files and libraries are.  This  code  sets  the  following
              variables:


                CABLE             the path to the cable executable
                CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY the path to the Tcl wrapper library
                CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the path to the include directory




              To  build  Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and link it
              to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}.  You should also add ${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR}
              as an include directory.


       FindCUDA
              Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

              This  script  locates  the  NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should work on
              linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to  date  with
              CUDA C releases.


              This  script  makes  use of the standard find_package arguments of
              &lt;VERSION&gt;, REQUIRED and  QUIET.   CUDA_FOUND  will  report  if  an
              acceptable version of CUDA was found.


              The  script  will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR
              if the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in  the
              system  path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package(). To use a
              different installed version of the  toolkit  set  the  environment
              variable     CUDA_BIN_PATH     before    running    cmake    (e.g.
              CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0   instead    of    the    default
              /usr/local/cuda)  or  set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.
              If you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR,  various  compo&#8208;
              nents that depend on the path will be relocated.


              It  might  be  necessary  to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on
              certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed  in  the
              default  location.  In  newer  versions  of  the  toolkit the cuda
              library is included with the graphics driver-  be  sure  that  the
              driver version matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.


              The  following  variables affect the behavior of the macros in the
              script (in alphebetical order).  Note that any of these flags  can
              be  changed  multiple  times  in the same directory before calling
              CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,  CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY,  CUDA_COMPILE,   CUDA_COM&#8208;
              PILE_PTX or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.


                CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
                -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
                   Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
                   or C files from CUDA code just won&apos;t work, because size_t gets defined by
                   nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
                   file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.




                CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
                -- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
                   file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
                   targets.




                   This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
                   things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
                   When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
                   command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
                   errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
                   source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
                   When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
                   the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
                   is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
                   this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
                   and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.




                CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
                -- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in
                   Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
                   printed during build.




                CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
                -- Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
                   when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.




                CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
                -- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
                   blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
                   Intermediate files will always be placed in
                   CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.




                CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
                -- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.




                CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
                CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
                -- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
                   semi-colon delimited (e.g. --compiler-options;-Wall)




                CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
                -- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
                   dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
                   host compiler through nvcc&apos;s -Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
                   generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
                   certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
                   propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
                   via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
                   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
                   shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.




                CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
                -- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
                   using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
                   VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
                   always print the output.




              The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical order):


                CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
                -- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
                   you are in emulation mode or not.




                CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
                -- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
                   whether you are in emulation mode or not.




                CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                                     [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
                -- Creates an executable &quot;cuda_target&quot; which is made up of the files
                   specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
                   build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
                   files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
                   added automatically to include_directories().  Some standard CMake target
                   calls can be used on the target after calling this macro
                   (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting
                   properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by
                   nvcc.  Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
                   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.




                CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                                  [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
                -- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.




                CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
                -- Creates a convience target that deletes all the dependency files
                   generated.  You should make clean after running this target to ensure the
                   dependency files get regenerated.




                CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                              [OPTIONS ...] )
                -- Returns a list of generated files from the input source files to be used
                   with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.




                CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
                -- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.




                CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
                -- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
                   (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0 -Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
                   files.




                CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                                 [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
                -- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
                   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
                   function under the hood.




                   Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
                   custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use &quot;PTX&quot; or
                   &quot;OBJ&quot; for the format argument to switch).  Files that don&apos;t end with .cu
                   or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.




                   The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
                   give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
                   specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
                   options must preceed configuration specific options.  Not all
                   configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.




                      OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 &quot;-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag&quot;
                      DEBUG -g
                      RELEASE --use_fast_math
                      RELWITHDEBINFO --use_fast_math;-g
                      MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math




                   For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
                   CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
                   be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
                   cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
                   and will link in the resulting object file automatically.




                   This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
                   build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.




                     1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
                     Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
                     checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.




                     2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
                     encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
                     target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
                     now deletes the output files if there was an error.




                     3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
                     make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
                     regenerated when the options change.




                   This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
                   determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
                   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
                   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
                   objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
                   &lt;target_name&gt;_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
                   detected.




                   Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are passed along to nvcc.




              The script defines the following variables:


                CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    -- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.
                CUDA_VERSION_MINOR    -- The minor version.
                CUDA_VERSION
                CUDA_VERSION_STRING   -- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR




                CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).
                CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR     -- Path to the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the
                                         SDK.  This script will not directly support finding
                                         specific libraries or headers, as that isn&apos;t
                                         supported by NVIDIA.  If you want to change
                                         libraries when the path changes see the
                                         FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear
                                         these variables.  There are also examples of how to
                                         use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or
                                         libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).
                CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS     -- Include directory for cuda headers.  Added automatically
                                         for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.

              INPUT Variables


                 CXXTEST_USE_PYTHON [deprecated since 1.3]
                     Only used in the case both Python &amp; Perl
                     are detected on the system to control

                     NOTE: In older versions of this Find Module,
                     this variable controlled if the Python test
                     generator was used instead of the Perl one,
                     regardless of which scripting language the
                     user had installed.

                                                 this runner

                     #==============
                     Example Usage:




                         find_package(CxxTest)
                         if(CXXTEST_FOUND)
                             include_directories(${CXXTEST_INCLUDE_DIR})

                                               ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/foo_test.h)
                             target_link_libraries(unittest_foo foo) # as needed
                         endif()




                            This will (if CxxTest is found):
                            1. Invoke the testgen executable to autogenerate foo_test.cc in the
                               binary tree from &quot;foo_test.h&quot; in the current source directory.
                            2. Create an executable and test called unittest_foo.

                    #=============
                    Example foo_test.h:




                        #include &lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;

                        class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite
                        {
                        public:

                           {
                              TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 &gt; 1 );
                              TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1 + 1, 2 );
                           }

              nil.sourceforge.net/


              This module sets:


                 IL_LIBRARIES -   the name of the IL library. These include the full path to
                                  the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the
                                  application.
                 ILU_LIBRARIES -  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
                                  library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
                                  doesn&apos;t have to be linked if the functionality it provides
                                  is not used.
                 ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
                                  library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
                                  in applications.
                 IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
                 IL_FOUND -       this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
                                  This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
                                  even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one
                                  library is found all the others are as well. That&apos;s the
                                  way the DevIL developers release it.


       FindDoxygen
              This module looks for Doxygen and the path to Graphviz&apos;s dot

              Doxygen  is  a  documentation   generation   tool.    Please   see
              http://www.doxygen.org


              This module accepts the following optional variables:


                 DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT       = If true this module will skip trying to find Dot
                                          (an optional component often used by Doxygen)




              This modules defines the following variables:


                 DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE     = The path to the doxygen command.
                 DOXYGEN_FOUND          = Was Doxygen found or not?
                 DOXYGEN_VERSION        = The version reported by doxygen --version




                 DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program used by doxygen.
                 DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND      = Was Dot found or not?
                 DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH       = The path to dot not including the executable








       FindEXPAT
              Find expat

              Find the native EXPAT headers and libraries.


                EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIRS - where to find expat.h, etc.
                EXPAT_LIBRARIES    - List of libraries when using expat.
                EXPAT_FOUND        - True if expat found.


       FindFLEX
              Find flex executable and provides a macro to generate custom build
              rules




              The module defines the following variables:


                FLEX_FOUND - true is flex executable is found
                FLEX_EXECUTABLE - the path to the flex executable
                FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex
                FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex libraries
                FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex headers




              The minimum required version of flex can be  specified  using  the
              standard syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(FLEX 2.5.13)





              If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:


                FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput [COMPILE_FLAGS &lt;string&gt;])

              which  creates a custom command  to generate the &lt;FlexOutput&gt; file
              from the &lt;FlexInput&gt; file.  If  COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified,
              the  next parameter is added to the flex  command line. Name is an
              alias used to get  details of  this custom  command.   Indeed  the
              macro defines  the following variables:


                FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully
                FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file generated by the custom rule, an
                alias for FlexOutput
                FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}




              Flex  scanners oftenly use tokens  defined by Bison: the code gen&#8208;
              erated by Flex  depends of the header  generated by Bison.    This
              module also defines a macro:


                ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)

              which   adds  the   required dependency  between a  scanner and  a
              parser where  &lt;FlexTarget&gt;  and  &lt;BisonTarget&gt;   are   the   first
              parameters  of respectively FLEX_TARGET and BISON_TARGET macros.


                ====================================================================
                Example:




                 find_package(BISON)
                 find_package(FLEX)




                 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
                 FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
                 ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)




                 include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
                 add_executable(Foo
                    Foo.cc
                    ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
                    ${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS}
                 )
                ====================================================================


       FindFLTK
              Find the native FLTK includes and library




              By  default  FindFLTK.cmake will search for all of the FLTK compo&#8208;
              nents and add them to the FLTK_LIBRARIES variable.


                 You can limit the components which get placed in FLTK_LIBRARIES by

                    include_directories(${GTK2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
                    add_executable(mygui mygui.cc)
                    target_link_libraries(mygui ${GTK2_LIBRARIES})
                 endif()





       FindGTest
              --------------------

              Locate the Google C++ Testing Framework.


              Defines the following variables:


                 GTEST_FOUND - Found the Google Testing framework
                 GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories




              Also defines the library  variables  below  as  normal  variables.
              These contain debug/optimized keywords when a debugging library is
              found.


                 GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES - Both libgtest &amp; libgtest-main
                 GTEST_LIBRARIES - libgtest
                 GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARIES - libgtest-main




              Accepts the following variables as input:


                 GTEST_ROOT - (as a CMake or environment variable)
                              The root directory of the gtest install prefix
&#12;

                 GTEST_MSVC_SEARCH - If compiling with MSVC, this variable can be set to
                                     &quot;MD&quot; or &quot;MT&quot; to enable searching a GTest build tree
                                     (defaults: &quot;MD&quot;)




              Example Usage:


                  enable_testing()
                  find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
                  include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})




                  add_executable(foo foo.cc)
                  target_link_libraries(foo ${GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES})




                  add_test(AllTestsInFoo foo)







              If you would like each Google test to show up in CTest as  a  test
              you  may  use  the  following  macro. NOTE: It will slow down your
              tests by running an executable for each  test  and  test  fixture.
              You  will  also have to rerun CMake after adding or removing tests
              or test fixtures.


              GTEST_ADD_TESTS(executable extra_args ARGN)


                  executable = The path to the test executable
                  extra_args = Pass a list of extra arguments to be passed to
                               executable enclosed in quotes (or &quot;&quot; for none)
                  ARGN =       A list of source files to search for tests &amp; test
                               fixtures.




                Example:
                   set(FooTestArgs --foo 1 --bar 2)
                   add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cc)
                   GTEST_ADD_TESTS(FooTest &quot;${FooTestArgs}&quot; FooUnitTest.cc)


       FindGettext
              Find GNU gettext tools

              This module looks for the GNU gettext tools. This  module  defines
              the following values:


                GETTEXT_MSGMERGE_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the msgmerge tool.
                GETTEXT_MSGFMT_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the msgfmt tool.
                GETTEXT_FOUND: True if gettext has been found.
                GETTEXT_VERSION_STRING: the version of gettext found (since CMake 2.8.8)




              Additionally   it  provides  the  following  macros:  GETTEXT_CRE&#8208;
              ATE_TRANSLATIONS ( outputFile [ALL] file1 ... fileN )


                  This will create a target &quot;translations&quot; which will convert the
                  given input po files into the binary output mo file. If the
                  ALL option is used, the translations will also be created when
                  building the default target.

              GETTEXT_PROCESS_POT( &lt;potfile&gt; [ALL]  [INSTALL_DESTINATION  &lt;dest&#8208;
              dir&gt;] LANGUAGES &lt;lang1&gt; &lt;lang2&gt; ... )
&#12;
                   Process the given pot file to mo files.
                   If INSTALL_DESTINATION is given then automatically install rules will be created,
                   the language subdirectory will be taken into account (by default use share/locale/).
                   If ALL is specified, the pot file is processed when building the all traget.
                   It creates a custom target &quot;potfile&quot;.

              GETTEXT_PROCESS_PO_FILES( &lt;lang&gt; [ALL] [INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
              PO_FILES &lt;po1&gt; &lt;po2&gt; ... )


                   Process the given po files to mo files for the given language.
                   If INSTALL_DESTINATION is given then automatically install rules will be created,
                   the language subdirectory will be taken into account (by default use share/locale/).
                   If ALL is specified, the po files are processed when building the all traget.
                   It creates a custom target &quot;pofiles&quot;.


       FindGit


              The module defines the following variables:


                 GIT_EXECUTABLE - path to git command line client
                 GIT_FOUND - true if the command line client was found
                 GIT_VERSION_STRING - the version of git found (since CMake 2.8.8)

              Example usage:


                 find_package(Git)
                 if(GIT_FOUND)
                   message(&quot;git found: ${GIT_EXECUTABLE}&quot;)
                 endif()


       FindGnuTLS
              Try to find the GNU Transport Layer Security library (gnutls)




              Once done this will define


                GNUTLS_FOUND - System has gnutls
                GNUTLS_INCLUDE_DIR - The gnutls include directory
                GNUTLS_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use gnutls
                GNUTLS_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using gnutls


       FindGnuplot
              this module looks for gnuplot




              Once done this will define


                GNUPLOT_FOUND - system has Gnuplot
                GNUPLOT_EXECUTABLE - the Gnuplot executable
                GNUPLOT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Gnuplot found (since CMake 2.8.8)




              GNUPLOT_VERSION_STRING will not work for old versions like 3.7.1.


       FindHDF5
              Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing self describing array
              data.




              This  module  invokes  the  HDF5  wrapper  compiler that should be
              installed alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5  Configuration,
              the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this suc&#8208;
              ceeds, the module will then call the compiler with the -show argu&#8208;
              ment  to  see  what  flags  are used when compiling an HDF5 client
              application.
&#12;
              The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If  no
              COMPONENTS  are  specified,  then  the find module will default to
              finding only the HDF5 C library.  If one or  more  COMPONENTS  are
              specified,  the  module will attempt to find the language bindings
              for the specified components.  The only valid  components  are  C,
              CXX,  Fortran,  HL, and Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS argument is
              not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.


              On  UNIX   systems,   this   module   will   read   the   variable
              HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES  to determine whether or not to prefer a
              static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of  it&apos;s  dependen&#8208;
              cies.     To    use    this    feature,   make   sure   that   the
              HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable  is  set  before  the  call  to
              find_package.


              To  provide  the  module with a hint about where to find your HDF5
              installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The
              Find  module  will  then look in this path when searching for HDF5
              executables, paths, and libraries.


              In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to com&#8208;
              pile  an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort
              to find tools that come with the HDF5  distribution  that  may  be
              useful for regression testing.


              This module will define the following variables:


                HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS - Location of the hdf5 includes
                HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR - Location of the hdf5 includes (deprecated)
                HDF5_DEFINITIONS - Required compiler definitions for HDF5
                HDF5_C_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 C bindings.
                HDF5_CXX_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 C++ bindings
                HDF5_Fortran_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 Fortran bindings
                HDF5_HL_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the HDF5 high level API
                HDF5_Fortran_HL_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for the high level Fortran
                                            bindings.
                HDF5_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for all requested bindings
                HDF5_FOUND - true if HDF5 was found on the system
                HDF5_LIBRARY_DIRS - the full set of library directories
                HDF5_IS_PARALLEL - Whether or not HDF5 was found with parallel IO support
                HDF5_C_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 C wrapper compiler
                HDF5_CXX_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 C++ wrapper compiler
                HDF5_Fortran_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 Fortran wrapper compiler
                HDF5_DIFF_EXECUTABLE - the path to the HDF5 dataset comparison tool


       FindHSPELL
              Try to find Hspell

              Once done this will define


                HSPELL_FOUND - system has Hspell
                HSPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the Hspell include directory
                HSPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use Hspell
                HSPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using Hspell




                HSPELL_VERSION_STRING - The version of Hspell found (x.y)
                HSPELL_MAJOR_VERSION  - the major version of Hspell
                HSPELL_MINOR_VERSION  - The minor version of Hspell


       FindHTMLHelp
              This module looks for Microsoft HTML Help Compiler

              It defines:


                 HTML_HELP_COMPILER     : full path to the Compiler (hhc.exe)
                 HTML_HELP_INCLUDE_PATH : include path to the API (htmlhelp.h)
                 HTML_HELP_LIBRARY      : full path to the library (htmlhelp.lib)
&#12;       FindITK
              Find an ITK installation or build tree.


       FindImageMagick
              Find the ImageMagick binary suite.

              This  module  will search for a set of ImageMagick tools specified
              as  components  in  the  FIND_PACKAGE  call.  Typical   components
              include,  but  are  not limited to (future versions of ImageMagick
              might have additional components not listed here):


                animate
                compare
                composite
                conjure
                convert
                display
                identify
                import
                mogrify
                montage
                stream




              If no component is specified in the  FIND_PACKAGE  call,  then  it
              only  searches for the ImageMagick executable directory. This code
              defines the following variables:


                ImageMagick_FOUND                  - TRUE if all components are found.
                ImageMagick_EXECUTABLE_DIR         - Full path to executables directory.
                ImageMagick_&lt;component&gt;_FOUND      - TRUE if &lt;component&gt; is found.
                ImageMagick_&lt;component&gt;_EXECUTABLE - Full path to &lt;component&gt; executable.
                ImageMagick_VERSION_STRING         - the version of ImageMagick found
                                                     (since CMake 2.8.8)




              ImageMagick_VERSION_STRING will not work  for  old  versions  like
              5.2.3.


              There are also components for the following ImageMagick APIs:


                Magick++
                MagickWand
                MagickCore




              For these components the following variables are set:


                ImageMagick_FOUND                    - TRUE if all components are found.
                ImageMagick_INCLUDE_DIRS             - Full paths to all include dirs.
                ImageMagick_LIBRARIES                - Full paths to all libraries.
                ImageMagick_&lt;component&gt;_FOUND        - TRUE if &lt;component&gt; is found.

                FIND_PACKAGE(ImageMagick COMPONENTS convert mogrify display)
                FIND_PACKAGE(ImageMagick COMPONENTS Magick++)
                FIND_PACKAGE(ImageMagick COMPONENTS Magick++ convert)




              Note  that the standard FIND_PACKAGE features are supported (i.e.,
              QUIET, REQUIRED, etc.).
&#12;
       FindJNI
              Find JNI java libraries.

              This module finds if Java is installed and  determines  where  the
              include  files and libraries are. It also determines what the name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:



                JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS      = the include dirs to use

       FindJava
              Find Java

              This module finds if Java is installed and  determines  where  the
              include  files  and  libraries  are.  This code sets the following
              variables:

              The minimum required version of Java can be  specified  using  the
              standard CMake syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(Java 1.5)


              NOTE:  ${Java_VERSION}  and ${Java_VERSION_STRING} are not guaran&#8208;
              teed to be identical. For example some java  version  may  return:
              Java_VERSION_STRING = 1.5.0_17 and Java_VERSION        = 1.5.0.17


              another  example  is  the  Java  OEM,  with: Java_VERSION_STRING =

              It also adds the following macros (from KDE3Macros.cmake) SRCS_VAR
              is always the variable which contains the list of source files for
              your application or library.


              KDE3_AUTOMOC(file1 ... fileN)


                  Call this if you want to have automatic moc file handling.
                  This means if you include &quot;foo.moc&quot; in the source file foo.cpp
                  a moc file for the header foo.h will be created automatically.
                  You can set the property SKIP_AUTOMAKE using SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES()
                  to exclude some files in the list from being processed.




              KDE3_ADD_MOC_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1 ... fileN )


                  If you don&apos;t use the KDE3_AUTOMOC() macro, for the files
                  listed here moc files will be created (named &quot;foo.moc.cpp&quot;)




              KDE3_ADD_DCOP_SKELS(SRCS_VAR header1.h ... headerN.h )


                  Use this to generate DCOP skeletions from the listed headers.




              KDE3_ADD_DCOP_STUBS(SRCS_VAR header1.h ... headerN.h )


                   Use this to generate DCOP stubs from the listed headers.




              KDE3_ADD_UI_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1.ui ... fileN.ui )


                  Use this to add the Qt designer ui files to your application/library.




              KDE3_ADD_KCFG_FILES(SRCS_VAR file1.kcfgc ... fileN.kcfgc )


                  Use this to add KDE kconfig compiler files to your application/library.




              KDE3_INSTALL_LIBTOOL_FILE(target)


                  This will create and install a simple libtool file for the given target.




              KDE3_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name file1 ... fileN )


                  Currently identical to ADD_EXECUTABLE(), may provide some advanced features in the future.




              KDE3_ADD_KPART(name [WITH_PREFIX] file1 ... fileN )


                  Create a KDE plugin (KPart, kioslave, etc.) from the given source files.
                  If WITH_PREFIX is given, the resulting plugin will have the prefix &quot;lib&quot;, otherwise it won&apos;t.
                  It creates and installs an appropriate libtool la-file.




              KDE3_ADD_KDEINIT_EXECUTABLE(name file1 ... fileN )


                  Create a KDE application in the form of a module loadable via kdeinit.
                  A library named kdeinit_&lt;name&gt; will be created and a small executable which links to it.




              The  option  KDE3_ENABLE_FINAL to enable all-in-one compilation is
              no longer supported.

                  link against to use LAPACK95
                LAPACK95_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the LAPACK f95
                  interface is found
                BLA_STATIC  if set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
                BLA_VENDOR  if set checks only the specified vendor, if not set checks
                   all the possibilities

       FindLua50


              Locate Lua library This module defines


                LUA50_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Lua
                LUA_LIBRARIES, both lua and lualib
                LUA_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find lua.h and lualib.h (and probably lauxlib.h)

              and not


                #include &lt;lua/lua.h&gt;

              This is because, the lua location  is  not  standardized  and  may
              exist in locations other than lua/

                #include &lt;lua/lua.h&gt;

              This  is  because,  the  lua  location is not standardized and may
              exist in locations other than lua/

       FindMPI
              Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation

              The  Message  Passing  Interface  (MPI) is a library used to write
              high-performance distributed-memory parallel applications, and  is
              typically  deployed  on  a  cluster.  MPI  is a standard interface
              (defined by the MPI forum)  for  which  many  implementations  are
              available.  All  of  them  have  somewhat different include paths,
              libraries to link against, etc., and this module tries  to  smooth
              out those differences.


              === Variables ===


              This  module will set the following variables per language in your
              project, where &lt;lang&gt; is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:


                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND           TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags for &lt;lang&gt;
                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER        MPI Compiler wrapper for &lt;lang&gt;
                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS   Compilation flags for MPI programs
                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH    Include path(s) for MPI header
                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_FLAGS      Linking flags for MPI programs
                 MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES       All libraries to link MPI programs against

              Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for running MPI
              programs from the command line:


                 MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
                 MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
                                            it the number of processors to run on
                 MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly
                                            before the executable to run.
                 MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other flags

              === Usage ===


              To  use  this  module,  simply  call FindMPI from a CMakeLists.txt
              file, or run find_package(MPI), then run CMake.  If you are  happy
              with  the  auto-  detected  configuration  for your language, then
              you&apos;re done.  If not, you have two options:


                 1. Set MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper (mpicc, etc.) of your
                    choice and reconfigure.  FindMPI will attempt to determine all the
                    necessary variables using THAT compiler&apos;s compile and link flags.
                 2. If this fails, or if your MPI implementation does not come with
                    a compiler wrapper, then set both MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES and
                    MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH.  You may also set any other variables
                    listed above, but these two are required.  This will circumvent
                    autodetection entirely.

              When configuration is successful, MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER will be  set
              to   the   compiler   wrapper   for   &lt;lang&gt;,  if  it  was  found.
              MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND and other variables above will be set if any  MPI
              implementation  was found for &lt;lang&gt;, regardless of whether a com&#8208;
              piler was found.


              When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you  should  typi&#8208;
              cally use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:


                 ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
                   ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS

              where  PROCS  is  the number of processors on which to execute the
              program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments
              to pass to the MPI program.


              === Backward Compatibility ===


              For  backward  compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these
              variables are set, but deprecated:


                 MPI_FOUND           MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY
                 MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH    MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
                 MPI_LINK_FLAGS      MPI_LIBRARIES

              In new projects, please use the MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_XXX equivalents.

              will  have  to  change the cache values of OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY  and
              OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with X11 on OSX


       FindOpenMP
              Finds OpenMP support

              This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler. If
              the  compiler  supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with
              openmp support are set.


              The following variables are set:


                 OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for OpenMP support
                 OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX compiler for OpenMP support
                 OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is detected




              Supported       compilers       can       be       found        at
              http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/

       FindOpenSceneGraph
              Find OpenSceneGraph

              This  module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core &quot;osg&quot; library as
              well as OpenThreads, and whatever additional COMPONENTS (nodekits)
              that you specify.


                  See http://www.openscenegraph.org




              NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require CMake
              &gt;= 2.6.3 with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION  2.6.3)  or  download
              and  place  FindOpenThreads.cmake,  Findosg_functions.cmake, Find&#8208;
              osg.cmake, and Find&lt;etc&gt;.cmake files into your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.


              ==================================


              This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)


                  OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output




                  OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables as advanced
                                                    automatically




              The following environment variables are also respected for finding
              the  OSG  and it&apos;s various components.  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also
              be used for this (see find_library() CMake documentation).


                  &lt;MODULE&gt;_DIR (where MODULE is of the form &quot;OSGVOLUME&quot; and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake file)
                  OSG_DIR
                  OSGDIR
                  OSG_ROOT




              This module defines the following output variables:


                  OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?




                  OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which was found




                  OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers




                  OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries




              ================================== Example Usage:


                find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB osgUtil)
                    # libOpenThreads &amp; libosg automatically searched
                include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})




                add_executable(foo foo.cc)
                target_link_libraries(foo ${OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES})





       FindOpenThreads


              OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its largest userbase
              seems  to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
              environment path. I consider this part of the Findosg* suite  used
              to find OpenSceneGraph  components. Each component is separate and
              you must opt in to each module.


              Locate  OpenThreads  This   module   defines   OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY
              OPENTHREADS_FOUND,  if  false,  do  not try to link to OpenThreads
              OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


              $OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would  correspond
              to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

       FindPHP4
              Find PHP4

              This  module  finds  if PHP4 is installed and determines where the
              include files and libraries are. It also determines what the  name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where php.h can be found
                PHP4_EXECUTABLE         = full path to the php4 binary





       FindPNG
              Find the native PNG includes and library




              This  module  searches  libpng,  the  library for working with PNG
              images.


              It defines the following variables


                PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find png.h, etc.
                PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
                PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should add_definitons(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.
                PNG_FOUND, If false, do not try to use PNG.
                PNG_VERSION_STRING - the version of the PNG library found (since CMake 2.8.8)

              Also defined, but not for general use are


                PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.

              For backward compatiblity the  variable  PNG_INCLUDE_DIR  is  also
              set. It has the same value as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS.


              Since  PNG  depends  on  the ZLib compression library, none of the
              above will be defined unless ZLib can be found.


       FindPackageHandleStandardArgs


              FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; ... )


              This function is intended to  be  used  in  FindXXX.cmake  modules
              files.  It  handles  the REQUIRED, QUIET and version-related argu&#8208;
              ments to FIND_PACKAGE(). It also sets the  &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND
              variable.  The  package  is  considered  found  if  all  variables
              &lt;var1&gt;... listed contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.


              There are two modes of this function. The first argument  in  both
              modes is the name of the Find-module where it is called (in origi&#8208;
              nal casing).


              The first simple mode looks like this:


                  FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; (DEFAULT_MSG|&quot;Custom failure message&quot;) &lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt; )

              If the variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt;  are  all  valid,  then  &lt;UPPER&#8208;
              CASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND  will be set to TRUE. If DEFAULT_MSG is given as
              second argument, then the function  will  generate  itself  useful
              success  and  error  messages.  You can also supply a custom error
              message for the failure case. This is not recommended.


              The second mode is more powerful and also supports version  check&#8208;
              ing:


                  FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [REQUIRED_VARS &lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt;]
                                                         [VERSION_VAR   &lt;versionvar&gt;]
                                                         [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
                                                         [CONFIG_MODE]
                                                         [FAIL_MESSAGE &quot;Custom failure message&quot;] )




              As  above,  if  &lt;var1&gt;  through  &lt;varN&gt;  are  all  valid,  &lt;UPPER&#8208;
              CASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND will be set to  TRUE.  After  REQUIRED_VARS  the
              variables  which are required for this package are listed. Follow&#8208;
              ing VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can  be  specified  which
              holds  the version of the package which has been found. If this is
              done, this version will be checked against the (potentially) spec&#8208;
              ified  required version used in the find_package() call. The EXACT
              keyword is also handled. The default messages include  information
              about the required version and the version which has been actually
              found, both if the version is ok or not. If the  package  supports
              components,  use  the  HANDLE_COMPONENTS option to enable handling
              them.  In  this  case,  find_package_handle_standard_args()   will
              report which components have been found and which are missing, and
              the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variable will be set  to  FALSE  if  any  of  the
              required  components (i.e. not the ones listed after OPTIONAL_COM&#8208;
              PONENTS) are missing. Use the option  CONFIG_MODE  if  your  Find&#8208;
              XXX.cmake  module  is  a wrapper for a find_package(... NO_MODULE)
              call.  In this case VERSION_VAR will be set to &lt;NAME&gt;_VERSION  and
              the  macro  will automatically check whether the Config module was
              found. Via FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified,
              if this is not used, the default message will be displayed.


              Example for mode 1:


                  FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(LibXml2  DEFAULT_MSG  LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)




              LibXml2  is  considered  to  be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARY and
              LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is  set  to
              TRUE.  If  it  is  not  found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with
              FATAL_ERROR, independent whether QUIET was used or not. If  it  is
              found,  success will be reported, including the content of &lt;var1&gt;.
              On repeated Cmake runs, the same message won&apos;t be printed again.


              Example for mode 2:


                  FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(BISON  REQUIRED_VARS BISON_EXECUTABLE
                                                           VERSION_VAR BISON_VERSION)

              In this case, BISON is considered to be found if  the  variable(s)
              listed  after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e. BISON_EXECUTABLE in
              this case. Also the version of BISON will be checked by using  the
              version  contained  in  BISON_VERSION.  Since  no  FAIL_MESSAGE is
              given, the default messages will be printed.
&#12;              Another example for mode 2:


                  FIND_PACKAGE(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
                  FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)

              In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to FIND_PACKAGE(Auto&#8208;
              moc4  NO_MODULE) and adds an additional search directory for auto&#8208;
              moc4. The following FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call  pro&#8208;
              duces a proper success/error message.


       FindPackageMessage


              FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(&lt;name&gt;   &quot;message   for  user&quot;  &quot;find  result
              details&quot;)


              This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules  files.
              It  will print a message once for each unique find result. This is
              useful for telling the user where a package was found.  The  first
              argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package. The second argu&#8208;
              ment specifies the message to display. The  third  argument  lists
              details  about  the find result so that if they change the message
              will be displayed again. The macro also obeys the  QUIET  argument
              to the find_package command.


              Example:


                IF(X11_FOUND)
                  FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 &quot;Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}&quot;
                    &quot;[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]&quot;)
                ELSE(X11_FOUND)
                 ...
                ENDIF(X11_FOUND)


       FindPerl
              Find perl

              this module looks for Perl


                PERL_EXECUTABLE     - the full path to perl
                PERL_FOUND          - If false, don&apos;t attempt to use perl.
                PERL_VERSION_STRING - version of perl found (since CMake 2.8.8)


       FindPerlLibs
              Find Perl libraries

              This  module  finds  if PERL is installed and determines where the
              include files and libraries are. It also determines what the  name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                PERLLIBS_FOUND    = True if perl.h &amp; libperl were found
                PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h is found
                PERL_LIBRARY      = path to libperl
                PERL_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the perl binary




              The  minimum  required  version of Perl can be specified using the
              standard syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(PerlLibs 6.0)


                The following variables are also available if needed
                (introduced after CMake 2.6.4)




                PERL_SITESEARCH    = path to the sitesearch install dir
                PERL_SITELIB       = path to the sitelib install directory
                PERL_VENDORARCH    = path to the vendor arch install directory
                PERL_VENDORLIB     = path to the vendor lib install directory
                PERL_ARCHLIB       = path to the arch lib install directory
                PERL_PRIVLIB       = path to the priv lib install directory
                PERL_EXTRA_C_FLAGS = Compilation flags used to build perl
&#12;



       FindPhysFS


              Locate PhysFS library This module defines PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name
              of  the library to link against PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try
              to link to PHYSFS PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find physfs.h


              $PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
              ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR used in building PHYSFS.

       FindPike
              Find Pike

              This  module  finds  if PIKE is installed and determines where the
              include files and libraries are. It also determines what the  name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where program.h is found
                PIKE_EXECUTABLE         = full path to the pike binary





       FindPkgConfig
              a pkg-config module for CMake




              Usage:


                 pkg_check_modules(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET] &lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*)
                   checks for all the given modules




                 pkg_search_module(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET] &lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*)
                   checks for given modules and uses the first working one




              When  the  &apos;REQUIRED&apos;  argument  was set, macros will fail with an
              error when module(s) could not be found


              When the &apos;QUIET&apos; argument is  set,  no  status  messages  will  be
              printed.


              It sets the following variables:


                 PKG_CONFIG_FOUND          ... if pkg-config executable was found
                 PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE     ... pathname of the pkg-config program
                 PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING ... the version of the pkg-config program found
                                               (since CMake 2.8.8)




              For the following variables two sets of values exist; first one is
              the common one and has the given PREFIX. The second  set  contains
              flags  which  are  given  out  when  pkgconfig was called with the
              &apos;--static&apos; option.


                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_FOUND          ... set to 1 if module(s) exist
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARIES      ... only the libraries (w/o the &apos;-l&apos;)
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS   ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the &apos;-L&apos;)
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS        ... all required linker flags
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS_OTHER  ... all other linker flags
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS   ... the &apos;-I&apos; preprocessor flags (w/o the &apos;-I&apos;)
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS         ... all required cflags
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER   ... the other compiler flags




                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;        for common case
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC for static linking




              There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the count
              of  given  modules.  When there is only one module, &lt;PREFIX&gt; stays
              unchanged. When there are multiple modules,  the  prefix  will  be
              changed to &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;:


                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_VERSION    ... version of the module
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_PREFIX     ... prefix-directory of the module
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBDIR     ... lib-dir of the module




                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;  when |MODULES| == 1, else
                 &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;




              A &lt;MODULE&gt; parameter can have the following formats:


                 {MODNAME}            ... matches any version
                 {MODNAME}&gt;={VERSION} ... at least version &lt;VERSION&gt; is required
                 {MODNAME}={VERSION}  ... exactly version &lt;VERSION&gt; is required
                 {MODNAME}&lt;={VERSION} ... modules must not be newer than &lt;VERSION&gt;




              Examples


                 pkg_check_modules (GLIB2   glib-2.0)




                 pkg_check_modules (GLIB2   glib-2.0&gt;=2.10)
                   requires at least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.
                     GLIB2_VERSION=2.10.3




                 pkg_check_modules (FOO     glib-2.0&gt;=2.10 gtk+-2.0)
                   requires both glib2 and gtk2, and defines e.g.
                     FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION=2.10.3
                     FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION=2.8.20




                 pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender)
                   defines e.g.:
                     XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
                     XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp




                 pkg_search_module (BAR     libxml-2.0 libxml2 libxml&gt;=2)


       FindPostgreSQL
              Find the PostgreSQL installation.

              In  Windows,  we make the assumption that, if the PostgreSQL files
              are  installed,  the  default   directory   will   be   C:\Program
              Files\PostgreSQL.
&#12;
              This module defines


                PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES - the PostgreSQL libraries needed for linking
                PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directories of the PostgreSQL headers
                PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING - the version of PostgreSQL found (since CMake 2.8.8)


       FindProducer


              Though Producer isn&apos;t directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary
              user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used  to
              find   OpenSceneGraph  components.  You&apos;ll  notice  that  I accept
              OSGDIR as an environment path.


              Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You
              must   also  opt  into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these  modules
              won&apos;t do it for you. This is to allow you control  over  your  own
              system  piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain com&#8208;
              ponents or change the Find behavior for a particular module  (per&#8208;
              haps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn&apos;t work with
              your system as an example). If you want to use a  more  convenient
              module  that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake
              instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.


              Locate  Producer  This  module   defines   PRODUCER_LIBRARY   PRO&#8208;
              DUCER_FOUND,  if  false,  do  not  try  to  link  to Producer PRO&#8208;
              DUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


              $PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond  to
              the ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

       FindPythonInterp
              Find python interpreter

              This module finds if Python interpreter is  installed  and  deter&#8208;
              mines  where  the  executables  are.  This code sets the following
              variables:


                PYTHONINTERP_FOUND         - Was the Python executable found
                PYTHON_EXECUTABLE          - path to the Python interpreter
&#12;                PYTHON_VERSION_STRING      - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
                PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR       - Python major version found e.g. 2
                PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR       - Python minor version found e.g. 5
                PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH       - Python patch version found e.g. 2




              The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to  specify  a
              list  of  version  numbers  that should be taken into account when
              searching for Python. You need to set this variable before calling
              find_package(PythonInterp).


       FindPythonLibs
              Find python libraries

              This  module finds if Python is installed and determines where the
              include files and libraries are. It also determines what the  name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                PYTHONLIBS_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
                PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
                PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH        - path to where Python.h is found (deprecated)
                PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
                PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES     - path to the debug library (deprecated)
                PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING  - version of the Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)




              The  Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  variable can be used to specify a
              list of version numbers that should be  taken  into  account  when
              searching for Python. You need to set this variable before calling
              find_package(PythonLibs).


              If you&apos;d like to specify the installation of Python  to  use,  you
              should modify the following cache variables:


                PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
                PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found


       FindQt Searches for all installed versions of QT.

              This  should  only  be used if your project can work with multiple
              versions of QT.  If not, you should just directly use  FindQt4  or
              FindQt3. If multiple versions of QT are found on the machine, then
              The user must set the option  DESIRED_QT_VERSION  to  the  version
              they  want  to  use.   If  only  one version of qt is found on the
              machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to  that  version  and
              the  matching FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user
              sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3  or  FindQt4  module  is
              included.


                QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
                            not find QT4 or QT3 an error is raised
                            and a message is sent to the user.




                DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
                QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
                QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.


       FindQt3
              Locate Qt include paths and libraries

              This module defines:


                QT_INCLUDE_DIR    - where to find qt.h, etc.
                QT_LIBRARIES      - the libraries to link against to use Qt.
                QT_DEFINITIONS    - definitions to use when
                                    compiling code that uses Qt.
                QT_FOUND          - If false, don&apos;t try to use Qt.
                QT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Qt found
&#12;

              If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to
              TRUE


              Also defined, but not for general use are:


                QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
                QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
                QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
                QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
                 library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.


       FindQt4
              Find QT 4

              This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important  issue  is
              that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is
              then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines
              a number of key variables and macros.  The variable QT_USE_FILE is
              set which is the path to a CMake file that  can  be  included   to
              compile  Qt 4 applications and libraries.  It sets up the compila&#8208;
              tion environment for include directories, preprocessor defines and
              populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.


              Typical usage could be something like:


                 find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtCore QtGui QtXml)
                 include(${QT_USE_FILE})
                 add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
                 target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})




              The  minimum  required version can be specified using the standard
              find_package()-syntax (see example above).  For compatibility with
              older  versions  of  FindQt4.cmake  it is also possible to set the
              variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the minimum  required  version  of  Qt4
              before the  find_package(Qt4) command.  If both are used, the ver&#8208;
              sion used in the find_package() command  overrides  the  one  from
              QT_MIN_VERSION.


              When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables are auto&#8208;
              matically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up.  If  one  wishes  to
              manually set them, the available ones to set include:


                                  QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE
                                  QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI
                                  QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
                                  QT_USE_QTASSISTANT
                                  QT_USE_QAXCONTAINER
                                  QT_USE_QAXSERVER
                                  QT_USE_QTDESIGNER
                                  QT_USE_QTMOTIF
                                  QT_USE_QTMAIN
                                  QT_USE_QTMULTIMEDIA
                                  QT_USE_QTNETWORK
                                  QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN
                                  QT_USE_QTOPENGL
                                  QT_USE_QTSQL
                                  QT_USE_QTXML
                                  QT_USE_QTSVG
                                  QT_USE_QTTEST
                                  QT_USE_QTUITOOLS
                                  QT_USE_QTDBUS
                                  QT_USE_QTSCRIPT
                                  QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT
                                  QT_USE_QTHELP
                                  QT_USE_QTWEBKIT
                                  QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS
                                  QT_USE_PHONON
                                  QT_USE_QTSCRIPTTOOLS
                                  QT_USE_QTDECLARATIVE
&#12;                QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS
                      If this variable is set to TRUE, FindQt4.cmake will create imported
                      library targets for the various Qt libraries and set the
                      library variables like QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported
                      targets instead of the library file on disk. This provides much better
                      handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt libraries and is
                     also always backwards compatible, except for the case that dependencies
                     of libraries are exported, these will then also list the names of the
                     imported targets as dependency and not the file location on disk. This
                     is much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is executed before
                     such an exported dependency file is processed.




              There  are  also  some files that need processing by some Qt tools
              such as moc and uic.  Listed below are macros that may be used  to
              process those files.



                macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
                      create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
                      the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-direcotry preprocessor definitions
                      are also added.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found
                      when executing &quot;moc -help&quot;.




                macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
                      create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
                      Options may be given to uic, such as those found
                      when executing &quot;uic -help&quot;




                macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
                      create code from a list of Qt resource files.
                      Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
                      when executing &quot;rcc -help&quot;




                macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )
                      creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
                      Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn&apos;t appropriate, e.g.
                      because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.




                macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )
                      This macro is still experimental.
                      It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
                      So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
                      a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don&apos;t
                      want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
                      #include &quot;foo.moc&quot;
                      in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the
                      scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it finds
                      them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
                      accompanying header file foo.h.
                      If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.




                      You should have a look on the AUTOMOC property for targets to achieve the same results.




                macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)
                      Create a the interface header and implementation files with the
                      given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to
                      the list of sources.




                      You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp call by setting
                      properties on the input file:




                      INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate interface header




                      CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly




                      NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a namespace




                macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
                      Create the interface header and implementation files
                      for all listed interface xml files.
                      The basename will be automatically determined from the name of the xml file.




                      The source file properties described for QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.




                macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname [basename] [classname])
                      create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
                      describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
                      forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
                      parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
                      &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file.
                      If &lt;classname&gt; is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
                      adaptor itself.




                macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
                      generate the xml interface file from the given header.
                      If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
                      interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
                      the suffix .xml appended.
                      Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when executing &quot;qdbuscpp2xml --help&quot;




                macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ... sources ...
                                              ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)
                      out: qm_files
                      in:  directories sources ts_files
                      options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify
                      extensions for a directory scan.
                      generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm
                      (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are
                      created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
                      The qm files are generated in the build tree.
                      Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
                      to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
                      always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
                      they get updated/generated.




                macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )

                      in:  ts_files
                      generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
                      filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
                      must exists and are not updated in any way.

                                    when having platform specific code.




                QT_DEFINITIONS   Definitions to use when compiling code that uses Qt.
                                 You do not need to use this if you include QT_USE_FILE.
                                 The QT_USE_FILE will also define QT_DEBUG and QT_NO_DEBUG
                                 to fit your current build type.  Those are not contained
                                 in QT_DEFINITIONS.

                QT_INCLUDES      List of paths to all include directories of
                                 Qt4 QT_INCLUDE_DIR and QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR are
                                 always in this variable even if NOTFOUND,
                                 all other INCLUDE_DIRS are
                                 only added if they are found.
                                 You do not need to use this if you include QT_USE_FILE.

              The  Qt  toolkit  may contain both debug and release libraries. In
              that case, the following library variables will contain both.  You
              do not need to use these variables if you include QT_USE_FILE, and
              use QT_LIBRARIES.

       FindQuickTime


              Locate QuickTime  This  module  defines  QUICKTIME_LIBRARY  QUICK&#8208;

       FindRTI
              Try to find M&amp;S HLA RTI libraries

              This  module  finds  if  any  HLA RTI is installed and locates the
              standard RTI include files and libraries.


              RTI is a simulation infrastructure standardized by IEEE and  SISO.
              It  has a well defined C++ API that assures that simulation appli&#8208;
              cations are independent on a particular RTI implementation.


                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)




              This code sets the following variables:


                RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file are found
                RTI_LIBRARIES = The libraries to link against to use RTI
                RTI_DEFINITIONS = -DRTI_USES_STD_FSTREAM
                RTI_FOUND = Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found

       FindRuby
              Find Ruby

              This module finds if Ruby is installed and  determines  where  the
              include files and libraries are. Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 are supported.


              The  minimum  required  version of Ruby can be specified using the
              standard syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(Ruby 1.8)


              It also determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
              the following variables:


                RUBY_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the ruby binary
                RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = include dirs to be used when using the ruby library
                RUBY_LIBRARY      = full path to the ruby library
                RUBY_VERSION      = the version of ruby which was found, e.g. &quot;1.8.7&quot;
                RUBY_FOUND        = set to true if ruby ws found successfully




                RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only provided for compatibility reasons, don&apos;t use it


       FindSDL


              Locate  SDL  library  This module defines SDL_LIBRARY, the name of
              the library to link against SDL_FOUND, if false,  do  not  try  to
              link to SDL SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h


              This module responds to the the flag: SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this
              is defined, then no SDL_main  will  be  linked  in  because   only
              applications  need main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are build&#8208;
              ing an application and this module will attempt to locate and  set
              the  the  proper  link  flags  as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY
              variable.


              Don&apos;t forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your  project  for
              the   OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL&#8208;
              main which this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also  for
              OS  X, this  module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on
              your behalf.





              Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your con&#8208;
              figuration  and  no  SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your
              SDL  library   (SDL.dll,  libsdl.so,  SDL.framework,  etc).    Set
              SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP  to  point  to  your  SDL  library, and configure
              again.  Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should
              set  this  value as appropriate. These values are used to generate
              the final SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values  are  unset,
              SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.





              $SDLDIR  is  an  environment variable that would correspond to the
              ./configure  --prefix=$SDLDIR  used  in  building  SDL.  l.e.galup
              9-20-02


              Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated build&#8208;
              ing by using environmental variables and  providing  a  more  con&#8208;
              trolled/consistent  search  behavior.  Added  new modifications to
              recognize OS X frameworks and   additional  Unix  paths  (FreeBSD,
              etc).   Also  corrected  the header search path to follow &quot;proper&quot;
              SDL guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
              platforms.  Added  a  search  for  threads which is needed by some
              platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.


              On OSX, this will prefer the Framework  version  (if  found)  over
              others.  People  will  have to manually change the cache values of
              SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the  CMake  environ&#8208;
              ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.


              Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
              This needed to change because &quot;proper&quot; SDL convention is  #include
              &quot;SDL.h&quot;,  not  &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;.  This  is done for portability reasons
              because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

       FindSWIG
              Find SWIG

              This module finds an installed SWIG.  It sets the following  vari&#8208;
              ables:


                SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found
                SWIG_DIR - the directory where swig is installed
                SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path to the swig executable
                SWIG_VERSION   - the version number of the swig executable
&#12;
              The  minimum  required  version of SWIG can be specified using the
              standard syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(SWIG 1.1)


              All information is collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE so the  ver&#8208;
              sion  to be found can be changed from the command line by means of
              setting SWIG_EXECUTABLE



       FindSelfPackers
              Find upx

              This module looks for some executable packers (i.e. softwares that
              compress  executables or shared libs into on-the-fly self-extract&#8208;
              ing executables or shared libs. Examples:


                UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html


       FindSquish
              -- Typical Use




              This module can be used to find Squish (currently support is aimed
              at version 3).


                SQUISH_FOUND                    If false, don&apos;t try to use Squish




                SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR              The Squish installation directory (containing bin, lib, etc)
                SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE        The squishserver executable
                SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE        The squishrunner executable




                SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND        Was the install directory found?
                SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the server executable found?
                SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the client executable found?




              macro   SQUISH_ADD_TEST(testName   applicationUnderTest  testSuite
              testCase)

       FindSubversion
              Extract information from a subversion working copy

              The module defines the following variables:


                Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line client
                Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line client
                Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client was found
                SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set for compatiblity reasons




              The minimum required version of Subversion can be specified  using
              the standard syntax, e.g. FIND_PACKAGE(Subversion 1.4)


              If  the  command  line  client  executable is found two macros are
              defined:
&#12;                Subversion_WC_INFO(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)
                Subversion_WC_LOG(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)

              Subversion_WC_INFO extracts information of  a  subversion  working
              copy  at  a given location. This macro defines the following vari&#8208;
              ables:


                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_URL - url of the repository (at &lt;dir&gt;)
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_ROOT - root url of the repository
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_REVISION - current revision
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last commit
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of last commit
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV - revision of last commit
                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_INFO - output of command `svn info &lt;dir&gt;&apos;

              Subversion_WC_LOG retrieves the log message of the  base  revision
              of  a  subversion  working  copy  at  a given location. This macro
              defines the variable:


                &lt;var-prefix&gt;_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base revision

              Example usage:


                FIND_PACKAGE(Subversion)
                IF(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
                  Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
                  MESSAGE(&quot;Current revision is ${Project_WC_REVISION}&quot;)
                  Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
                  MESSAGE(&quot;Last changed log is ${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}&quot;)
                ENDIF(SUBVERSION_FOUND)


       FindTCL
              TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

              This module finds if Tcl is installed  and  determines  where  the
              include  files and libraries are. It also determines what the name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
                TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
                TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
                TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
                TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
                TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
                TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
                TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
                TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable




              In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some  issues  for
              people  who  are  not  necessarily  Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some
              variables were moved or removed. Changes  compared  to  CMake  2.4
              are:


                 =&gt; they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
                 =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
                    Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
                    are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
                    specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx).
                    Let&apos;s leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
                    TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
                 =&gt; this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
                    confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
                    tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
                    this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
                    and dig from there.


       FindTIFF
              Find TIFF library

              Find the native TIFF includes and library This module defines


                TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find tiff.h, etc.
                TIFF_LIBRARIES, libraries to link against to use TIFF.
                TIFF_FOUND, If false, do not try to use TIFF.

              also defined, but not for general use are


                TIFF_LIBRARY, where to find the TIFF library.


       FindTclStub
              TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.

              This  module  finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl include
              files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake. How to Use  the  Tcl
              Stubs Library:


                 http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html

              Using Stub Libraries:


                 http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3

              This code sets the following variables:


                TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library
                TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library
                TTK_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to ttk stub library




              In  an  effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
              people who are  not  necessarily  Tcl/Tk  gurus/developpers,  some
              variables  were  moved  or  removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4
              are:

                    TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.


       FindTclsh
              Find tclsh

              This module finds if TCL is installed  and  determines  where  the
              include  files and libraries are. It also determines what the name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found
                TCL_TCLSH = the path to the tclsh executable

              In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first.  Don&apos;t look  for  it
              later to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32 build.


       FindThreads
              This module determines the thread library of the system.

              The following variables are set


                CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT     - the thread library
                CMAKE_USE_SPROC_INIT       - are we using sproc?
                CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
                CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT    - are we using pthreads
                CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT     - are we using hp pthreads

              For systems with multiple thread libraries, caller can set


                CMAKE_THREAD_PREFER_PTHREAD


       FindUnixCommands
              Find unix commands from cygwin

              This module looks for some usual Unix commands.



       FindVTK
              Find a VTK installation or build tree.
&#12;              The  following  variables  are set if VTK is found.  If VTK is not
              found, VTK_FOUND is set to false.


                VTK_FOUND         - Set to true when VTK is found.
                VTK_USE_FILE      - CMake file to use VTK.

                VTK_MINOR_VERSION - The VTK minor version number
                                     (odd non-release).
                VTK_BUILD_VERSION - The VTK patch level
                                     (meaningless for odd minor).
                VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Include directories for VTK
                VTK_LIBRARY_DIRS  - Link directories for VTK libraries
                VTK_KITS          - List of VTK kits, in CAPS
                                    (COMMON,IO,) etc.
                VTK_LANGUAGES     - List of wrapped languages, in CAPS
                                    (TCL, PYHTON,) etc.

              The following cache entries must be set by the user to locate VTK:


                VTK_DIR  - The directory containing VTKConfig.cmake.
                           This is either the root of the build tree,
                           or the lib/vtk directory.  This is the
                           only cache entry.

              The following variables are set  for  backward  compatibility  and
              should not be used in new code:


                USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
                               This is provided for backward
                               compatibility.  Use VTK_USE_FILE
                               instead.





       FindWget
              Find wget

              This  module  looks  for  wget. This module defines the  following
              values:


                WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.
                WGET_FOUND: True if wget has been found.


       FindWish
              Find wish installation

              This module finds if TCL is installed  and  determines  where  the
              include  files and libraries are. It also determines what the name
              of the library is. This code sets the following variables:


                TK_WISH = the path to the wish executable




              if UNIX is defined, then it will look for the cygwin version first


       FindX11
              Find X11 installation

              Try to find X11 on UNIX systems. The following values are defined

       Findosg





              NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new FindOpenScene&#8208;
              Graph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not use this Find module
              directly.


              This  is  part  of  the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
              components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
              module.  You  must  also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Pro&#8208;
              ducer if needed) as these  modules won&apos;t do it for you. This is to
              allow you control over your own  system piece by piece in case you
              need to opt out of certain components or change the Find  behavior
              for  a  particular  module  (perhaps  because  the  default  Find&#8208;
              OpenGL.cmake module doesn&apos;t work with your system as an  example).
              If  you  want to use a more convenient module that includes every&#8208;
              thing, use  the  FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake  instead  of  the  Find&#8208;
              osg*.cmake modules.

              module. You must also opt into OpenGL and  OpenThreads  (and  Pro&#8208;
              ducer  if needed) as these modules won&apos;t do it for you. This is to
              allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case  you
              need  to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior
              for  a  particular  module  (perhaps  because  the  default  Find&#8208;
              OpenGL.cmake  module doesn&apos;t work with your system as an example).
              If you want to use a more convenient module that  includes  every&#8208;
              thing,  use  the  FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake  instead  of  the Find&#8208;
              osg*.cmake modules.

       Findosg_functions





              This CMake file contains two macros to assist with  searching  for
              OSG libraries and nodekits.



       FindwxWidgets
              Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

              This  module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default
              configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular library.  To  specify
              the modules that you will use, you need to name them as components
              to the package:


              FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ...)


              There are two search branches: a windows style and a  unix  style.
              For  windows,  the following variables are searched for and set to
              defaults in case of multiple choices. Change them if the  defaults
              are  not  desired  (i.e.,  these are the only variables you should
              change to select a configuration):


                wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                                          (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3).
                wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                                          (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
                wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                                          (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
                wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                                        - Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                                          commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                                          jpeg zlib regex expat).




              For unix style it uses  the  wx-config  utility.  You  can  select
              between  debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and
              static/shared in the QtDialog  or  ccmake  interfaces  by  turning
              ON/OFF the following variables:


                wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
                wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
                wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
                wxWidgets_USE_STATIC




              There  is  also  a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other
              options that need to be passed to the wx-config utility. For exam&#8208;
              ple, to use the base toolkit found in the /usr/local path, set the
              variable (before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:


                SET(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base --prefix=/usr)




              The following are set after the configuration  is  done  for  both
              windows and unix style:


                wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
                wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                                             i.e., where to find &quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and
                                             &quot;wx/setup.h&quot;; possibly empty for unices.
                wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
                wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                                             rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                                             in WIN32 environment.
                wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                                             against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
                wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link
                                             against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
                wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and compiler flags for
                                             unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                                             &quot;`wx-config --cxxflags`&quot;.
                wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.




              Sample usage:


                 # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
                 FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS net gl core base)
                 IF(wxWidgets_FOUND)
                   INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
                   # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
                   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(&lt;YourTarget&gt; ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
                 ENDIF(wxWidgets_FOUND)




              If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):


                 FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
                 INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
                 # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
                 TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(&lt;YourTarget&gt; ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})


       FindwxWindows
              Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

              This  module  finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and deter&#8208;
              mines where the include files and libraries are.  It  also  deter&#8208;
              mines  what  the  name of the library is. Please note this file is
              DEPRECATED and replaced by FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the
              following variables:

       FortranCInterface
              Fortran/C Interface Detection

              This module automatically detects the API by which C  and  Fortran
              languages interact.  Variables indicate if the mangling is found:


                 FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and functions
                 FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module subroutines and functions
                                                  (declared by &quot;MODULE PROCEDURE&quot;)
&#12;              A  function  is  provided  to  generate a C header file containing
              macros to mangle symbol names:


                 FortranCInterface_HEADER(&lt;file&gt;
                                          [MACRO_NAMESPACE &lt;macro-ns&gt;]
                                          [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &lt;ns&gt;]
                                          [SYMBOLS [&lt;module&gt;:]&lt;function&gt; ...])

              It generates in &lt;file&gt; definitions of the following macros:


                 #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...

              These macros mangle four categories of  Fortran  symbols,  respec&#8208;
              tively:


                 - Global symbols without &apos;_&apos;: call mysub()
                 - Global symbols with &apos;_&apos;   : call my_sub()
                 - Module symbols without &apos;_&apos;: use mymod; call mysub()
                 - Module symbols with &apos;_&apos;   : use mymod; call my_sub()

              If  mangling  for a category is not known, its macro is left unde&#8208;
              fined. All macros require raw names in both lower case  and  upper
              case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the default &quot;FortranCIn&#8208;
              terface_&quot; prefix with a given namespace &quot;&lt;macro-ns&gt;&quot;.


              The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle  automatically  with  C
              preprocessor definitions:


                 &lt;function&gt;          ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;function&gt; ...
                 &lt;module&gt;:&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;module&gt;_&lt;function&gt; ...

              If  the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor
              definition is created,  and  a  warning  is  displayed.  The  SYM&#8208;
              BOL_NAMESPACE  option prefixes all preprocessor definitions gener&#8208;
              ated by the SYMBOLS option with a given namespace &quot;&lt;ns&gt;&quot;.


              Example usage:


                 include(FortranCInterface)
                 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot;)

              This  creates  a  &quot;FC.h&quot;  header  that  defines  mangling   macros
              FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and FC_MODULE_().


              Example usage:


                 include(FortranCInterface)
                 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                                          MACRO_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot;
                                          SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot;
                                          SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)

              This  creates  a  &quot;FCMangle.h&quot; header that defines the same FC_*()
              mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor  symbols
              FC_mysub and FC_mymod_my_sub.


              Another  function is provided to verify that the Fortran and C/C++
              compilers work together:


                 FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])

              It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and
              C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully.
              The result is stored in the  cache  entry  FortranCInterface_VERI&#8208;
              FIED_C  (or  FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX  if CXX is given) as a
              boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not  given  the  function
              terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing the problem.  The
              purpose of this check is to stop a build  early  for  incompatible
              compiler combinations.


              FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE manglings
              for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an  interface  to
              specify new possible manglings.  Set the variables
&#12;
                 FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
                 FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS

              before  including  FortranCInterface  to  specify manglings of the
              symbols  &quot;MySub&quot;,   &quot;My_Sub&quot;,   &quot;MyModule:MySub&quot;,   and   &quot;My_Mod&#8208;
              ule:My_Sub&quot;. For example, the code:


                 set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
                   #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
                 set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
                     __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
                   #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
                 include(FortranCInterface)

              tells  FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE manglings.
              (The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this  example
              but are not needed.)


       GNUInstallDirs
              Define GNU standard installation directories

              Provides install directory variables as defined for GNU software:


                http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html

              Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:


                CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;      - destination for files of a given type
                CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt; - corresponding absolute path

              where &lt;dir&gt; is one of:


                BINDIR           - user executables (bin)
                SBINDIR          - system admin executables (sbin)
                LIBEXECDIR       - program executables (libexec)
                SYSCONFDIR       - read-only single-machine data (etc)
                SHAREDSTATEDIR   - modifiable architecture-independent data (com)
                LOCALSTATEDIR    - modifiable single-machine data (var)
                LIBDIR           - object code libraries (lib or lib64 or lib/&lt;multiarch-tuple&gt; on Debian)
                INCLUDEDIR       - C header files (include)
                OLDINCLUDEDIR    - C header files for non-gcc (/usr/include)
                DATAROOTDIR      - read-only architecture-independent data root (share)
                DATADIR          - read-only architecture-independent data (DATAROOTDIR)
                INFODIR          - info documentation (DATAROOTDIR/info)
                LOCALEDIR        - locale-dependent data (DATAROOTDIR/locale)
                MANDIR           - man documentation (DATAROOTDIR/man)
                DOCDIR           - documentation root (DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME)

              Each  CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;  value  may be passed to the DESTINATION
              options of install() commands for the corresponding file type.  If
              the  includer does not define a value the above-shown default will
              be used and the value will appear in the cache for editing by  the
              user.  Each  CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt;  value  contains an absolute
              path constructed from the corresponding destination by  prepending
              (if necessary) the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


       GenerateExportHeader
              Function for generation of export macros for libraries

              This module provides the function GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() and the
              accompanying ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS() function.


              The GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER function can be used to generate a file
              suitable  for  preprocessor inclusion which contains EXPORT macros
              to be used in library classes.


              GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET


                           [BASE_NAME &lt;base_name&gt;]
                           [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME &lt;export_macro_name&gt;]
                           [EXPORT_FILE_NAME &lt;export_file_name&gt;]
                           [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME &lt;deprecated_macro_name&gt;]
                           [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME &lt;no_export_macro_name&gt;]
                           [STATIC_DEFINE &lt;static_define&gt;]
                           [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME &lt;no_deprecated_macro_name&gt;]
                           [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
                           [PREFIX_NAME &lt;prefix_name&gt;]

              )


              ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [&lt;output_variable&gt;] )


              By default GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() generates  macro  names  in  a
              file  name  determined  by  the  name of the library. The ADD_COM&#8208;
              PILER_EXPORT_FLAGS   function    adds    -fvisibility=hidden    to
              CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS if supported, and is a no-op on Windows which does
              not need extra compiler  flags  for  exporting  support.  You  may
              optionally  pass  a  single  argument to ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS
              that will be populated with the  required  CXX_FLAGS  required  to
              enable visibility support for the compiler/architecture in use.


              This  means  that  in  the simplest case, users of these functions
              will be equivalent to:


                 add_compiler_export_flags()
                 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
                 generate_export_header(somelib)
                 install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
                 install(FILES
                  someclass.h
                  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
                 )




              And in the ABI header files:


                 #include &quot;somelib_export.h&quot;
                 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
                   ...
                 };




              The CMake fragment  will  generate  a  file  in  the  ${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BUILD_DIR}  called  somelib_export.h  containing  the  macros
              SOMELIB_EXPORT,       SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT,       SOMELIB_DEPRECATED,
              SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT  and  SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT.  The
              resulting file should be  installed  with  other  headers  in  the
              library.


              The  BASE_NAME  argument can be used to override the file name and
              the names used for the macros


                 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
                 generate_export_header(somelib
                   BASE_NAME other_name
                 )




              Generates a file called other_name_export.h containing the  macros
              OTHER_NAME_EXPORT,  OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT and OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED
              etc.


              The BASE_NAME may be overridden by specifiying  other  options  in
              the function. For example:


                 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
                 generate_export_header(somelib
                   EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
                 )




              creates the macro OTHER_NAME_EXPORT instead of SOMELIB_EXPORT, but
              other macros and the generated file name is as default.


                 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
                 generate_export_header(somelib
                   DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
                 )
&#12;

              creates the macro KDE_DEPRECATED instead of SOMELIB_DEPRECATED.


              If LIBRARY_TARGET is a static library, macros are defined  without
              values.


              If  the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static
              library, the uppercased symbol  ${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE  should
              be used when building the static library


                 add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
                 add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
                 generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME libshared_and_static)
                 set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
                   COMPILE_FLAGS -DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)




              This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when build&#8208;
              ing the static library.


              If   DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED   is    specified,    then    a    macro
              ${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED  will be defined This macro can be used
              to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output.


                 option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED &quot;Exclude deprecated parts of the library&quot; FALSE)
                 if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
                   set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED)
                 endif()
                 generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})




              And then in somelib:


                 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
                 {
                 public:
                 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
                   SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
                 #endif
                 };




                 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
                 void SomeClass::oldMethod() {  }
                 #endif




              If PREFIX_NAME is specified, the argument will be used as a prefix
              to all generated macros.


              For example:


                 generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)




              Generates the macros VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT etc.


       GetPrerequisites
              Functions to analyze and list executable file prerequisites.

              This  module  provides  functions  to list the .dll, .dylib or .so
              files that an executable or shared library file depends  on.  (Its
              prerequisites.)


              It  uses  various  tools  to  obtain  the  list of required shared
              library files:
&#12;                 dumpbin (Windows)
                 ldd (Linux/Unix)
                 otool (Mac OSX)

              The following functions are provided by this module:


                 get_prerequisites
                 list_prerequisites
                 list_prerequisites_by_glob
                 gp_append_unique
                 is_file_executable
                 gp_item_default_embedded_path
                   (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
                 gp_resolve_item
                   (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
                 gp_resolved_file_type
                   (projects can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
                 gp_file_type

              Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because  it  uses  function,  break,
              return and PARENT_SCOPE.


                GET_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; &lt;exclude_system&gt; &lt;recurse&gt;
                                  &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

              Get  the  list  of  shared library files required by &lt;target&gt;. The
              list in the variable named &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; should be empty  on
              first  entry  to  this function. On exit, &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; will
              contain the list of required shared library files.


              &lt;target&gt; is the  full  path  to  an  executable  file.  &lt;prerequi&#8208;
              sites_var&gt; is the name of a CMake variable to contain the results.
              &lt;exclude_system&gt; must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to  include  or
              exclude  &quot;system&quot; prerequisites. If &lt;recurse&gt; is set to 1 all pre&#8208;
              requisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only direct pre&#8208;
              requisites are listed. &lt;exepath&gt; is the path to the top level exe&#8208;
              cutable used for @executable_path replacment on the Mac. &lt;dirs&gt; is
              a  list  of  paths where libraries might be found: these paths are
              searched first when a target without any path info is given.  Then
              standard system locations are also searched: PATH, Framework loca&#8208;
              tions, /usr/lib...


                LIST_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; [&lt;recurse&gt; [&lt;exclude_system&gt; [&lt;verbose&gt;]]])

              Print a message listing the prerequisites of &lt;target&gt;.


              &lt;target&gt; is the name of a shared library or executable  target  or
              the full path to a shared library or executable file. If &lt;recurse&gt;
              is set to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to
              0 only direct prerequisites are listed. &lt;exclude_system&gt; must be 0
              or 1 indicating whether to include or exclude  &quot;system&quot;  prerequi&#8208;
              sites.  With  &lt;verbose&gt;  set  to 0 only the full path names of the
              prerequisites are printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be  dis&#8208;
              played.


                LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(&lt;glob_arg&gt; &lt;glob_exp&gt;)

              Print  the  prerequisites  of  shared library and executable files
              matching a globbing pattern. &lt;glob_arg&gt; is  GLOB  or  GLOB_RECURSE
              and  &lt;glob_exp&gt;  is a globbing expression used with &quot;file(GLOB&quot; or
              &quot;file(GLOB_RECURSE&quot; to retrieve a list of  matching  files.  If  a
              matching file is executable, its prerequisites are listed.


              Any  additional  (optional) arguments provided are passed along as
              the optional arguments to the list_prerequisites calls.


                GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(&lt;list_var&gt; &lt;value&gt;)

              Append &lt;value&gt; to the list variable &lt;list_var&gt; only if  the  value
              is not already in the list.


                IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(&lt;file&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)

              Return  1 in &lt;result_var&gt; if &lt;file&gt; is a binary executable, 0 oth&#8208;
              erwise.


                GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(&lt;item&gt; &lt;default_embedded_path_var&gt;)

              Return the path that others should refer to the item by  when  the
              item is embedded inside a bundle.


              Override  on  a  per-project basis by providing a project-specific
              gp_item_default_embedded_path_override function.


                GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(&lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;resolved_item_var&gt;)

              Resolve an item into an existing full path file.


              Override on a per-project basis by  providing  a  project-specific
              gp_resolve_item_override function.


                GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;type_var&gt;)

              Return  the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to &lt;original_file&gt;. String
              describing type of prerequisite  is  returned  in  variable  named
              &lt;type_var&gt;.


              Use  &lt;exepath&gt;  and  &lt;dirs&gt;  if  necessary to resolve non-absolute
              &lt;file&gt; values -- but only for non-embedded items.


              Possible types are:


                 system
                 local
                 embedded
                 other

              Override on a per-project basis by  providing  a  project-specific
              gp_resolved_file_type_override function.


                GP_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;type_var&gt;)

              Return  the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to &lt;original_file&gt;. String
              describing type of prerequisite  is  returned  in  variable  named

       InstallRequiredSystemLibraries


              By  including  this file, all library files listed in the variable
              CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS   will   be    installed    with
              INSTALL(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for non-WIN32. If
              CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP  is  set  to  TRUE   before
              including  this  file, then the INSTALL command is not called. The
              user can use the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use
              a custom install command and install them however they want. If it
              is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time  libraries  will
              be  found and automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUN&#8208;
              TIME_LIBS, and installed. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is  set
              and  it  is  the  MSVC  compiler,  then  the  debug  libraries are
              installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is
              set  then  only  the debug libraries are installed when both debug
              and release are available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES  is  set
              then  the  MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT
              run time libraries. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is
              set then the libraries are installed to that directory rather than
              the default. If  CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS  is
              NOT  set,  then  this  file warns about required files that do not
              exist. You can set this variable to ON before including this  file
              to  avoid the warning. For example, the Visual Studio Express edi&#8208;
              tions do not include the redistributable files, so if you  include
              this  file on a machine with only VS Express installed, you&apos;ll get
              the warning.


       MacroAddFileDependencies
              MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt; depend_files...)

              Using  the  macro  MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES()  is  discouraged.
              There are usually better ways to specify the correct dependencies.


              MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt;  depend_files...)  is  just  a
              convenience  wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source  file  prop&#8208;
              erty.  You can just use SET_PROPERTY(SOURCE &lt;file&gt; APPEND PROPERTY
              OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.


       ProcessorCount
              ProcessorCount(var)

              Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}


              Sets the variable named ${var} to the  number  of  physical  cores
              available  on  the  machine  if the information can be determined.
              Otherwise it is set to 0. Currently this functionality  is  imple&#8208;
              mented for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX,
              Sun and Windows.


              This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (&gt;=1)  if
              it  succeeds.  It  returns  0 if there&apos;s a problem determining the
              processor count.


              Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:


                 include(ProcessorCount)
                 ProcessorCount(N)
                 if(NOT N EQUAL 0)
                   set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N})
                   set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})
                 endif()




              This function is intended to offer an approximation of  the  value
              of  the  number of compute cores available on the current machine,
              such that you may use that value for parallel building and  paral&#8208;
              lel testing. It is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as
              seems reasonable. Of course, knowledge of what else might be  run&#8208;
              ning  on  the  machine simultaneously should be used when deciding
              whether to request a machine&apos;s full capacity all for yourself.

       SelectLibraryConfigurations


              select_library_configurations( basename )


              This macro takes a library base name  as  an  argument,  and  will
              choose good values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, base&#8208;
              name_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what
              has  been  found  and  set.   If  only basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is
              defined,  basename_LIBRARY,  basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG,   and   base&#8208;
              name_LIBRARY_RELEASE  will  be  set to the release value.  If only
              basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined,  then  basename_LIBRARY,  base&#8208;
              name_LIBRARY_DEBUG  and  basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE  will  take  the
              debug value.


              If  the  generator  supports  configuration  types,   then   base&#8208;
              name_LIBRARY  and  basename_LIBRARIES  will  be set with debug and
              optimized flags specifying the library to be used  for  the  given
              configuration.   If no build type has been set or the generator in
              use does not support configuration  types,  then  basename_LIBRARY
              and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release values.


       SquishTestScript
&#12;

              This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call
              the script  directly;  instead,  you  should  access  it  via  the
              SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.


              This  script  starts  the  Squish server, launches the test on the
              client, and finally stops the squish  server.   If  any  of  these
              steps fail (including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error
              is raised.

       UseEcos
              This module defines variables and macros required  to  build  eCos
              application.

              This file contains the following macros: ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTO&#8208;
              RIES()  -  add  the  eCos  include  dirs  ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name

              add_jar(TARGET_NAME SRC1 SRC2 .. SRCN RCS1 RCS2 .. RCSN)


              This  command  creates  a &lt;TARGET_NAME&gt;.jar. It compiles the given
              source files (SRC) and adds the given resource files (RCS) to  the
              jar file. If only resource files are given then just a jar file is
              created.


              Additional instructions:


                 To add compile flags to the target you can set these flags with
                 the following variable:




                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS -nowarn)




                 To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do this
                 with the CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH variable.




                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)




                 To use a different output name for the target you can set it with:




                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_NAME shibboleet.jar)
                     add_jar(foobar foobar.java)




                 To use a different output directory than CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
                 you can set it with:
&#12;
                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)




                 To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with:




                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_JAR_ENTRY_POINT com/examples/MyProject/Main)




                 To add a VERSION to the target output name you can set it using
                 CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION. This will create a jar file with the name
                 shibboleet-1.0.0.jar and will create a symlink shibboleet.jar
                 pointing to the jar with the version information.




                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION 1.2.0)
                     add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java)




                  If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following commands to
                  create a JNI symbolic link:




                     set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE)
                     set(CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_VERSION 1.2.0)
                     add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java)
                     install_jar(shibboleet ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
                     install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})




                  If a single target needs to produce more than one jar from its
                  java source code, to prevent the accumulation of duplicate class
                  files in subsequent jars, set/reset CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX prior
                  to calling the add_jar() function:




                     set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo)
                     add_jar(foo foo.java)




                     set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar)
                     add_jar(bar bar.java)




              Target Properties:


                 The add_jar() functions sets some target properties. You can get these
                 properties with the
                    get_property(TARGET &lt;target_name&gt; PROPERTY &lt;propery_name&gt;)
                 command.




                 INSTALL_FILES      The files which should be installed. This is used by
                                    install_jar().
                 JNI_SYMLINK        The JNI symlink which should be installed.
                                    This is used by install_jni_symlink().
                 JAR_FILE           The location of the jar file so that you can include
                                    it.
                 CLASS_DIR          The directory where the class files can be found. For
                                    example to use them with javah.




              find_jar(&lt;VAR&gt;


                        name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                        [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                        [VERSIONS version1 [version2]]
                        [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                       )




              This command is used to find a full path to the named jar. A cache
              entry  named  by  &lt;VAR&gt; is created to stor the result of this com&#8208;
              mand. If the full path to a jar is found the result is  stored  in
              the  variable and the search will not repeated unless the variable
              is cleared. If nothing is found, the  result  will  be  &lt;VAR&gt;-NOT&#8208;
              FOUND,  and  the search will be attempted again next time find_jar
              is invoked with the same variable. The name of the full path to  a
              file  that  is searched for is specified by the names listed after
              NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified after
              the PATHS argument. If you require special a version of a jar file
              you can specify it with the VERSIONS argument. The argument  after
              DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.


              install_jar(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)


              This  command installs the TARGET_NAME files to the given DESTINA&#8208;
              TION. It should be called in the same scope  as  add_jar()  or  it
              will fail.


              install_jni_symlink(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)


              This  command  installs  the TARGET_NAME JNI symlinks to the given
              DESTINATION. It should be called in the same scope as add_jar() or
              it will fail.


              create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt;


                              PACKAGES pkg1 [pkg2 ...]
                              [SOURCEPATH &lt;sourcepath&gt;]
                              [CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;]
                              [INSTALLPATH &lt;install path&gt;]
                              [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
                              [WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;]
                              [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                              [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                              [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
                             )




              Create  java  documentation  based  on files or packages. For more
              details please read the javadoc manpage.


              There are two main signatures for create_javadoc. The first signa&#8208;
              ture works with package names on a path with source files:


                 Example:
                 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
                   PACKAGES com.exmaple.foo com.example.bar
                   SOURCEPATH &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}&quot;
                   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
                   WINDOWTITLE &quot;My example&quot;
                   DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
                   AUTHOR TRUE
                   USE TRUE
                   VERSION TRUE
                 )




              The  second  signature for create_javadoc works on a given list of
              files.


                 create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt;
                                FILES file1 [file2 ...]
                                [CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;]
                                [INSTALLPATH &lt;install path&gt;]
                                [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
                                [WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;]
                                [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                                [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                                [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
                               )




              Example:


                 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
                   FILES ${example_SRCS}
                   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
                   WINDOWTITLE &quot;My example&quot;
                   DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
                   AUTHOR TRUE
                   USE TRUE
                   VERSION TRUE
                 )




              Both signatures share most of the options. These options  are  the
              same  as  what you can find in the javadoc manpage. Please look at
              the manpage for CLASSPATH, DOCTITLE, WINDOWTITLE, AUTHOR, USE  and
              VERSION.


              The documentation will be by default installed to


                 ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/&lt;VAR&gt;




              if you don&apos;t set the INSTALLPATH.



       UseJavaClassFilelist





              This script create a list of compiled Java class files to be added
              to a jar file. This avoids including cmake files which get created
              in the binary directory.



       UseJavaSymlinks





              Helper script for UseJava.cmake



       UsePkgConfig
              Obsolete pkg-config module for CMake, use FindPkgConfig instead.




              This module defines the following macro:


              PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags cflags)


              Calling  PKGCONFIG  will  fill  the desired information into the 4
              given  arguments,  e.g.  PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0   LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR
              LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was
              NOT found or the specified software  package  doesn&apos;t  exist,  the
              variable  will  be empty when the function returns, otherwise they
              will contain the respective information



       UseQt4 Use Module for QT4
&#12;              Sets up C and C++ to use Qt 4.  It is  assumed  that  FindQt.cmake
              has  already been loaded.  See FindQt.cmake for information on how
              to load Qt 4 into your CMake project.


       UseSWIG
              SWIG module for CMake

              Defines the following macros:


                 SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ])
                   - Define swig module with given name and specified language
                 SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ])
                   - Link libraries to swig module

              All other macros are for internal use only. To get the actual name
              of  the  swig  module,  use: ${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set
              Source files properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to  spec&#8208;
              ify  special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be
              used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another special vari&#8208;
              able  is  CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR,  it  allows  one to specify  where to
              write all the swig generated  module  (swig  -outdir  option)  The
              name-specific  variable  SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_EXTRA_DEPS may be used
              to specify extra dependencies for the generated  modules.  If  the
              source  file  generated by swig need some special flag you can use
              SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES( ${swig_generated_file_fullname}


                      PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS &quot;-bla&quot;)

POLICIES
       CMP0000
              A minimum required CMake version must be specified.

              CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which
              they have been written.  This policy has  been  put  in  place  so
              users  trying  to  build the project may be told when they need to
              update their CMake.  Specifying a version also helps  the  project
              build  with  CMake  versions  newer  than that specified.  Use the
              cmake_minimum_required command at the top  of  your  main   CMake&#8208;
              Lists.txt file:


                cmake_minimum_required(VERSION &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;)

              where  &quot;&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;  is the version of CMake you want to sup&#8208;
              port (such as &quot;2.6&quot;).  The command will ensure that at  least  the
              given  version of CMake is running and help newer versions be com&#8208;
              patible  with  the  project.   See  documentation  of  cmake_mini&#8208;
              mum_required for details.


              Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt
              file itself; a call in an included file is not  sufficient.   How&#8208;
              ever, the cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000
              to OLD or  NEW  behavior  explicitly.   The  OLD  behavior  is  to
              silently  ignore  the  missing invocation.  The NEW behavior is to
              issue an error instead of a warning.  An  included  file  may  set
              CMP0000  explicitly  to affect how this policy is enforced for the
              main CMakeLists.txt file.


              This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.


       CMP0001
              CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY should no longer be used.

              The OLD behavior is  to  check  CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY  and
              present it to the user.  The NEW behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACK&#8208;
              WARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.


              In CMake 2.4 and below the variable  CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
              was  used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.
              In CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility  issues  are  handled  by
              policies  and the cmake_policy command.  However, CMake must still
              check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY for projects written for CMake
              2.4 and below.


              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
              2.8.9 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
              the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.


       CMP0002
              Logical target names must be globally unique.

              Targets   names   created  with  add_executable,  add_library,  or
              add_custom_target are logical build target names.  Logical  target
              names must be globally unique because:


                - Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
                  code and on make tool command lines.
                - Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
                  to produce meaningful project names for the targets.

              The  logical  name of executable and library targets does not have
              to correspond to the physical file names  built.   Consider  using
              the  OUTPUT_NAME  target  property  to create two targets with the
              same physical name while keeping logical names  distinct.   Custom
              targets  must  simply  have globally unique names (unless one uses
              the global property ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS  with  a  Make&#8208;
              files generator).


              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version

              Libraries  linked  via  full  path no longer produce linker search
              paths.

              This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are  NOT  known
              are  found  at  link  time, but was created due to a change in how
              CMake deals with libraries whose full paths are  known.   Consider
              the code


                target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)

              CMake  2.4  and  below implemented linking to libraries whose full
              paths are known by splitting them on the link line  into  separate
              components  consisting  of  the linker search path and the library
              name.  The example code might have produced something like


                ... -L/path/to -lA ...

              in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order
              multiple  link directories such that the linker would find library
              A in the desired location, but there are cases in which this  does
              not  work.   CMake  versions  2.6  and above use the more reliable
              approach of passing the full path to  libraries  directly  to  the
              linker  in  most  cases.   The example code now produces something
              like


                ... /path/to/libA.so ....

              Unfortunately this change can break code like


                target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

              where &quot;B&quot; is meant to find &quot;/path/to/libB.so&quot;.  This code is wrong
              because  the  user  is asking the linker to find library B but has
              not provided a linker search path (which may  be  added  with  the
              link_directories  command).   However, with the old linking imple&#8208;
              mentation the code would  work  accidentally  because  the  linker
              search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.


              In  order  to  support  projects  depending on linker search paths
              added by linking to libraries  with  known  full  paths,  the  OLD
              behavior  for  this  policy  will add the linker search paths even
              though they are not needed for their  own  libraries.   When  this
              policy is set to OLD, CMake will produce a link line such as


                ... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

              which will allow library B to be found as it was previously.  When
              this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as


                ... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

              which more accurately matches what the project specified.


              The setting for this policy used when generating the link line  is
              that  in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or
              add_library command.  For the example described above, the code


                cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
                add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
                target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

              will work and suppress the warning for this policy.  It  may  also
              be updated to work with the corrected linking approach:


                cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
                link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
                add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
                target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

              Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:


                add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
                target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)

              When  all  items  on the link line have known paths CMake does not
              check this policy so it has no effect.


              Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for  at  most
              one  target.   This  avoids flooding users with messages for every
              target when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.


              This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake  version
              2.8.9 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
              the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

              Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.

              CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing
              whitespace from libraries linked with code like


                target_link_libraries(myexe &quot; A &quot;)

              This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.


              The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and
              trailing whitespace.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to diag&#8208;
              nose  the  existence  of such whitespace as an error.  The setting
              for this policy used when checking the library names  is  that  in
              effect  when  the  target  is  created  by  an  add_executable  or
              add_library command.

              Preprocessor definition values are now escaped automatically.

              This policy  determines  whether  or  not  CMake  should  generate
              escaped  preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.
              CMake versions 2.4 and below  assumed  that  only  trivial  values
              would  be  given  for macros in add_definitions calls.  It did not
              attempt to escape non-trivial values such as  string  literals  in
              generated  build  rules.   CMake  versions  2.6  and above support
              escaping of most values, but cannot assume the user has not  added
              escapes  already  in an attempt to work around limitations in ear&#8208;
              lier versions.


              The OLD behavior for this policy is  to  place  definition  values
              given  to  add_definitions  directly  in the generated build rules
              without attempting to escape anything.  The NEW behavior for  this
              policy  is  to generate correct escapes for all native build tools
              automatically.  See documentation of the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  tar&#8208;

              Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a BUNDLE DESTINATION.

              This  policy  determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must
              be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target  with
              the  MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not dis&#8208;
              tinguish  application  bundles  from   normal   executables   when
              installing  targets.   CMake  2.6  provides a BUNDLE option to the
              install(TARGETS) command that specifies rules specific to applica&#8208;
              tion  bundles  on  the  Mac.  Projects should use this option when
              installing a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.


              The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back  to  the  RUNTIME
              DESTINATION  if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.  The NEW behav&#8208;
              ior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle  target  is
              installed without a BUNDLE DESTINATION.

              list command no longer ignores empty elements.

              This  policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty
              elements in the list. CMake 2.4 and below  list  commands  ignored
              all  empty  elements  in the list.  For example, a;b;;c would have
              length 3 and not 4. The OLD behavior for this policy is to  ignore
              empty  list  elements. The NEW behavior for this policy is to cor&#8208;
              rectly count empty elements in a list.

              Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid library file name.

              In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like


                target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)

              where &quot;somelib&quot; is supposed to be a valid library file  name  such
              as  &quot;libsomelib.a&quot; or &quot;somelib.lib&quot;.  For Makefile generators this
              produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full
              path  cannot  be found.  For VS IDE and Xcode generators this used
              to work by accident because  CMake  would  always  split  off  the
              library  directory and ask the linker to search for the library by
              name (-lsomelib or somelib.lib).  Despite the failure  with  Make&#8208;
              files,  some  projects  have code like this and build only with VS
              and/or Xcode.  This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path
              directly  to  the  native build tool, which will fail in this case
              because it does not name a valid library file.


              This policy determines what to do with  full  paths  that  do  not
              appear  to  name  a valid library file.  The OLD behavior for this
              policy is to split the library name from  the  path  and  ask  the
              linker  to  search for it.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to
              trust the given path and pass it directly to the native build tool
              unchanged.


              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1.  CMake version

              FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow symlinks by default.

              In  CMake  2.6.1  and  below, FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls would follow
              through symlinks, sometimes  coming  up  with  unexpectedly  large
              result sets because of symlinks to top level directories that con&#8208;
              tain hundreds of thousands of files.


              This policy determines whether or not to follow  symlinks  encoun&#8208;
              tered  during  a FILE GLOB_RECURSE call. The OLD behavior for this
              policy is to follow the symlinks. The NEW behavior for this policy
              is  not to follow the symlinks by default, but only if FOLLOW_SYM&#8208;
              LINKS is given as an additional argument to the FILE command.

              as  a  missing close-brace (&quot;${FOO&quot;) was reported but did not stop
              processing of CMake code.  This policy determines  whether  a  bad
              variable  reference is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy
              is to warn about the error, leave the string untouched,  and  con&#8208;
              tinue. The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error.


              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version

              Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

              In  CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded
              by the include() and  find_package()  commands  would  affect  the
              includer.    Explicit   invocations   of   cmake_policy(PUSH)  and
              cmake_policy(POP) were required to isolate policy changes and pro&#8208;
              tect  the includer.  While some scripts intend to affect the poli&#8208;
              cies of their includer, most do not.  In CMake  2.6.3  and  above,
              include()  and  find_package() by default PUSH and POP an entry on
              the policy stack around an included script, but provide a  NO_POL&#8208;
              ICY_SCOPE option to disable it.  This policy determines whether or
              not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for compatibility.  The OLD  behavior
              for  this  policy  is  to  imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for include() and
              find_package() commands.  The NEW behavior for this policy  is  to
              allow the commands to do their default cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

              if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.

              In  CMake  versions  2.6.4  and  lower the if() command implicitly
              dereferenced arguments  corresponding  to  variables,  even  those
              named like numbers or boolean constants, except for 0 and 1.  Num&#8208;
              bers and boolean constants such as true, false, yes, no, on,  off,
              y,  n,  notfound, ignore (all case insensitive) were recognized in
              some cases but not all.  For example, the  code  &quot;if(TRUE)&quot;  might
              have  evaluated  as false.  Numbers such as 2 were recognized only
              in boolean expressions like &quot;if(NOT 2)&quot; (leading to false) but not
              as  a  single-argument like &quot;if(2)&quot; (also leading to false). Later
              versions of CMake prefer to treat numbers  and  boolean  constants
              literally, so they should not be used as variable names.


              The  OLD  behavior  for  this  policy is to implicitly dereference
              variables named like numbers and boolean constants. The NEW behav&#8208;
              ior  for this policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants
              without dereferencing variables with such names.

              Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.

              CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory()  calls

              system generation files would be written and then  overwritten  in
              the  build  tree  and could lead to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4
              and above explicitly detect duplicate binary  directories.   CMake

              with respect to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with

              (i.e. located in the CMake module directory)  calls  include()  or
              find_package(),  the  files located in the the CMake module direc&#8208;
              tory are preferred over  the  files  in  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.   This
              makes  sure  that  the modules belonging to CMake always get those
              files included which they expect,  and  against  which  they  were
              developed  and  tested.   In  call other cases, the files found in
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take precedence over the ones in the CMake
              module  directory.   The  OLD  behaviour is to always prefer files
              from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the  CMake  modules  direc&#8208;
              tory.


              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.4.  CMake version
              2.8.9 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
              the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.


       CMP0018
              Ignore CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS variable.

              CMake  2.8.8  and  lower  compiled  sources  in  SHARED and MODULE
              libraries    using    the    value     of     the     undocumented
              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS platform variable.  The variable
              contained platform-specific flags needed to  compile  objects  for
              shared  libraries.  Typically it included a flag such as -fPIC for
              position independent code but also included other flags needed  on
              certain  platforms.   CMake 2.8.9 and higher prefer instead to use
              the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property  to  determine  what
              targets should be position independent, and new undocumented plat&#8208;
              form    variables    to    select     flags     while     ignoring
              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS completely.


              The  default  for  either  approach produces identical compilation
              flags, but if a project modifies CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS
              from  its  original value this policy determines which approach to
              use.


              The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore  the  POSITION_INDE&#8208;
              PENDENT_CODE  property  for all targets and use the modified value
              of  CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS  for   SHARED   and   MODULE
              libraries.


              The    NEW    behavior    for    this    policy   is   to   ignore
              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS whether it is  modified  or  not
              and honor the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property.
&#12;
              This  policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.9.  CMake version
              2.8.9 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
              the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.


VARIABLES
VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
       BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
              Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

              If  present  and  true,  this will cause all libraries to be built
              shared unless  the  library  was  explicitly  added  as  a  static
              library.  This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so
              that each user of a project can decide if they want to  build  the
              project using shared or static libraries.


       CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
              List  of files which have been installed using  an ABSOLUTE DESTI&#8208;
              NATION path.

              This variable is defined  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts.  It  can  be  used  (read-only) by program or script that
              source those install scripts. This is used by some  CPack  genera&#8208;
              tors (e.g. RPM).


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
              Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

              By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the documenta&#8208;
              tion of the AUTOMOC target property.  When set to TRUE, it accepts
              more  input  and tries to find the correct input file for moc even
              if it differs from the documented behaviour. In this mode it  e.g.
              also  checks  whether a header file is intended to be processed by
              moc when a &quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.


              Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.


       CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
              Version of cmake required to build project

              From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this  specifies
              what  version  of CMake should be supported. By default this value
              is the version number of CMake that you are running. You  can  set
              this  to  an older version of CMake to support deprecated commands
              of CMake in projects that were written to use  older  versions  of
              CMake.  This  can  be set by the user or set at the beginning of a
              CMakeLists file.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
              Specifies the build type for make based generators.

              This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possi&#8208;
              ble  values  are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSiz&#8208;
              eRel. This variable is only supported for make  based  generators.
              If  this  variable is supported, then CMake will also provide ini&#8208;
              tial    values    for    the    variables    with     the     name
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For exam&#8208;
              ple, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then  CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG  will
              be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.


       CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
              Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.

              When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
              Default is ON.


       CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
              Specifies the available build types.

              This specifies what build types will be available such  as  Debug,
              Release,  RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most
              platforms. But can be extended to provide other build  types.  See
              also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.


       CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;
              Variable for disabling find_package() calls.

              Every  non-REQUIRED  find_package()  call in a project can be dis&#8208;
              abled by setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Package&#8208;
              Name&gt;  to  TRUE.  This  can  be used to build a project without an
              optional package, although that package is installed.


              This switch should be used during the initial CMake run. Otherwise
              if the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
              variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.
              In  the  case  it is recommended to remove the cache variables for
              this package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U


       CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file with
              absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              The  fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offend&#8208;
              ing file takes place. This variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated
              cmake_install.cmake scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while
              running the script, it may  get  fatal  error  messages  from  the
              script.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
              Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

              This  specifies  what  prefixes  to  add to library names when the
              find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX systems this  is
              typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
              will look for libfoo.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
              Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

              This specifies what suffixes to add  to  library  names  when  the
              find_library  command looks for libraries. On Windows systems this
              is typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to  find  the
              foo library it will look for foo.dll etc.


       CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
              Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.

              If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
              CONFIG  or  NO_MODULE)  and  no  Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake  module   is   in
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH  then  CMake  implicitly assumes that the caller
              intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
              configuration  file  is found then the wording of the failure mes&#8208;
              sage must account for both the case that  the  package  is  really
              missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed to pro&#8208;
              vide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an
              explicit  mode  option  then  the failure message can be more spe&#8208;
              cific.


              Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package
              to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps devel&#8208;
              opers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package
              within a project.


       CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would  normally  search.  By default this is empty; it is
              intended to be set by the  project.  Note  that  CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              takes  a  list  of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you
              want to ignore paths under prefixes  (bin,  include,  lib,  etc.),
              you&apos;ll  need  to  specify  them  explicitly.  See  also CMAKE_PRE&#8208;
              FIX_PATH,   CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,   CMAKE_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will  be  used  both by FIND_FILE() and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories  for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
              By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by  the  project.
              See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
              Default component used in install() commands.
&#12;              If  an  install()  command is used without the COMPONENT argument,
              these files will be grouped into a default component. The name  of
              this  default  install component will be taken from this variable.
              It defaults to &quot;Unspecified&quot;.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
              Install directory used by install.

              If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,  this  directory
              is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults
              to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will   be   used   by   FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY()  will  check  each of the contained directories for
              the existence of the  library  which  is  currently  searched.  By
              default  it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See
              also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
              Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

              This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will  enable  MFC  in
              the  application.  It should be set to 1 for static the static MFC
              library, and 2 for the shared MFC library.  This is used in visual
              studio 6 and 7 project files.   The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and
              the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:


              add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)


              set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)


              add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})



       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
              List of directories to search for CMake modules.

              Commands like include() and find_package()  search  for  files  in
              directories  listed  by  this variable before checking the default
              modules that come with CMake.


       CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
              Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

              This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake  to  tell
              CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.


       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;
              Default  for  CMake  Policy  CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;  when  it is otherwise left
              unset.

              Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION)
              by  default  leave  policies  introduced  after  the given version
              unset.  Set CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to  spec&#8208;
              ify  the  default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where &lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy
              number.


              This variable should not be set by a project in  CMake  code;  use
              cmake_policy(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this vari&#8208;
              able       in       the       cache       (e.g.       -DCMAKE_POL&#8208;
              ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy not otherwise set
              by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a policy warning while  using
              old behavior or to NEW to try building the project with new behav&#8208;
              ior.


       CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include .  By  default  it  is
              empty,  it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence of the program which is currently searched. By default it is
              empty, it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See  also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
              Don&apos;t make the install target depend on the all target.

              By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on the &quot;all&quot; target. This
              has the effect, that when &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL  is
              built,  first  the  &quot;all&quot;  target  is built, then the installation
              starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE,  this
              dependency  is not created, so the installation process will start
              immediately, independent from whether the project  has  been  com&#8208;
              pletely built or not.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would normally search. By default this contains a list of
              directories containing incompatible binaries for the host  system.
              See   also   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies a path which  will  be  used  both  by  FIND_FILE()  and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories for the existence of the file which is currently  searched.
              By  default  it  contains the standard directories for the current
              system. It is NOT intended to be  modified  by  the  project,  use
              CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies   a   path   which   will  be  used  by  FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the  contained  directories  for
              the  existence  of  the  library  which  is currently searched. By
              default it contains the standard directories for the current  sys&#8208;
              tem.  It  is  NOT  intended  to  be  modified  by the project, use
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default this con&#8208;
              tains  the  standard directories for the current system. It is NOT
              intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH  for
              this.     See     also    CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH,    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,   and    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_IGNORE_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence  of  the  program which is currently searched. By default it
              contains the standard directories for the current  system.  It  is
              NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
              Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.
&#12;              CMake loads the specified file while  enabling  support  for  each
              language  from either the project() or enable_language() commands.
              It is loaded after CMake&apos;s builtin compiler and platform  informa&#8208;
              tion  modules have been loaded but before the information is used.
              The file  may  set  platform  information  variables  to  override
              CMake&apos;s defaults.


              This  feature  is  intended for use only in overriding information
              variables that must be set before  CMake  builds  its  first  test
              project  to  check  that  the  compiler  for a language works.  It
              should not be used to load a file in cases that a normal include()
              will  work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot
              be  achieved  any  other  way.    For   example,   one   may   set
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT  to change the default value used to initialize
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.  The override file  should  NOT
              be  used  to  set  anything  that could be set after languages are
              enabled, such  as  variables  like  CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              that  affect  the  placement  of binaries.  Information set in the
              file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds too.


       CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with abso&#8208;
              lute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              This  variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while running the script,
              it may get warning messages from the script.


VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM
       APPLE  True if running on Mac OSX.

              Set to true on Mac OSX.


       BORLAND
              True if the borland compiler is being used.

              Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft

              Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
              Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

              Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Micro&#8208;
              soft.


       CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
              True for Apple OSXoperating systems.

              Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is being run on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system  instead  of  the
              target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of
              the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
              True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.
&#12;              Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE
              and CYGWIN).


       CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
              True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

              This is the value of CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected
              for one of the enabled languages.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
              Regex matching  possible  target  architecture  library  directory
              names.

              This  is used to detect CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the
              implicit linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.


       CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
              Maximum object file  full-path  length  allowed  by  native  build
              tools.

              CMake  computes  for every source file an object file name that is
              unique to the source file and deterministic with  respect  to  the
              full  path  to the source file.  This allows multiple source files
              in a target to share the same name if they lie in different direc&#8208;
              tories  without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However,
              it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so  CMake  shortens
              the  path  using  a hashing scheme when the full path to an object
              file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for  each  plat&#8208;
              form  that  is  sufficient for common tools, but some native tools
              may have a lower limit.  This variable may be set to  specify  the
              limit explicitly.  The value must be an integer no less than 128.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is compiling for.

              This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_VERSION,  like  this  ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VER&#8208;
              SION}.  If  CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION  is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is
              the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is building for.

              This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is target&#8208;
              ing.    On  systems  that have the uname command, this variable is
              set to the output of uname -s.  Linux, Windows,   and  Darwin  for
              Mac OSX are the values found  on the big three operating systems.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

              On  systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output
              of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the  environment
              variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is building for.

              A  numeric  version string for the system, on systems that support
              uname, this variable is set to the output of uname  -r.  On  other
              systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.


       CYGWIN True for cygwin.

              Set to true when using CYGWIN.


       MSVC   True when using Microsoft Visual C

              Set  to true when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual
              C.


       MSVC80 True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0

              Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of  Microsoft  Visual
              C.
&#12;       MSVC_IDE
              True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE

              Set  to  true  when  the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C
              IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.


       MSVC_VERSION
              The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.

              Known version numbers are:


                1200 = VS  6.0
                1300 = VS  7.0
                1310 = VS  7.1
                1400 = VS  8.0
                1500 = VS  9.0
                1600 = VS 10.0


       UNIX   True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

              Set to true when the target system is  UNIX  or  UNIX  like  (i.e.
              APPLE and CYGWIN).


       WIN32  True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the target system is Windows.


       XCODE_VERSION
              Version of Xcode (Xcode generator only).

              Under  the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as speci&#8208;
              fied in &quot;Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist&quot; (such as &quot;3.1.2&quot;).

       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND
              Rule variable to append to a static archive.

              This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append to a static
              archive.     It    is   used   in   place   of   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE&#8208;
              ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in  order  to  support  large
              object   counts.    See   also   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE   and
              CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE
              Rule variable to create a new static archive.

              This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to  create  a  static

              ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in  order  to  support  large
              object   counts.    See   also   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND   and
              CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH
              Rule variable to finish an existing static archive.

              This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to  finish  a  static
              archive.     It    is   used   in   place   of   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE&#8208;
              ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms in  order  to  support  large
              object   counts.    See   also   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE   and

              The full path to the compiler for LANG.

              This is the command that will be used as the &lt;LANG&gt; compiler. Once
              set, you can not change this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ABI
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This  is  used  in  determining the compiler ABI and is subject to
              change.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID
              An internal variable subject to change.

              Defined to true if the language is enabled.
&#12;              When language &lt;LANG&gt; is enabled by project() or  enable_language()
              this variable is defined to 1.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION
              An internal variable subject to change.

              Compiler  version  in  major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This
              variable is reserved for internal use by CMake and is not  guaran&#8208;
              teed to be set.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILE_OBJECT
              Rule variable to compile a single object file.

              This  is  a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single

       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
              File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

              This  is  a  list of file extensions that may be part of a project
              for a given language but are not compiled.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

              CMake does not explicitly specify these  directories  on  compiler
              command  lines  for language &lt;LANG&gt;.  This prevents system include
              directories from being treated as user include directories on some
              compilers.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
              Implicit linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              Compilers  typically  pass directories containing language runtime
              libraries and default library search  paths  when  they  invoke  a
              linker.   These  paths  are implicit linker search directories for
              the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects these direc&#8208;
              tories for each language and reports the results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
              Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.
&#12;              Compilers  typically pass language runtime library names and other
              flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags  are  implicit  link
              options  for the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects
              these libraries and  flags  for  each  language  and  reports  the
              results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name detected for &lt;lang&gt;.

              If  the  &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an architecture-spe&#8208;
              cific system library search directory such as  &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt;
              this variable contains the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              Preference value for linker language selection.

              The  &quot;linker  language&quot; for executable, shared library, and module
              targets is the language whose compiler  will  invoke  the  linker.
              The  LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.
              Otherwise, the linker language is  that  whose  linker  preference
              value is highest among languages compiled and linked into the tar&#8208;
              get.  See also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES vari&#8208;
              able.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
              True if CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

              This  is  used  when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
              Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.
              A  language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
              considered if this variable is true.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE
              Rule variable to link and executable.

              Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
              Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

              This is the extension for an object file for the given &lt;LANG&gt;. For
              example .obj for C on Windows.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
              Size of pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This  holds  the  size  (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the
              target platform ABI.  It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
              Extensions of source files for the given language.

              This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt;
              True if the compiler is GNU.

              If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU compiler then  this  is
              TRUE, if not it is FALSE.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
              Fortran default module output directory.

              Most  Fortran  compilers  write  .mod files to the current working
              directory.  For those that do not, this is set  to  &quot;.&quot;  and  used
              when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property is not set.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
              Fortran flag for module output directory.

              This  stores the flag needed to pass the value of the Fortran_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_DIRECTORY target property to the compiler.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
              Fortran flag to enable module output.

              Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.  For  oth&#8208;
              ers, this stores the flag needed to enable module output.


       CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This  is  used  in  determining the compiler ABI and is subject to
              change.


       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt;
              Specify a CMake  file  that  overrides  platform  information  for
              &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This is a language-specific version of CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVER&#8208;
              RIDE loaded only when enabling language &lt;LANG&gt;.


VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
       CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Default filename postfix for libraries under  configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  a non-executable target is created its &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX tar&#8208;
              get property is initialized with the value of this variable if  it
              is set.


       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC
              Whether to handle moc automatically for Qt targets.

              This  variable  is  used to initialize the AUTOMOC property on all
              the targets. See that target property for additional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional options for moc when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTOMOC).

              This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS  prop&#8208;
              erty  on  all the targets. See that target property for additional
              information.


       CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Use the install path for the RPATH

              Normally CMake uses the build tree for  the  RPATH  when  building
              executables  etc  on  systems that use RPATH. When the software is
              installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake  to  have  the
              install  RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software
              is always built with the install path for the RPATH and  does  not
              need to be relinked when installed.


       CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.

              This  variable  is  a special case of the more-general CMAKE_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
              Linker flags used to create executables.

              Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE]
              Flag used when linking an executable.

              Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating  exe&#8208;
              cutables.


       CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Fortran module output directory.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              This  variable  is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property on tar&#8208;
              gets when they are created.  See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
              Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
              include path.

              If this variable is enabled,  CMake  automatically  adds  in  each
              directory     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}     and     ${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path  for  this  directory.  These
              additional  include directories do not propagate down to subdirec&#8208;
              tories. This is useful  mainly  for  out-of-source  builds,  where
              files  generated into the build tree are included by files located
              in the source tree.


              By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the  INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              property  on all targets. See that target property for more infor&#8208;
              mation.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed targets (for platforms that support it). This is used to
              initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
              will  append directories in the linker search path and outside the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is used to initialize the  tar&#8208;
              get property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
              The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.

              The  flag  used to specify a library directory to the compiler. On
              most compilers this is &quot;-L&quot;.


       CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG
              Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.

              The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll  on  Windows,
              this is only defined on Windows.


       CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Default value for LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

              The  flag  used before a library file path is given to the linker.
              This is needed only on very few platforms.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library into an executable.

              The flag used to specify a library to link to an  executable.   On
              most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.
&#12;       CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
              Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

              When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installa&#8208;
              tion than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a  builtin  editor
              to  change  the  RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is
              set to true then CMake will relink the binary before  installation
              instead of using its builtin editor.


       CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_FLAGS
              Default value for POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is always built with no RPATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is  always  installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
              building.  This can be useful for example to allow  running  tests
              from  the  build directory with RPATH enabled before the installa&#8208;
              tion step.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
              CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.


       CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
              Build configuration used for try_compile and try_run projects.

              Projects  built by try_compile and try_run are built synchronously
              during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a  specific  build
              configuration  must  be  chosen even if the generated build system
              supports multiple configurations.


       CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
              Use relative paths (May not work!).

              If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake  will  use  relative  paths
              between  the source and binary tree. This option does not work for
              more complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possi&#8208;
              ble.  In general, it is not possible to move CMake generated make&#8208;
              files to a different location regardless  of  the  value  of  this
              variable.


       CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Default value for WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE property
              on all the targets. See that target property for additional infor&#8208;
              mation.


       EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old executable location variable.

              The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this vari&#8208;
              able for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are  otherwise
              placed in this directory.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old library location variable.
&#12;              The   target   properties  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,  LIBRARY_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede  this  vari&#8208;
              able  for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise
              placed in this directory.


VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
       variables defined by cmake, that give information about the project,  and
       cmake


       CMAKE_AR
              Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

              This  specifies name of the program that creates archive or static
              libraries.


       CMAKE_ARGC
              Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

              When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number
              of command line arguments. See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...


       CMAKE_ARGV0
              Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

              When  run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the first
              command line argument. It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
              ...  and  so on, up to the number of command line arguments given.
              See also CMAKE_ARGC.


       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the top level of the build tree.

              This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake  build
              tree.   For  an  in-source  build,  this  would  be  the  same  as
              CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
              Tool used for the actual build process.

              This variable is set to the program that will be needed  to  build
              the output of CMake.   If the generator selected was Visual Studio
              6, the CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to msdev, for  Unix  makefiles
              it will be set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to
              devenv.  For Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be  use&#8208;
              ful for adding special flags and commands based on the final build
              environment.


       CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
              The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

              This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt
              file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
              Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This  is  stores  the major version of CMake used to write a CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
              Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This  is  stores  the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
              Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This  is  stores  the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
              Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

              For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
              build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a  ref&#8208;
              erence  to  a  build-time  variable  specifying  the  name  of the
              per-configuration output  subdirectory.   On  Makefile  generators
              this evaluates to &quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
              build tree.  Example values:


                $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
                $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
                $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
                $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
                .                = Make-based tools

              Since these values are evaluated by the native build system,  this
              variable  is  suitable  only for use in command lines that will be
              evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:


                add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
                add_custom_command(
                  OUTPUT out.txt
                  COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
                  DEPENDS mytool in.txt
                  )
                add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

              Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose
              but  has  been  left  for  compatibility  with  existing projects.
              Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in
              its         COMMAND         option,        so        &quot;${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot; can  be  replaced  by
              just &quot;mytool&quot;.


              This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
              multi-configuration build systems the value of  this  variable  is
              passed  as  the value of preprocessor symbol &quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot; to the
              compilation of all source files.


       CMAKE_COMMAND
              The full path to the cmake executable.

              This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is  use&#8208;
              ful  from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for
              portable system commands. (e.g. /usr/local/bin/cmake


       CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
              Is CMake currently cross compiling.

              This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross  com&#8208;
              piling.  Specifically  if the build platform is different from the
              target platform.


       CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
              Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.

              This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is  use&#8208;
              ful  from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option for
              portable system commands.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

              This the full path to the build directory that is currently  being
              processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will
              create a binary directory in the build tree, and as  it  is  being
              processed  this variable will be set. For in-source builds this is
              the current source directory being processed.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
              Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

              As CMake processes the listfiles in  your  project  this  variable
              will  always  be  set to the directory where the listfile which is
              currently being processed  (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE)  is  located.
              The  value  has  dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing com&#8208;
              mands in a source file it sets  this  variable  to  the  directory
              where  this  file is located.  When CMake finishes processing com&#8208;
              mands from the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the
              value  of the variable inside a macro or function is the directory
              of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack,  not
              the directory of the file containing the macro or function defini&#8208;
              tion.


              See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
              Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

              As CMake processes the listfiles in  your  project  this  variable
              will  always  be  set  to  the one currently being processed.  The
              value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in
              a  source  file it sets this variable to the location of the file.
              When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it  restores
              the  previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a
              macro or function is the file invoking the  bottom-most  entry  on
              the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function def&#8208;
              inition.

              first.


       CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
              If true, do not add run time path information.

              If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
              compiled  executables.  The default is to add rpath information if
              the platform supports it.  This allows for easy running  from  the
              build  tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build

              dows.


              CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
              The tweak version of cmake (i.e. the 1 in X.X.X.1).

              This specifies the tweak version of  the  CMake  executable  being
              run.   Releases  use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development versions use
              the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak level.

              Create verbose makefiles if on.

              This variable defaults to false. You can set this variable to true
              to  make  CMake  produce  verbose makefiles that show each command
              line as it is used.


       CMAKE_VERSION
              The full version of cmake in  major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]]  for&#8208;
              mat.

       [Project name]_BINARY_DIR
              Top level binary directory for the named project.

              A variable is created with the name used in the  PROJECT  command,
              and  is the binary directory for the project.   This can be useful
              when SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.


       [Project name]_SOURCE_DIR
              Top level source directory for the named project.

              A variable is created with the name used in the  PROJECT  command,
