NAME
       cmakecompat - Reference of CMake compatibility commands.


COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS
         CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.


       This  is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previ&#8208;
       ous CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility  reasons.
       You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;-)


       build_name
              Deprecated.    Use   ${CMAKE_SYSTEM}   and   ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
              instead.

                build_name(variable)

              Sets the specified variable to a string representing the  platform
              and compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
              CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.


       exec_program
              Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.

              Run an executable program during  the  processing  of  the  CMake&#8208;
              List.txt file.


                exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
                             [ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;]
                             [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                             [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])

              The  executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
              executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
              better  to  use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to
              the program.   This is because cmake will then be able  to  escape
              spaces  in the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARI&#8208;
              ABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture
              the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUT&#8208;
              PUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output  will  go  to  the  std&#8208;
              out/stderr of the console running cmake.



       export_library_dependencies
              Deprecated.  Use INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.

              This  command  generates  an  old-style library dependencies file.
              Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the  command.
              Use  instead  the  install(EXPORT)  command to help export targets
              from an installation tree and the export() command to export  tar&#8208;
              gets from a build tree.


              The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account
              per-configuration  names   of   libraries   or   the   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES target property.
&#12;
                export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])

              Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included into a CMake list&#8208;
              file with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number  of
              SET  commands  that  will set all the variables needed for library
              dependency information.  This should be the last  command  in  the
              top  level  CMakeLists.txt  file  of  the  project.  If the APPEND
              option is specified, the SET commands  will  be  appended  to  the
              given file instead of replacing it.


       install_files
              Deprecated.  Use the install(FILES ) command instead.

              This  command  has  been superceded by the install command.  It is
              provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES  form
              is  directly  replaced  by  the FILES form of the install command.
              The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB  form
              of the file command.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)

              Create  rules to install the listed files with the given extension
              into the given directory.  Only  files  existing  in  the  current
              source  tree  or its corresponding location in the binary tree may
              be listed.  If a file specified already  has  an  extension,  that
              extension  will  be  removed  first.  This is useful for providing
              lists of source files such as foo.cxx when  you  want  the  corre&#8208;
              sponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is &apos;.h&apos;.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

              Any  files  in the current source directory that match the regular
              expression will be installed.


                install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)

              Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be installed explic&#8208;
              itly from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.


              The  directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix, which
              is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


       install_programs
              Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS ) command instead.

              This command has been superceded by the install  command.   It  is
              provided  for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form
              is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the INSTALL  command.
              The  regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form
              of the FILE command.


                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])

              Create rules to install the listed programs into the given  direc&#8208;
              tory.  Use the FILES argument to guarantee that the file list ver&#8208;
              sion of the command will be used even when there is only one argu&#8208;
              ment.


                install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

              In  the  second  form  any program in the current source directory
              that matches the regular expression will be installed.


              This command is intended to install programs that are not built by
              cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the TARGETS form of the INSTALL
              command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.


              The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix,  which
              is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


       install_targets
              Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )  command instead.

              This  command  has  been superceded by the install command.  It is
              provided for compatibility with older CMake code.


                install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)

              Create rules to install the listed targets into the  given  direc&#8208;
              tory.  The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix,
              which is stored in  the  variable  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  If  RUN&#8208;
              TIME_DIRECTORY  is specified, then on systems with special runtime
              files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.


       link_libraries
              Deprecated. Use the target_link_libraries() command instead.

              Link libraries to all targets added later.


                link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt; library2 ...)

              Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any  following  tar&#8208;
              gets  (typically  added  with  the  add_executable  or add_library
              calls).  This command is passed down to all  subdirectories.   The
              debug  and optimized strings may be used to indicate that the next
              library listed is to be used only for that specific type of build.


       make_directory
              Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.

                make_directory(directory)

              Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
              parent  directories  that  do not exist will also be created.  Use
              with care.


       output_required_files
              Deprecated.  Approximate C preprocessor dependency scanning.

              This command exists only because ancient CMake  versions  provided
              it.   CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning automatically
              using a more advanced scanner.
&#12;                output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)

              Outputs a list of all the source files that are  required  by  the
              specified  srcfile.  This list is written into outputfile. This is
              similar to writing out the dependencies for srcfile except that it
              jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c and .cpp files if possible.


       remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.

                remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

              Removes  VALUE  from  the variable VAR.  This is typically used to
              remove entries from a  vector  (e.g.  semicolon  separated  list).
              VALUE is expanded.


       subdir_depends
              Deprecated.  Does nothing.

                subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)

              Does  not  do  anything.  This command used to help projects order
              parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.


       subdirs
              Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command instead.

              Add a list of subdirectories to the build.


                subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
                        [PREORDER] )

              Add a list of subdirectories to the  build.  The  add_subdirectory
              command  should  be  used instead of subdirs although subdirs will
              still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files  in  the  sub
              directories  to  be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the
              PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER
              flag  has  no  effect  on IDE projects.  Any directories after the
              EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be  included  in  the  top  level
              makefile  or  project file. This is useful for having CMake create
              makefiles or projects for a set of  examples  in  a  project.  You
              would  want  CMake  to generate makefiles or project files for all
              the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show
              up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from
              the top.


       use_mangled_mesa
              Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

                use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

              The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.   The  mesa
              headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
              mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by  being  added
              to the include directory path earlier.


       utility_source
              Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.

                utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                               path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])

              When  a  third-party utility&apos;s source is included in the distribu&#8208;
              tion, this command specifies its location  and  name.   The  cache
              entry  will  not  be  set unless the path_to_source and all listed
              files exist.  It is assumed that the source tree  of  the  utility
              will have been built before it is needed.


              When  cross  compiling  CMake  will  print  a  warning  if a util&#8208;
              ity_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used
              to  build  an  executable which is executed later on. This doesn&apos;t
              work when cross compiling, since the executable can  run  only  on
              their  target  platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be
              adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is  runnable
              on the build host.


       variable_requires
              Deprecated. Use the if() command instead.

              Assert satisfaction of an option&apos;s required variables.


                variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)

              The  first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the variable to
              be tested, if that variable is false  nothing  else  is  done.  If
              TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is
              a variable that is set to true if all the required  variables  are
              set.  The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or
              not set to NOTFOUND to avoid an error.  If any are  not  true,  an
              error is reported.


       write_file
              Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.

                write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;... [APPEND])

              The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
              messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified,  then  the
              message will be appended.


              NOTE  1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as
              this one but add some more functionality.


              NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used  as
              an  input  to  CMake  (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it
              will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you  want  to
              generate input files to CMake.
