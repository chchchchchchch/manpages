NAME
       cmakeprops - Reference of CMake properties.


PROPERTIES
         CMake Properties - Properties supported by CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.


       This  is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake. Proper&#8208;
       ties can have different scopes. They can either be assigned to  a  source
       file, a directory, a target or globally to CMake. By modifying the values
       of properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.


PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
       ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
              Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

              Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a  project  have
              globally  unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is nec&#8208;
              essary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode  and  VS
              IDE  generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
              unambiguously.


              Makefile generators are capable  of  supporting  duplicate  custom
              target  names.  For projects that care only about Makefile genera&#8208;
              tors and do not wish to support Xcode or VS  IDE  generators,  one
              may  set  this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.
              The property allows multiple add_custom_target  command  calls  in
              different  directories  to specify the same target name.  However,
              setting this property will cause non-Makefile generators  to  pro&#8208;
              duce an error and refuse to generate the project.


       DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
              Specify which configurations are for debugging.

              The  value  must  be  a semi-colon separated list of configuration
              names.   Currently  this  property  is  used  only  by  the   tar&#8208;
              get_link_libraries  command  (see  its documentation for details).
              Additional uses may be defined in the future.


              This property must be set at the top  level  of  the  project  and
              before the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any
              entry in the list does not match a  valid  configuration  for  the
              project the behavior is undefined.


       DISABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

              List  of  features  which  are  disabled  during the CMake run. By
              default it contains the names  of  all  packages  which  were  not
              found.  This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Pack&#8208;
              ages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A  project  can  add
              its own features to this list. This property is used by the macros
              in FeatureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
&#12;              List of features which  are  enabled  during  the  CMake  run.  By
              default  it  contains  the names of all packages which were found.
              This is determined  using  the  &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND  variables.  Packages
              which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own
              features to this list. This property is used by the macros in Fea&#8208;
              tureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_LANGUAGES
              Read-only  property  that  contains  the list of currently enabled
              languages

              Set to list of currently enabled languages.


       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
              Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically  search  lib64  directo&#8208;
              ries.

              FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS  is  a boolean specifying whether the
              FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant
              of  directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit
              binaries.


       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
              Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.

              This property is a boolean  specifying  whether  the  FIND_LIBRARY
              command  should find shared libraries with OpenBSD-style versioned
              extension: &quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;.  The property is set to true  on
              OpenBSD and false on other platforms.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
              Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

              CMake  automatically  analyzes  the global inter-target dependency
              graph at the beginning of native build  system  generation.   This
              property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
              Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

              CMake  automatically  analyzes  the global inter-target dependency
              graph at the beginning of  native  build  system  generation.   It
              reports  an  error  if  the dependency graph contains a cycle that
              does not consist of all STATIC  library  targets.   This  property
              tells  CMake  to disallow all cycles completely, even among static
              libraries.


       IN_TRY_COMPILE
              Read-only property that is true during  a  try-compile  configura&#8208;
              tion.

              True  when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN com&#8208;
              mand.


       PACKAGES_FOUND
              List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

              List of packages which were found during the CMake run. Whether  a
              package  has been found is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND vari&#8208;
              ables.
&#12;
       PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
              List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

              List of packages which  were  not  found  during  the  CMake  run.
              Whether   a  package  has  been  found  is  determined  using  the
              &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.


       PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
              Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

              If not set, CMake uses &quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value
              for  this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS
              will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the documentation for
              the FOLDER target property.


       REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
              If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

              If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
              report any properties or variables  that  were  accessed  but  not
              defined into the filename specified in this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              Makefile  generators  prefix  compiler  commands  with  the  given
              launcher command line.  This is intended  to  allow  launchers  to
              intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile gen&#8208;
              erators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher
              command  line.   This  is intended to allow launchers to intercept
              build problems with  high  granularity.   Non-Makefile  generators
              currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              Makefile  generators  prefix  link  and  archive commands with the
              given launcher command line.  This is intended to allow  launchers
              to  intercept  build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile
              generators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_MESSAGES
              Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

              This property specifies whether Makefile generators should  add  a
              progress  message  describing  what  each build rule does.  If the
              property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
              disable  granular  messages  and  report  only as each target com&#8208;
              pletes.  This is intended to allow scripted builds  to  avoid  the
              build  time  cost  of  detailed reports.  If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES
              cache entry exists its value initializes the value of  this  prop&#8208;
              erty.  Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.


       TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
              Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.
&#12;              On AIX shared libraries may be named &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;.  This property
              is set to true on such platforms.


       TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
              Does the target platform support shared libraries.

              TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean  specifying  whether  the
              target  platform  supports shared libraries. Basically all current
              general general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embed&#8208;
              ded systems with no or special OSs.


       USE_FOLDERS
              Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.

              If  not  set,  CMake treats this property as OFF by default. CMake
              generators that are capable of  organizing  into  a  hierarchy  of
              folders use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those
              folders. See also the documentation for the  FOLDER  target  prop&#8208;
              erty.


       __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
              Internal property

              Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.


PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
       ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
              Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

              A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the &quot;make clean&quot;
              stage.


       CACHE_VARIABLES
              List of cache variables available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  cache  vari&#8208;
              ables currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


       CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
              Should the output of custom commands be left.

              If  this  is  true  then  the  outputs of custom commands for this
              directory will not be removed during the &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;  is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).
              This property will be initialized in each directory by  its  value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              This  property  will be initialized in each directory by its value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.



       DEFINITIONS
              For  CMake  2.4  compatibility  only.    Use   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              instead.

              This  read-only  property specifies the list of flags given so far
              to the add_definitions command.  It is intended for debugging pur&#8208;
              poses.  Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

              A  property  on  a  directory  that  indicates  if its targets are
              excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with  a
              Makefile  for  example  typing  make  will cause the targets to be
              built. The same concept applies to the default build of other gen&#8208;
              erators.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form
&#12;                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to


                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This  property  applies  to sources in all targets within a direc&#8208;
              tory.  The property value is initialized in each directory by  its
              value in the directory&apos;s parent.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This  property  specifies  the list of directories given so far to
              the include_directories command. This property exists on  directo&#8208;
              ries  and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from the
              include_directories command, values may be  set  directly  on  any
              directory  or  any target using the set_property command. A target
              gets its initial value for this property from  the  value  of  the
              directory  property.  A  directory gets its initial value from its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The  target  property values are used by the generators to set the
              include paths for the compiler. See also  the  include_directories
              command.


       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              Include file scanning regular expression.

              This read-only property specifies the regular expression used dur&#8208;
              ing dependency scanning to match include files that should be fol&#8208;
              lowed.  See the include_regular_expression command.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LINK_DIRECTORIES
              List of linker search directories.

              This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so
              far to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
              purposes.


       LISTFILE_STACK
              The current stack of listfiles being processed.

              This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
              CMake  scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently
              being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an INCLUDE com&#8208;
              mand  then  that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto
              the stack.


       MACROS List of macro commands available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  macros  cur&#8208;
              rently  defined.   It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the
              macro command.


       PARENT_DIRECTORY
              Source directory that added current subdirectory.

              This read-only property specifies the source directory that  added
              the  current  source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In
              the top-level directory the value is the empty-string.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
              A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

              If  you  specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
              processed when ctest is run on the directory.


       VARIABLES
              List of variables defined in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables cur&#8208;
              rently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME
              Old per-configuration target file base name.

              This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.  Use OUT&#8208;
              PUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.


       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the value of this prop&#8208;
              erty is appended to the target  file  name  built  on  disk.   For
              non-executable  targets, this property is initialized by the value
              of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a  target
              is  created.   This  property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
              and App Bundles.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  archive  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property is initialized by the value  of  the  variable  CMAKE_AR&#8208;
              CHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the base name for archive target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.


       AUTOMOC
              Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).

              AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle  the  Qt
              moc  preprocessor  automatically,  i.e.  without having to use the
              QT4_WRAP_CPP() macro. Currently Qt4 is supported. When this  prop&#8208;
              erty  is  set  to  TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build
              time and invoke moc accordingly. If  an  #include  statement  like
              #include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT class declaration is
              expected in the header, and moc is run on the header file.  If  an
              #include  statement  like  #include  &quot;foo.moc&quot;  is  found,  then a
              Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run  on
              the  file  itself.  Additionally,  all header files are parsed for
              Q_OBJECT macros, and if found,  moc  is  also  executed  on  those
              files.  The  resulting  moc files, which are not included as shown
              above in any of the source files are included in a generated &lt;tar&#8208;
              getname&gt;_automoc.cpp  file,  which is compiled as part of the tar&#8208;
              get.This property is initialized by  the  value  of  the  variable
              CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.


              Additional  command  line options for moc can be set via the AUTO&#8208;
              MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.


              By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE  variable  to  TRUE  the
              rules  for  searching the files which will be processed by moc can
              be relaxed. See the  documentation  for  this  variable  for  more
              details.


       AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional  options  for  moc  when using automoc (see the AUTOMOC
              property)

              This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is set to  TRUE
              for  this  target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
              options which will be used when moc is executed during the  build,
              i.e.  it  is  equivalent  to  the optional OPTIONS argument of the
              qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.


              By default it is empty.


       BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

              BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether  to  link
              the  target  in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
              precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
              before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is  set  when  a
              target is created.


       BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.

              If  a  module library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac.  It  will  have  the
              directory  structure  required for a CFBundle and will be suitable
              to be used for  creating  Browser  Plugins  or  other  application
              resources.


       BUNDLE_EXTENSION
              The file extension used to name a BUNDLE target on the Mac.

              The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also use &quot;plugin&quot; or what&#8208;
              ever file extension is required by the host app for your bundle.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.


       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used  to
              build  sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
              additional preprocessor definitions.


       DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See target property &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.

              This property is a special case of the more-general &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POST&#8208;
              FIX property for the DEBUG configuration.


       DEFINE_SYMBOL
              Define a symbol when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              DEFINE_SYMBOL  sets  the  name  of the preprocessor symbol defined
              when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set  here  then
              it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if
              the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for  head&#8208;
              ers  to  know  whether  they  are being included from inside their
              library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport  decora&#8208;
              tions.


       ENABLE_EXPORTS
              Specify  whether  an  executable exports symbols for loadable mod&#8208;
              ules.

              Normally an executable does not export any symbols because  it  is
              the  final  program.   It  is possible for an executable to export
              symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set
              to true CMake will allow other targets to &quot;link&quot; to the executable
              with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms  a  tar&#8208;
              get-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that
              link to it.  For DLL platforms an import library will  be  created
              for  the  exported  symbols  and  then used for linking.  All Win&#8208;
              dows-based  systems  including  Cygwin  are  DLL  platforms.   For
              non-DLL  platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link
              time, such as Mac OS X, the module will &quot;link&quot; to  the  executable
              using  a  flag like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;.  For other non-DLL platforms
              the link rule is simply ignored  since  the  dynamic  loader  will
              automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the target from the all target.

              A  property  on  a target that indicates if the target is excluded
              from the default build target. If it is not, then with a  Makefile
              for  example  typing  make will cause this target to be built. The
              same concept applies to the default  build  of  other  generators.
              Installing  a  target  with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has unde&#8208;
              fined behavior.


       EchoString
              A message to be displayed when the target is built.

              A message to display on some generators (such as  makefiles)  when
              the target is built.


       FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

              Targets  with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities
              in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same FOLDER  property
              value  will appear next to each other in a folder of that name. To
              nest folders, use FOLDER values such  as  &apos;GUI/Dialogs&apos;  with  &apos;/&apos;
              characters separating folder levels.


       FRAMEWORK
              This target is a framework on the Mac.

              If  a  shared library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a framework when built on the mac. It  will  have  the
              directory  structure required for a framework and will be suitable
              to be used with the -framework option


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source  files  in  a
              target  use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the cor&#8208;
              responding format flag to the compiler.  Use  the  source-specific
              Fortran_FORMAT  property to change the format of a specific source
              file.  If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when  a  target
              is created its value is used to initialize this property.


       Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Specify  output directory for Fortran modules provided by the tar&#8208;
              get.

              If the target contains Fortran source files that  provide  modules
              and the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies
              the directory in which the modules  will  be  placed.   When  this
              property is not set the modules will be placed in the build direc&#8208;
              tory corresponding to the target&apos;s source directory.  If the vari&#8208;
              able  CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY  is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated its value is used to initialize this property.


              Note that some compilers will automatically search the module out&#8208;
              put  directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will
              not.  If your sources USE modules their location must be specified
              by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.


       GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
              Generator&apos;s file for this target.

              An internal property used by some generators to record the name of
              project or dsp file associated with this target.


       GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              When linking a shared library or executable that  exports  symbols
              using  GNU  tools  on  Windows  (MinGW/MSYS)  with  Visual  Studio
              installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS  for&#8208;
              mat   (.lib).    Both   import  libraries  will  be  installed  by
              install(TARGETS) and exported by install(EXPORT) and  export()  to
              be linked by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.


              If  the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
              value is used to initialize this property.  The variable  must  be
              set  prior  to  the  first command that enables a language such as
              project() or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an
              option  to the user automatically when configuring on Windows with
              GNU tools.


       HAS_CXX
              Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

              This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
              See that property&apos;s documentation for details.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form


                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to
&#12;                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.


       IMPORTED
              Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

              The  boolean  value  of  this property is true for targets created
              with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It  is
              false for targets built within the project.


       IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
              Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

              Set  this  to  the  list  of  configuration names available for an
              IMPORTED target.  The names correspond to  configurations  defined
              in  the project from which the target is imported.  If the import&#8208;
              ing project uses a different set of configurations the  names  may
              be   mapped   using   the  MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_IMPLIB
              Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot;  part  of  a  windows  DLL.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
              Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

              Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries  as  part
              of  their  implementation.   On some platforms the linker searches
              for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including
              in  the  link.   Set this property to the list of dependent shared
              libraries of an imported library.  The  list  should  be  disjoint
              from  the  list of interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES property.  On platforms requiring dependent  shared
              libraries  to  be  found  at link time CMake uses this list to add
              appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.  If  set,  this  property  com&#8208;
              pletely  overrides  the  generic property for the named configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
              Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.

              Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to pro&#8208;
              duce  a  STATIC  IMPORTED  library  (such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;).  CMake
              accounts for these languages when computing how to link  a  target
              to  the  imported library.  For example, when a C executable links
              to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker  to
              satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library.


              This   property  is  ignored  for  targets  that  are  not  STATIC
              libraries.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when
              an IMPORTED library target  is  linked  to  another  target.   The
              libraries  will  be  included  on  the  link  line for the target.
              Unlike  the  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  property,   this   property
              applies  to all imported target types, including STATIC libraries.
              This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

              This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.

              If  set,  this  property completely overrides the generic property
              for the named configuration.


       IMPORTED_LOCATION
              Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.   For
              executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bun&#8208;
              dles on OS X this is the location of the  executable  file  inside
              Contents/MacOS  under  the  application bundle folder.  For static
              libraries and modules this is the location of the library or  mod&#8208;
              ule.   For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the loca&#8208;
              tion of the shared library.  For frameworks on OS X  this  is  the
              location  of  the  library  file symlink just inside the framework
              folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part  of  the
              library.   For  UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file
              to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets.
&#12;              Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the  configuration-specific
              property  IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  is set.  To get the location
              of an imported target read one of the LOCATION  or  LOCATION_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt; properties.


       IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
              Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no &quot;soname&quot;.

              Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that
              has  no  &quot;soname&quot; field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands
              for some platforms to prevent the linker from using  the  path  to
              the   library  in  place  of  its  missing  soname.   Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_SONAME
              The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

              Set  this  to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an imported shared library.
              This is meaningful  only  on  platforms  supporting  the  feature.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORT_PREFIX
              What comes before the import library name.

              Similar to  the  target  property  PREFIX,  but  used  for  import
              libraries  (typically  corresponding  to a DLL) instead of regular
              libraries. A target property that can be set to override the  pre&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       IMPORT_SUFFIX
              What comes after the import library name.

              Similar  to  the  target  property  SUFFIX,  but  used  for import
              libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL)  instead  of  regular
              libraries.  A target property that can be set to override the suf&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This property specifies the list of directories given  so  far  to
              the  include_directories command. This property exists on directo&#8208;
              ries and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from  the
              include_directories  command,  values  may  be set directly on any
              directory or any target using the set_property command.  A  target
              gets  its  initial  value  for this property from the value of the
              directory property. A directory gets its initial  value  from  its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The target property values are used by the generators to  set  the
              include  paths  for the compiler. See also the include_directories
              command.


       INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory  portion  of
              the  &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in
              the installed targets.


       INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed  targets (for platforms that support it).  This property
              is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if
              it is set when a target is created.


       INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH  is a boolean that if set to true will
              append directories in the  linker  search  path  and  outside  the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if  it  is
              set when a target is created.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

              Target label semantics are currently unspecified.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  library  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target
              is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the base name for library target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.


       LINKER_LANGUAGE
              Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

              For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the lan&#8208;
              guage  whose  compiler  is used to link the target (such as &quot;C&quot; or
              &quot;CXX&quot;).  A typical value for an executable is the language of  the
              source file providing the program entry point (main).  If not set,
              the language with the  highest  linker  preference  value  is  the
              default.    See  documentation  of  CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              variables.


       LINK_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

              Specifies a semicolon-separated list of  full-paths  to  files  on
              which  the  link  rule for this target depends.  The target binary
              will be linked if any of the named files is newer than it.


              This property  is  ignored  by  non-Makefile  generators.   It  is
              intended  to  specify  dependencies on &quot;linker scripts&quot; for custom
              Makefile link rules.


       LINK_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when linking this target.
&#12;              The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
              step  of  a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to the configura&#8208;
              tion &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDE&#8208;
              BINFO.


       LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              List  public  interface  libraries  for  a  shared library or exe&#8208;
              cutable.

              By default linking to a shared library target  transitively  links
              to  targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an exe&#8208;
              cutable with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no  default
              transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the
              default transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.   When
              the target is linked into another target the libraries listed (and
              recursively their link interface libraries) will  be  provided  to
              the  other  target  also.  If the list is empty then no transitive
              link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is  linked
              into  another  target  even if the default set is non-empty.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.  This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

              This  is  the  configuration-specific   version   of   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES.   If  set,  this property completely overrides the
              generic property for the named configuration.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

              When linking to a STATIC library target with  cyclic  dependencies
              the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in
              the strongly connected component of the dependency  graph.   CMake
              by  default  constructs the link line so that the linker will scan
              through the component at least twice.  This property specifies the
              minimum  number  of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake
              uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

              This is the configuration-specific version of  LINK_INTERFACE_MUL&#8208;
              TIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic
              property for the named configuration.


       LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
              End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds
              an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the
              linker search type back  to  its  starting  type.   This  property
              switches  the  final  linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of
              how it started.  See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.


       LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
              Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker
              search  type  is  assumed  to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the
              library list.  This property switches the assumption to  -Bstatic.
              It is intended for use when linking an executable statically (e.g.
              with the GNU -static option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.


       LOCATION
              Read-only location of a target on disk.

              For an imported target, this read-only property returns the  value
              of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.


              For a non-imported target, this property is provided for  compati&#8208;
              bility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location
              of an executable target&apos;s output file for use  in  add_custom_com&#8208;
              mand.   The  path may contain a build-system-specific portion that
              is replaced at build time with  the  configuration  getting  built
              (such  as  &quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot;  in  VS). In CMake 2.6 and above
              add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name  in  its
              COMMAND  and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
              CMake 2.8.4  and  above  add_custom_command  recognizes  generator
              expressions  to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
              Therefore this property is not needed  for  creating  custom  com&#8208;
              mands.


              Do  not  set properties that affect the location of a target after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.  Failure to follow this rule  is  not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

              A  read-only property that indicates where a target&apos;s main file is
              located on disk for the configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.  The  property  is
              defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported tar&#8208;
              get may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
              importing  project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
              otherwise uses an  arbitrary  available  configuration.   Use  the
              MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property  to map imported configura&#8208;
              tions explicitly.


              Do not set properties that affect the location of a  target  after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.   Failure  to follow this rule is not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

              When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac
              OS  X  will  be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a
              GUI executable that can be launched  from  the  Finder.   See  the
              MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST  target  property  for  information about
              creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.   This
              property   is   initialized   by   the   value   of  the  variable
              CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when a target is created.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.

              An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be  built  as
              an application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file
              is  created  by  configuring  a  template   called   MacOSXBundle&#8208;
              Info.plist.in  located  in  the  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property
              specifies an alternative template file name which may  be  a  full
              path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.

              An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a frame&#8208;
              work on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file  is  created  by
              configuring a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located
              in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an  alternative
              template file name which may be a full path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target&apos;s configuration.

              Set  this to the list of configurations of an imported target that
              may be used for  the  current  project&apos;s  &lt;CONFIG&gt;  configuration.
              Targets imported from another project may not provide the same set
              of configuration names available in the current project.   Setting
              this  property  tells CMake what imported configurations are suit&#8208;
              able for use when building the &lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration.  The  first
              configuration  in  the  list  found to be provided by the imported
              target is selected.  If this property is set and no matching  con&#8208;
              figurations  are available, then the imported target is considered
              to be not found.  This property is ignored for  non-imported  tar&#8208;
              gets.


       NO_SONAME
              Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking a shared library or module.

              Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library or mod&#8208;
              ule should not have &quot;soname&quot; set. Default is to  set  &quot;soname&quot;  on
              all  shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports
              it. Generally, use this property only for leaf  private  libraries
              or  plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other
              targets link against, on some platforms a  linker  will  insert  a
              full  path  to  the  library  (as specified at link time) into the
              dynamic  section  of  the  dependent   binary.   Therefore,   once
              installed,  dynamic  loader  may  eventually  fail  to  locate the
              library for the binary.


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES
              Target specific architectures for OS X.

              The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture
              for targets on OS X.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
              created.   Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the binary archi&#8208;
              tectures on a per-configuration basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an  upper-case
              name (ex: &quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.

              This  property is the configuration-specific version of OSX_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURES.


       OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for target files.

              This sets the base name for output files created for an executable
              or library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
              default.


       OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration target file base name.

              This is the configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.


       POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              Whether to create a position-independent target

              The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines whether position
              independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
              property is true by default for SHARED and MODULE library  targets
              and false otherwise.


       POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The  PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL  com&#8208;
              mand instead.
&#12;
       PREFIX What comes before the library name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
              &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.


       PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are  the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS  command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL com&#8208;
              mand instead.


       PRIVATE_HEADER
              Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  PrivateHeaders  directory  inside  the  framework folder.  On
              non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the  PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       PROJECT_LABEL
              Change the name of a target in an IDE.

              Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
              Studio.


       PUBLIC_HEADER
              Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  Headers  directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
              platforms these headers may be installed using  the  PUBLIC_HEADER
              option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RESOURCE
              Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This  property  may  be set to a list of files to be placed in the
              Resources directory inside the  framework  folder.   On  non-Apple
              platforms  these  files may be installed using the RESOURCE option
              to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.
&#12;       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the directory into which runtime target
              files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS,  Xcode)
              append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory to the specified direc&#8208;
              tory.  There are three kinds of target files that  may  be  built:
              archive,  library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as
              runtime targets. Static libraries are always  treated  as  archive
              targets.  Module  libraries are always treated as library targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets.  For  DLL  platforms  the  DLL  part  of a shared library is
              treated as a runtime target and the corresponding  import  library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value  of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set
              when a target is created.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target files.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but  multi-configuration  generators  (VS,  Xcode) do NOT append a
              per-configuration subdirectory to the specified  directory.   This
              property  is  initialized  by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN&#8208;
              TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is  cre&#8208;
              ated.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the base name for runtime target files.
              It  overrides  OUTPUT_NAME  and  OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  properties.
              There  are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive,
              library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as  runtime
              targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive targets.
              Module libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets.  For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime  target and the corresponding import library is treated as
              an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin  are
              DLL platforms.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.


       SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

              SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
              generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from  the  build
              tree.   This  property is initialized by the value of the variable
              CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.


       SOURCES
              Source names specified for a target.
&#12;              Read-only list of sources  specified  for  a  target.   The  names
              returned  are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_proper&#8208;
              ties command.


       SOVERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  SOVERSION  is  ignored  if NO_SONAME property is set. For
              shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION  attribute
              is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version number. These numbers
              are used as the image version of the binary.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
              Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

              Extra flags to use when linking a static library.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration flags for creating a static library.

              This     is     the     configuration-specific     version      of
              STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.


       SUFFIX What comes after the target name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
              &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of a library, module or executable.


       TYPE   The type of the target.

              This read-only property can be used to test the type of the  given
              target.   It   will  be  one  of  STATIC_LIBRARY,  MODULE_LIBRARY,
              SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.


       VERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  For  executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
              version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are cre&#8208;
              ated  if  the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and
              executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to  extract
              a  &quot;major.minor&quot;  version  number.  These  numbers are used as the
              image version of the binary.


       VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio managed project .NET references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to  a  gener&#8208;
              ated  Visual  Studio  project.  For  example,  &quot;System;System.Win&#8208;
              dows.Forms&quot;.


       VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;
              Visual Studio project-specific global variable.
&#12;              Tell the Visual  Studio  generator  to  set  the  global  variable
              &apos;&lt;variable&gt;&apos;  to  a  given  value  in  the generated Visual Studio
              project. Ignored on other generators. Qt integration works  better
              if  VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.
              For example, &quot;4.7.3&quot;


       VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Sets  the  &quot;keyword&quot;  attribute  for  a  generated  Visual  Studio
              project.  Defaults  to  &quot;Win32Proj&quot;. You may wish to override this
              value with &quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio managed
              C++ unit test project.


       VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
              Visual Studio project type(s).

              Can  be  set  to  one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
              indicate the type of project. This value is copied  verbatim  into
              the generated project file. Example for a managed C++ unit testing
              project:


               {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

              UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.


       VS_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Can be set to change the visual studio  keyword,  for  example  QT
              integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.


       VS_SCC_AUXPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
              property.


       VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code  control  local
              path property.


       VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
              name property.


       VS_SCC_PROVIDER
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

              Can be set  to  change  the  visual  studio  source  code  control
              provider property.


       VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
              Visual  Studio project C++/CX language extensions for Windows Run&#8208;
              time

              Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.
&#12;       VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a  gener&#8208;
              ated   Visual   Studio   project.   For   example,   &quot;Windows;Win&#8208;
              dows.UI.Core&quot;.


       WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

              When this property is set to true the executable  when  linked  on
              Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of
              just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead  of  a  console
              application.   See  the  CMAKE_MFC_FLAG  variable documentation to
              configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.   This  property  is
              initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if
              it is set when a target is created.


       XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;
              Set Xcode target attributes directly.

              Tell the Xcode generator to set &apos;&lt;an-attribute&gt;&apos; to a given  value
              in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.


PROPERTIES ON TESTS
       ATTACHED_FILES
              Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

              Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and sub&#8208;
              mitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.


       ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
              Attach a list of files to  a  dashboard  submission  if  the  test
              fails.

              Same  as  ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if
              the test does not pass.


       COST   Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test  set  will  be
              run in descending order of cost.

              This property describes the cost of a test. You can explicitly set
              this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.


       DEPENDS
              Specifies that this test should only be run  after  the  specified
              list of tests.

              Set  this  to a list of tests that must finish before this test is
              run.


       ENVIRONMENT
              Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a
              test.

              If  set  to a list of environment variables and values of the form
              MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while run&#8208;
              ning  the  test. The environment is restored to its previous state
              after the test is done.


       FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

              If set, if the output matches one  of  specified  regular  expres&#8208;
              sions,  the  test  will  fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              &quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

              The list is reported in dashboard submissions.


       MEASUREMENT
              Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

              If set to a name then that name will be reported  to  CDASH  as  a
              named  measurement with a value of 1. You may also specify a value
              by setting MEASUREMENT to &quot;measurement=value&quot;.


       PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              The output must match this regular  expression  for  the  test  to
              pass.

              If set, the test output will be checked against the specified reg&#8208;
              ular expressions and at least one of the regular  expressions  has
              to match, otherwise the test will fail.


       PROCESSORS
              How many process slots this test requires

              Denotes the number of processors that this test will require. This
              is typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction
              with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.


       REQUIRED_FILES
              List of files required to run the test.

              If  set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of
              the files exist.


       RESOURCE_LOCK
              Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

              If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaran&#8208;
              teed not to run concurrently.


       RUN_SERIAL
              Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

              Use  this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
              option to specify that this test should not  be  run  in  parallel
              with any other tests.


       TIMEOUT
              How many seconds to allow for this test.

              This  property  if set will limit a test to not take more than the
              specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds  that  the  test
              process  will be killed and ctest will move to the next test. This
              setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.


       WILL_FAIL
              If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

              This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail  and
              return a non zero return code.
&#12;       WORKING_DIRECTORY
              The directory from which the test executable will be called.

              If  this  is not set it is called from the directory the test exe&#8208;
              cutable is located in.


PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
       ABSTRACT
              Is this source file an abstract class.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file rep&#8208;
              resents  a  class that is abstract. This only makes sense for lan&#8208;
              guages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
              by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

              The  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  property may be set to a semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated list of preprocessor definitions using  the  syntax  VAR  or
              VAR=value.   Function-style  definitions are not supported.  CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system  (note  that  CMake  language syntax may require escapes to
              specify some values).  This property may be set on a  per-configu&#8208;
              ration  basis  using  the  name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).


              CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are  not  sup&#8208;
              ported  by  the  native  build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).   Xcode  does  not
              support per-configuration definitions on source files.


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              Note  that  Xcode  does  not support per-configuration source file
              flags so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.


       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

              These flags will be added to the list of compile flags  when  this
              source  file  builds.   Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional
              preprocessor definitions.


       EXTERNAL_OBJECT
              If set to true then this is an object file.

              If this property is set to true then the source file is really  an
              object  file  and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked
              into the target though.


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
              fixed-format  or  free-format.   CMake will pass the corresponding
              format flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide  For&#8208;
              tran_FORMAT  property  if  all  source files in a target share the
              same format.


       GENERATED
              Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

              If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will han&#8208;
              dle  it differently in terms of dependency checking etc. Otherwise
              having a non-existent source file could create problems.


       HEADER_FILE_ONLY
              Is this source file only a header file.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
              header  file  with no associated implementation. This is set auto&#8208;
              matically based on the file extension and  is  used  by  CMake  to
              determine is certain dependency information should be computed.


       KEEP_EXTENSION
              Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

              If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
              will be the same as that of the source file. Normally  the  output
              file  extension  is  computed  based on the language of the source
              file, for example .cxx will go to a .o extension.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

              This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
              target  whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
              currently specified.


       LANGUAGE
              What programming language is the file.

              A property that can be set to indicate what  programming  language
              the  source  file  is. If it is not set the language is determined
              based on the file extension. Typical values are CXX C etc. Setting
              this  property for a file means this file will be compiled. Do not
              set this for header or files that should not be compiled.


       LOCATION
              The full path to a source file.

              A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full  path
              to the source file.


       MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
              Place  a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle, CFBundle, or frame&#8208;
              work.

              Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set  are  built
              as  Mac  OS  X  application  bundles  on  Apple platforms.  Shared
              library targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built  as  Mac
              OS  X  frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
              the BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles  on
              Apple  platforms.   Source  files  listed  in the target with this
              property set will be copied to a directory inside  the  bundle  or
              framework  content  folder  specified  by the property value.  For
              bundles the content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;.   For  frame&#8208;
              works the content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;.
              For  cfbundles  the  content  folder  is  &quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Contents&quot;
              (unless  the  extension  is changed).  See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for  specifying  files
              meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or Resources directories.


       OBJECT_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

              Specifies  a  semicolon-separated  list  of full-paths to files on
              which any object files compiled from this source file depend.   An
              object  file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer
              than it.


              This property need not be used to  specify  the  dependency  of  a
              source file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although
              the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is  no
              longer  necessary.   If  the generated header file is created by a
              custom command in the same target as the source  file,  the  auto&#8208;
              matic  dependency  scanning process will recognize the dependency.
              If the generated header file is  created  by  another  target,  an
              inter-target  dependency  should be created with the add_dependen&#8208;
              cies command (if one does not already exist due to  linking  rela&#8208;
              tionships).


       OBJECT_OUTPUTS
              Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

              Additional  outputs created by compilation of this source file. If
              any of these outputs is missing the  object  will  be  recompiled.
              This  is supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored
              on other generators.


       SYMBOLIC
              Is this just a name for a rule.

              If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true  the  build  system  will  be
              informed  that the source file is not actually created on disk but
              instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.


       WRAP_EXCLUDE
              Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

              Some packages can wrap source files into  alternate  languages  to
              provide  additional  functionality.  For  example, C++ code can be
              wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
              set  to  true  (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should
              not be wrapped.


PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
       ADVANCED
              True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

              This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
              interesting     only     for    advanced    configuration.     The
              mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.
&#12;
       HELPSTRING
              Help associated with entry in GUIs.

              This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help  users  set
              it through a CMake GUI.


       MODIFIED
              Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

              This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
              interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.


       STRINGS
              Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

              For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of  val&#8208;
              ues.   CMake  GUIs  may  use  this  to  provide a selection widget
              instead of a generic string entry field.  This is for  convenience
              only.   CMake does not enforce that the value matches one of those
              listed.


       TYPE   Widget type for entry in GUIs.

              Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present wid&#8208;
              gets  to  help  users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a
              hint to determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:


                BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
                PATH          = Path to a directory.
                FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
                STRING        = Generic string value.
                INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
                STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
                UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

              Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by  the  command
              which creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).


       VALUE  Value of a cache entry.

              This  property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting
              this property always sets the value without checking, so use  with
              care.
