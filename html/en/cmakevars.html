NAME
       cmakevars - Reference of CMake variables.


VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
       variables  defined by cmake, that give information about the project, and
       cmake


       CMAKE_AR
              Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

              This specifies name of the program that creates archive or  static
              libraries.


       CMAKE_ARGC
              Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

              When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number
              of command line arguments. See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...


       CMAKE_ARGV0
              Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

              When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the  first
              command line argument. It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
              ... and so on, up to the number of command line  arguments  given.
              See also CMAKE_ARGC.


       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the top level of the build tree.

              This  is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
              tree.  For  an  in-source  build,  this  would  be  the  same   as
              CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
              Tool used for the actual build process.

              This  variable  is set to the program that will be needed to build
              the output of CMake.   If the generator selected was Visual Studio
              6,  the  CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles
              it will be set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to
              devenv.   For Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be use&#8208;
              ful for adding special flags and commands based on the final build
              environment.


       CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
              The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

              This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt
              file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
              Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file
&#12;              This is stores the major version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
              Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This is stores the minor version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
              Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This is stores the patch version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
              Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

              For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
              build  tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a ref&#8208;
              erence to  a  build-time  variable  specifying  the  name  of  the
              per-configuration  output  subdirectory.   On  Makefile generators
              this evaluates to &quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
              build tree.  Example values:


                $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
                $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
                $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
                $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
                .                = Make-based tools

              Since  these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
              variable is suitable only for use in command lines  that  will  be
              evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:


                add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
                add_custom_command(
                  OUTPUT out.txt
                  COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
                  DEPENDS mytool in.txt
                  )
                add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

              Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose
              but has  been  left  for  compatibility  with  existing  projects.
              Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in
              its        COMMAND        option,         so         &quot;${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot;  can  be  replaced by
              just &quot;mytool&quot;.


              This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
              multi-configuration  build  systems  the value of this variable is
              passed as the value of preprocessor symbol &quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot;  to  the
              compilation of all source files.
&#12;       CMAKE_COMMAND
              The full path to the cmake executable.

              This  is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is use&#8208;
              ful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option  for
              portable system commands. (e.g. /usr/local/bin/cmake


       CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
              Is CMake currently cross compiling.

              This  variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross com&#8208;
              piling. Specifically if the build platform is different  from  the
              target platform.


       CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
              Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.

              This  is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is use&#8208;
              ful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option  for
              portable system commands.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

              This  the full path to the build directory that is currently being
              processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will
              create  a  binary  directory in the build tree, and as it is being
              processed this variable will be set. For in-source builds this  is
              the current source directory being processed.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
              Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set to the directory where the  listfile  which  is
              currently  being  processed  (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located.
              The value has dynamic scope.  When CMake  starts  processing  com&#8208;
              mands  in  a  source  file  it sets this variable to the directory
              where this file is located.  When CMake finishes  processing  com&#8208;
              mands from the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the
              value of the variable inside a macro or function is the  directory
              of  the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not
              the directory of the file containing the macro or function defini&#8208;
              tion.


              See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
              Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set to the  one  currently  being  processed.   The
              value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in
              a source file it sets this variable to the location of  the  file.
              When  CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores
              the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside  a
              macro  or  function  is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on
              the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function def&#8208;
              inition.
&#12;
              See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
              The line number of the current file being processed.

              This  is  the line number of the file currently being processed by
              cmake.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
              The path to the source directory currently being processed.

              This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
              processed by cmake.


       CMAKE_DL_LIBS
              Name of library containing dlopen and dlcose.

              The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in it, usually
              -ldl on most UNIX machines.


       CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
              Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.

              This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
              edit the cache.  For example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.


       CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
              The suffix for executables on this platform.

              The  suffix  to  use  for the end of an executable if any, .exe on
              Windows.


              CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this for language &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
              The extra generator used to build the project.

              When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop  generators,  CMake
              generates  Makefiles  (CMAKE_GENERATOR)  and  additionally project
              files for the respective IDE. This IDE project file  generator  is
              stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).


       CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
              Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

              Extensions  for  shared  libraries  other  than  that specified by
              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
              external  shared library files during analysis of libraries linked
              by a target.


       CMAKE_GENERATOR
              The generator used to build the project.

              The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
              files.  (e.g. &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;, &quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)
&#12;
       CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
              Path to top of source tree.

              This is the path to the top level of the source tree.

              The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

              The  prefix  to  use  for the name of an import library if used on
              this platform.


              CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for import  libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of an import library if used on this
              platform.


              CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a library, .lib on Windows.


       CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION
              The Major version of cmake (i.e. the 2 in 2.X.X)

              This  specifies  the  major  version of the CMake executable being
              run.


       CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
              See CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.

              This  variable  is  around  for   backwards   compatibility,   see
              CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.


       CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION
              The Minor version of cmake (i.e. the 4 in X.4.X).

              This  specifies  the  minor  version of the CMake executable being
              run.


       CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
              Full path to the parent listfile of the one currently  being  pro&#8208;
              cessed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set  to  the  listfile  that  included  or  somehow
              invoked  the  one  currently  being processed. See also CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_LIST_FILE.
&#12;       CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION

              This specifies the patch version of  the  CMake  executable  being
              run.


       CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME
              The name of the current project.

              This specifies name of the current project from the closest inher&#8208;
              ited PROJECT command.


       CMAKE_RANLIB
              Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.

              This specifies name of the program that  randomizes  libraries  on
              UNIX, not used on Windows, but may be present.


       CMAKE_ROOT
              Install directory for running cmake.

              This  is  the  install  root for the running CMake and the Modules
              directory can be found here. This is commonly used in this format:
              ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules


       CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
              Full path to the -P script file currently being processed.

              When  run  in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the full
              path of the script file. When run to  configure  a  CMakeLists.txt
              file, this variable is not set.


       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
              The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib on UNIX.


              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a shared library,  .dll  on  Win&#8208;
              dows.


              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX
              The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

              The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this  plat&#8208;
              form.


              CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;   overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX
              The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module on  this  plat&#8208;
              form


              CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;   overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
              Size of a void pointer.

              This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and is deter&#8208;
              mined  by  a  try  compile.  If  a  64 bit size is found, then the
              library search path is modified  to  look  for  64  bit  libraries
              first.


       CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
              If true, do not add run time path information.

              If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
              compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information  if
              the  platform  supports it.  This allows for easy running from the
              build tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the  build
              step, use CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.


       CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
              The path to the top level of the source tree.

              This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
              tree.  For  an  in-source  build,  this  would  be  the  same   as
              CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.


       CMAKE_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
              Libraries linked into every executable and shared library.

              This is the list of libraries that are linked into all executables
              and libraries.


       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX
              The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

              The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib on UNIX.


              CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

              The  suffix  to  use for the end of a static library, .lib on Win&#8208;
              dows.


              CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
              The tweak version of cmake (i.e. the 1 in X.X.X.1).

              This  specifies  the  tweak  version of the CMake executable being
              run.  Releases use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development  versions  use
              the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak level.


       CMAKE_USING_VC_FREE_TOOLS
              True if free visual studio tools being used.

              This is set to true if the compiler is Visual Studio free tools.


       CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
              Create verbose makefiles if on.

              This variable defaults to false. You can set this variable to true
              to make CMake produce verbose makefiles  that  show  each  command
              line as it is used.


       CMAKE_VERSION
              The  full  version of cmake in major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] for&#8208;
              mat.

              This specifies the full version of the CMake executable being run.
              This  variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and higher.  See vari&#8208;
              ables CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION,  CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION,  CMAKE_PATCH_VER&#8208;
              SION,  and  CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual version components.
              The [-id] component appears in non-release  versions  and  may  be
              arbitrary text.


       PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
              Full path to build directory for project.

              This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT command.


       PROJECT_NAME
              Name of the project given to the project command.

              This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT command.


       PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
              Top level source directory for the current project.

              This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT command.


       [Project name]_BINARY_DIR
              Top level binary directory for the named project.

              A  variable  is created with the name used in the PROJECT command,
              and is the binary directory for the project.   This can be  useful
              when SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.


       [Project name]_SOURCE_DIR
              Top level source directory for the named project.
&#12;              A  variable  is created with the name used in the PROJECT command,
              and is the source directory for the project.   This can be  useful
              when add_subdirectory is used to connect several projects.


VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
       BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
              Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

              If  present  and  true,  this will cause all libraries to be built
              shared unless  the  library  was  explicitly  added  as  a  static
              library.  This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so
              that each user of a project can decide if they want to  build  the
              project using shared or static libraries.


       CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
              List  of files which have been installed using  an ABSOLUTE DESTI&#8208;
              NATION path.

              This variable is defined  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts.  It  can  be  used  (read-only) by program or script that
              source those install scripts. This is used by some  CPack  genera&#8208;
              tors (e.g. RPM).


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
              Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

              By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the documenta&#8208;
              tion of the AUTOMOC target property.  When set to TRUE, it accepts
              more  input  and tries to find the correct input file for moc even
              if it differs from the documented behaviour. In this mode it  e.g.
              also  checks  whether a header file is intended to be processed by
              moc when a &quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.


              Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.


       CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
              Version of cmake required to build project

              From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this  specifies
              what  version  of CMake should be supported. By default this value
              is the version number of CMake that you are running. You  can  set
              this  to  an older version of CMake to support deprecated commands
              of CMake in projects that were written to use  older  versions  of
              CMake.  This  can  be set by the user or set at the beginning of a
              CMakeLists file.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
              Specifies the build type for make based generators.

              This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possi&#8208;
              ble  values  are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSiz&#8208;
              eRel. This variable is only supported for make  based  generators.
              If  this  variable is supported, then CMake will also provide ini&#8208;
              tial    values    for    the    variables    with     the     name
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For exam&#8208;
              ple, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then  CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG  will
              be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.


       CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
              Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.
&#12;              When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
              Default is ON.


       CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
              Specifies the available build types.

              This specifies what build types will be available such  as  Debug,
              Release,  RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most
              platforms. But can be extended to provide other build  types.  See
              also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.


       CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;
              Variable for disabling find_package() calls.

              Every  non-REQUIRED  find_package()  call in a project can be dis&#8208;
              abled by setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Package&#8208;
              Name&gt;  to  TRUE.  This  can  be used to build a project without an
              optional package, although that package is installed.


              This switch should be used during the initial CMake run. Otherwise
              if the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
              variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.
              In  the  case  it is recommended to remove the cache variables for
              this package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U


       CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file with
              absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              The  fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offend&#8208;
              ing file takes place. This variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated
              cmake_install.cmake scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while
              running the script, it may  get  fatal  error  messages  from  the
              script.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
              Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

              This  specifies  what  prefixes  to  add to library names when the
              find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX systems this  is
              typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
              will look for libfoo.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
              Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

              This specifies what suffixes to add  to  library  names  when  the
              find_library  command looks for libraries. On Windows systems this
              is typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to  find  the
              foo library it will look for foo.dll etc.


       CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
              Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.

              If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
              CONFIG  or  NO_MODULE)  and  no  Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake  module   is   in
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH  then  CMake  implicitly assumes that the caller
              intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
              configuration  file  is found then the wording of the failure mes&#8208;
              sage must account for both the case that  the  package  is  really
              missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed to pro&#8208;
              vide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an
              explicit  mode  option  then  the failure message can be more spe&#8208;
              cific.


              Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package
              to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps devel&#8208;
              opers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package
              within a project.


       CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would  normally  search.  By default this is empty; it is
              intended to be set by the  project.  Note  that  CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              takes  a  list  of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you
              want to ignore paths under prefixes  (bin,  include,  lib,  etc.),
              you&apos;ll  need  to  specify  them  explicitly.  See  also CMAKE_PRE&#8208;
              FIX_PATH,   CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,   CMAKE_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will  be  used  both by FIND_FILE() and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories  for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
              By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by  the  project.
              See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
              Default component used in install() commands.

              If  an  install()  command is used without the COMPONENT argument,
              these files will be grouped into a default component. The name  of
              this  default  install component will be taken from this variable.
              It defaults to &quot;Unspecified&quot;.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
              Install directory used by install.

              If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,  this  directory
              is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults
              to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will   be   used   by   FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY()  will  check  each of the contained directories for
              the existence of the  library  which  is  currently  searched.  By
              default  it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See
              also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
              Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.
&#12;              This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will  enable  MFC  in
              the  application.  It should be set to 1 for static the static MFC
              library, and 2 for the shared MFC library.  This is used in visual
              studio 6 and 7 project files.   The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and
              the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:


              add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)


              set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)


              add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})



       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
              List of directories to search for CMake modules.

              Commands like include() and find_package()  search  for  files  in
              directories  listed  by  this variable before checking the default
              modules that come with CMake.


       CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
              Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

              This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake  to  tell
              CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.


       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;
              Default  for  CMake  Policy  CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;  when  it is otherwise left
              unset.

              Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION)
              by  default  leave  policies  introduced  after  the given version
              unset.  Set CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to  spec&#8208;
              ify  the  default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where &lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy
              number.


              This variable should not be set by a project in  CMake  code;  use
              cmake_policy(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this vari&#8208;
              able       in       the       cache       (e.g.       -DCMAKE_POL&#8208;
              ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy not otherwise set
              by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a policy warning while  using
              old behavior or to NEW to try building the project with new behav&#8208;
              ior.


       CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include .  By  default  it  is
              empty,  it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().
&#12;              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence of the program which is currently searched. By default it is
              empty, it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See  also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
              Don&apos;t make the install target depend on the all target.

              By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on the &quot;all&quot; target. This
              has the effect, that when &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL  is
              built,  first  the  &quot;all&quot;  target  is built, then the installation
              starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE,  this
              dependency  is not created, so the installation process will start
              immediately, independent from whether the project  has  been  com&#8208;
              pletely built or not.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would normally search. By default this contains a list of
              directories containing incompatible binaries for the host  system.
              See   also   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies a path which  will  be  used  both  by  FIND_FILE()  and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories for the existence of the file which is currently  searched.
              By  default  it  contains the standard directories for the current
              system. It is NOT intended to be  modified  by  the  project,  use
              CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies   a   path   which   will  be  used  by  FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the  contained  directories  for
              the  existence  of  the  library  which  is currently searched. By
              default it contains the standard directories for the current  sys&#8208;
              tem.  It  is  NOT  intended  to  be  modified  by the project, use
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default this con&#8208;
              tains  the  standard directories for the current system. It is NOT
              intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH  for
              this.     See     also    CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH,    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,   and    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_IGNORE_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence  of  the  program which is currently searched. By default it
              contains the standard directories for the current  system.  It  is
              NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
              Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

              CMake loads the specified file while  enabling  support  for  each
              language  from either the project() or enable_language() commands.
              It is loaded after CMake&apos;s builtin compiler and platform  informa&#8208;
              tion  modules have been loaded but before the information is used.
              The file  may  set  platform  information  variables  to  override
              CMake&apos;s defaults.


              This  feature  is  intended for use only in overriding information
              variables that must be set before  CMake  builds  its  first  test
              project  to  check  that  the  compiler  for a language works.  It
              should not be used to load a file in cases that a normal include()
              will  work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot
              be  achieved  any  other  way.    For   example,   one   may   set
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT  to change the default value used to initialize
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.  The override file  should  NOT
              be  used  to  set  anything  that could be set after languages are
              enabled, such  as  variables  like  CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              that  affect  the  placement  of binaries.  Information set in the
              file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds too.


       CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with abso&#8208;
              lute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              This  variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while running the script,
              it may get warning messages from the script.


VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM
       APPLE  True if running on Mac OSX.

              Set to true on Mac OSX.


       BORLAND
              True if the borland compiler is being used.

              This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being used.


       CMAKE_CL_64
              Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft

              Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
              Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

              Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Micro&#8208;
              soft.


       CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
              True for Apple OSXoperating systems.

              Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is being run on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system  instead  of  the
              target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of
              the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
              True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

              Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE
              and CYGWIN).


       CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
              True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

              This is the value of CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected
              for one of the enabled languages.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
              Regex matching  possible  target  architecture  library  directory
              names.

              This  is used to detect CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the
              implicit linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.


       CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
              Maximum object file  full-path  length  allowed  by  native  build
              tools.

              CMake  computes  for every source file an object file name that is
              unique to the source file and deterministic with  respect  to  the
              full  path  to the source file.  This allows multiple source files
              in a target to share the same name if they lie in different direc&#8208;
              tories  without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However,
              it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so  CMake  shortens
              the  path  using  a hashing scheme when the full path to an object
              file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for  each  plat&#8208;
              form  that  is  sufficient for common tools, but some native tools
              may have a lower limit.  This variable may be set to  specify  the
              limit explicitly.  The value must be an integer no less than 128.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is compiling for.

              This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_VERSION,  like  this  ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VER&#8208;
              SION}.  If  CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION  is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is
              the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is building for.

              This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is target&#8208;
              ing.    On  systems  that have the uname command, this variable is
              set to the output of uname -s.  Linux, Windows,   and  Darwin  for
              Mac OSX are the values found  on the big three operating systems.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

              On  systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output
              of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the  environment
              variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is building for.

              A  numeric  version string for the system, on systems that support
              uname, this variable is set to the output of uname  -r.  On  other
              systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.


       CYGWIN True for cygwin.

              Set to true when using CYGWIN.


       MSVC   True when using Microsoft Visual C

              Set  to true when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual
              C.


       MSVC80 True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0

              Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of  Microsoft  Visual
              C.


       MSVC_IDE
              True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE

              Set  to  true  when  the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C
              IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.
&#12;       MSVC_VERSION
              The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.

              Known version numbers are:


                1200 = VS  6.0
                1300 = VS  7.0
                1310 = VS  7.1
                1400 = VS  8.0
                1500 = VS  9.0
                1600 = VS 10.0


       UNIX   True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

              Set to true when the target system is  UNIX  or  UNIX  like  (i.e.
              APPLE and CYGWIN).


       WIN32  True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the target system is Windows.


       XCODE_VERSION
              Version of Xcode (Xcode generator only).

              Under  the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as speci&#8208;
              fied in &quot;Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist&quot; (such as &quot;3.1.2&quot;).


VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
       CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Default filename postfix for libraries under  configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  a non-executable target is created its &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX tar&#8208;
              get property is initialized with the value of this variable if  it
              is set.


       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC
              Whether to handle moc automatically for Qt targets.

              This  variable  is  used to initialize the AUTOMOC property on all
              the targets. See that target property for additional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional options for moc when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTOMOC).

              This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS  prop&#8208;
              erty  on  all the targets. See that target property for additional
              information.


       CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Use the install path for the RPATH

              Normally CMake uses the build tree for  the  RPATH  when  building
              executables  etc  on  systems that use RPATH. When the software is
              installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake  to  have  the
              install  RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software
              is always built with the install path for the RPATH and  does  not
              need to be relinked when installed.


       CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.

              This  variable  is  a special case of the more-general CMAKE_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
              Linker flags used to create executables.

              Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE]
              Flag used when linking an executable.

              Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating  exe&#8208;
              cutables.


       CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Fortran module output directory.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              This  variable  is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property on tar&#8208;
              gets when they are created.  See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
              Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
              include path.

              If this variable is enabled,  CMake  automatically  adds  in  each
              directory     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}     and     ${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path  for  this  directory.  These
              additional  include directories do not propagate down to subdirec&#8208;
              tories. This is useful  mainly  for  out-of-source  builds,  where
              files  generated into the build tree are included by files located
              in the source tree.


              By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the  INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              property  on all targets. See that target property for more infor&#8208;
              mation.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed targets (for platforms that support it). This is used to
              initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
              will  append directories in the linker search path and outside the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is used to initialize the  tar&#8208;
              get property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
              The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.

              The  flag  used to specify a library directory to the compiler. On
              most compilers this is &quot;-L&quot;.


       CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG
              Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.

              The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll  on  Windows,
              this is only defined on Windows.


       CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Default value for LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

              The  flag  used before a library file path is given to the linker.
              This is needed only on very few platforms.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library into an executable.

              The flag used to specify a library to link to an  executable.   On
              most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.


       CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
              Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

              When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installa&#8208;
              tion than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a  builtin  editor
              to  change  the  RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is
              set to true then CMake will relink the binary before  installation
              instead of using its builtin editor.


       CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_FLAGS
              Default value for POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is always built with no RPATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is  always  installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
              building.  This can be useful for example to allow  running  tests
              from  the  build directory with RPATH enabled before the installa&#8208;
              tion step.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
              CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.


       CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
              Build configuration used for try_compile and try_run projects.

              Projects  built by try_compile and try_run are built synchronously
              during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a  specific  build
              configuration  must  be  chosen even if the generated build system
              supports multiple configurations.


       CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
              Use relative paths (May not work!).

              If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake  will  use  relative  paths
              between  the source and binary tree. This option does not work for
              more complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possi&#8208;
              ble.  In general, it is not possible to move CMake generated make&#8208;
              files to a different location regardless  of  the  value  of  this
              variable.


       CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Default value for WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE property
              on all the targets. See that target property for additional infor&#8208;
              mation.


       EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old executable location variable.

              The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this vari&#8208;
              able for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are  otherwise
              placed in this directory.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old library location variable.

              The   target   properties  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,  LIBRARY_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede  this  vari&#8208;
              able  for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise
              placed in this directory.


VARIABLES FOR LANGUAGES
       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND
              Rule variable to append to a static archive.

              This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append to a static
              archive.     It    is   used   in   place   of   CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE&#8208;

              This is the command that will be used as the &lt;LANG&gt; compiler. Once
              set, you can not change this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ABI
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This  is  used  in  determining the compiler ABI and is subject to

       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION
              An internal variable subject to change.

              Compiler  version  in  major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This
              variable is reserved for internal use by CMake and is not  guaran&#8208;
              teed to be set.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILE_OBJECT
              Rule variable to compile a single object file.

              This  is  a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile a single

       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
              File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

              This  is  a  list of file extensions that may be part of a project
              for a given language but are not compiled.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

              CMake does not explicitly specify these  directories  on  compiler
              command  lines  for language &lt;LANG&gt;.  This prevents system include
              directories from being treated as user include directories on some
              compilers.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
              Implicit linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              Compilers  typically  pass directories containing language runtime
              libraries and default library search  paths  when  they  invoke  a
              linker.   These  paths  are implicit linker search directories for
              the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects these direc&#8208;
              tories for each language and reports the results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
              Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              Compilers  typically pass language runtime library names and other
              flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags  are  implicit  link
              options  for the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects
              these libraries and  flags  for  each  language  and  reports  the
              results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name detected for &lt;lang&gt;.

              If  the  &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an architecture-spe&#8208;
              cific system library search directory such as  &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt;
              this variable contains the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              Preference value for linker language selection.

              The  &quot;linker  language&quot; for executable, shared library, and module
              targets is the language whose compiler  will  invoke  the  linker.
              The  LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.
              Otherwise, the linker language is  that  whose  linker  preference
              value is highest among languages compiled and linked into the tar&#8208;
              get.  See also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES vari&#8208;
              able.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
              True if CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

              This  is  used  when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
              Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.
              A  language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
              considered if this variable is true.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE
              Rule variable to link and executable.

              Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
              Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

              This is the extension for an object file for the given &lt;LANG&gt;. For
              example .obj for C on Windows.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
              Size of pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This  holds  the  size  (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the
              target platform ABI.  It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
              Extensions of source files for the given language.

              This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt;
              True if the compiler is GNU.

              If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU compiler then  this  is
              TRUE, if not it is FALSE.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
              Fortran default module output directory.

              Most  Fortran  compilers  write  .mod files to the current working
              directory.  For those that do not, this is set  to  &quot;.&quot;  and  used
              when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property is not set.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
              Fortran flag for module output directory.

              This  stores the flag needed to pass the value of the Fortran_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_DIRECTORY target property to the compiler.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
              Fortran flag to enable module output.

              Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.  For  oth&#8208;
              ers, this stores the flag needed to enable module output.


       CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This  is  used  in  determining the compiler ABI and is subject to
              change.
&#12;
       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt;
              Specify a CMake  file  that  overrides  platform  information  for
              &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This is a language-specific version of CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVER&#8208;
              RIDE loaded only when enabling language &lt;LANG&gt;.
