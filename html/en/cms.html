DESCRIPTION
       The cms command handles S/MIME v3.1 mail. It can encrypt, decrypt, sign
       and verify, compress and uncompress S/MIME messages.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       There are fourteen operation options that set the type of operation to be
       performed. The meaning of the other options varies according to the
       operation type.

       -encrypt
           encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates. Input file is the
           message to be encrypted. The output file is the encrypted mail in
           MIME format. The actual CMS type is &lt;B&gt;EnvelopedData&lt;B&gt;.

       -decrypt
           decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Expects
           an encrypted mail message in MIME format for the input file. The
           decrypted mail is written to the output file.

       -sign
           sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Input file
           is the message to be signed. The signed message in MIME format is
           written to the output file.

       -verify
           verify signed mail. Expects a signed mail message on input and
           outputs the signed data. Both clear text and opaque signing is
           supported.

       -cmsout
           takes an input message and writes out a PEM encoded CMS structure.

       -resign
           resign a message: take an existing message and one or more new
           signers.

       -data_create
           Create a CMS Data type.

       -data_out
           Data type and output the content.

       -digest_create
           Create a CMS DigestedData type.
&#12;       -digest_verify
           Verify a CMS DigestedData type and output the content.

       -compress
           Create a CMS CompressedData type. OpenSSL must be compiled with zlib
           support for this option to work, otherwise it will output an error.

       -uncompress
           Uncompress a CMS CompressedData type and output the content. OpenSSL
           must be compiled with zlib support for this option to work, otherwise
           it will output an error.

       -EncryptedData_encrypt
           Encrypt suppled content using supplied symmetric key and algorithm
           using a CMS EncrytedData type and output the content.

       -sign_receipt
           Generate and output a signed receipt for the supplied message. The
           input message must contain a signed receipt request. Functionality is
           otherwise similar to the -sign operation.

       -verify_receipt receipt
           Verify a signed receipt in filename receipt. The input message must
           contain the original receipt request. Functionality is otherwise
           similar to the -verify operation.

       -in filename
           the input message to be encrypted or signed or the message to be
           decrypted or verified.

       -inform SMIME|PEM|DER
           this specifies the input format for the CMS structure. The default is
           SMIME which reads an S/MIME format message. PEM and DER format change
           this to expect PEM and DER format CMS structures instead. This
           currently only affects the input format of the CMS structure, if no
           CMS structure is being input (for example with -encrypt or -sign)
           this option has no effect.

       -rctform SMIME|PEM|DER
           specify the format for a signed receipt for use with the
           -receipt_verify operation.

       -out filename
           the message text that has been decrypted or verified or the output
           MIME format message that has been signed or verified.

       -outform SMIME|PEM|DER
           this specifies the output format for the CMS structure. The default
           is SMIME which writes an S/MIME format message. PEM and DER format
           change this to write PEM and DER format CMS structures instead. This
           currently only affects the output format of the CMS structure, if no
           CMS structure is being output (for example with -verify or -decrypt)
           this option has no effect.

       -stream -indef -noindef
           the -stream and -indef options are equivalent and enable streaming
           I/O for encoding operations. This permits single pass processing of
           data without the need to hold the entire contents in memory,
           potentially supporting very large files. Streaming is automatically
           set for S/MIME signing with detached data if the output format is
           SMIME it is currently off by default for all other operations.

       -noindef
           disable streaming I/O where it would produce and indefinite length
           constructed encoding. This option currently has no effect. In future
           streaming will be enabled by default on all relevant operations and
           this option will disable it.
&#12;       -content filename
           This specifies a file containing the detached content, this is only
           useful with the -verify command. This is only usable if the CMS
           structure is using the detached signature form where the content is
           not included. This option will override any content if the input
           format is S/MIME and it uses the multipart/signed MIME content type.

       -text
           this option adds plain text (text/plain) MIME headers to the supplied
           message if encrypting or signing. If decrypting or verifying it
           strips off text headers: if the decrypted or verified message is not
           of MIME type text/plain then an error occurs.

       -noout
           for the -cmsout operation do not output the parsed CMS structure.
           This is useful when combined with the -print option or if the syntax
           of the CMS structure is being checked.

       -print
           for the -cmsout operation print out all fields of the CMS structure.
           This is mainly useful for testing purposes.

       -CAfile file
           a file containing trusted CA certificates, only used with -verify.

       -CApath dir
           a directory containing trusted CA certificates, only used with
           -verify. This directory must be a standard certificate directory:
           that is a hash of each subject name (using x509 -hash) should be
           linked to each certificate.

       -md digest
           digest algorithm to use when signing or resigning. If not present
           then the default digest algorithm for the signing key will be used
           (usually SHA1).

       -[cipher]
           the encryption algorithm to use. For example triple DES (168 bits) -
           -des3 or 256 bit AES - -aes256. Any standard algorithm name (as used
           by the EVP_get_cipherbyname() function) can also be used preceded by
           a dash, for example -aes_128_cbc. See enc for a list of ciphers
           supported by your version of OpenSSL.

           If not specified triple DES is used. Only used with -encrypt and
           -EncryptedData_create commands.

       -nointern
           when verifying a message normally certificates (if any) included in
           the message are searched for the signing certificate. With this
           option only the certificates specified in the -certfile option are
           used.  The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs
           however.

       -no_signer_cert_verify
           do not verify the signers certificate of a signed message.

       -nocerts
           when signing a message the signer&apos;s certificate is normally included
           with this option it is excluded. This will reduce the size of the
           signed message but the verifier must have a copy of the signers
           certificate available locally (passed using the -certfile option for
           example).

       -noattr
           normally when a message is signed a set of attributes are included
           which include the signing time and supported symmetric algorithms.
           With this option they are not included.
&#12;       -nosmimecap
           exclude the list of supported algorithms from signed attributes,
           other options such as signing time and content type are still
           included.

       -binary
           normally the input message is converted to &quot;canonical&quot; format which
           is effectively using CR and LF as end of line: as required by the
           S/MIME specification. When this option is present no translation
           occurs. This is useful when handling binary data which may not be in
           MIME format.

       -nodetach
           when signing a message use opaque signing: this form is more
           resistant to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail
           agents that do not support S/MIME.  Without this option cleartext
           signing with the MIME type multipart/signed is used.

       -certfile file
           allows additional certificates to be specified. When signing these
           will be included with the message. When verifying these will be
           searched for the signers certificates. The certificates should be in
           PEM format.

       -certsout file
           any certificates contained in the message are written to file.

       -signer file
           a signing certificate when signing or resigning a message, this
           option can be used multiple times if more than one signer is
           required. If a message is being verified then the signers
           certificates will be written to this file if the verification was
           successful.

       -recip file
           the recipients certificate when decrypting a message. This
           certificate must match one of the recipients of the message or an
           error occurs.

       -keyid
           use subject key identifier to identify certificates instead of issuer
           name and serial number. The supplied certificate must include a
           subject key identifier extension. Supported by -sign and -encrypt
           options.

       -receipt_request_all -receipt_request_first
           for -sign option include a signed receipt request. Indicate requests
           should be provided by all receipient or first tier recipients (those
           mailed directly and not from a mailing list). Ignored it
           -receipt_request_from is included.

       -receipt_request_from emailaddress
           for -sign option include a signed receipt request. Add an explicit
           email address where receipts should be supplied.

       -receipt_request_to emailaddress
           Add an explicit email address where signed receipts should be sent
           to. This option must but supplied if a signed receipt it requested.

       -receipt_request_print
           For the -verify operation print out the contents of any signed
           receipt requests.

       -secretkey key
           specify symmetric key to use. The key must be supplied in hex format
           and be consistent with the algorithm used. Supported by the
           -EncryptedData_encrypt -EncrryptedData_decrypt, -encrypt and -decrypt
           options. When used with -encrypt or -decrypt the supplied key is used
           to wrap or unwrap the content encryption key using an AES key in the
           KEKRecipientInfo type.

       -secretkeyid id
           the key identifier for the supplied symmetric key for
           KEKRecipientInfo type.  This option must be present if the -secretkey
           option is used with -encrypt. With -decrypt operations the id is used
           to locate the relevant key if it is not supplied then an attempt is
           used to decrypt any KEKRecipientInfo structures.

       -econtent_type type
           set the encapsulated content type to type if not supplied the Data
           type is used. The type argument can be any valid OID name in either
           text or numerical format.

       -inkey file
           the private key to use when signing or decrypting. This must match
           the corresponding certificate. If this option is not specified then
           the private key must be included in the certificate file specified
           with the -recip or -signer file. When signing this option can be used
           multiple times to specify successive keys.

       -passin arg
           the private key password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -rand file(s)
           a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
           generator, or an EGD socket (see RAND_egd(3)).  Multiple files can be
           specified separated by a OS-dependent character.  The separator is ;
           for MS-Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       cert.pem...
           one or more certificates of message recipients: used when encrypting
           a message.

       -to, -from, -subject
           the relevant mail headers. These are included outside the signed
           portion of a message so they may be included manually. If signing
           then many S/MIME mail clients check the signers certificate&apos;s email
           address matches that specified in the From: address.

       -purpose, -ignore_critical, -issuer_checks, -crl_check, -crl_check_all,
       -policy_check, -extended_crl, -x509_strict, -policy -check_ss_sig
           Set various certificate chain valiadition option. See the verify
           manual page for details.

NOTES
       The MIME message must be sent without any blank lines between the headers
       and the output. Some mail programs will automatically add a blank line.
       Piping the mail directly to sendmail is one way to achieve the correct
       format.

       The supplied message to be signed or encrypted must include the necessary
       MIME headers or many S/MIME clients wont display it properly (if at all).
       You can use the -text option to automatically add plain text headers.

       A &quot;signed and encrypted&quot; message is one where a signed message is then
       encrypted. This can be produced by encrypting an already signed message:
       see the examples section.

       This version of the program only allows one signer per message but it
       will verify multiple signers on received messages. Some S/MIME clients
       choke if a message contains multiple signers. It is possible to sign
       messages &quot;in parallel&quot; by signing an already signed message.

       The options -encrypt and -decrypt reflect common usage in S/MIME clients.
       Strictly speaking these process CMS enveloped data: CMS encrypted data is
       used for other purposes.

       The -resign option uses an existing message digest when adding a new
       signer. This means that attributes must be present in at least one
       existing signer using the same message digest or this operation will
       fail.

       The -stream and -indef options enable experimental streaming I/O support.
       As a result the encoding is BER using indefinite length constructed
       encoding and no longer DER. Streaming is supported for the -encrypt
       operation and the -sign operation if the content is not detached.

       Streaming is always used for the -sign operation with detached data but
       since the content is no longer part of the CMS structure the encoding
       remains DER.

EXIT CODES
       0   the operation was completely successfully.

       1   an error occurred parsing the command options.

       2   one of the input files could not be read.

       3   an error occurred creating the CMS file or when reading the MIME
           message.

       4   an error occurred decrypting or verifying the message.

       5   the message was verified correctly but an error occurred writing out
           the signers certificates.

COMPATIBILITY WITH PKCS#7 format.
       The smime utility can only process the older PKCS#7 format. The cms
       utility supports Cryptographic Message Syntax format. Use of some
       features will result in messages which cannot be processed by
       applications which only support the older format. These are detailed
       below.

       The use of the -keyid option with -sign or -encrypt.

       The -outform PEM option uses different headers.

       The -compress option.

       The -secretkey option when used with -encrypt.

       Additionally the -EncryptedData_create and -data_create type cannot be
       processed by the older smime command.

EXAMPLES
       Create a cleartext signed message:

        openssl cms -sign -in message.txt -text -out mail.msg \
               -signer mycert.pem

       Create an opaque signed message

        openssl cms -sign -in message.txt -text -out mail.msg -nodetach \
               -signer mycert.pem

       Create a signed message, include some additional certificates and read
       the private key from another file:

        openssl cms -sign -in in.txt -text -out mail.msg \
               -signer mycert.pem -inkey mykey.pem -certfile mycerts.pem

       Create a signed message with two signers, use key identifier:
&#12;        openssl cms -sign -in message.txt -text -out mail.msg \
               -signer mycert.pem -signer othercert.pem -keyid

       Send a signed message under Unix directly to sendmail, including headers:

        openssl cms -sign -in in.txt -text -signer mycert.pem \
               -from steve@openssl.org -to someone@somewhere \
               -subject &quot;Signed message&quot; | sendmail someone@somewhere

       Verify a message and extract the signer&apos;s certificate if successful:

        openssl cms -verify -in mail.msg -signer user.pem -out signedtext.txt

       Send encrypted mail using triple DES:

        openssl cms -encrypt -in in.txt -from steve@openssl.org \
               -to someone@somewhere -subject &quot;Encrypted message&quot; \
               -des3 user.pem -out mail.msg

       Sign and encrypt mail:

        openssl cms -sign -in ml.txt -signer my.pem -text \
               | openssl cms -encrypt -out mail.msg \
               -from steve@openssl.org -to someone@somewhere \
               -subject &quot;Signed and Encrypted message&quot; -des3 user.pem

       Note: the encryption command does not include the -text option because
       the message being encrypted already has MIME headers.

       Decrypt mail:

        openssl cms -decrypt -in mail.msg -recip mycert.pem -inkey key.pem

       The output from Netscape form signing is a PKCS#7 structure with the
       detached signature format. You can use this program to verify the
       signature by line wrapping the base64 encoded structure and surrounding
       it with:

        -----BEGIN PKCS7-----
        -----END PKCS7-----

       and using the command,

        openssl cms -verify -inform PEM -in signature.pem -content content.txt

       alternatively you can base64 decode the signature and use

        openssl cms -verify -inform DER -in signature.der -content content.txt

       Create an encrypted message using 128 bit Camellia:

        openssl cms -encrypt -in plain.txt -camellia128 -out mail.msg cert.pem

       Add a signer to an existing message:

        openssl cms -resign -in mail.msg -signer newsign.pem -out mail2.msg

BUGS
       The MIME parser isn&apos;t very clever: it seems to handle most messages that
       I&apos;ve thrown at it but it may choke on others.

       The code currently will only write out the signer&apos;s certificate to a
       file: if the signer has a separate encryption certificate this must be
       manually extracted. There should be some heuristic that determines the
       correct encryption certificate.

       Ideally a database should be maintained of a certificates for each email
       address.

       The code doesn&apos;t currently take note of the permitted symmetric
       encryption algorithms as supplied in the SMIMECapabilities signed
       attribute. this means the user has to manually include the correct
       encryption algorithm. It should store the list of permitted ciphers in a
       database and only use those.

       No revocation checking is done on the signer&apos;s certificate.

HISTORY
       The use of multiple -signer options and the -resign command were first
       added in OpenSSL 1.0.0
