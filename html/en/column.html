COLUMN(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                COLUMN(1)

NAME
     column &#8212; columnate lists

SYNOPSIS
     column [-entx] [-c columns] [-s sep] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The column utility formats its input into multiple columns.  Rows are
     filled before columns.  Input is taken from file operands, or, by default,
     from the standard input.  Empty lines are ignored unless the -e option is
     used.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Output is formatted for a display columns wide.

     -s      Specify a set of characters to be used to delimit columns for the
             -t option.

     -t      Determine the number of columns the input contains and create a ta&#8208;
             ble.  Columns are delimited with whitespace, by default, or with
             the characters supplied using the -s option.  Useful for pretty-
             printing displays.

     -x      Fill columns before filling rows.

     -n      By default, the column command will merge multiple adjacent delim&#8208;
             iters into a single delimiter when using the -t option; this option
             disables that behavior. This option is a Debian GNU/Linux exten&#8208;
             sion.

     -e      Do not ignore empty lines.

ENVIRONMENT
     The COLUMNS, LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the
     execution of column as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The column utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           (printf &quot;PERM LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY &quot; ; \
           printf &quot;HH:MM/YEAR NAME\n&quot; ; \
           ls -l | sed 1d) | column -t

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     Input lines are limited to LINE_MAX (2048) bytes in length.
