DESCRIPTION
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       three contains lines common to both files.

       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)

       --check-order
              check  that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input lines
              are pairable

       --nocheck-order
              do not check that the input is correctly sorted
