NAME
       common-lisp-controller - Common Lisp system management tool


DESCRIPTION
       The  common-lisp-controller  system will manage the installed Common Lisp
       implementations and libraries on the system.  The  main  function  is  to
       enable every user to load any available library and to store the compiled
       files in a user and implementation specific cache directory.

       On upgrades of either implementations or libraries these directories will
       be cleared so that no old fasl files will remain.

       There  are  also  options  to add libraries by default to new images, see
       /usr/share/doc/common-lisp-controller/README.Debian , or to add user spe&#8208;
       cific libraries to the management system, see clc-register-user-package.


EXAMPLES
       To load a clc library :foo on a clc enabled implementation simply do

       (clc:clc-require :foo)


FILES
       /var/cache/common-lisp/  &lt;uid&gt;  /  &lt;implementation-name&gt;  / &lt;library&gt; the
       cache directory for a library fir a given user with associated uid and  a
       certain implementation.

       /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/ the location of the libraries.


BUGS
       Bug reports should be sent to the Debian BTS, preferably with reportbug.
