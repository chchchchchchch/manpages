COMPLEX(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 COMPLEX(7)



NAME
       complex - basics of complex mathematics

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;complex.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       Complex numbers are numbers of the form z = a+b*i, where a and b are real
       numbers and i = sqrt(-1), so that i*i = -1.
       There are other ways to represent that number.  The pair  (a,b)  of  real
       numbers  may be viewed as a point in the plane, given by X- and Y-coordi&#8208;
       nates.  This same point may also be described by giving the pair of  real
       numbers  (r,phi),  where  r  is the distance to the origin O, and phi the
       angle between the X-axis and  the  line  Oz.   Now  z  =  r*exp(i*phi)  =
       r*(cos(phi)+i*sin(phi)).

       The basic operations are defined on z = a+b*i and w = c+d*i as:

       addition: z+w = (a+c) + (b+d)*i

       multiplication: z*w = (a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)*i

       division: z/w = ((a*c + b*d)/(c*c + d*d)) + ((b*c - a*d)/(c*c + d*d))*i

       Nearly  all  math  function have a complex counterpart but there are some
       complex-only functions.

EXAMPLE
       Your C-compiler can work with complex numbers  if  it  supports  the  C99
       standard.  Link with -lm.  The imaginary unit is represented by I.

       /* check that exp(i * pi) == -1 */
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;        /* for atan */
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;complex.h&gt;

       int
       main(void)
       {
           double pi = 4 * atan(1.0);
           double complex z = cexp(I * pi);
           printf(&quot;%f + %f * i\n&quot;, creal(z), cimag(z));
       }
