compton-trans(1)                                                compton-trans(1)



NAME
       compton-trans - an opacity setter tool


SYNOPSIS
       compton-trans [-wncs] [window] -o [opacity]


DESCRIPTION
       compton-trans  is  a  bash  script  that sets _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY only
       using standard command-line utilities for  X11,  including  xprop(1)  and
       xwininfo(1).  It is similar to other utilities like transset(1) or trans&#8208;
       set-df(1).


OPTIONS
       -w window-id
              Specify the window id to target.

       -n window-name
              Specify and try to match a window name.

       -c     Specify the current window as a target.

       -s     Select target window with mouse cursor.  This is the default if no
              window has been specified.

       -o opacity
              Specify  the  new  opacity value for the window. This value can be
              anywhere from 1-100. If it is prefixed with a plus or minus (+/-),
              this  will increment or decrement from the target window&apos;s current
              opacity instead.


EXAMPLES
       Set window id to opacity of 75%.
              compton-trans -w &quot;$WINDOWID&quot; -o 75

       Set window name, &quot;urxvt&quot;, to opacity of 75%.
              compton-trans -n &quot;urxvt&quot; -o 75

       Set current window to opacity of 75%.
              compton-trans -c -o 75

       Select target window and set opacity to 75%.
              compton-trans -s -o 75

       Increment current window 5% opacity.
              compton-trans -c -o +5
