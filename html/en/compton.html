NAME
       compton - a compositor for X11


SYNOPSIS
       compton  [-d  display]  [-r  radius]  [-o  opacity]  [-l left-offset] [-t
       top-offset]  [-i  opacity]  [-e  opacity]  [-cCfFSdG]   [--config   path]
       [--shadow-red   value]   [--shadow-green   value]  [--shadow-blue  value]
       [--inactive-opacity-override]           [--inactive-dim            value]
       [--mark-wmwin-focused]            [--shadow-exclude            condition]
       [--mark-ovredir-focused] [--no-fading-openclose] [--shadow-ignore-shaped]
       [--detect-round-corners]


DESCRIPTION
       compton is a compositor based on Dana Jansens&apos; version of xcompmgr (which
       itself was written by Keith Packard). It includes many improvements  over
       the  original  xcompmgr,  including window frame opacity, inactive window
       transparency, and shadows on argb windows.


EXAMPLE
       $ compton -cC -i 0.6 -e 0.6 -f

       $ compton --config ~/compton.conf


OPTIONS
       -d display
              Which display should be managed.

       -r radius
              The blur radius for shadows. (default 12)

       -o opacity
              The translucency for shadows. (default .75)

       -l left-offset
              The left offset for shadows. (default -15)

       -t top-offset
              The top offset for shadows. (default -15)

       -I fade-in-step
              Opacity change between steps while fading in. (default 0.028)

       -O fade-out-step
              Opacity change between steps while fading out. (default 0.03)

       -D fade-delta-time
              The time between steps in a fade in milliseconds. (default 10)

       -m opacity
              The opacity for menus. (default 1.0)

       -c     Enabled client-side shadows on windows.

       -C     Avoid drawing shadows on dock/panel windows.

       -z     Zero the part of the shadow&apos;s mask behind the  window  (experimen&#8208;
              tal).
&#12;       -f     Fade windows in/out when opening/closing and when opacity changes,
              unless --no-fading-openclose is used.

       -F     Equals -f. Deprecated.

       -i opacity
              Opacity of inactive windows. (0.1 - 1.0)

       -e opacity
              Opacity of window titlebars and borders. (0.1 - 1.0)

       -G     Don&apos;t draw shadows on DND windows

       -b     Daemonize/background process.

       -S     Enable synchronous operation (for debugging).

       --config path
              Look for configuration file at the path.

       --shadow-red value
              Red color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       --shadow-green value
              Green color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       --shadow-blue value
              Blue color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       --inactive-opacity-override
              Inactive opacity set by -i overrides value of _NET_WM_OPACITY.

       --inactive-dim value
              Dim inactive windows. (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0)

       --mark-wmwin-focused
              Try to detect WM windows and mark them as active.

       --shadow-exclude condition
              Exclude conditions for shadows.

       --mark-ovredir-focused
              Mark over-redirect windows as active.

       --no-fading-openclose
              Do not fade on window open/close.

       --shadow-ignore-shaped
              Do not paint shadows on shaped windows.

       --detect-rounded-corners
              Try to detect windows with rounded corners and don&apos;t consider them
              shaped windows.

       Format of a condition:

              condition = &lt;target&gt;:&lt;type&gt;[&lt;flags&gt;]:&lt;pattern&gt;

              &lt;target&gt; is one of &quot;n&quot; (window name), &quot;i&quot; (window class instance),
              and &quot;g&quot; (window general class)

              &lt;type&gt; is one of &quot;e&quot; (exact  match),  &quot;a&quot;  (match  anywhere),  &quot;s&quot;
              (match  from start), &quot;w&quot; (wildcard), and &quot;p&quot; (PCRE regular expres&#8208;
              sions, if compiled with the support).

              &lt;flags&gt; could be a series of flags.  Currently  the  only  defined
              flag is &quot;i&quot; (ignore case).

              &lt;pattern&gt; is the actual pattern string.


CONFIGURATION
       (A  more  robust  sample configuration file exists in the compton reposi&#8208;
       tory.)

       Example

       ~/compton.conf:

           # Shadows
           shadow = true;

           # Opacity
           inactive-opacity = 0.8;
           frame-opacity = 0.7;

           # Fades
           fading = true;

       Run with:

           $ compton --config ~/compton.conf
