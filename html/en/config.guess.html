CONFIG.GUESS(1)                   User Commands                  CONFIG.GUESS(1)



NAME
       config.guess - guess the build system triplet

SYNOPSIS
       config.guess [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       The  GNU  build system distinguishes three types of machines, the `build&apos;
       machine on which the compilers are run, the `host&apos; machine on  which  the
       package being built will run, and, exclusively when you build a compiler,
       assembler etc., the `target&apos; machine, for which the compiler being  built
       will produce code.

       This script will guess the type of the `build&apos; machine.

       Output the configuration name of the system `config.guess&apos; is run on.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -t, --time-stamp
              print date of last modification, then exit

       -v, --version
              print version number, then exit

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       config.guess  might need to compile and run C code, hence it needs a com&#8208;
       piler  for  the   `build&apos;   machine:   use   the   environment   variable
       `CC_FOR_BUILD&apos;  to  specify  the  compiler  for  the  build  machine.  If
       `CC_FOR_BUILD&apos; is not specified, `CC&apos; will be used.  Be sure  to  specify
       `CC_FOR_BUILD&apos; is `CC&apos; is a cross-compiler to the `host&apos; machine.

         CC_FOR_BUILD    a native C compiler, defaults to `cc&apos;
         CC              a native C compiler, the previous variable is preferred
