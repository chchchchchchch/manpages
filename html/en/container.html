NAME
       container - Widget to contain a foreign window.
_________________________________________________________________

SYNOPSIS
       container pathName ?options?

DESCRIPTION
       The container widget lets you embed an X11 window from a foreign applica&#8208;
       tion into your Tk application.  The foreign window is  reparented  inside
       of  the  widget. You can then place and arrange the container just as you
       would any Tk widget.

INTRODUCTION
       Notebooks are a popular graphical paradigm.  They allow you  to  organize
       many windows in a single widget.  For example, you might have an applica&#8208;
       tion the displays several X-Y graphs at the same  time.   Typically,  you
       can&apos;t  pack  the  graphs  into the same frame because they are too large.
       The other alternative is to pack the graphs into  several  toplevel  wid&#8208;
       gets,  allowing  them  to overlap on the screen.  The problem is that all
       the different toplevel windows clutter the screen and  are  difficult  to
       manage.

       The  container  widget  lets organize your application by displaying each
       graph as a page in a folder of a notebook.  Only one page is visible at a
       time.  When  you  click on a tab, the folder (graph) corresponding to the
       tab is displayed in the container widget.  The container  also  lets  you
       temporarily  tear pages out of the notebook into a separate toplevel wid&#8208;
       get, and put them back in the container later.  For  example,  you  could
       compare  two  graphs  side-by-side  by tearing them out, and then replace
       them when you are finished.

       A container may contain an unlimited number of folders.  If there are too
       many  tabs  to view, you can arrange them as multiple tiers or scroll the
       tabs. The container uses the conventional Tk scrollbar syntax, so you can
       attach a scrollbar too.

EXAMPLE
       You create a container widget with the container command.

              # Create a new container
              container .c

       A  new Tcl command .c is also created.  This command can be used to query
       and modify the container.  For example, to  change  the  default  border&#8208;
       width, you use the new command and the container&apos;s configure operation.

              # Change the default font.
              .c configure -borderwidth 2

       You can then add folders using the insert operation.

              # Create a new folder &quot;f1&quot;
              .c coinsert 0 &quot;f1&quot;

       This  inserts  the  new  tab  named &quot;f1&quot; into the container.  The index 0
       indicates location to insert the new tab.  You can also use the index end
       to append a tab to the end of the container.  By default, the text of the
       tab is the name of the tab.  You can change this by configuring the -text
       option.

              # Change the label of &quot;f1&quot;
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -label &quot;Tab #1&quot;

       The insert operation lets you add one or more folders at a time.

              .ts insert end &quot;f2&quot; -label &quot;Tab #2&quot; &quot;f3&quot; &quot;f4&quot;

       The  tab  on  each  folder contains a label.  A label may display both an
       image and a text string.  You can reconfigure the tab&apos;s attributes (fore&#8208;
       ground/background  colors,  font,  rotation, etc) using the tab configure
       operation.

              # Add an image to the label of &quot;f1&quot;
              set image [image create photo -file stopsign.gif]
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -image $image
              .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -rotate 90

       Each folder may contain an embedded widget  to  represent  its  contents.
       The widget to be embedded must be a child of the container widget.  Using
       the -window option, you specify the name of widget to be  embedded.   But
       don&apos;t  pack the widget, the container takes care of placing and arranging
       the widget for you.

              graph .ts.graph
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot; \
                  -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       The size of the folder is determined the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded
       inside  each  folder.  The folder will be as wide as the widest widget in
       any folder. The tallest determines the height.  You  can  use  the  tab&apos;s
       -pagewidth and -pageheight options override this.

       Other  options  control  how the widget appears in the folder.  The -fill
       option says that you wish to have the widget stretch to fill  the  avail&#8208;
       able space in the folder.

              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i


       Now  when you click the left mouse button on &quot;f1&quot;, the graph will be dis&#8208;
       played in the folder.  It  will  be  automatically  hidden  when  another
       folder is selected.  If you click on the right mouse button, the embedded
       widget will be moved into a toplevel widget of its own.   Clicking  again
       on the right mouse button puts it back into the folder.

       If  you  want to share a page between two different folders, the -command
       option lets you specify a Tcl command to be invoked whenever  the  folder
       is  selected.  You can reset the -window option for the tab whenever it&apos;s
       clicked.

              .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -command {
                  .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
              }
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -command {
                  .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
              }

       If you have many folders, you may wish to stack tabs in  multiple  tiers.
       The  container&apos;s  -tiers option requests a maximum number of tiers.   The
       default is one tier.

              .ts configure -tiers 2

       If the tabs can fit in less tiers, the widget will use that many.   When&#8208;
       ever  there  are more tabs than can be displayed in the maximum number of
       tiers, the container will automatically let you scroll the tabs.  You can
       even attach a scrollbar to the container.

              .ts configure -scrollcommand { .sbar set }  -scrollincrement 20
              .sbar configure -orient horizontal -command { .ts view }

       By  default  tabs  are along the top of the container from left to right.
       But tabs can be placed on any side  of  the  container  using  the  -side
       option.

              # Arrange tabs along the right side of the container.
              .ts configure -side right -rotate 270


SYNTAX
       The  container  command  creates a new window using the pathName argument
       and makes it into a container widget.

              container pathName ?option value?...

       Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the  option
       database  to configure aspects of the container such as its colors, font,
       text, and relief.  The container command returns its  pathName  argument.
       At  the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
       pathName, but pathName&apos;s parent must exist.

       When first created, a new container contains no tabs.  Tabs are added  or
       deleted  using widget operations described below. It is not necessary for
       all the tabs to be displayed in the container window  at  once;  commands
       described below may be used to change the view in the window.  Containers
       allow scrolling of tabs using the -scrollcommand option.  They also  sup&#8208;
       port  scanning  (see the scan operation).  Tabs may be arranged along any
       side of the container window using the -side option.

       The size of the container window is determined the  number  of  tiers  of
       tabs  and  the  sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder.  The
       widest widget determines the width of the folder. The tallest  determines
       the height.  If no folders contain an embedded widget, the size is deter&#8208;
       mined solely by the size of the tabs.

       You can override either dimension with the container&apos;s -width and -height
       options.

CONTAINER OPERATIONS
       All container operations are invoked by specifying the widget&apos;s pathname,
       the operation, and any arguments that pertain  to  that  operation.   The
       general form is:


                pathName operation ?arg arg ...?


       Operation  and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following operations are available for container widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the  configuration  option  given  by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the config&#8208;
              ure operation described below.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the  widget.   If  no
              option  is  specified, returns a list describing all the available
              options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on  the
              format  of this list).  If option is specified with no value, then
              the command returns a list describing the one named  option  (this
              list  will  be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
              returned if no option is specified).  If one or more  option-value
              pairs  are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget
              option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this  case  the  command
              returns an empty string.  Option and value are described below:

              -background color
                     Sets the border color of the container.

              -borderwidth pixels
                     Sets the width of the 3-D border around the outside edge of
                     the widget.  The -relief option determines how  the  border
                     is to be drawn.  The default is 2.

              -command pattern
                     Specifies  to search for a window whose WM_COMMAND property
                     matches the given pattern.  If no windows, or more than one
                     window,  matches  the  pattern,  an error is generated.  If
                     pattern is the empty string, then no command search is per&#8208;
                     formed.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

              -cursor cursor
                     Specifies the widget&apos;s cursor.  The default cursor is &quot;&quot;.

              -height pixels
                     Specifies  the requested height of widget.  If pixels is 0,
                     then the height is height  the  embedded  window  plus  the
                     specified borderwidth. The default is 0.

              -highlightbackground  color
                     Sets the color to display in the traversal highlight region
                     when the container does not have the input focus.

              -highlightcolor color
                     Sets the color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle
                     that  is  drawn  around  the  widget  when it has the input
                     focus.  The default is black.

              -highlightthickness pixels
                     Sets the width of the highlight rectangle  to  draw  around
                     the outside of the widget when it has the input focus. Pix&#8208;
                     els is a non-negative value and may have any of  the  forms
                     acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If the value is zero, no focus
                     highlight is drawn around the widget.  The default is 2.

              -name pattern
                     Specifies to search for a  window  whose  WM_NAME  property
                     matches the given pattern.  If no windows, or more than one
                     window, matches the pattern, an  error  is  generated.   If
                     pattern  is  the  empty string, then no name search is per&#8208;
                     formed.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

              -relief relief
                     Specifies the 3-D effect for the container widget.   Relief
                     specifies  how the container should appear relative to wid&#8208;
                     get that it is packed into; for example, raised  means  the
                     container  should  appear  to  protrude.   The  default  is
                     sunken.

              -takefocus focus
                     Provides information used when moving the focus from window
                     to window via keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).
                     If focus is 0,  this  means  that  this  window  should  be
                     skipped  entirely  during keyboard traversal.  1 means that
                     the this window should always receive the input focus.   An
                     empty value means that the traversal scripts decide whether
                     to focus on the window.  The default is 1.

              -width pixels
                     Specifies the requested width of the widget.  If pixels  is
                     0,  then the width is the width the embedded window and the
                     specified borderwidth.  The default is 0.

              -window id
                     Specifies the foreign embedded using its X window id.

       pathName find -command|-name pattern
              Searches for all windows that match the  given  pattern.   If  the
              -command  switch  is given, all windows whose WWM_COMMAND property
              match pattern are returned in a list.   If  the  -name  switch  is
              given,  all  windows  whose  WWM_NAME  property  match pattern are
              returned in a list.  The list returned will contains pairs of  the
              window id and the matching property.
