COWPOKE(1)                                                            COWPOKE(1)



NAME
       cowpoke - Build a Debian source package in a remote cowbuilder instance

SYNOPSIS
       cowpoke [options] packagename.dsc


DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  a  Debian  source  package  to  a cowbuilder host and builds it,
       optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.



OPTIONS
       The following options are available:


       --arch=architecture
              Specify the Debian architecture(s) to build for.   A  space  sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of architectures may be used to build for all of them
              in a single pass.  Valid arch names are those  returned  by  dpkg-
              architecture(1) for DEB_BUILD_ARCH.


       --dist=distribution
              Specify  the  Debian  distribution(s) to build for.  A space sepa&#8208;
              rated list of distributions may be used to build for all  of  them
              in  a  single pass.  Either codenames (such as sid, or squeeze) or
              distribution names (such as  unstable,  or  experimental)  may  be
              used,  but you should usually stick to using one or the other con&#8208;
              sistently as this name may be used in file paths and to locate old
              packages for comparison reporting.


       --buildd=host
              Specify the remote host to build on.


       --buildd-user=name
              Specify the remote user to build as.


       --create
              Create  the  remote  cowbuilder root if it does not already exist.
              If this option is not passed it is  an  error  for  the  specified
              --dist  or  --arch  to not have an existing cowbuilder root in the
              expected location.


       --return=[path]
              Copy results of the build to path.  If path is not specified, then
              return  them  to the current directory. The given path must exist,
              it will not be created.


       --no-return
              Do not copy results of the build to RETURN_DIR (overriding a  path
              set for it in the configuration files).


       --dpkg-opts=&apos;opt1 opt2 ...&apos;
              Specify  additional  options to be passed to dpkg-buildpackage(1).
              Multiple options are delimited with spaces.   This  will  override
              any   options  specified  in  DEBBUILDOPTS  in  the  build  host&apos;s
              pbuilderrc.


       --help Display a brief summary of the available options and current  con&#8208;
              figuration.


       --version
              Display the current version information.



CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       When  cowpoke  is  run  the following configuration options are read from
       global, per-user, and per-project configuration files if  present.   File
       paths  may  be  absolute  or  relative,  the latter being relative to the
       BUILDD_USER&apos;s home directory.  Since the paths are typically quoted  when
       used, tilde expansion will not be performed on them.


   Global defaults
       These apply to every arch and dist in a single cowpoke invocation.


       BUILDD_HOST
              The  network address or fqdn of the build machine where cowbuilder
              is configured.  This may be overridden  by  the  --buildd  command
              line option.

       BUILDD_USER
              The  unprivileged  user  name for operations on the build machine.
              This defaults to the local name of the user executing cowpoke  (or
              to  a  username  that  is  specified in your SSH configuration for
              BUILDD_HOST), and may be overridden by the  --buildd-user  command
              line option.

       BUILDD_ARCH
              The  Debian  architecture(s)  to  build  for.  This must match the
              DEB_BUILD_ARCH of the build chroot being used.  It defaults to the
              local  machine  architecture where cowpoke is executed, and may be
              overridden by the --arch command line option.   A  (quoted)  space
              separated  list of architectures may be used here to build for all
              of them in a single pass.

       BUILDD_DIST
              The Debian distribution(s) to build for.  A (quoted)  space  sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of distributions may be used to build for all of them
              in a single pass.  This may be overridden by  the  --dist  command
              line option.


       INCOMING_DIR
              The  directory  path on the build machine where the source package
              will  initially  be  placed.   This  must  be  writable   by   the
              BUILDD_USER.

       PBUILDER_BASE
              The  filesystem  root for all pbuilder COW and result files.  Arch
              and dist specific subdirectories will normally  be  created  under
              this.   The  apt  cache and temporary build directory will also be
              located under this path.


       SIGN_KEYID
              If this option is set, it is expected to contain the gpg key id to
              pass to debsign(1) if the packages are to be remotely signed.  You
              will be prompted to confirm whether you wish to sign the  packages
              after  all  builds  are  complete.   If this option is unset or an
              empty string, no attempt to sign packages will be made.

       UPLOAD_QUEUE
              If this option is set, it is expected to contain a &apos;host&apos; specifi&#8208;
              cation  for  dput(1)  which will be used to upload them after they
              are signed.  You will be prompted to confirm whether you  wish  to
              upload  the  packages  after  they  are signed.  If this option is
              unset or an empty string, no attempt to upload  packages  will  be
              made.   If  SIGN_KEYID  is  not  set,  this option will be ignored
              entirely.


       BUILDD_ROOTCMD
              The command to use to gain root privileges  on  the  remote  build
              machine.   If unset the default is sudo(8).  This is only required
              to invoke cowbuilder and allow it to enter its chroot, so you  may
              restrict  this  user  to  only being able to run that command with
              escalated privileges.  Something like this in sudoers will  enable
              invoking cowbuilder without an additional password entry required:


                      youruser ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/cowbuilder

              Alternatively  you could use SSH with a forwarded key, or whatever
              other mechanism suits your local access policy.  Using su -c isn&apos;t
              really  suitable  here due to its quoting requirements being some&#8208;
              what different to the rest.


       DEBOOTSTRAP
              The utility to use when creating a new build  root.   Alternatives
              are debootstrap or cdebootstrap.


       RETURN_DIR
              If  set,  package files resulting from the build will be copied to
              the path (local or remote) that this is set to,  after  the  build
              completes.   The  path  must  exist, it will not be created.  This
              option is unset by default and can be overridden with --return  or
              --no-return.



   Arch and dist specific options
       These  are  variables of the form: $arch_$dist_VAR which apply only for a
       particular target arch/dist build.


       arch_dist_RESULT_DIR
              The directory path on the build machine where the resulting  pack&#8208;
              ages  (source  and binary) will be found, and where older versions
              of the package that were built previously may be  found.   If  any
              such older packages exist, debdiff will be used to compare the new
              package with the previous version after the build is complete, and
              the result will be included in the build log.  Files in it must be
              readable by the BUILDD_USER for sanity  checking  with  lintian(1)
              and  debdiff(1),  and  for upload with dput(1).  If this option is
              not specified for some arch and  dist  combination  then  it  will
              default to $PBUILDER_BASE/$arch/$dist/result


       arch_dist_BASE_PATH
              The  directory where the COW master files are to be found (or cre&#8208;
              ated if the --create command line option  was  passed).   If  this
              option is not specified for some arch or dist then it will default
              to $PBUILDER_BASE/$arch/$dist/base.cow



CONFIGURATION FILES
       /etc/cowpoke.conf
              Global configuration options.  Will override hardcoded defaults.

       ~/.cowpoke
              Per-user configuration options.  Will override any global configu&#8208;
              ration.

       .cowpoke
              Per-project  configuration options.  Will override any per-user or
              global configuration if cowpoke is called from the directory where
              they exist.

              If  the  environment variable COWPOKE_CONF is set, it specifies an
              additional configuration file which will  override  all  of  those
              above.   Options specified explicitly on the command line override
              all configuration files.



COWBUILDER CONFIGURATION
       There is nothing particularly special required to configure a  cowbuilder
       instance  for  use  with  cowpoke.  Simply create them in the flavour you
       require with `cowbuilder --create` according to the cowbuilder documenta&#8208;
       tion,  then  configure  cowpoke with the user, arch, and path information
       required to access it, on the machines you wish to  invoke  it  from  (or
       alternatively  configure  cowpoke  with  the  path, arch and distribution
       information and pass the --create option to it on the first  invocation).
       The  build  host  running  cowbuilder  does not require cowpoke installed
       locally.

       The build  machine  should  have  the  lintian  and  devscripts  packages
       installed for post-build sanity checking.  Upon completion, the build log
       and the results of automated checks will be recorded in the INCOMING_DIR.
       If  you  wish  to upload signed packages the build machine will also need
       dput(1) installed and configured to use the  &apos;host&apos;  alias  specified  by
       UPLOAD_QUEUE.   If  rsync(1)  is  available  on  both the local and build
       machine, then it will be used to transfer the source  package  (this  may
       save  on some transfers of the orig.tar.* when building subsequent Debian
       revisions).

       The user executing cowpoke must have SSH access to the build  machine  as
       the  BUILDD_USER.  That user must be able to invoke cowbuilder as root by
       using the BUILDD_ROOTCMD.  Signing keys are not required to be  installed
       on  the  build  machine  (and will be ignored there if they are).  If the
       package is signed, keys will be expected on  the  machine  that  executes
       cowpoke.

       When  cowpoke  is invoked, it will first attempt to update the cowbuilder
       image if that has not already been done on the same day.  This is checked
       by  the  presence or absence of a cowbuilder-$arch-$dist-update-log-$date
       file in the INCOMING_DIR.  You may move, remove, or touch  this  file  if
       you  wish the image to be updated more or less often than that.  Its con&#8208;
       tents log the output of cowbuilder during the update (or creation) of the
       build root.



NOTES
       Since  cowbuilder creates a chroot, and to do that you need root, cowpoke
       also requires some degree of root access.  So  all  the  horrible  things
       that  can  go  wrong with that may well one day rain down upon you.  cow&#8208;
       builder has been known to accidentally wipe out bind-mounted  filesystems
       outside  the  chroot, and worse than that can easily happen.  So be care&#8208;
       ful, keep good backups of things you don&apos;t want to  lose  on  your  build
       machine,  and  use  cowpoke to keep all that on a machine that isn&apos;t your
       bleeding edge dev box with your last few hours of uncommitted work.
