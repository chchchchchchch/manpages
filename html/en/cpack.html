cpack(1)                                                                cpack(1)



NAME
         cpack - Packaging driver provided by CMake.


USAGE
         cpack -G &lt;generator&gt; [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The  &quot;cpack&quot;  executable is the CMake packaging program.  CMake-generated
       build trees created for projects that use  the  INSTALL_*  commands  have
       packaging support.  This program will generate the package.


       CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
       build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in  each
       directory  of  a  source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a
       project by using CMake to generate a build system for a  native  tool  on
       their platform.


OPTIONS
       -G &lt;generator&gt;
              Use the specified generator to generate package.

              CPack  may  support  multiple  native packaging systems on certain
              platforms. A generator is responsible for generating  input  files
              for  particular system and invoking that systems. Possible genera&#8208;
              tor names are specified in the Generators section.


       -C &lt;Configuration&gt;
              Specify the project configuration

              This option specifies the configuration that the project was build
              with, for example &apos;Debug&apos;, &apos;Release&apos;.


       -D &lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
              Set a CPack variable.

              Set a variable that can be used by the generator.


       --config &lt;config file&gt;
              Specify the config file.

              Specify  the  config file to use to create the package. By default
              CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be used.


       --verbose,-V
              enable verbose output

              Run cpack with verbose output.


       --debug
              enable debug output (for CPack developers)

              Run cpack with debug output (for CPack developers).
&#12;
       -P &lt;package name&gt;
              override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

              If the package name is not specified on cpack commmand line thenC&#8208;
              Pack.cmake defines it as CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME


       -R &lt;package version&gt;
              override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

              If  version is not specified on cpack command line thenCPack.cmake
              defines it from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_[MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]look into
              CPack.cmake for detail


       -B &lt;package directory&gt;
              override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY

              The  directory  where  CPack  will be doing its packaging work.The
              resulting package will be found there. Inside this  directoryCPack
              creates  &apos;_CPack_Packages&apos;  sub-directory which is theCPack tempo&#8208;
              rary directory.


       --vendor &lt;vendor name&gt;
              override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR

              If vendor is not specified on cpack command line (or inside CMake&#8208;
              Lists.txt) thenCPack.cmake defines it with a default value

COMMANDS
       cpack_add_component
              Describes  a  CPack  installation component named by the COMPONENT
              argument to a CMake INSTALL command.

                   cpack_add_component(compname
                                       [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                       [DESCRIPTION description]
                                       [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                                       [GROUP group]
                                       [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                                       [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                                       [DOWNLOADED]
                                       [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])




                 The cmake_add_component command describes an installation
                 component, which the user can opt to install or remove as part of
                 the graphical installation process. compname is the name of the
                 component, as provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more
                 CMake INSTALL commands.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in
                 graphical installers to display the component name. This value can
                 be any string.




                 DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
                 graphical installers to give the user additional information about
                 the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;\n&quot; as
                 the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no
                 more than a few lines long.




                 HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the
                 graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change
                 whether it is installed or not.




                 REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore
                 will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical
                 installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required
                 components are shown greyed out).




                 DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled
                 (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component
                 for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.




                 DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If
                 this component is selected, then each of the components listed
                 must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded
                 within the installer itself, so that users cannot install
                 inconsitent sets of components.




                 GROUP names the component group of which this component is a
                 part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone
                 component, not part of any component group. Component groups are
                 described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed
                 below.




                 INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component
                 is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this
                 component will automatically be selected. Installation types are
                 described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.




                 DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
                 on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
                 installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads
                 command.




                 ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack
                 to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will
                 create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and
                 the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more
                 information.


       cpack_add_component_group
              Describes a group of related CPack installation components.

                   cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                                            [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                            [DESCRIPTION description]
                                            [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                                            [EXPANDED]
                                            [BOLD_TITLE])




                 The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
                 components, which will be placed together within the listing of
                 options. Typically, component groups allow the user to
                 select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
                 single group-level option. Use component groups to reduce the
                 complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an
                 arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of
                 the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
                 component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with
                 the name of any component.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
                 graphical installers to display the component group name. This
                 value can be any string.




                 DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group,
                 used in graphical installers to give the user additional
                 information about the components within that group. Descriptions
                 can span multiple lines using &quot;\n&quot; as the line
                 separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a
                 few lines long.




                 PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group.
                 Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups,
                 providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.




                 EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
                 &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user immediately sees all of the
                 components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially
                 show up as a single entry.




                 BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold,
                 to call the user&apos;s attention to the group.


       cpack_add_install_type
              Add a new installation type containing a set of predefined  compo&#8208;
              nent selections to the graphical installer.

                   cpack_add_install_type(typename
                                          [DISPLAY_NAME name])
&#12;                 The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
                 components that represents a common use case for an
                 application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot; install type might include
                 an application along with its header and library files, while an
                 &quot;End user&quot; install type might just include the application&apos;s
                 executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more
                 install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
                 cpack_add_component.




                 DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
                 typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical
                 installer. This value can be any string.


       cpack_configure_downloads
              Configure CPack to download selected components on-the-fly as part
              of the installation process.

                   cpack_configure_downloads(site
                                             [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                                             [ALL]
                                             [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])




                 The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time
                 downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component,
                 CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
                 component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the
                 user selects that component for installation, the installer will
                 download and extract the component in place. This feature is
                 useful for creating small installers that only download the
                 requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the
                 installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of
                 the normal installation process, and the &quot;Change&quot; button in
                 Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or
                 remove parts of the application after the original
                 installation. On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality
                 requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:




                   http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in




                 On Mac OS X, installers that download components on-the-fly can
                 only be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or
                 later.




                 The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
                 components will reside, e.g., http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/
                 All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.




                 UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
                 various archives for each of the components. The contents of this
                 directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
                 in the site argument. If omitted, CPack will use the directory
                 CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
                 archives.




                 The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded. Otherwise, only
                 those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified
                 ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded. Additionally, the ALL option implies
                 ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).




                 ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
                 that can be called from Windows&apos; Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
                 &quot;Modify&quot; button) to change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE
                 turns off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.

       cmake_minimum_required
              Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

                cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
                                       [FATAL_ERROR])

              If the current version of CMake is lower  than  that  required  it
              will stop processing the project and report an error.  When a ver&#8208;
              sion higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])

              which sets the cmake policy version level to  the  version  speci&#8208;
              fied.   When  version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly
              invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)

              which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.


              The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by  CMake  2.6  and
              higher.   It  should  be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower
              fail with an error instead of just a warning.


       cmake_policy
              Manage CMake Policy settings.

              As CMake evolves it is  sometimes  necessary  to  change  existing
              behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of exist&#8208;
              ing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep
              existing  projects  building  as  new  versions of CMake introduce
              changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given
              an identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where &quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer
              index.  Documentation associated with each  policy  describes  the
              OLD  and  NEW  behavior  and the reason the policy was introduced.
              Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When
              CMake  needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting
              specified by the project.  If no  setting  is  available  the  OLD
              behavior  is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the
              policy be set.


              The cmake_policy command is used to set policies  to  OLD  or  NEW
              behavior.   While  setting  policies individually is supported, we
              encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.


                cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])

              Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the  given
              version  of  CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified ver&#8208;
              sion or earlier will be set to use  NEW  behavior.   All  policies
              introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless vari&#8208;
              able CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This  effec&#8208;
              tively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and
              tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.   The
              policy  version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will
              report an error.  In order to get compatibility features  support&#8208;
              ing versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.


                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)

              Tell  CMake  to  use  the  OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.
              Projects depending on the old  behavior  of  a  given  policy  may
              silence  a  policy  warning  by  setting  the policy state to OLD.
              Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new  behav&#8208;
              ior and set the policy state to NEW.


                cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Check  whether  a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The
              output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot; or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set,
              and empty otherwise.


              CMake  keeps  policy  settings  on a stack, so changes made by the
              cmake_policy command affect only the top  of  the  stack.   A  new
              entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdi&#8208;
              rectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a
              new  entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() com&#8208;
              mands except when invoked with  the  NO_POLICY_SCOPE  option  (see
              also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an inter&#8208;
              face to manage custom entries on the policy stack:


                cmake_policy(PUSH)
                cmake_policy(POP)

              Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This  is
              useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.


              Functions  and macros record policy settings when they are created
              and use the pre-record policies when they  are  invoked.   If  the
              function  or macro implementation sets policies, the changes auto&#8208;
              matically propagate up through callers until they reach the  clos&#8208;
              est nested policy stack entry.


       configure_file
              Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

                configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
                               [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                               [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

              Copies  a  file  &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and substitutes variable
              values referenced in the file content.  If &lt;input&gt; is  a  relative
              path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory.
              The &lt;input&gt; must be a file, not a directory.   If  &lt;output&gt;  is  a
              relative  path  it is evaluated with respect to the current binary
              directory.  If &lt;output&gt; names an existing directory the input file
              is placed in that directory with its original name.


              This  command  replaces any variables in the input file referenced
              as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a
              variable  is  not  defined,  it will be replaced with nothing.  If
              COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.
              If  ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be
              C-style escaped.  The file will be  configured  with  the  current
              values  of  CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables
              of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and  ${VAR}  will  be  ignored.
              This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occur&#8208;
              rences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced  with  either  #define
              VAR  or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake.
              Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either
              #define  VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates
              to TRUE or FALSE in CMake.


              With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be adjusted:


                  &apos;UNIX&apos; or &apos;LF&apos; for \n, &apos;DOS&apos;, &apos;WIN32&apos; or &apos;CRLF&apos; for \r\n.

              COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.

       execute_process
              Execute one or more child processes.

                execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
                                [COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]]
                                [WORKING_DIRECTORY &lt;directory&gt;]
                                [TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;]

                                [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
                                [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
                                [INPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [OUTPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                                [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                                [ERROR_QUIET]
                                [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                                [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])

              Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the  standard
              output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A
              single standard error pipe is used for all  processes.   If  WORK&#8208;
              ING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory of the  child  processes.   If  TIMEOUT  is
              given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish
              in the specified number of seconds (fractions  are  allowed).   If
              RESULT_VARIABLE  is  given the variable will be set to contain the
              result of running the processes.  This will be an  integer  return
              code  from  the  last child or a string describing an error condi&#8208;
              tion.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable
              named  will  be  set  with the contents of the standard output and
              standard error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is  named
              for  both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.
              If INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file  named
              will be attached to the standard input of the first process, stan&#8208;
              dard output of the last process, or standard  error  of  all  pro&#8208;
              cesses respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then
              the standard output or standard  error  results  will  be  quietly
              ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for
              the same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_*  or
              ERROR_*  options are given the output will be shared with the cor&#8208;
              responding pipes of the CMake process itself.


              The execute_process command is a newer more  powerful  version  of
              exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.


       file   File manipulation command.

                file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )

              WRITE will write a message into a file called &apos;filename&apos;. It over&#8208;
              writes the file if it already exists, and creates the file  if  it
              does not exist.


              APPEND  will  write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it
              will append it to the end of the file


              READ will read the content of a file and store it into  the  vari&#8208;
              able.  It  will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes.
              If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to
              hexadecimal  representation  and  this will be stored in the vari&#8208;
              able.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the content of a file.


              STRINGS  will  parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store
              it in a variable. Binary data in the file  are  ignored.  Carriage
              return  (CR)  characters  are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex
              and Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted  to
              binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVER&#8208;
              SION.


              LIMIT_COUNT  sets  the  maximum  number  of  strings  to   return.
              LIMIT_INPUT  sets  the  maximum  number  of bytes to read from the
              input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store
              in  the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of
              a string to return. Shorter strings  are  ignored.  LENGTH_MAXIMUM
              sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are
              split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CON&#8208;
              SUME  allows  newlines to be included in strings instead of termi&#8208;
              nating them.


              REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must  match  to
              be returned. Typical usage


                file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

              stores  a  list  in  the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in which each item is a
              line from the input file.


              GLOB will generate a list of all files  that  match  the  globbing
              expressions  and  store it into the variable. Globbing expressions
              are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If  RELATIVE
              flag  is specified for an expression, the results will be returned
              as a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend  using
              GLOB  to collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If
              no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added  or  removed
              then  the  generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to
              regenerate.)


              Examples of globbing expressions include:


                 *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
                 *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
                 f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

              GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar  to  the  regular  GLOB,
              except  it  will  traverse  all  the subdirectories of the matched
              directory and match the files. Subdirectories  that  are  symlinks
              are  only  traversed  if  FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy
              CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See  cmake  --help-policy  CMP0009  for
              more information.


              Examples of recursive globbing include:


                 /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

              MAKE_DIRECTORY  will  create  the given directories, also if their
              parent directories don&apos;t exist yet


              RENAME moves a file or directory within  a  filesystem,  replacing
              the destination atomically.


              REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories


              REMOVE_RECURSE  will  remove the given files and directories, also
              non-empty directories


              RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory  to  the
              given file.


              TO_CMAKE_PATH  will convert path into a cmake style path with unix
              /.  The input  can  be  a  single  path  or  a  system  path  like
              &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;.    Note  the  double  quotes  around  the  ENV  call
              TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes  one argument.  This  command  will  also
              convert  the  native  list delimiters for a list of paths like the
              PATH environment variable.


              TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like  TO_CMAKE_PATH,  but  will  convert
              from   a cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows
              and / for UNIX.


              DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var
              is  specified  a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS
              var is specified the status of the operation will be put  in  var.
              The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is
              the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element
              is  a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error
              in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will
              timeout  after  time seconds, time should be specified as an inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of  inactivity  after  which  the  operation  should terminate. If
              EXPECTED_MD5 sum is specified, the operation will verify that  the
              downloaded file&apos;s actual md5 sum matches the expected value. If it
              does  not  match,  the  operation  fails   with   an   error.   If
              SHOW_PROGRESS  is  specified, progress information will be printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.


              UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If LOG var  is
              specified a log of the upload will be put in var. If STATUS var is
              specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The sta&#8208;
              tus  is  returned  in a list of length 2. The first element is the
              numeric return value for the operation, and the second element  is
              a  string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in
              the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified,  the  operation  will
              timeout  after  time seconds, time should be specified as an inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of  inactivity  after  which  the  operation  should terminate. If
              SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will  be  printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.


              The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:


                file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                     [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
                     [FILES_MATCHING]
                     [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                      [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

              The  COPY  signature  copies files, directories, and symlinks to a
              destination folder.   Relative  input  paths  are  evaluated  with
              respect  to  the current source directory, and a relative destina&#8208;
              tion is evaluated with respect to  the  current  build  directory.
              Copying  preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file
              if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.   Copying
              preserves   input   permissions  unless  explicit  permissions  or
              NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are  given  (default  is  USE_SOURCE_PERMIS&#8208;
              SIONS).   See  the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of
              permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.


              The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status
              messages,  and  NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS  is  default.   Installation
              scripts generated by the  install()  command  use  this  signature
              (with some undocumented options for internal use).


       find_file
              Find the full path to a file.

                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This  is  the  short-hand signature for the command that is suffi&#8208;
              cient in many cases.  It is  the  same  as  find_file(&lt;VAR&gt;  name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_file(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This  command  is  used to find a full path to named file. A cache
              entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of  this  com&#8208;
              mand.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in
              the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the  vari&#8208;
              able  is  cleared.   If  nothing  is  found,  the  result  will be
              &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted  again  the  next
              time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the
              full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names
              listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can
              be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the
              HINTS  or  PATHS section the environment variable var will be read
              and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake  style
              list  of  paths.   For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
              system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for  the
              documentation  string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies addi&#8208;
              tional subdirectories to check below each search path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.
&#12;
              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       find_library
              Find a library.

                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This  is  the  short-hand signature for the command that is suffi&#8208;
              cient in many cases.  It is the same as  find_library(&lt;VAR&gt;  name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_library(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This  command  is  used  to find a library. A cache entry named by
              &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result  of  this  command.   If  the
              library  is  found  the  result  is stored in the variable and the
              search will not be repeated unless the variable  is  cleared.   If
              nothing  is  found,  the  result  will  be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the
              search will be attempted  again  the  next  time  find_library  is
              invoked  with  the same variable.  The name of the library that is
              searched for is specified by the  names  listed  after  the  NAMES
              argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the
              PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
              the  environment  variable  var  will be read and converted from a
              system environment variable to a cmake style list of  paths.   For
              example  ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable.
              The argument after DOC will be used for the  documentation  string
              in  the  cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories
              to check below each search path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.
&#12;
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 LIB

              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.
&#12;              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              If  the  library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the
              full path to the framework  &lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework.  When  a  full
              path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -frame&#8208;
              work A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the target.


              If the global property  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS  is  set  all
              search  paths  will  be tested as normal, with &quot;64/&quot; appended, and
              with all matches of &quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;.  This  property
              is  automatically  set for the platforms that are known to need it
              if at least one of the languages supported by the PROJECT  command
              is enabled.


       find_package
              Load settings for an external project.

                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Finds  and  loads  settings  from  an  external  project.   &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the package was  found.
              When the package is found package-specific information is provided
              through variables documented by the  package  itself.   The  QUIET
              option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The MOD&#8208;
              ULE option disables the second signature  documented  below.   The
              REQUIRED  option  stops  processing  with  an error message if the
              package cannot be found.


              A package-specific list of required components may be listed after
              the  COMPONENTS  option (or after the REQUIRED option if present).
              Additional optional components may be listed after OPTIONAL_COMPO&#8208;
              NENTS.   Available  components  and  their  influence on whether a
              package is considered to be found are defined by the target  pack&#8208;
              age.
&#12;
              The  [version]  argument requests a version with which the package
              found      should       be       compatible       (format       is
              major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).   The  EXACT  option requests that
              the version be matched exactly.  If no [version] and/or  component
              list  is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the
              corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer
              call (including the EXACT flag for [version]).  Version support is
              currently provided only on  a  package-by-package  basis  (details
              below).


              User  code should generally look for packages using the above sim&#8208;
              ple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation speci&#8208;
              fies the full command signature and details of the search process.
              Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to  be  found  by
              this command are encouraged to read on.


              The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: &quot;Mod&#8208;
              ule&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot; mode.  Module mode is  available  when  the
              command  is  invoked  with  the  above  reduced  signature.  CMake
              searches for a file called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the CMAKE_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_PATH  followed  by  the  CMake  installation.   If the file is
              found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is  responsible  for
              finding  the  package,  checking  the  version,  and producing any
              needed messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no  support
              for  versioning;  check the module documentation.  If no module is
              found and the MODULE option is not given the command  proceeds  to
              Config mode.


              The complete Config mode command signature is:


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
                             [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
                             [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
                             [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                             [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                             [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                              ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

              The  CONFIG  option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and
              switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Con&#8208;
              fig  mode  is  also implied by use of options not specified in the
              reduced signature.


              Config mode attempts to locate a configuration  file  provided  by
              the  package  to  be found.  A cache entry called &lt;package&gt;_DIR is
              created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the
              command  searches  for  a package with the name &lt;package&gt;.  If the
              NAMES option is given the names following it are used  instead  of
              &lt;package&gt;.   The  command  searches  for a file called &quot;&lt;name&gt;Con&#8208;
              fig.cmake&quot; or &quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each name spec&#8208;
              ified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may
              be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is speci&#8208;
              fied  below.   Once found, the configuration file is read and pro&#8208;
              cessed by CMake.  Since the file is provided  by  the  package  it
              already  knows the location of package contents.  The full path to
              the configuration file is stored  in  the  cmake  variable  &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_CONFIG.


              All  configuration files which have been considered by CMake while
              searching for an installation of the package with  an  appropriate
              version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CON&#8208;
              FIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.


              If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will  gen&#8208;
              erate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is
              specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not  found
              a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.
              If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a con&#8208;
              figuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.


              When  the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a
              version  of  the  package  that  claims  compatibility  with   the
              requested  version  (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If
              the EXACT option is given only a version of the  package  claiming
              an  exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does
              not establish any convention for the meaning of  version  numbers.
              Package version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files provided by
              the packages themselves.  For a  candidate  package  configuration
              file  &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot;  the  corresponding  version  file  is
              located next to it and named either  &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot;
              or  &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;.   If  no  such  version  file is
              available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compat&#8208;
              ible  with any requested version.  A basic version file containing
              generic version matching code  can  be  created  using  the  macro
              write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more
              details.  When a version file is found it is loaded to  check  the
              requested  version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested
              scope in which the following variables have been defined:


                PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version
              and sets these variables:


                PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
                PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
                PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
                PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version

              These  variables are checked by the find_package command to deter&#8208;
              mine whether the configuration file provides  an  acceptable  ver&#8208;
              sion.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.
              If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:


                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION       = full provided version string
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.   When
              multiple  package  configuration files are available whose version
              files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspec&#8208;
              ified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest
              or closest version number.


              Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search  procedure.
              Much  of  the  interface  is provided for completeness and for use
              internally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user  code
              should simply call


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

              in  order  to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake
              package configuration files are encouraged  to  name  and  install
              them such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
              requiring use of additional options.


              CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes  for  the
              package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
              configuration  file.   The  tables  below  show  the   directories
              searched.   Each  entry  is meant for installation trees following
              Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A) conventions.


                &lt;prefix&gt;/                                               (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/                                       (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/          (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/                (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)

              On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles  the
              following  directories are searched for frameworks or bundles con&#8208;
              taining a configuration file:


                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/                    (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

              In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as case-insensitive and  corre&#8208;
              sponds  to any of the names specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by
              NAMES).  Paths with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURE  is  set.   If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are
              appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.


              This set of directories is intended to work  in  cooperation  with
              projects  that  provide  configuration files in their installation
              trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for instal&#8208;
              lations  on  Windows  where  the prefix may point at the top of an
              application&apos;s installation directory.  Those marked with  (U)  are
              intended  for  installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is
              shared by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so  all
              (W)  and  (U)  directories  are  still  searched on all platforms.
              Directories marked with (A)  are  intended  for  installations  on
              Apple  platforms.   The  cmake  variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and
              CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference  as  speci&#8208;
              fied below.


              The  set of installation prefixes is constructed using the follow&#8208;
              ing steps.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_*  options  are
              enabled.


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;package&gt;_DIR
                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3.  Search  paths  specified by the HINTS option.  These should be
              paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by
              the  location  of  another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped  if  NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH  is  passed.  Path entries
              ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot; are automatically converted  to  their
              parent directories.


                 PATH

              5.  Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake GUI.
              This can be skipped if  NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH  is  passed.   It  is
              intended  for  the case when a user is building multiple dependent
              projects one after another.


              6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package  registry.   This
              can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On Windows
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the  direc&#8208;
              tory containing the package configuration file.  On UNIX platforms
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory


                ~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;

              as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory   containing   the   package  configuration  file.   See  the
              export(PACKAGE) command to create user  package  registry  entries
              for project build trees.


              7.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package registry.  This
              can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.   On
              Windows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as  a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory containing the package configuration file.  There is no  sys&#8208;
              tem package registry on non-Windows platforms.


              9.  Search  paths  specified by the PATHS option.  These are typi&#8208;
              cally hard-coded guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.
&#12;              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_package(&lt;package&gt;)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              Every  non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by setting
              the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
              documentation  for  the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; vari&#8208;
              able for more information.


              When  loading  a  find  module  or  package   configuration   file
              find_package  defines  variables  to provide information about the
              call arguments (and restores their original state  before  return&#8208;
              ing):


               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;  = true if component &lt;c&gt; is required
                                              false if component &lt;c&gt; is optional

              In  Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the
              request detailed by these  variables;  see  the  find  module  for
              details.  In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and
              version options automatically but leaves it to the package config&#8208;
              uration  file  to  handle components in a way that makes sense for
              the package.   The  package  configuration  file  may  set  &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND  to  false to tell find_package that component require&#8208;
              ments are not satisfied.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       find_path
              Find the directory containing a file.

                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This  is  the  short-hand signature for the command that is suffi&#8208;
              cient in many cases.  It is  the  same  as  find_path(&lt;VAR&gt;  name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_path(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This  command  is  used  to  find a directory containing the named
              file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the  result
              of  this  command.  If the file in a directory is found the result
              is stored in the variable and the  search  will  not  be  repeated
              unless  the  variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result
              will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the
              next  time  find_path is invoked with the same variable.  The name
              of the file in a directory that is searched for  is  specified  by
              the  names  listed  after  the NAMES argument.   Additional search
              locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If  ENV  var
              is  found  in  the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable
              var will be read and converted from a system environment  variable
              to  a  cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a
              way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC  will
              be  used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES
              specifies additional subdirectories to  check  below  each  search
              path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as  A/b.h,
              then  the  framework search will look for A.framework/Headers/b.h.
              If that is found the path will be set to the path  to  the  frame&#8208;
              work.  CMake will convert this to the correct -F option to include
              the file.


       find_program
              Find an executable program.

                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many cases.  It is the same as find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_program(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find a program. A  cache  entry  named  by
              &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the pro&#8208;
              gram is found the result is stored in the variable and the  search
              will  not  be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing
              is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the  search  will
              be  attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with the
              same variable.  The name of the program that is  searched  for  is
              specified  by  the  names listed after the NAMES argument.   Addi&#8208;
              tional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
              If  ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
              variable var will be read and converted from a system  environment
              variable  to  a  cmake  style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH
              would be a way to list the  system  path  variable.  The  argument
              after  DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.
              PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to  check  below
              each search path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.

                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH


              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       foreach
              Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

                foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endforeach(loop_var)

              All commands between  foreach  and  the  matching  endforeach  are
              recorded without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated,
              the recorded list of commands is invoked once  for  each  argument
              listed  in the original foreach command.  Before each iteration of
              the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot; will be set as a variable with the  current
              value in the list.


                foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
                foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

              Foreach  can also iterate over a generated range of numbers. There
              are three types of this iteration:


              * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to
              &quot;total&quot;.


              *  When  specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from
              the first number to the second number.


              * The third optional number is the increment used to iterate  from
              the first number to the second number.


                foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                                    [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

              Iterates  over  a  precise  list of items.  The LISTS option names
              list-valued variables to be traversed,  including  empty  elements
              (an  empty  string  is a zero-length list).  The ITEMS option ends
              argument parsing and includes all arguments following  it  in  the
              iteration.


       function
              Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

                function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define  a  function  named  &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1
              arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after function, but  before  the
              matching  endfunction,  are  not  invoked  until  the  function is
              invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in  the  func&#8208;
              tion  are  first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1})
              with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In
              addition  to  referencing  the formal parameters you can reference
              the variable ARGC which will be set to  the  number  of  arguments
              passed  into  the  function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which
              will have the actual values  of  the  arguments  passed  in.  This
              facilitates  creating functions with optional arguments. Addition&#8208;
              ally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given  to  the  function
              and  ARGN  holds the list of argument past the last expected argu&#8208;
              ment.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the  behavior  of
              policies inside functions.


       get_cmake_property
              Get a property of the CMake instance.

                get_cmake_property(VAR property)

              Get a property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property
              is stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found,  VAR
              will  be  set  to  &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;.  Some supported properties include:
              VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS, and COMPONENTS.


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_directory_property
              Get a property of DIRECTORY scope.

                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)

              Store a property of directory scope in the named variable.  If the
              property  is not defined the empty-string is returned.  The DIREC&#8208;
              TORY argument specifies another directory from which  to  retrieve
              the  property  value.   The  specified directory must have already
              been traversed by CMake.


                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                                       DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)

              Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form  is  useful
              to get a variable definition from another directory.


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_filename_component
              Get a specific component of a full filename.

                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH
                                       [CACHE])

              Set  &lt;VAR&gt; to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file extension
              (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, the full
              path  (ABSOLUTE),  or  the  full  path  with all symlinks resolved
              (REALPATH).  Note that the path is converted to Unix slashes  for&#8208;
              mat  and  has  no  trailing slashes. The longest file extension is
              always considered. If the optional CACHE  argument  is  specified,
              the result variable is added to the cache.


                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;]
                                       [CACHE])

              The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or
              left as a full path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS  is  present  with  PROGRAM,
              then any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are
              split from the program name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;.  This is used
              to  separate  a  program name from its arguments in a command line
              string.


       get_property
              Get a property.

                get_property(&lt;variable&gt;
                             &lt;GLOBAL             |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                              TARGET    &lt;target&gt; |
                              SOURCE    &lt;source&gt; |
                              TEST      &lt;test&gt;   |
                              CACHE     &lt;entry&gt;  |
                              VARIABLE&gt;
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
                             [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

              Get one property from one object in a scope.  The  first  argument
              specifies  the  variable in which to store the result.  The second
              argument determines the scope from which to get the property.   It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY  scope  defaults  to  the  current directory but another
              directory (already processed by CMake) may be  named  by  full  or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope must name one existing target.


              SOURCE scope must name one source file.


              TEST scope must name one existing test.


              CACHE scope must name one cache entry.


              VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              The  required  PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name
              of the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value
              is  returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to a
              boolean value indicating whether the property has  been  set.   If
              the DEFINED option is given the variable is set to a boolean value
              indicating whether the property has  been  defined  such  as  with
              define_property.  If  BRIEF_DOCS  or  FULL_DOCS  is given then the
              variable is set to  a  string  containing  documentation  for  the
              requested  property.  If documentation is requested for a property
              that has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.


       if     Conditionally execute a group of commands.

                if(expression)
                  # then section.
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)

                  ...
                elseif(expression2)
                  # elseif section.
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)

                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endif(expression)

              Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true,  the  com&#8208;
              mands in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in
              the else section are invoked.  The elseif and  else  sections  are
              optional.  You  may  have  multiple  elseif clauses. Note that the
              expression in the else and endif clause is optional. Long  expres&#8208;
              sions  can be used and there is a traditional order of precedence.
              Parenthetical expressions are evaluated first  followed  by  unary
              operators  such  as  EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any EQUAL,
              LESS, GREATER, STRLESS,  STRGREATER,  STREQUAL,  MATCHES  will  be
              evaluated.  Then  NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators will
              be evaluated. Possible expressions are:


                if(&lt;constant&gt;)

              True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
              False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, &quot;&quot;, or ends
              in  the  suffix  &apos;-NOTFOUND&apos;.    Named   boolean   constants   are
              case-insensitive.   If the argument is not one of these constants,
              it is treated as a variable:


                if(&lt;variable&gt;)

              True if the variable is defined to a value that  is  not  a  false
              constant.   False  otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are not vari&#8208;
              ables.)


                if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)

              True if the expression is not true.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if both expressions would be considered true individually.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if either expression would be considered true individually.

                if(COMMAND command-name)

              True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
              invoked.


                if(POLICY policy-id)

              True  if  the  given  name  is  an  existing  policy  (of the form
              CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).


                if(TARGET target-name)

              True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.


                if(EXISTS file-name)
                if(EXISTS directory-name)

              True  if  the  named  file  or  directory  exists.   Behavior   is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)

              True  if  file1  is  newer  than  file2 or if one of the two files
              doesn&apos;t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)

              True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior  is  well-defined
              only for full paths.


                if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)

              True   if  the  given  name  is  a  symbolic  link.   Behavior  is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)

              True if the given path is an absolute path.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)

              True if the given string or variable&apos;s  value  matches  the  given
              regular expression.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True if the given string or variable&apos;s value is a valid number and
              the inequality or equality is true.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True if the given string or variable&apos;s value is  lexicographically
              less  (or  greater,  or  equal) than the string or variable on the
              right.

                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              Component-wise integer version number comparison  (version  format
              is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).


                if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)

              True  if  the given variable is defined. It does not matter if the
              variable is true or false just if it has been set.


                if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))

              The expressions inside the parenthesis  are  evaluated  first  and
              then  the  remaining  expression  is  evaluated as in the previous
              examples. Where there are nested  parenthesis  the  innermost  are
              evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.


              The  if command was written very early in CMake&apos;s history, predat&#8208;
              ing the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evalu&#8208;
              ates variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signa&#8208;
              tures.  Note that normal  variable  evaluation  with  ${}  applies
              before the if command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code
              like


                set(var1 OFF)
                set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;)
                if(${var2})

              appears to the if command as


                if(var1)

              and is evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;)  case  documented
              above.   The  result is OFF which is false.  However, if we remove
              the ${} from the example then the command sees


                if(var2)

              which is true because var2 is defined to &quot;var1&quot;  which  is  not  a
              false constant.


              Automatic  evaluation  applies  in  the  other  cases whenever the
              above-documented signature accepts &lt;variable|string&gt;:


              1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it
              is  a defined variable, if so the variable&apos;s value is used, other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              2) If the left hand argument to  MATCHES  is  missing  it  returns
              false without error


              3)  Both  left  and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER EQUAL are
              independently tested to see if they are defined variables,  if  so
              their  defined  values  are  used  otherwise the original value is
              used.


              4) Both left and right hand arguments  to  STRLESS  STREQUAL  STR&#8208;
              GREATER  are independently tested to see if they are defined vari&#8208;
              ables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the  original
              value is used.


              5)  Both  left  and  right  hand  argumemnts  to VERSION_LESS VER&#8208;
              SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they
              are  defined variables, if so their defined values are used other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to  see  if  it  is  a
              boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed
              to be a variable and it is dereferenced.


              7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR  are  independently
              tested  to  see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used
              as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are deref&#8208;
              erenced.



       include
              Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

                include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;VAR&gt;]
                                      [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Reads  CMake  listfile  code from the given file.  Commands in the
              file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of
              the  include  command.   If  OPTIONAL is present, then no error is
              raised if the file does not exist.  If  RESULT_VARIABLE  is  given
              the  variable  will  be  set  to  the full filename which has been
              included or NOTFOUND if it failed.


              If a module is specified instead of a file,  the  file  with  name
              &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in
              the CMake module directory. There is one exception to this: if the
              file  which  calls include() is located itself in the CMake module
              directory, then first the CMake module directory is  searched  and
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       list   List operations.

                list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element index&gt; ...]
                     &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(APPEND &lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_ITEM &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;)
                list(REVERSE &lt;list&gt;)
                list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)
&#12;              LENGTH will return a given list&apos;s length.


              GET will return list of elements specified  by  indices  from  the
              list.


              APPEND will append elements to the list.


              FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or
              -1 if it wasn&apos;t found.


              INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.


              REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items  from  the  list.  The
              difference  is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items, while
              REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.


              REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.


              REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.


              SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.


              The  list  subcommands  APPEND,  INSERT,  REMOVE_AT,  REMOVE_ITEM,
              REMOVE_DUPLICATES,  REVERSE and SORT may create new values for the
              list within the current CMake variable scope. Similar to  the  SET
              command,  the LIST command creates new variable values in the cur&#8208;
              rent scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a  par&#8208;
              ent  scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards,
              use SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some  other
              means of value propagation.


              NOTES:  A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To cre&#8208;
              ate a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c
              d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) cre&#8208;
              ates a string or a list with one item in it.


              When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or  greater,
              it  is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing
              the first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it  is
              indexed  from  the  end of the list, with -1 representing the last
              list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they
              do  not  start  from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list ele&#8208;
              ment.



       macro  Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

                macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named  arg1  arg2
              arg3  (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching
              endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it  is
              invoked,  the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by
              replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the  arguments  passed,
              and  then  invoked  as normal commands. In addition to referencing
              the formal parameters you can reference the values  ${ARGC}  which
              will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as
              well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the  actual
              values  of  the  arguments  passed  in.  This facilitates creating
              macros with optional arguments.  Additionally  ${ARGV}  holds  the
              list  of  all  arguments  given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the
              list of argument past the last expected argument.  Note  that  the
              parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in
              the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like  the
              c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake vari&#8208;
              ables you should look at the function command.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the  behavior  of
              policies inside macros.


       mark_as_advanced
              Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

                mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)

              Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
              will not be displayed in any of the cmake  GUIs  unless  the  show
              advanced  option  is  on.  If CLEAR is the first argument advanced
              variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is  the  first
              argument,  then  the  variable is made advanced.  If neither FORCE
              nor CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but
              if  the  variable  already  has an advanced/non-advanced state, it
              will not be changed.


              It does nothing in script mode.


       math   Mathematical expressions.

                math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math expression&gt;)

              EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return  result  in  the
              output variable. Example mathematical expression is &apos;5 * ( 10 + 13
              )&apos;.  Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %.   They
              have the same meaning  as they do in c code.


       message
              Display a message to the user.

                message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
                        &quot;message to display&quot; ...)

              The optional keyword determines the type of message:


                (none)         = Important information
                STATUS         = Incidental information
                WARNING        = CMake Warning, continue processing
                AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
                SEND_ERROR     = CMake Error, continue but skip generation
                FATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop all processing

              The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and
              all other message types on stderr.  The  CMake  GUI  displays  all
              messages  in  its  log  area.  The interactive dialogs (ccmake and
              CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at a time on  a  status  line
              and other messages in interactive pop-up boxes.


              CMake  Warning  and  Error  message  text  displays using a simple
              markup language.  Non-indented text is formatted  in  line-wrapped
              paragraphs  delimited  by  newlines.   Indented text is considered
              pre-formatted.


       option Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

                option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string describing option&quot;
                       [initial value])

              Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no ini&#8208;
              tial value is provided, OFF is used.


              If  you  have  options that depend on the values of other options,
              see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.


       return Return from a file, directory or function.

                return()

              Returns from a file, directory or function. When this  command  is
              encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()),
              it causes processing of the current file to stop  and  control  is
              returned  to  the  including  file. If it is encountered in a file
              which is not included by another file, e.g. a CMakeLists.txt, con&#8208;
              trol  is  returned  to  the  parent  directory if there is one. If
              return is called in a function, control is returned to the  caller
              of  the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does not
              handle return like a function does.


       separate_arguments
              Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

                separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt; &lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)

              Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string  &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;  and
              stores  a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;.  The
              entire command line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; argument.


              The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted  whitespace.
              It  recognizes  both single-quote and double-quote pairs.  A back&#8208;
              slash escapes the next literal character (\&quot; is &quot;); there  are  no
              special escapes (\n is just n).


              The  WINDOWS_COMMAND  mode parses a windows command-line using the
              same syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.
              It  separates  arguments  by whitespace that is not double-quoted.
              Backslashes are literal unless they  precede  double-quotes.   See
              the MSDN article &quot;Parsing C Command-Line Arguments&quot; for details.


                separate_arguments(VARIABLE)

              Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list.  All
              spaces are replaced with &apos;;&apos;.  This helps with generating  command
              lines.


       set    Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a given value.
&#12;                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;
                    [[CACHE &lt;type&gt; &lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])

              Within  CMake  sets  &lt;variable&gt;  to the value &lt;value&gt;.  &lt;value&gt; is
              expanded before &lt;variable&gt; is set to it.  Normally, set will set a
              regular  CMake  variable. If CACHE is present, then the &lt;variable&gt;
              is put in the cache instead, unless it is already  in  the  cache.
              See section &apos;Variable types in CMake&apos; below for details of regular
              and cache variables and their  interactions.  If  CACHE  is  used,
              &lt;type&gt;  and  &lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by the CMake
              GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value. The value
              for &lt;type&gt; may be one of


                FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
                PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
                STRING   = Arbitrary string.
                BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
                INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).

              If  &lt;type&gt;  is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked as internal,
              and will not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui. This is
              intended  for  values  that  should be persisted in the cache, but
              which users should not normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.


              Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but  does  not
              modify  them.  If FORCE is specified, the value of the cache vari&#8208;
              able is set, even if the variable is already in  the  cache.  This
              should  normally  be avoided, as it will remove any changes to the
              cache variable&apos;s value by the user.


              If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the  scope
              above  the current scope. Each new directory or function creates a
              new scope. This command will set the value of a variable into  the
              parent  directory  or calling function (whichever is applicable to
              the case at hand). PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.


              If &lt;value&gt; is not specified then the variable is  removed  instead
              of set.  See also: the unset() command.


                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ... &lt;valueN&gt;)

              In  this  case  &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon separated list of
              values.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )

              in which case the environment variable will be set.


              *** Variable types in CMake ***


              In CMake there are two types of variables:  normal  variables  and
              cache  variables.  Normal variables are meant for the internal use
              of the script (just like variables in most programming languages);
              they  are not persisted across CMake runs. Cache variables (unless
              set with INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration  settings
              where  the  first  CMake  run determines a suitable default value,
              which the user can then override, by editing the cache with  tools
              such  as  ccmake  or  cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the
              CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.


              Both types can exist at the same time with the same name but  dif&#8208;
              ferent  values.  When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks for a
              normal variable &apos;FOO&apos; in scope and uses it if set. If and only  if
              no normal variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              Some examples:


              The code &apos;set(FOO &quot;x&quot;)&apos; sets the normal variable  &apos;FOO&apos;.  It  does
              not  touch  the  cache,  but it will hide any existing cache value
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              The code &apos;set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...)&apos; checks for &apos;FOO&apos; in  the  cache,
              ignoring  any normal variable of the same name. If &apos;FOO&apos; is in the
              cache then nothing happens to either the normal  variable  or  the
              cache  variable. If &apos;FOO&apos; is not in the cache, then it is added to
              the cache.


              Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a  com&#8208;
              mand,  CMake  also  *removes* the normal variable of the same name
              from the current scope so that an immediately following evaluation
              of it will expose the newly cached value.


              Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of
              the same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow. However,
              in  some  situations  it  can be useful. One example (used by some
              projects):


              A project has a subproject in its source tree. The  child  project
              has  its  own  CMakeLists.txt,  which  is included from the parent
              CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if  the  parent  and
              the  child project provide the same option (for example a compiler
              option), the parent gets the first chance to add  a  user-editable
              option  to  the cache. Normally, the child would then use the same
              value that the parent  uses.  However,  it  may  be  necessary  to
              hard-code  the  value  for  the child project&apos;s option while still
              allowing the user to edit the value used by  the  parent  project.
              The  parent  project  can  achieve this simply by setting a normal
              variable with the same name as the option in a scope sufficient to
              hide  the  option&apos;s  cache variable from the child completely. The
              parent has  already  set  the  cache  variable,   so  the  child&apos;s
              set(...CACHE...)  will do nothing, and evaluating the option vari&#8208;
              able will use the value from the normal variable, which hides  the
              cache variable.


       set_directory_properties
              Set a property of the directory.

                set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

              Set  a  property  for the current directory and subdirectories. If
              the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The proper&#8208;
              ties include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, INCLUDE_REGU&#8208;
              LAR_EXPRESSION,     and     ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.     ADDI&#8208;
              TIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as
              a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       set_property
              Set a named property in a given scope.
&#12;                set_property(&lt;GLOBAL                            |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                              TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                              SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                              TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]     |
                              CACHE     [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
                             [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1 [value2 ...]])

              Set one property on zero or more objects of a  scope.   The  first
              argument  determines  the  scope in which the property is set.  It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY scope defaults to  the  current  directory  but  another
              directory  (already  processed  by  CMake) may be named by full or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.


              SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
              file  properties  are  visible  only  to targets added in the same
              directory (CMakeLists.txt).


              TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.


              CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.


              The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by  the  name
              of  the  property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose
              the property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.   If
              the  APPEND  option  is given the list is appended to any existing
              property value.If the APPEND_STRING option is given the string  is
              append  to  any existing property value as string, i.e. it results
              in a longer string and not a list of strings.


       site_name
              Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

                site_name(variable)

                string(FIND &lt;string&gt; &lt;substring&gt; &lt;output variable&gt; [REVERSE])

              REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and  store  the
              match in the output variable.


              REGEX  MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times as
              possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.


              REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many  times  as
              possible  and  substitute the replacement expression for the match
              in the output.  The replace expression may refer  to  paren-delim&#8208;
              ited subexpressions of the match using \1, \2, ..., \9.  Note that
              two backslashes (\\1) are required in CMake code to  get  a  back&#8208;
              slash through argument parsing.


              REPLACE  will replace all occurrences of match_string in the input
              with replace_string and store the result in the output.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the input string.


              COMPARE  EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER  will compare the strings and
              store true or false in the output variable.


              ASCII will convert all numbers into  corresponding  ASCII  charac&#8208;
              ters.


              CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a
              file.


              TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.


              LENGTH will return a given string&apos;s length.


              SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string. If length  is
              -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin will be returned.


              STRIP  will  return a substring of a given string with leading and
              trailing spaces removed.


              RANDOM will return a random string of given length  consisting  of
              characters from the given alphabet. Default length is 5 characters
              and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case  let&#8208;
              ters.   If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be used
              to seed the random number generator.


              FIND will return the position where the given substring was  found
              in  the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was used, the command
              will search for the position of the last occurrence of the  speci&#8208;
              fied substring.


              The  following  characters have special meaning in regular expres&#8208;
              sions:


                 ^         Matches at beginning of a line
                 $         Matches at end of a line
                 .         Matches any single character
                 [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
                 [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
                  -        Matches any character in range on either side of a dash
                 *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
                 +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
                 ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
                 |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
                 ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced
                           in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved
                           by all regular expression-related commands, including
                           e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).


       unset  Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

                unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])

              Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If
              CACHE  is  present  then  the  variable  is removed from the cache
              instead of the current scope.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})

              in which case the variable will be removed from the current  envi&#8208;
              ronment.


       variable_watch
              Watch the CMake variable for change.

                variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to execute&gt;])

              If  the  specified  variable  changes, the message will be printed
              about the variable being changed. If the command is specified, the
              command  will  be executed. The command will receive the following
              arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
              &lt;stack&gt;)


       while  Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

                while(condition)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endwhile(condition)

              All  commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded
              without being  invoked.   Once  the  endwhile  is  evaluated,  the
              recorded  list  of commands is invoked as long as the condition is
              true. The condition is evaluated using the same logic  as  the  if
              command.


COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS
         CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.
&#12;       This  is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previ&#8208;
       ous CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility  reasons.
       You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;-)


MODULES
PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
       ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
              Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

              Normally  CMake  requires that all targets built in a project have
              globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is  nec&#8208;
              essary  to  generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS
              IDE generators.  It also allows the target names to be  referenced
              unambiguously.


              Makefile  generators  are  capable  of supporting duplicate custom
              target names.  For projects that care only about Makefile  genera&#8208;
              tors  and  do  not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one
              may set this property to true to allow duplicate  custom  targets.
              The  property  allows  multiple add_custom_target command calls in
              different directories to specify the same target  name.   However,
              setting  this  property will cause non-Makefile generators to pro&#8208;
              duce an error and refuse to generate the project.


       DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
              Specify which configurations are for debugging.

              The value must be a semi-colon  separated  list  of  configuration
              names.    Currently  this  property  is  used  only  by  the  tar&#8208;
              get_link_libraries command (see its  documentation  for  details).
              Additional uses may be defined in the future.


              This  property  must  be  set  at the top level of the project and
              before the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any
              entry  in  the  list  does not match a valid configuration for the
              project the behavior is undefined.


       DISABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

              List of features which are  disabled  during  the  CMake  run.  By
              default  it  contains  the  names  of  all packages which were not
              found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.  Pack&#8208;
              ages  which  are  searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add
              its own features to this list. This property is used by the macros
              in FeatureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_FEATURES
              List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

              List  of  features  which  are  enabled  during  the CMake run. By
              default it contains the names of all packages  which  were  found.
              This  is  determined  using  the  &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages
              which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own
              features to this list. This property is used by the macros in Fea&#8208;
              tureSummary.cmake.


       ENABLED_LANGUAGES
              Read-only property that contains the  list  of  currently  enabled
              languages

              Set to list of currently enabled languages.
&#12;       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
              Whether  FIND_LIBRARY  should  automatically search lib64 directo&#8208;
              ries.

              FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying  whether  the
              FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant
              of directories called lib in the search path when building  64-bit
              binaries.


       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
              Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.

              This  property  is  a  boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY
              command should find shared libraries with OpenBSD-style  versioned
              extension:  &quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;.  The property is set to true on
              OpenBSD and false on other platforms.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
              Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

              CMake automatically analyzes the  global  inter-target  dependency
              graph  at  the  beginning of native build system generation.  This
              property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.


       GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
              Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

              CMake automatically analyzes the  global  inter-target  dependency
              graph  at  the  beginning  of  native build system generation.  It
              reports an error if the dependency graph  contains  a  cycle  that
              does  not  consist  of  all STATIC library targets.  This property
              tells CMake to disallow all cycles completely, even  among  static
              libraries.


       IN_TRY_COMPILE
              Read-only  property  that  is true during a try-compile configura&#8208;
              tion.

              True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN  com&#8208;
              mand.


       PACKAGES_FOUND
              List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

              List  of packages which were found during the CMake run. Whether a
              package has been found is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND  vari&#8208;
              ables.


       PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
              List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

              List  of  packages  which  were  not  found  during the CMake run.
              Whether  a  package  has  been  found  is  determined  using   the
              &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.


       PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
              Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

              If not set, CMake uses &quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value
              for this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and  RUN_TESTS
              will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the documentation for
              the FOLDER target property.
&#12;       REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
              If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

              If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
              report  any  properties  or  variables  that were accessed but not
              defined into the filename specified in this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              Makefile  generators  prefix  compiler  commands  with  the  given
              launcher  command  line.   This  is intended to allow launchers to
              intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non-Makefile gen&#8208;
              erators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher
              command line.  This is intended to allow  launchers  to  intercept
              build  problems  with  high  granularity.  Non-Makefile generators
              currently ignore this property.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              Makefile generators prefix link  and  archive  commands  with  the
              given  launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers
              to intercept build problems with high  granularity.   Non-Makefile
              generators currently ignore this property.


       RULE_MESSAGES
              Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

              This  property  specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
              progress message describing what each build  rule  does.   If  the
              property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
              disable granular messages and report  only  as  each  target  com&#8208;
              pletes.   This  is  intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the
              build time cost of detailed  reports.   If  a  CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES
              cache  entry  exists its value initializes the value of this prop&#8208;
              erty.  Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.


       TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
              Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

              On AIX shared libraries may be named &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;.  This property
              is set to true on such platforms.


       TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
              Does the target platform support shared libraries.

              TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS  is  a  boolean specifying whether the
              target platform supports shared libraries. Basically  all  current
              general general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embed&#8208;
              ded systems with no or special OSs.


       USE_FOLDERS
              Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.

              If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF  by  default.  CMake
              generators  that  are  capable  of  organizing into a hierarchy of
              folders use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those
              folders.  See  also  the documentation for the FOLDER target prop&#8208;
              erty.


       __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
              Internal property

              Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.


PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
       ADVANCED
              True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

              This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
              interesting     only     for    advanced    configuration.     The
              mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.


       HELPSTRING
              Help associated with entry in GUIs.

              This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help  users  set
              it through a CMake GUI.


       MODIFIED
              Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

              This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
              interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.


       STRINGS
              Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

              For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of  val&#8208;
              ues.   CMake  GUIs  may  use  this  to  provide a selection widget
              instead of a generic string entry field.  This is for  convenience
              only.   CMake does not enforce that the value matches one of those
              listed.


       TYPE   Widget type for entry in GUIs.

              Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present wid&#8208;
              gets  to  help  users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a
              hint to determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:


                BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
                PATH          = Path to a directory.
                FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
                STRING        = Generic string value.
                INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
                STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
                UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

              Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by  the  command
              which creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).


       VALUE  Value of a cache entry.

              This  property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting
              this property always sets the value without checking, so use  with
              care.


PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
       ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
              Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.
&#12;              A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the &quot;make clean&quot;
              stage.


       CACHE_VARIABLES
              List of cache variables available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  cache  vari&#8208;
              ables currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


       CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
              Should the output of custom commands be left.

              If  this  is  true  then  the  outputs of custom commands for this
              directory will not be removed during the &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;  is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).
              This property will be initialized in each directory by  its  value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              This  property  will be initialized in each directory by its value
              in the directory&apos;s parent.



       DEFINITIONS
              For  CMake  2.4  compatibility  only.    Use   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              instead.

              This  read-only  property specifies the list of flags given so far
              to the add_definitions command.  It is intended for debugging pur&#8208;
              poses.  Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

              A  property  on  a  directory  that  indicates  if its targets are
              excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with  a
              Makefile  for  example  typing  make  will cause the targets to be
              built. The same concept applies to the default build of other gen&#8208;
              erators.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form


                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to


                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This  property  applies  to sources in all targets within a direc&#8208;
              tory.  The property value is initialized in each directory by  its
              value in the directory&apos;s parent.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This  property  specifies  the list of directories given so far to
              the include_directories command. This property exists on  directo&#8208;
              ries  and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from the
              include_directories command, values may be  set  directly  on  any
              directory  or  any target using the set_property command. A target
              gets its initial value for this property from  the  value  of  the
              directory  property.  A  directory gets its initial value from its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The  target  property values are used by the generators to set the
              include paths for the compiler. See also  the  include_directories
              command.


       INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              Include file scanning regular expression.

              This read-only property specifies the regular expression used dur&#8208;
              ing dependency scanning to match include files that should be fol&#8208;
              lowed.  See the include_regular_expression command.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LINK_DIRECTORIES
              List of linker search directories.

              This read-only property specifies the list of directories given so
              far to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
              purposes.


       LISTFILE_STACK
              The current stack of listfiles being processed.

              This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
              CMake  scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently
              being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an INCLUDE com&#8208;
              mand  then  that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto
              the stack.


       MACROS List of macro commands available in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of  CMake  macros  cur&#8208;
              rently  defined.   It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the
              macro command.


       PARENT_DIRECTORY
              Source directory that added current subdirectory.

              This read-only property specifies the source directory that  added
              the  current  source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In
              the top-level directory the value is the empty-string.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global property for a directory.
&#12;       TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
              A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

              If  you  specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
              processed when ctest is run on the directory.


       VARIABLES
              List of variables defined in the current directory.

              This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables cur&#8208;
              rently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.


PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
       ABSTRACT
              Is this source file an abstract class.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file rep&#8208;
              resents a class that is abstract. This only makes sense  for  lan&#8208;
              guages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
              by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).


              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition  values  with  spaces (but NMake does).  Xcode does not
              support per-configuration definitions on source files.


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain  values.   CMake  has work-arounds for many cases but some
              values may just not be possible to pass  correctly.   If  a  value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to  the  value.
              Your  work-around  may break in a future version of CMake that has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake does not reject these values outright because they  do  work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
              Note that Xcode does not  support  per-configuration  source  file
              flags so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.
&#12;
       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

              These  flags  will be added to the list of compile flags when this
              source file builds.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS  to  pass  additional
              preprocessor definitions.


       EXTERNAL_OBJECT
              If set to true then this is an object file.

              If  this property is set to true then the source file is really an
              object file and should not be compiled.  It will still  be  linked
              into the target though.


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
              fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will  pass  the  corresponding
              format  flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide For&#8208;
              tran_FORMAT property if all source files in  a  target  share  the
              same format.


       GENERATED
              Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

              If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will han&#8208;
              dle it differently in terms of dependency checking etc.  Otherwise
              having a non-existent source file could create problems.


       HEADER_FILE_ONLY
              Is this source file only a header file.

              A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
              header file with no associated implementation. This is  set  auto&#8208;
              matically  based  on  the  file  extension and is used by CMake to
              determine is certain dependency information should be computed.


       KEEP_EXTENSION
              Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

              If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
              will  be  the same as that of the source file. Normally the output
              file extension is computed based on the  language  of  the  source
              file, for example .cxx will go to a .o extension.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

              This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
              target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics  are
              currently specified.


       LANGUAGE
              What programming language is the file.

              A  property  that can be set to indicate what programming language
              the source file is. If it is not set the  language  is  determined
              based on the file extension. Typical values are CXX C etc. Setting
              this property for a file means this file will be compiled. Do  not
              set this for header or files that should not be compiled.


       LOCATION
              The full path to a source file.
&#12;              A  read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path
              to the source file.


       MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
              Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle, CFBundle, or  frame&#8208;
              work.

              Executable  targets  with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built
              as Mac OS  X  application  bundles  on  Apple  platforms.   Shared
              library  targets  with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac
              OS X frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library  targets  with
              the  BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on
              Apple platforms.  Source files listed  in  the  target  with  this
              property  set  will  be copied to a directory inside the bundle or
              framework content folder specified by  the  property  value.   For
              bundles  the  content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;.  For frame&#8208;
              works the content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;.
              For  cfbundles  the  content  folder  is  &quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Contents&quot;
              (unless the extension is changed).  See  the  PUBLIC_HEADER,  PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER,  and  RESOURCE target properties for specifying files
              meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or Resources directories.


       OBJECT_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

              Specifies a semicolon-separated list of  full-paths  to  files  on
              which  any object files compiled from this source file depend.  An
              object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is  newer
              than it.


              This  property  need  not  be  used to specify the dependency of a
              source file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although
              the  property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no
              longer necessary.  If the generated header file is  created  by  a
              custom  command  in  the same target as the source file, the auto&#8208;
              matic dependency scanning process will recognize  the  dependency.
              If  the  generated  header  file  is created by another target, an
              inter-target dependency should be created with  the  add_dependen&#8208;
              cies  command  (if one does not already exist due to linking rela&#8208;
              tionships).


       OBJECT_OUTPUTS
              Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

              Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If
              any  of  these  outputs  is missing the object will be recompiled.
              This is supported only on Makefile generators and will be  ignored
              on other generators.


       SYMBOLIC
              Is this just a name for a rule.

              If  SYMBOLIC  (boolean)  is  set  to true the build system will be
              informed that the source file is not actually created on disk  but
              instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.


       WRAP_EXCLUDE
              Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

              Some  packages  can  wrap source files into alternate languages to
              provide additional functionality. For example,  C++  code  can  be
              wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
              set to true (1 etc) that indicates then this  source  file  should
              not be wrapped.


PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME
              Old per-configuration target file base name.
&#12;              This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.  Use OUT&#8208;
              PUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.


       &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the value of this prop&#8208;
              erty is appended to the target  file  name  built  on  disk.   For
              non-executable  targets, this property is initialized by the value
              of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a  target
              is  created.   This  property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
              and App Bundles.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  archive  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property is initialized by the value  of  the  variable  CMAKE_AR&#8208;
              CHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This property specifies the base name for archive target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.


       AUTOMOC
              Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).

              AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle  the  Qt
              moc  preprocessor  automatically,  i.e.  without having to use the
              QT4_WRAP_CPP() macro. Currently Qt4 is supported. When this  prop&#8208;
              erty  is  set  to  TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build
              time and invoke moc accordingly. If  an  #include  statement  like
              #include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT class declaration is
              expected in the header, and moc is run on the header file.  If  an
              #include  statement  like  #include  &quot;foo.moc&quot;  is  found,  then a
              Q_OBJECT is expected in the current source file and moc is run  on
              the  file  itself.  Additionally,  all header files are parsed for
              Q_OBJECT macros, and if found,  moc  is  also  executed  on  those
              files.  The  resulting  moc files, which are not included as shown
              above in any of the source files are included in a generated &lt;tar&#8208;
              getname&gt;_automoc.cpp  file,  which is compiled as part of the tar&#8208;
              get.This property is initialized by  the  value  of  the  variable
              CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a target is created.


              Additional  command  line options for moc can be set via the AUTO&#8208;
              MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.


              By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE  variable  to  TRUE  the
              rules  for  searching the files which will be processed by moc can
              be relaxed. See the  documentation  for  this  variable  for  more
              details.


       AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional  options  for  moc  when using automoc (see the AUTOMOC
              property)

              This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is set to  TRUE
              for  this  target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
              options which will be used when moc is executed during the  build,
              i.e.  it  is  equivalent  to  the optional OPTIONS argument of the
              qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.


              By default it is empty.


       BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

              BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether  to  link
              the  target  in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
              precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
              before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is  set  when  a
              target is created.


       BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.

              If  a  module library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac.  It  will  have  the
              directory  structure  required for a CFBundle and will be suitable
              to be used for  creating  Browser  Plugins  or  other  application
              resources.


       BUNDLE_EXTENSION
              The file extension used to name a BUNDLE target on the Mac.

              The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also use &quot;plugin&quot; or what&#8208;
              ever file extension is required by the host app for your bundle.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
              Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to  a  semicolon-sepa&#8208;
              rated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions using the syntax VAR or
              VAR=value.  Function-style definitions are not  supported.   CMake
              will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build
              system (note that CMake language syntax  may  require  escapes  to
              specify  some values).  This property may be set on a per-configu&#8208;
              ration basis using  the  name  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  where
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex. &quot;COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG&quot;).
&#12;
              CMake  will  automatically drop some definitions that are not sup&#8208;
              ported by the native build tool.  The VS6  IDE  does  not  support
              definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


              Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
              certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many  cases  but  some
              values  may  just  not  be possible to pass correctly.  If a value
              does  not  seem  to  be  escaped  correctly,  do  not  attempt  to
              work-around  the  problem by adding escape sequences to the value.
              Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake  that  has
              improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a
              (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known lim&#8208;
              itations include:


                #          - broken almost everywhere
                ;          - broken in VS IDE and Borland Makefiles
                ,          - broken in VS IDE
                %          - broken in some cases in NMake
                &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
                ^ &lt; &gt; \&quot;   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

              CMake  does  not reject these values outright because they do work
              in some cases.  Use with caution.


       COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.


       COMPILE_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used  to
              build  sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
              additional preprocessor definitions.


       DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See target property &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.

              This property is a special case of the more-general &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POST&#8208;
              FIX property for the DEBUG configuration.


       DEFINE_SYMBOL
              Define a symbol when compiling this target&apos;s sources.

              DEFINE_SYMBOL  sets  the  name  of the preprocessor symbol defined
              when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set  here  then
              it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if
              the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for  head&#8208;
              ers  to  know  whether  they  are being included from inside their
              library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport  decora&#8208;
              tions.


       ENABLE_EXPORTS
              Specify  whether  an  executable exports symbols for loadable mod&#8208;
              ules.

              Normally an executable does not export any symbols because  it  is
              the  final  program.   It  is possible for an executable to export
              symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set
              to true CMake will allow other targets to &quot;link&quot; to the executable
              with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms  a  tar&#8208;
              get-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that
              link to it.  For DLL platforms an import library will  be  created
              for  the  exported  symbols  and  then used for linking.  All Win&#8208;
              dows-based  systems  including  Cygwin  are  DLL  platforms.   For
              non-DLL  platforms that require all symbols to be resolved at link
              time, such as Mac OS X, the module will &quot;link&quot; to  the  executable
              using  a  flag like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;.  For other non-DLL platforms
              the link rule is simply ignored  since  the  dynamic  loader  will
              automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.


       EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
              Exclude the target from the all target.

              A  property  on  a target that indicates if the target is excluded
              from the default build target. If it is not, then with a  Makefile
              for  example  typing  make will cause this target to be built. The
              same concept applies to the default  build  of  other  generators.
              Installing  a  target  with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has unde&#8208;
              fined behavior.


       EchoString
              A message to be displayed when the target is built.

              A message to display on some generators (such as  makefiles)  when
              the target is built.


       FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

              Targets  with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities
              in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same FOLDER  property
              value  will appear next to each other in a folder of that name. To
              nest folders, use FOLDER values such  as  &apos;GUI/Dialogs&apos;  with  &apos;/&apos;
              characters separating folder levels.


       FRAMEWORK
              This target is a framework on the Mac.

              If  a  shared library target has this property set to true it will
              be built as a framework when built on the mac. It  will  have  the
              directory  structure required for a framework and will be suitable
              to be used with the -framework option


       Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source  files  in  a
              target  use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the cor&#8208;
              responding format flag to the compiler.  Use  the  source-specific
              Fortran_FORMAT  property to change the format of a specific source
              file.  If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when  a  target
              is created its value is used to initialize this property.


       Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Specify  output directory for Fortran modules provided by the tar&#8208;
              get.

              If the target contains Fortran source files that  provide  modules
              and the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies
              the directory in which the modules  will  be  placed.   When  this
              property is not set the modules will be placed in the build direc&#8208;
              tory corresponding to the target&apos;s source directory.  If the vari&#8208;
              able  CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY  is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated its value is used to initialize this property.


              Note that some compilers will automatically search the module out&#8208;
              put  directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will
              not.  If your sources USE modules their location must be specified
              by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.


       GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
              Generator&apos;s file for this target.

              An internal property used by some generators to record the name of
              project or dsp file associated with this target.


       GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              When linking a shared library or executable that  exports  symbols
              using  GNU  tools  on  Windows  (MinGW/MSYS)  with  Visual  Studio
              installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS  for&#8208;
              mat   (.lib).    Both   import  libraries  will  be  installed  by
              install(TARGETS) and exported by install(EXPORT) and  export()  to
              be linked by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.


              If  the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
              value is used to initialize this property.  The variable  must  be
              set  prior  to  the  first command that enables a language such as
              project() or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an
              option  to the user automatically when configuring on Windows with
              GNU tools.


       HAS_CXX
              Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

              This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
              See that property&apos;s documentation for details.


       IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
              Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

              This  property  specifies  rules  to transform macro-like #include
              lines during implicit dependency scanning  of  C  and  C++  source
              files.   The  list  of rules must be semicolon-separated with each
              entry of the form &quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the %  must  be  lit&#8208;
              eral).   During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on
              #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the  macro
              argument substituted for &apos;%&apos;.  For example, the entry


                MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

              will convert lines of the form


                #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

              to


                #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

              allowing the dependency to be followed.


              This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.


       IMPORTED
              Read-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

              The  boolean  value  of  this property is true for targets created
              with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It  is
              false for targets built within the project.


       IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
              Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

              Set  this  to  the  list  of  configuration names available for an
              IMPORTED target.  The names correspond to  configurations  defined
              in  the project from which the target is imported.  If the import&#8208;
              ing project uses a different set of configurations the  names  may
              be   mapped   using   the  MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.
&#12;
       IMPORTED_IMPLIB
              Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot;  part  of  a  windows  DLL.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
              Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

              Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries  as  part
              of  their  implementation.   On some platforms the linker searches
              for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including
              in  the  link.   Set this property to the list of dependent shared
              libraries of an imported library.  The  list  should  be  disjoint
              from  the  list of interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES property.  On platforms requiring dependent  shared
              libraries  to  be  found  at link time CMake uses this list to add
              appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.  If  set,  this  property  com&#8208;
              pletely  overrides  the  generic property for the named configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
              Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.

              Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to pro&#8208;
              duce  a  STATIC  IMPORTED  library  (such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;).  CMake
              accounts for these languages when computing how to link  a  target
              to  the  imported library.  For example, when a C executable links
              to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker  to
              satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library.


              This   property  is  ignored  for  targets  that  are  not  STATIC
              libraries.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when
              an IMPORTED library target  is  linked  to  another  target.   The
              libraries  will  be  included  on  the  link  line for the target.
              Unlike  the  LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  property,   this   property
              applies  to all imported target types, including STATIC libraries.
              This property is ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
&#12;              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from  which  the  target  is imported.  If set, this property com&#8208;
              pletely overrides the generic property for  the  named  configura&#8208;
              tion.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

              This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.


       IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.

              If  set,  this  property completely overrides the generic property
              for the named configuration.


       IMPORTED_LOCATION
              Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

              Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.   For
              executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bun&#8208;
              dles on OS X this is the location of the  executable  file  inside
              Contents/MacOS  under  the  application bundle folder.  For static
              libraries and modules this is the location of the library or  mod&#8208;
              ule.   For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the loca&#8208;
              tion of the shared library.  For frameworks on OS X  this  is  the
              location  of  the  library  file symlink just inside the framework
              folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part  of  the
              library.   For  UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file
              to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets.


              Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the  configuration-specific
              property  IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  is set.  To get the location
              of an imported target read one of the LOCATION  or  LOCATION_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt; properties.


       IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
              Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no &quot;soname&quot;.

              Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that
              has  no  &quot;soname&quot; field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands
              for some platforms to prevent the linker from using  the  path  to
              the   library  in  place  of  its  missing  soname.   Ignored  for
              non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.

              Configuration names correspond to those provided  by  the  project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORTED_SONAME
              The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

              Set  this  to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an imported shared library.
              This is meaningful  only  on  platforms  supporting  the  feature.
              Ignored for non-imported targets.


       IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

              Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project
              from which the target is imported.


       IMPORT_PREFIX
              What comes before the import library name.

              Similar to  the  target  property  PREFIX,  but  used  for  import
              libraries  (typically  corresponding  to a DLL) instead of regular
              libraries. A target property that can be set to override the  pre&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       IMPORT_SUFFIX
              What comes after the import library name.

              Similar  to  the  target  property  SUFFIX,  but  used  for import
              libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL)  instead  of  regular
              libraries.  A target property that can be set to override the suf&#8208;
              fix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import library name.


       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              List of preprocessor include file search directories.

              This property specifies the list of directories given  so  far  to
              the  include_directories command. This property exists on directo&#8208;
              ries and  targets.  In  addition  to  accepting  values  from  the
              include_directories  command,  values  may  be set directly on any
              directory or any target using the set_property command.  A  target
              gets  its  initial  value  for this property from the value of the
              directory property. A directory gets its initial  value  from  its
              parent directory if it has one. Both directory and target property
              values are adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.


              The target property values are used by the generators to  set  the
              include  paths  for the compiler. See also the include_directories
              command.


       INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory  portion  of
              the  &quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in
              the installed targets.


       INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed  targets (for platforms that support it).  This property
              is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if
              it is set when a target is created.


       INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH  is a boolean that if set to true will
              append directories in the  linker  search  path  and  outside  the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if  it  is
              set when a target is created.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
              Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

              If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
              known to be supported by the compiler.


       INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.
&#12;              This is a per-configuration version  of  INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA&#8208;
              TION.   If  set,  this property overrides the generic property for
              the named configuration.


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

              Target label semantics are currently unspecified.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the directory into  which  library  target
              files  should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)
              append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  direc&#8208;
              tory.   There  are  three kinds of target files that may be built:
              archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as
              runtime  targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive
              targets. Module libraries are always treated as  library  targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets. For DLL platforms the  DLL  part  of  a  shared  library  is
              treated  as  a runtime target and the corresponding import library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is  set
              when a target is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target files.

              This  is  a per-configuration version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a
              per-configuration  subdirectory  to the specified directory.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target
              is created.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This property specifies the base name for library target files. It
              overrides  OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.  There
              are three kinds of  target  files  that  may  be  built:  archive,
              library,  and  runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime
              targets. Static libraries are always treated as  archive  targets.
              Module  libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets. For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated  as
              an  archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
              DLL platforms.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.


       LINKER_LANGUAGE
              Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

              For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the lan&#8208;
              guage  whose  compiler  is used to link the target (such as &quot;C&quot; or
              &quot;CXX&quot;).  A typical value for an executable is the language of  the
              source file providing the program entry point (main).  If not set,
              the language with the  highest  linker  preference  value  is  the
              default.    See  documentation  of  CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              variables.


       LINK_DEPENDS
              Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.
&#12;              Specifies a semicolon-separated list of  full-paths  to  files  on
              which  the  link  rule for this target depends.  The target binary
              will be linked if any of the named files is newer than it.


              This property  is  ignored  by  non-Makefile  generators.   It  is
              intended  to  specify  dependencies on &quot;linker scripts&quot; for custom
              Makefile link rules.


       LINK_FLAGS
              Additional flags to use when linking this target.

              The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
              step  of  a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to the configura&#8208;
              tion &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDE&#8208;
              BINFO.


       LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration linker flags for a target.

              This is the configuration-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              List  public  interface  libraries  for  a  shared library or exe&#8208;
              cutable.

              By default linking to a shared library target  transitively  links
              to  targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an exe&#8208;
              cutable with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no  default
              transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the
              default transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.   When
              the target is linked into another target the libraries listed (and
              recursively their link interface libraries) will  be  provided  to
              the  other  target  also.  If the list is empty then no transitive
              link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is  linked
              into  another  target  even if the default set is non-empty.  This
              property  is  initialized   by   the   value   of   the   variable
              CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES  if it is set when a target is cre&#8208;
              ated.  This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.


       LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

              This  is  the  configuration-specific   version   of   LINK_INTER&#8208;
              FACE_LIBRARIES.   If  set,  this property completely overrides the
              generic property for the named configuration.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
              Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

              When linking to a STATIC library target with  cyclic  dependencies
              the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in
              the strongly connected component of the dependency  graph.   CMake
              by  default  constructs the link line so that the linker will scan
              through the component at least twice.  This property specifies the
              minimum  number  of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake
              uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.


       LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

              This is the configuration-specific version of  LINK_INTERFACE_MUL&#8208;
              TIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic
              property for the named configuration.


       LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
              End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds
              an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the
              linker search type back  to  its  starting  type.   This  property
              switches  the  final  linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of
              how it started.  See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.


       LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
              Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

              Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic  and  -Bdynamic  to
              determine  whether  to  use  static  or shared libraries for -lXXX
              options.  CMake uses these  options  to  set  the  link  type  for
              libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in
              implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker
              search  type  is  assumed  to be -Bdynamic at the beginning of the
              library list.  This property switches the assumption to  -Bstatic.
              It is intended for use when linking an executable statically (e.g.
              with the GNU -static option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.


       LOCATION
              Read-only location of a target on disk.

              For an imported target, this read-only property returns the  value
              of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an unspecified configuration
              &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the target.


              For a non-imported target, this property is provided for  compati&#8208;
              bility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location
              of an executable target&apos;s output file for use  in  add_custom_com&#8208;
              mand.   The  path may contain a build-system-specific portion that
              is replaced at build time with  the  configuration  getting  built
              (such  as  &quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot;  in  VS). In CMake 2.6 and above
              add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name  in  its
              COMMAND  and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
              CMake 2.8.4  and  above  add_custom_command  recognizes  generator
              expressions  to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
              Therefore this property is not needed  for  creating  custom  com&#8208;
              mands.


              Do  not  set properties that affect the location of a target after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.  Failure to follow this rule  is  not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

              A  read-only property that indicates where a target&apos;s main file is
              located on disk for the configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.  The  property  is
              defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported tar&#8208;
              get may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
              importing  project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
              otherwise uses an  arbitrary  available  configuration.   Use  the
              MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  property  to map imported configura&#8208;
              tions explicitly.


              Do not set properties that affect the location of a  target  after
              reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
              &quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot; or
              &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;.   Failure  to follow this rule is not
              diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

              When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac
              OS  X  will  be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a
              GUI executable that can be launched  from  the  Finder.   See  the
              MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST  target  property  for  information about
              creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.   This
              property   is   initialized   by   the   value   of  the  variable
              CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when a target is created.


       MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.

              An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be  built  as
              an application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file
              is  created  by  configuring  a  template   called   MacOSXBundle&#8208;
              Info.plist.in  located  in  the  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property
              specifies an alternative template file name which may  be  a  full
              path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
                MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
              Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.

              An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a frame&#8208;
              work on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file  is  created  by
              configuring a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located
              in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an  alternative
              template file name which may be a full path.


              The  following  target properties may be set to specify content to
              be configured into the file:


                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
                MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION

              CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all  targets
              in  a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a
              custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may  of  course
              hard-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.


       MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target&apos;s configuration.

              Set  this to the list of configurations of an imported target that
              may be used for  the  current  project&apos;s  &lt;CONFIG&gt;  configuration.
              Targets imported from another project may not provide the same set
              of configuration names available in the current project.   Setting
              this  property  tells CMake what imported configurations are suit&#8208;
              able for use when building the &lt;CONFIG&gt; configuration.  The  first
              configuration  in  the  list  found to be provided by the imported
              target is selected.  If this property is set and no matching  con&#8208;
              figurations  are available, then the imported target is considered
              to be not found.  This property is ignored for  non-imported  tar&#8208;
              gets.
&#12;
       NO_SONAME
              Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking a shared library or module.

              Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library or mod&#8208;
              ule should not have &quot;soname&quot; set. Default is to  set  &quot;soname&quot;  on
              all  shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports
              it. Generally, use this property only for leaf  private  libraries
              or  plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other
              targets link against, on some platforms a  linker  will  insert  a
              full  path  to  the  library  (as specified at link time) into the
              dynamic  section  of  the  dependent   binary.   Therefore,   once
              installed,  dynamic  loader  may  eventually  fail  to  locate the
              library for the binary.


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES
              Target specific architectures for OS X.

              The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture
              for targets on OS X.  This property is initialized by the value of
              the variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
              created.   Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the binary archi&#8208;
              tectures on a per-configuration basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt; is an  upper-case
              name (ex: &quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).


       OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.

              This  property is the configuration-specific version of OSX_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURES.


       OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for target files.

              This sets the base name for output files created for an executable
              or library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
              default.


       OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration target file base name.

              This is the configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.


       POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              Whether to create a position-independent target

              The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines whether position
              independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
              property is true by default for SHARED and MODULE library  targets
              and false otherwise.


       POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The  PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL  com&#8208;
              mand instead.


       PREFIX What comes before the library name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
              &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.


       PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Deprecated install support.

              The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are  the
              old  way  to  specify  CMake  scripts  to  run  before  and  after
              installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TAR&#8208;
              GETS  command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL com&#8208;
              mand instead.


       PRIVATE_HEADER
              Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  PrivateHeaders  directory  inside  the  framework folder.  On
              non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the  PRI&#8208;
              VATE_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       PROJECT_LABEL
              Change the name of a target in an IDE.

              Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
              Studio.


       PUBLIC_HEADER
              Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
              the  Headers  directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
              platforms these headers may be installed using  the  PUBLIC_HEADER
              option to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RESOURCE
              Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

              Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
              frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
              This  property  may  be set to a list of files to be placed in the
              Resources directory inside the  framework  folder.   On  non-Apple
              platforms  these  files may be installed using the RESOURCE option
              to the install(TARGETS) command.


       RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
              Specify a launcher for compile rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
              Specify a launcher for custom rules.

              See  the global property of the same name for details.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
              Specify a launcher for link rules.

              See the global property of the same name for details.  This  over&#8208;
              rides the global and directory property for a target.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the directory into which runtime target
              files should be built. Multi-configuration generators (VS,  Xcode)
              append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory to the specified direc&#8208;
              tory.  There are three kinds of target files that  may  be  built:
              archive,  library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as
              runtime targets. Static libraries are always  treated  as  archive
              targets.  Module  libraries are always treated as library targets.
              For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library tar&#8208;
              gets.  For  DLL  platforms  the  DLL  part  of a shared library is
              treated as a runtime target and the corresponding  import  library
              is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based systems includ&#8208;
              ing Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the
              value  of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set
              when a target is created.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target files.

              This is a per-configuration version  of  RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
              but  multi-configuration  generators  (VS,  Xcode) do NOT append a
              per-configuration subdirectory to the specified  directory.   This
              property  is  initialized  by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN&#8208;
              TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a target is  cre&#8208;
              ated.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
              Output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This  property  specifies  the base name for runtime target files.
              It  overrides  OUTPUT_NAME  and  OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;  properties.
              There  are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive,
              library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated  as  runtime
              targets.  Static  libraries are always treated as archive targets.
              Module libraries  are  always  treated  as  library  targets.  For
              non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
              For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a
              runtime  target and the corresponding import library is treated as
              an archive target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin  are
              DLL platforms.


       RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.

              This is the configuration-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.


       SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

              SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
              generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from  the  build
              tree.   This  property is initialized by the value of the variable
              CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.


       SOURCES
              Source names specified for a target.

              Read-only list of sources  specified  for  a  target.   The  names
              returned  are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_proper&#8208;
              ties command.


       SOVERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  SOVERSION  is  ignored  if NO_SONAME property is set. For
              shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION  attribute
              is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version number. These numbers
              are used as the image version of the binary.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
              Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

              Extra flags to use when linking a static library.


       STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              Per-configuration flags for creating a static library.

              This     is     the     configuration-specific     version      of
              STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.


       SUFFIX What comes after the target name.

              A  target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
              &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of a library, module or executable.


       TYPE   The type of the target.

              This read-only property can be used to test the type of the  given
              target.   It   will  be  one  of  STATIC_LIBRARY,  MODULE_LIBRARY,
              SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.


       VERSION
              What version number is this target.

              For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to  specify
              the  build  version and api version respectively. When building or
              installing appropriate symlinks are created if the  platform  sup&#8208;
              ports  symlinks  and  the linker supports so-names. If only one of
              both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same  version
              number.  For  executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
              version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are cre&#8208;
              ated  if  the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and
              executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to  extract
              a  &quot;major.minor&quot;  version  number.  These  numbers are used as the
              image version of the binary.


       VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio managed project .NET references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to  a  gener&#8208;
              ated  Visual  Studio  project.  For  example,  &quot;System;System.Win&#8208;
              dows.Forms&quot;.


       VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;
              Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

              Tell the Visual  Studio  generator  to  set  the  global  variable
              &apos;&lt;variable&gt;&apos;  to  a  given  value  in  the generated Visual Studio
              project. Ignored on other generators. Qt integration works  better
              if  VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.
              For example, &quot;4.7.3&quot;


       VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Sets  the  &quot;keyword&quot;  attribute  for  a  generated  Visual  Studio
              project.  Defaults  to  &quot;Win32Proj&quot;. You may wish to override this
              value with &quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio managed
              C++ unit test project.


       VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
              Visual Studio project type(s).

              Can  be  set  to  one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
              indicate the type of project. This value is copied  verbatim  into
              the generated project file. Example for a managed C++ unit testing
              project:


               {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

              UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.


       VS_KEYWORD
              Visual Studio project keyword.

              Can be set to change the visual studio  keyword,  for  example  QT
              integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.


       VS_SCC_AUXPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
              property.


       VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code  control  local
              path property.


       VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

              Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
              name property.


       VS_SCC_PROVIDER
              Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

              Can be set  to  change  the  visual  studio  source  code  control
              provider property.


       VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
              Visual  Studio project C++/CX language extensions for Windows Run&#8208;
              time

              Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.


       VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
              Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

              Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a  gener&#8208;
              ated   Visual   Studio   project.   For   example,   &quot;Windows;Win&#8208;
              dows.UI.Core&quot;.


       WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

              When this property is set to true the executable  when  linked  on
              Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of
              just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead  of  a  console
              application.   See  the  CMAKE_MFC_FLAG  variable documentation to
              configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.   This  property  is
              initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if
              it is set when a target is created.


       XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;
              Set Xcode target attributes directly.

              Tell the Xcode generator to set &apos;&lt;an-attribute&gt;&apos; to a given  value
              in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.


PROPERTIES ON TESTS
       ATTACHED_FILES
              Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

              Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and sub&#8208;
              mitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.


       ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
              Attach a list of files to  a  dashboard  submission  if  the  test
              fails.

              Same  as  ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if
              the test does not pass.


       COST   Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test  set  will  be
              run in descending order of cost.

              This property describes the cost of a test. You can explicitly set
              this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.


       DEPENDS
              Specifies that this test should only be run  after  the  specified
              list of tests.

              Set  this  to a list of tests that must finish before this test is
              run.


       ENVIRONMENT
              Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a
              test.

              If  set  to a list of environment variables and values of the form
              MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while run&#8208;
              ning  the  test. The environment is restored to its previous state
              after the test is done.


       FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

              If set, if the output matches one  of  specified  regular  expres&#8208;
              sions,  the  test  will  fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              &quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;


       LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

              The list is reported in dashboard submissions.


       MEASUREMENT
              Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

              If set to a name then that name will be reported  to  CDASH  as  a
              named  measurement with a value of 1. You may also specify a value
              by setting MEASUREMENT to &quot;measurement=value&quot;.


       PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
              The output must match this regular  expression  for  the  test  to
              pass.

              If set, the test output will be checked against the specified reg&#8208;
              ular expressions and at least one of the regular  expressions  has
              to match, otherwise the test will fail.


       PROCESSORS
              How many process slots this test requires

              Denotes the number of processors that this test will require. This
              is typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction
              with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.


       REQUIRED_FILES
              List of files required to run the test.

              If  set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of
              the files exist.


       RESOURCE_LOCK
              Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

              If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaran&#8208;
              teed not to run concurrently.


       RUN_SERIAL
              Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

              Use  this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
              option to specify that this test should not  be  run  in  parallel
              with any other tests.


       TIMEOUT
              How many seconds to allow for this test.

              This  property  if set will limit a test to not take more than the
              specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds  that  the  test
              process  will be killed and ctest will move to the next test. This
              setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.


       WILL_FAIL
              If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

              This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail  and
              return a non zero return code.


       WORKING_DIRECTORY
              The directory from which the test executable will be called.

              If  this  is not set it is called from the directory the test exe&#8208;
              cutable is located in.


VARIABLES
       CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask CPack to error out as soon as a  file  with  absolute  INSTALL
              DESTINATION is encountered.

              The  fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offend&#8208;
              ing file takes place. Some  CPack  generators,  like  NSIS,enforce
              this  internally.  This  variable  triggers  the  definition  ofC&#8208;
              MAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION  when  CPack  runsVari&#8208;
              ables common to all CPack generators


VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
       BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
              Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

              If  present  and  true,  this will cause all libraries to be built
              shared unless  the  library  was  explicitly  added  as  a  static
              library.  This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so
              that each user of a project can decide if they want to  build  the
              project using shared or static libraries.


       CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
              List  of files which have been installed using  an ABSOLUTE DESTI&#8208;
              NATION path.

              This variable is defined  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts.  It  can  be  used  (read-only) by program or script that
              source those install scripts. This is used by some  CPack  genera&#8208;
              tors (e.g. RPM).


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
              Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.
&#12;              By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the documenta&#8208;
              tion of the AUTOMOC target property.  When set to TRUE, it accepts
              more  input  and tries to find the correct input file for moc even
              if it differs from the documented behaviour. In this mode it  e.g.
              also  checks  whether a header file is intended to be processed by
              moc when a &quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.


              Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.


       CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
              Version of cmake required to build project

              From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this  specifies
              what  version  of CMake should be supported. By default this value
              is the version number of CMake that you are running. You  can  set
              this  to  an older version of CMake to support deprecated commands
              of CMake in projects that were written to use  older  versions  of
              CMake.  This  can  be set by the user or set at the beginning of a
              CMakeLists file.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
              Specifies the build type for make based generators.

              This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possi&#8208;
              ble  values  are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSiz&#8208;
              eRel. This variable is only supported for make  based  generators.
              If  this  variable is supported, then CMake will also provide ini&#8208;
              tial    values    for    the    variables    with     the     name
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For exam&#8208;
              ple, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then  CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG  will
              be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.


       CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
              Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.

              When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
              Default is ON.


       CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
              Specifies the available build types.

              This specifies what build types will be available such  as  Debug,
              Release,  RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most
              platforms. But can be extended to provide other build  types.  See
              also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.


       CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;
              Variable for disabling find_package() calls.

              Every  non-REQUIRED  find_package()  call in a project can be dis&#8208;
              abled by setting the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Package&#8208;
              Name&gt;  to  TRUE.  This  can  be used to build a project without an
              optional package, although that package is installed.


              This switch should be used during the initial CMake run. Otherwise
              if the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
              variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.
              In  the  case  it is recommended to remove the cache variables for
              this package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U


       CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file with
              absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              The  fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offend&#8208;
              ing file takes place. This variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated
              cmake_install.cmake scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while
              running the script, it may  get  fatal  error  messages  from  the
              script.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
              Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

              This  specifies  what  prefixes  to  add to library names when the
              find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX systems this  is
              typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
              will look for libfoo.


       CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
              Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

              This specifies what suffixes to add  to  library  names  when  the
              find_library  command looks for libraries. On Windows systems this
              is typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to  find  the
              foo library it will look for foo.dll etc.


       CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
              Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit mode.

              If find_package is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
              CONFIG  or  NO_MODULE)  and  no  Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake  module   is   in
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH  then  CMake  implicitly assumes that the caller
              intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
              configuration  file  is found then the wording of the failure mes&#8208;
              sage must account for both the case that  the  package  is  really
              missing and the case that the project has a bug and failed to pro&#8208;
              vide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an
              explicit  mode  option  then  the failure message can be more spe&#8208;
              cific.


              Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell find_package
              to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps devel&#8208;
              opers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to find_package
              within a project.


       CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would  normally  search.  By default this is empty; it is
              intended to be set by the  project.  Note  that  CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
              takes  a  list  of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If you
              want to ignore paths under prefixes  (bin,  include,  lib,  etc.),
              you&apos;ll  need  to  specify  them  explicitly.  See  also CMAKE_PRE&#8208;
              FIX_PATH,   CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,   CMAKE_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will  be  used  both by FIND_FILE() and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories  for the existence of the file which is currently searched.
              By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by  the  project.
              See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
              Default component used in install() commands.

              If  an  install()  command is used without the COMPONENT argument,
              these files will be grouped into a default component. The name  of
              this  default  install component will be taken from this variable.
              It defaults to &quot;Unspecified&quot;.
&#12;
       CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
              Install directory used by install.

              If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,  this  directory
              is pre-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults
              to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies  a  path  which  will   be   used   by   FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY()  will  check  each of the contained directories for
              the existence of the  library  which  is  currently  searched.  By
              default  it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See
              also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
              Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

              This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will  enable  MFC  in
              the  application.  It should be set to 1 for static the static MFC
              library, and 2 for the shared MFC library.  This is used in visual
              studio 6 and 7 project files.   The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and
              the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:


              add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)


              set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)


              add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})



       CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
              List of directories to search for CMake modules.

              Commands like include() and find_package()  search  for  files  in
              directories  listed  by  this variable before checking the default
              modules that come with CMake.


       CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
              Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

              This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake  to  tell
              CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.


       CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;
              Default  for  CMake  Policy  CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;  when  it is otherwise left
              unset.

              Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION)
              by  default  leave  policies  introduced  after  the given version
              unset.  Set CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to  spec&#8208;
              ify  the  default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where &lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy
              number.


              This variable should not be set by a project in  CMake  code;  use
              cmake_policy(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this vari&#8208;
              able       in       the       cache       (e.g.       -DCMAKE_POL&#8208;
              ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy not otherwise set
              by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a policy warning while  using
              old behavior or to NEW to try building the project with new behav&#8208;
              ior.


       CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include .  By  default  it  is
              empty,  it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence of the program which is currently searched. By default it is
              empty, it  is  intended  to  be  set  by  the  project.  See  also
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
              Don&apos;t make the install target depend on the all target.

              By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on the &quot;all&quot; target. This
              has the effect, that when &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL  is
              built,  first  the  &quot;all&quot;  target  is built, then the installation
              starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE,  this
              dependency  is not created, so the installation process will start
              immediately, independent from whether the project  has  been  com&#8208;
              pletely built or not.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
              Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.

              Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() com&#8208;
              mands This is useful in  cross-compiled  environments  where  some
              system  directories  contain  incompatible  but  possibly linkable
              libraries. For example, on  cross-compiled  cluster  environments,
              this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries
              meant for the front-end machine that  modules  like  FindX11  (and
              others)  would normally search. By default this contains a list of
              directories containing incompatible binaries for the host  system.
              See   also   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
              CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

              Specifies a path which  will  be  used  both  by  FIND_FILE()  and
              FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained direc&#8208;
              tories for the existence of the file which is currently  searched.
              By  default  it  contains the standard directories for the current
              system. It is NOT intended to be  modified  by  the  project,  use
              CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

              Specifies   a   path   which   will  be  used  by  FIND_LIBRARY().
              FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the  contained  directories  for
              the  existence  of  the  library  which  is currently searched. By
              default it contains the standard directories for the current  sys&#8208;
              tem.  It  is  NOT  intended  to  be  modified  by the project, use
              CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with  appropriate  suffixes
              added.

              Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It
              contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the  FIND_XXX()  commands  append
              appropriate  subdirectories  to the base directories. So FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM()  adds  /bin  to  each  of  the  directories  in  the  path,
              FIND_LIBRARY()  appends  /lib  to  each  of  the  directories, and
              FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default this con&#8208;
              tains  the  standard directories for the current system. It is NOT
              intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH  for
              this.     See     also    CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH,    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_LIBRARY_PATH,   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,   and    CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_IGNORE_PATH.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
              Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

              Specifies  a  path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PRO&#8208;
              GRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the  exis&#8208;
              tence  of  the  program which is currently searched. By default it
              contains the standard directories for the current  system.  It  is
              NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.


       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
              Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

              CMake loads the specified file while  enabling  support  for  each
              language  from either the project() or enable_language() commands.
              It is loaded after CMake&apos;s builtin compiler and platform  informa&#8208;
              tion  modules have been loaded but before the information is used.
              The file  may  set  platform  information  variables  to  override
              CMake&apos;s defaults.


              This  feature  is  intended for use only in overriding information
              variables that must be set before  CMake  builds  its  first  test
              project  to  check  that  the  compiler  for a language works.  It
              should not be used to load a file in cases that a normal include()
              will  work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot
              be  achieved  any  other  way.    For   example,   one   may   set
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT  to change the default value used to initialize
              CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.  The override file  should  NOT
              be  used  to  set  anything  that could be set after languages are
              enabled, such  as  variables  like  CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              that  affect  the  placement  of binaries.  Information set in the
              file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds too.


       CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with abso&#8208;
              lute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

              This  variable  is  used  by  CMake-generated  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts. If ones set this variable to ON while running the script,
              it may get warning messages from the script.


VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM
       APPLE  True if running on Mac OSX.

              Set to true on Mac OSX.


       BORLAND
              True if the borland compiler is being used.

              This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being used.


       CMAKE_CL_64
              Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft

              Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from Microsoft.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
              Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft
&#12;              Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Micro&#8208;
              soft.


       CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
              True for Apple OSXoperating systems.

              Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is being run on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system  instead  of  the
              target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system instead of
              the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

              The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is running on.

              The  same  as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system instead
              of the target system when cross compiling.


       CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
              True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

              Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE
              and CYGWIN).


       CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
              True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

              This is the value of CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected
              for one of the enabled languages.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
              Regex matching  possible  target  architecture  library  directory
              names.

              This  is used to detect CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the
              implicit linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.


       CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
              Maximum object file  full-path  length  allowed  by  native  build
              tools.

              CMake  computes  for every source file an object file name that is
              unique to the source file and deterministic with  respect  to  the
              full  path  to the source file.  This allows multiple source files
              in a target to share the same name if they lie in different direc&#8208;
              tories  without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However,
              it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so  CMake  shortens
              the  path  using  a hashing scheme when the full path to an object
              file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for  each  plat&#8208;
              form  that  is  sufficient for common tools, but some native tools
              may have a lower limit.  This variable may be set to  specify  the
              limit explicitly.  The value must be an integer no less than 128.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM
              Name of system cmake is compiling for.

              This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYS&#8208;
              TEM_VERSION,  like  this  ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VER&#8208;
              SION}.  If  CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION  is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is
              the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
              Name of the OS CMake is building for.

              This is the name of the operating system on which CMake is target&#8208;
              ing.    On  systems  that have the uname command, this variable is
              set to the output of uname -s.  Linux, Windows,   and  Darwin  for
              Mac OSX are the values found  on the big three operating systems.


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
              The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

              On  systems that support uname, this variable is set to the output
              of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value of the  environment
              variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE


       CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
              OS version CMake is building for.

              A  numeric  version string for the system, on systems that support
              uname, this variable is set to the output of uname  -r.  On  other
              systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.


       CYGWIN True for cygwin.

              Set to true when using CYGWIN.


       MSVC   True when using Microsoft Visual C

              Set  to true when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual
              C.


       MSVC80 True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0

              Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of  Microsoft  Visual
              C.


       MSVC_IDE
              True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE

              Set  to  true  when  the target platform is the Microsoft Visual C
              IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.


       MSVC_VERSION
              The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.

              Known version numbers are:


                1200 = VS  6.0
                1300 = VS  7.0
                1310 = VS  7.1
                1400 = VS  8.0
                1500 = VS  9.0
                1600 = VS 10.0
&#12;
       UNIX   True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

              Set to true when the target system is  UNIX  or  UNIX  like  (i.e.
              APPLE and CYGWIN).


       WIN32  True on windows systems, including win64.

              Set to true when the target system is Windows.


       XCODE_VERSION
              Version of Xcode (Xcode generator only).

              Under  the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode as speci&#8208;
              fied in &quot;Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist&quot; (such as &quot;3.1.2&quot;).


VARIABLES COMMON TO ALL CPACK GENERATORS
       CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
              List of files which have been installed using  an ABSOLUTE  DESTI&#8208;
              NATION path.

              This  variable  is a Read-Only variable which is set internally by
              CPack during installation and before packaging  using  CMAKE_ABSO&#8208;
              LUTE_DESTINATION_FILES defined in cmake_install.cmake scripts. The
              value can be used within CPack project configuration  file  and/or
              CPack&lt;GEN&gt;.cmake file of &lt;GEN&gt; generator.


       CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt;
              CPack generated options for binary generators

              The CPack.cmake module generates (when CPACK_GENERATOR is not set)
              a set of CMake options (see CMake option command) which  may  then
              be used to select the CPack generator(s) to be used when launching
              the package target.


       CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR
              What CMake generator should  be  used  if  the  project  is  CMake
              project.

              Defaults  to  the  value of CMAKE_GENERATOR few users will want to
              change this setting.


       CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS
              List of desktop links to create


       CPACK_GENERATOR
              List of CPack generators to use

              If  not  specified,  CPack  will   create   a   set   of   options
              CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g., CPACK_BINARY_NSIS) allowing the user
              to enable/disable individual generators. This variable may be used
              on the command line as well as in:


                  cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR=&quot;ZIP;TGZ&quot; /path/to/build/tree


       CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
              Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

              When  preparing  a  package  CPack  installs  the  item  under the
              so-called top level directory. The purpose of is to  include  (set
              to  1 or ON or TRUE) the top level directory in the package or not
              (set to 0 or OFF or FALSE).


              Each CPack generator as a built-in default value  for  this  vari&#8208;
              able.  E.g.  Archive  generators  (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top
              level whereas RPM or DEB don&apos;t. The user may override the  default
              value byt setting this variable.


              There       is      a      similar      variable      CPACK_COMPO&#8208;
              NENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORYwhich may be used to  override  the
              behavior  for the componentpackaging case which may have different
              default value forhistorical (now backward compatibility) reason.


       CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES
              Extra directories to install


       CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS
              List of four values that specify what project to install.

              The four values are: Build directory, Project Name, Project Compo&#8208;
              nent,  Directory.  If  omitted, CPack will build an installer that
              installers everything.


       CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS
              Extra commands to install components


       CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT
              Extra CMake script provided by the user.

              If set this CMake script will be  executed  by  CPack  during  its
              local  [CPack-private]  installation  which  is  done right before
              packaging the files. The  script  is  not  called  by  e.g.:  make
              install.


       CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL
              Disables the component-based installation mechanism.

              When  set the component specification is ignored and all installed
              items are put in a single &quot;MONOLITHIC&quot; package. Some CPack genera&#8208;
              tors  do  monolithic  packaging  by default and may be asked to do
              component packaging by  setting  CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL
              to 1/TRUE.


       CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
              The name of the CPack binary configuration file.

              This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module
              for binary installers. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE
              A text file used to describe the project.

              Used, for example, the introduction screen  of  a  CPack-generated
              Windows installer to describe the project.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
              Short description of the project (only a few words).


       CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY
              The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging.

              If  it is not set then this will default (internally) to the build
              dir. This variable may be defined in CPack config file or from the
              cpack  command  line  option  &quot;-B&quot;. If set the command line option
              override the value found in the config file.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES
              Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used
              to create Start Menu shortcuts.

              For  example,  setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will create a
              shortcut named &quot;CMake&quot; that will execute the installed  executable
              ccmake.  Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and OSXX11
              do).


       CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
              The name of the package file to generate, not including the exten&#8208;
              sion.

              For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686. The default value is


                ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON
              A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used
              by GUI installers).


       CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
              Installation directory on the target system.

              This may be used by some CPack generators like NSIS to  create  an
              installation  directory  e.g.,  &quot;CMake 2.5&quot; below the installation
              prefix. All installed element will be put inside this directory.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY
              Registry key used when installing this project.

              This is only used   by installer for Windows.



       CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME
              The name of the package (or application)

              If not specified, defaults to the project name.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR
              The name of the package vendor

              (e.g., &quot;Kitware&quot;).


       CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION
              Package full version, used internally

              By  default,  this  is  built  from   CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR,
              CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR, and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.


       CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR
              Package major Version


       CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR
              Package minor Version


       CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH
              Package patch Version


       CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
              The prefix used in the built package.

              Each CPack generator has a default value (like /usr). This default
              value may be overwritten from the CMakeLists.txt or the cpack com&#8208;
              mand line by setting an alternative value.


              e.g.  set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX &quot;/opt&quot;)


              This is not the same purpose as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX which is used
              when installing from the build tree without building a package.


       CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
              CPack-time project CPack configuration file.

              This file included at cpack time, once per generator  after  CPack
              has  set  CPACK_GENERATOR  to  the actual generator being used. It
              allows per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.


       CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE
              License to be embedded in the installer

              It will typically be displayed to the user  by  the  produced  in&#8208;
              staller (often with an explicit &quot;Accept&quot; button, for graphical in&#8208;
              stallers) prior to installation. This license file is NOT added to
              installed  file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If
              you want to install a license file (may be the same as  this  one)
              along  with your project you must add an appropriate CMake INSTALL
              command in your CMakeLists.txt.


       CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README
              ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer

              It typically describes in some detail the purpose of  the  project
              during the installation. Not all CPack generators uses this file.


       CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME
              Welcome file to be embedded in the installer.

              It welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in the graphi&#8208;
              cal installers on Windows and Mac OS X.


       CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
              Boolean toggle to make CPack use DESTDIR mechanism when packaging.

              DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used by  make&#8208;
              file  users  in order to install software at non-default location.
              It is a basic relocation mechanism. It  is  usually  invoked  like
              this:


               make DESTDIR=/home/john install

              which  will  install the concerned software using the installation
              prefix, e.g. &quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended with the DESTDIR  value  which
              finally  gives  &quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;.  When preparing a package,
              CPack first installs the items to be packaged in a local  (to  the
              build  tree) directory by using the same DESTDIR mechanism. Never&#8208;
              theless, if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then CPack will  set  DESTDIR
              before doing the local install. The most  noticeable difference is
              that   without   CPACK_SET_DESTDIR,   CPack   uses   CPACK_PACKAG&#8208;
              ING_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR set,
              CPack will use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix.


              Manually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply  be  neces&#8208;
              sary)  if  some install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake
              INSTALL command). However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and
              DEB installers tries to handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is
              seldom necessary for the user to set it.


       CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR
              List of generators used for the source packages.

              As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then CPack  will
              create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to
              select which packages will be generated.


       CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES
              Pattern of files in the source tree that won&apos;t  be  packaged  when
              building a source package.

              This  is a list of regular expression patterns (that must be prop&#8208;
              erly escaped), e.g., /CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*


       CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE
              The name of the CPack source configuration file.

              This file is the CPack configuration generated by the CPack module
              for source installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.


       CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME
              The name of the source package

              For example cmake-2.6.1.


       CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES
              List of files in the source tree that will be stripped.

              Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a bool&#8208;
              ean variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files
              evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).


       CPACK_STRIP_FILES
              List of files to be stripped

              Starting  with  CMake  2.6.0  CPACK_STRIP_FILES  will be a boolean
              variable which enables stripping of all files  (a  list  of  files
              evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).


       CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME
              System name, defaults to the value of ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.


       CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG
              Directory for the installed files


       CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
              Ask  CPack to warn each time a file with absolute INSTALL DESTINA&#8208;
              TION is encountered.

              This  variable  triggers  the  definition  of  CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSO&#8208;
              LUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION   when   CPack  runs  cmake_install.cmake
              scripts.


VARIABLES CONCERNING CPACK COMPONENTS
       CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL
              Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.

                Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy
                default behavior. e.g. RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds component.
                One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.


       CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL
              The list of component to install

                The default value of this variable is computed by CPack
                and contains all components defined by the project. The
                user may set it to only include the specified components.


       CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING
              Specify  how  components  are  grouped  for  multi-package  compo&#8208;
              nent-aware CPack generators.

                Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates several
                packages files when asked for component packaging. They group the component
                differently depending on the value of this variable:
                   - ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
                   - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
                   - IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group
                One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by using
                a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.


       CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS
              The  dependencies  (list  of  components)  on which this component
              depends.

       CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP
              The group of a component


       CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED
              True is this component is required

              Flags for RelWithDebInfo type or configuration.

              &lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is  RelWithDebInfo.  Short
              for Release With Debug Information.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
              File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

              This  is  a  list of file extensions that may be part of a project
              for a given language but are not compiled.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
              Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.
&#12;              CMake does not explicitly specify these  directories  on  compiler
              command  lines  for language &lt;LANG&gt;.  This prevents system include
              directories from being treated as user include directories on some
              compilers.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
              Implicit linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              Compilers  typically  pass directories containing language runtime
              libraries and default library search  paths  when  they  invoke  a
              linker.   These  paths  are implicit linker search directories for
              the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects these direc&#8208;
              tories for each language and reports the results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
              Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              Compilers  typically pass language runtime library names and other
              flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags  are  implicit  link
              options  for the compiler&apos;s language.  CMake automatically detects
              these libraries and  flags  for  each  language  and  reports  the
              results in this variable.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
              Target architecture library directory name detected for &lt;lang&gt;.

              If  the  &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an architecture-spe&#8208;
              cific system library search directory such as  &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt;
              this variable contains the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE
              Preference value for linker language selection.

              The  &quot;linker  language&quot; for executable, shared library, and module
              targets is the language whose compiler  will  invoke  the  linker.
              The  LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.
              Otherwise, the linker language is  that  whose  linker  preference
              value is highest among languages compiled and linked into the tar&#8208;
              get.  See also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES vari&#8208;
              able.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
              True if CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

              This  is  used  when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
              Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.
              A  language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
              considered if this variable is true.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE
              Rule variable to link and executable.

              Rule variable to link and executable for the given language.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
              Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

              This is the extension for an object file for the given &lt;LANG&gt;. For
              example .obj for C on Windows.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
              Size of pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This  holds  the  size  (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the
              target platform ABI.  It is defined for languages C and CXX (C++).


       CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
              Extensions of source files for the given language.

              This is the list of extensions for a given languages source files.


       CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt;
              True if the compiler is GNU.

              If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU compiler then  this  is
              TRUE, if not it is FALSE.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT
              Fortran default module output directory.

              Most  Fortran  compilers  write  .mod files to the current working
              directory.  For those that do not, this is set  to  &quot;.&quot;  and  used
              when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property is not set.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG
              Fortran flag for module output directory.

              This  stores the flag needed to pass the value of the Fortran_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_DIRECTORY target property to the compiler.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG
              Fortran flag to enable module output.

              Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.  For  oth&#8208;
              ers, this stores the flag needed to enable module output.


       CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
              An internal variable subject to change.

              This  is  used  in  determining the compiler ABI and is subject to
              change.


       CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt;
              Specify a CMake  file  that  overrides  platform  information  for
              &lt;LANG&gt;.

              This is a language-specific version of CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVER&#8208;
              RIDE loaded only when enabling language &lt;LANG&gt;.

VARIABLES SPECIFIC TO CPACK PACKAGEMAKER GENERATOR
       CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION
              The version of Mac OS X that the  resulting  PackageMaker  archive
              should be compatible with.

              Different  versions  of  Mac  OS X support different features. For
              example, CPack can only build component-based installers  for  Mac
              OS  X  10.4  or newer, and can only build installers that download
              component son-the-fly for Mac OS X 10.5 or newer. If  left  blank,
              this  value  will  be  set to the minimum version of Mac OS X that
              supports the requested features. Set this variable to  some  value
              (e.g.,  10.4)  only  if  you want to guarantee that your installer
              will work on that version of Mac OS  X,  and  don&apos;t  mind  missing
              extra features available in the installer shipping with later ver&#8208;
              sions of Mac OS X.


VARIABLES SPECIFIC TO CPACK RPM GENERATOR

                   Default   : -
                   May be used to embed a changelog in the spec file.
                   The refered file will be read and directly put after the %changelog
                   section.
&#12;
       CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE
              RPM compression type

                   Default   : -
                   May be used to override RPM compression type to be used
                   to build the RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default
                   to lzma or xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM.
                   Using this one can enforce compression type to be used.
                   Possible value are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.


       CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE
              Spec file template

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
                   spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this
                   cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
                   The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own
                   binary spec file which may be used with CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.


       CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE

                   Default   : 1
                   This is the numbering of the RPM package
                   itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the version of the
                   content (see CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default
                   value if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here
                   a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.

                   be installed using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to
                   install it at an alternate place see rpm(8).
                   Note that currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
                   If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning message
                   but if there is file installed with absolute path you&apos;ll get
                   unexpected behavior.


       CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES
              RPM spec requires field

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to set RPM dependencies (requires).
                   Note that you must enclose the complete requires string between quotes,
                   for example:
                   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES &quot;python &gt;= 2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8&quot;)
                   The required package list of an RPM file could be printed with

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
                   The refered script file(s) will be read and directly
                   put after the %post or %postun section
                   If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
                   each component can be overridden with
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   One may verify which scriptlet has been included with

                   put after the %pre or %preun section
                   If CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install script for
                   each component can be overridden with
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
                   CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   One may verify which scriptlet has been included with
                    rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm

                   Default   : -
                   This way of specifying post-install script is deprecated use
                   CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
                   May be used to set an RPM post-install command inside the spec file.
                   For example setting it to &quot;/bin/true&quot; may be used to prevent
                   rpmbuild to strip binaries.


       CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE
              RPM extended spec definitions lines

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec file.


       CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE
              A user provided spec file

                   Mandatory : NO
                   Default   : -
                   May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file
                   to be used by CPackRPM instead of generating the file.

VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
       CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX
              Default filename postfix for libraries under  configuration  &lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;.

              When  a non-executable target is created its &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX tar&#8208;
              get property is initialized with the value of this variable if  it
              is set.


       CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC
              Whether to handle moc automatically for Qt targets.

              This  variable  is  used to initialize the AUTOMOC property on all
              the targets. See that target property for additional information.


       CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
              Additional options for moc when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTOMOC).

              This variable is used to initialize the AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS  prop&#8208;
              erty  on  all the targets. See that target property for additional
              information.


       CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
              Use the install path for the RPATH

              Normally CMake uses the build tree for  the  RPATH  when  building
              executables  etc  on  systems that use RPATH. When the software is
              installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake  to  have  the
              install  RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software
              is always built with the install path for the RPATH and  does  not
              need to be relinked when installed.


       CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
              See variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.

              This  variable  is  a special case of the more-general CMAKE_&lt;CON&#8208;
              FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
              Linker flags used to create executables.

              Flags used by the linker when creating an executable.


       CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE]
              Flag used when linking an executable.

              Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating  exe&#8208;
              cutables.


       CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT
              Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.

              This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              Fortran module output directory.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_GNUtoMS
              Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).

              This  variable  is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property on tar&#8208;
              gets when they are created.  See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
              Automatically add the current source- and build directories to the
              include path.

              If this variable is enabled,  CMake  automatically  adds  in  each
              directory     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}     and     ${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path  for  this  directory.  These
              additional  include directories do not propagate down to subdirec&#8208;
              tories. This is useful  mainly  for  out-of-source  builds,  where
              files  generated into the build tree are included by files located
              in the source tree.


              By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the  INSTALL_NAME_DIR
              property  on all targets. See that target property for more infor&#8208;
              mation.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH
              The rpath to use for installed targets.

              A  semicolon-separated  list  specifying  the  rpath  to  use   in
              installed targets (for platforms that support it). This is used to
              initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
              Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

              CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
              will  append directories in the linker search path and outside the
              project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is used to initialize the  tar&#8208;
              get property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG
              The flag used to add a library search path to a compiler.

              The  flag  used to specify a library directory to the compiler. On
              most compilers this is &quot;-L&quot;.


       CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG
              Linker flag used to specify a .def file for dll creation.

              The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll  on  Windows,
              this is only defined on Windows.


       CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              Default value for LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

              The  flag  used before a library file path is given to the linker.
              This is needed only on very few platforms.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
              Flag used to link a library into an executable.

              The flag used to specify a library to link to an  executable.   On
              most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.


       CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE
              Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE property on
              all the targets. See that target property for additional  informa&#8208;
              tion.


       CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
              Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

              When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installa&#8208;
              tion than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a  builtin  editor
              to  change  the  RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is
              set to true then CMake will relink the binary before  installation
              instead of using its builtin editor.


       CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_FLAGS
              Default value for POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

              This  variable  is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
              property on all the targets. See that target  property  for  addi&#8208;
              tional information.


       CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is always built with no RPATH.


       CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
              Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

              Normally  CMake  uses  the  build tree for the RPATH when building
              executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When  the  software  is
              installed  the  executables  etc are relinked by CMake to have the
              install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then  the  software
              is  always  installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
              building.  This can be useful for example to allow  running  tests
              from  the  build directory with RPATH enabled before the installa&#8208;
              tion step.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
              CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.


       CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
              Build configuration used for try_compile and try_run projects.

              Projects  built by try_compile and try_run are built synchronously
              during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a  specific  build
              configuration  must  be  chosen even if the generated build system
              supports multiple configurations.


       CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
              Use relative paths (May not work!).

              If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake  will  use  relative  paths
              between  the source and binary tree. This option does not work for
              more complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possi&#8208;
              ble.  In general, it is not possible to move CMake generated make&#8208;
              files to a different location regardless  of  the  value  of  this
              variable.


       CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
              Default value for WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.

              This  variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE property
              on all the targets. See that target property for additional infor&#8208;
              mation.


       EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old executable location variable.

              The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this vari&#8208;
              able for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are  otherwise
              placed in this directory.


       LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
              Old library location variable.

              The   target   properties  ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,  LIBRARY_OUT&#8208;
              PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede  this  vari&#8208;
              able  for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise
              placed in this directory.


VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
       CMAKE_AR
              Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

              This specifies name of the program that creates archive or  static
              libraries.


       CMAKE_ARGC
              Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

              When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number
              of command line arguments. See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...


       CMAKE_ARGV0
              Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

              When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the  first
              command line argument. It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
              ... and so on, up to the number of command line  arguments  given.
              See also CMAKE_ARGC.


       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the top level of the build tree.

              This  is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
              tree.  For  an  in-source  build,  this  would  be  the  same   as
              CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.


       CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
              Tool used for the actual build process.

              This  variable  is set to the program that will be needed to build
              the output of CMake.   If the generator selected was Visual Studio
              6,  the  CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles
              it will be set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to
              devenv.   For Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be use&#8208;
              ful for adding special flags and commands based on the final build
              environment.


       CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
              The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

              This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt
              file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
              Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This is stores the major version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
              Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This is stores the minor version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
              Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

              This is stores the patch version of CMake used to  write  a  CMake
              cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake
              is run on a previously created cache file.


       CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
              Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

              For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
              build  tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a ref&#8208;
              erence to  a  build-time  variable  specifying  the  name  of  the
              per-configuration  output  subdirectory.   On  Makefile generators
              this evaluates to &quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
              build tree.  Example values:


                $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
                $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
                $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
                $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
                .                = Make-based tools

              Since  these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
              variable is suitable only for use in command lines  that  will  be
              evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:


                add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
                add_custom_command(
                  OUTPUT out.txt
                  COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
                  DEPENDS mytool in.txt
                  )
                add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

              Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose
              but has  been  left  for  compatibility  with  existing  projects.
              Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in
              its        COMMAND        option,         so         &quot;${CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot;  can  be  replaced by
              just &quot;mytool&quot;.


              This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
              multi-configuration  build  systems  the value of this variable is
              passed as the value of preprocessor symbol &quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot;  to  the
              compilation of all source files.


       CMAKE_COMMAND
              The full path to the cmake executable.

              This  is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is use&#8208;
              ful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option  for
              portable system commands. (e.g. /usr/local/bin/cmake


       CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
              Is CMake currently cross compiling.

              This  variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is cross com&#8208;
              piling. Specifically if the build platform is different  from  the
              target platform.


       CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
              Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.

              This  is the full path to the CTest executable ctest which is use&#8208;
              ful from custom commands that want to use the cmake -E option  for
              portable system commands.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
              The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

              This  the full path to the build directory that is currently being
              processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will
              create  a  binary  directory in the build tree, and as it is being
              processed this variable will be set. For in-source builds this  is
              the current source directory being processed.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
              Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set to the directory where the  listfile  which  is
              currently  being  processed  (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located.
              The value has dynamic scope.  When CMake  starts  processing  com&#8208;
              mands  in  a  source  file  it sets this variable to the directory
              where this file is located.  When CMake finishes  processing  com&#8208;
              mands from the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the
              value of the variable inside a macro or function is the  directory
              of  the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not
              the directory of the file containing the macro or function defini&#8208;
              tion.


              See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
              Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set to the  one  currently  being  processed.   The
              value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in
              a source file it sets this variable to the location of  the  file.
              When  CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores
              the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside  a
              macro  or  function  is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on
              the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function def&#8208;
              inition.


              See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
              The line number of the current file being processed.

              This  is  the line number of the file currently being processed by
              cmake.
&#12;       CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
              The path to the source directory currently being processed.

              This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
              processed by cmake.


       CMAKE_DL_LIBS
              Name of library containing dlopen and dlcose.

              The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in it, usually
              -ldl on most UNIX machines.


       CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
              Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.

              This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
              edit the cache.  For example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.


       CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
              The suffix for executables on this platform.

              The  suffix  to  use  for the end of an executable if any, .exe on
              Windows.


              CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this for language &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
              The extra generator used to build the project.

              When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop  generators,  CMake
              generates  Makefiles  (CMAKE_GENERATOR)  and  additionally project
              files for the respective IDE. This IDE project file  generator  is
              stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).


       CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
              Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

              Extensions  for  shared  libraries  other  than  that specified by
              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
              external  shared library files during analysis of libraries linked
              by a target.


       CMAKE_GENERATOR
              The generator used to build the project.

              The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
              files.  (e.g. &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;, &quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)


       CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
              Path to top of source tree.

              This is the path to the top level of the source tree.


       CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX
              The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

              The  prefix  to  use  for the name of an import library if used on
              this platform.


              CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for import  libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of an import library if used on this
              platform.
&#12;
              CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a library, .lib on Windows.


       CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION
              The Major version of cmake (i.e. the 2 in 2.X.X)

              This  specifies  the  major  version of the CMake executable being
              run.


       CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
              See CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.

              This  variable  is  around  for   backwards   compatibility,   see
              CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL.


       CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION
              The Minor version of cmake (i.e. the 4 in X.4.X).

              This  specifies  the  minor  version of the CMake executable being
              run.


       CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
              Full path to the parent listfile of the one currently  being  pro&#8208;
              cessed.

              As  CMake  processes  the  listfiles in your project this variable
              will always be set  to  the  listfile  that  included  or  somehow
              invoked  the  one  currently  being processed. See also CMAKE_CUR&#8208;
              RENT_LIST_FILE.


       CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION
              The patch version of cmake (i.e. the 3 in X.X.3).

              This specifies the patch version of  the  CMake  executable  being
              run.


       CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME
              The name of the current project.

              This specifies name of the current project from the closest inher&#8208;
              ited PROJECT command.


       CMAKE_RANLIB
              Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.

              This specifies name of the program that  randomizes  libraries  on
              UNIX, not used on Windows, but may be present.


       CMAKE_ROOT
              Install directory for running cmake.

              This  is  the  install  root for the running CMake and the Modules
              directory can be found here. This is commonly used in this format:
              ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules


       CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
              Full path to the -P script file currently being processed.

              When  run  in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to the full
              path of the script file. When run to  configure  a  CMakeLists.txt
              file, this variable is not set.
&#12;       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
              The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib on UNIX.


              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a shared library,  .dll  on  Win&#8208;
              dows.


              CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX
              The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

              The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this  plat&#8208;
              form.


              CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;   overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX
              The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

              The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module on  this  plat&#8208;
              form


              CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;   overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
              Size of a void pointer.

              This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and is deter&#8208;
              mined  by  a  try  compile.  If  a  64 bit size is found, then the
              library search path is modified  to  look  for  64  bit  libraries
              first.


       CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
              If true, do not add run time path information.

              If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
              compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information  if
              the  platform  supports it.  This allows for easy running from the
              build tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the  build
              step, use CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.


       CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
              The path to the top level of the source tree.

              This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
              tree.  For  an  in-source  build,  this  would  be  the  same   as
              CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.


       CMAKE_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
              Libraries linked into every executable and shared library.

              This is the list of libraries that are linked into all executables
              and libraries.


       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX
              The prefix for static libraries that you link to.
&#12;              The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib on UNIX.


              CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
              The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

              The  suffix  to  use for the end of a static library, .lib on Win&#8208;
              dows.


              CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;  overrides  this  for  language
              &lt;LANG&gt;.


       CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
              The tweak version of cmake (i.e. the 1 in X.X.X.1).

              This  specifies  the  tweak  version of the CMake executable being
              run.  Releases use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development  versions  use
              the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak level.


       CMAKE_USING_VC_FREE_TOOLS
              True if free visual studio tools being used.

              This is set to true if the compiler is Visual Studio free tools.


       CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
              Create verbose makefiles if on.

              This variable defaults to false. You can set this variable to true
              to make CMake produce verbose makefiles  that  show  each  command
              line as it is used.


       CMAKE_VERSION
              The  full  version of cmake in major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] for&#8208;
              mat.

              This specifies the full version of the CMake executable being run.
              This  variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and higher.  See vari&#8208;
              ables CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION,  CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION,  CMAKE_PATCH_VER&#8208;
              SION,  and  CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual version components.
              The [-id] component appears in non-release  versions  and  may  be
              arbitrary text.


       PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
              Full path to build directory for project.

              This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT command.


       PROJECT_NAME
              Name of the project given to the project command.

              This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT command.


       PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
              Top level source directory for the current project.

              This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT command.


       [Project name]_BINARY_DIR
              Top level binary directory for the named project.

              A  variable  is created with the name used in the PROJECT command,
              and is the binary directory for the project.   This can be  useful
              when SUBDIR is used to connect several projects.


       [Project name]_SOURCE_DIR
              Top level source directory for the named project.
&#12;              A  variable  is created with the name used in the PROJECT command,
              and is the source directory for the project.   This can be  useful
              when add_subdirectory is used to connect several projects.
