cpufreq-aperf(1)                                                cpufreq-aperf(1)



NAME
       cpufreq-aperf - Calculates the average frequency over a time period

SYNTAX
       cpufreq-aperf [options]

DESCRIPTION
       On latest processors exist two MSR registers refered to as:
         - MPERF increasing with maxium (P0) frequency in C0
         - APERF increasing with current/actual frequency in C0

       From  this  information  the  average frequency over a time period can be
       calculated and this is what this tool does.

       A nice falloff feature beside the average frequency is the time a proces&#8208;
       sor core remained in C0 (working state) or any CX (sleep state) processor
       sleep state during the measured time  period.  This  information  can  be
       determined from the fact that MPERF only increases in C0 state.

OPTIONS
       -c --cpu &lt;CPU&gt;
               The &lt;CPU&gt; core to measure - default all cores.

       -i --interval &lt;seconds&gt;
              Refresh rate - default 1 second.

       -o --once
              Exit after one interval.

       -h --help
              Prints the available options.

REMARKS
       The msr driver must be loaded for this command to work.
