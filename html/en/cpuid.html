CPUID(4)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   CPUID(4)



NAME
       cpuid - x86 CPUID access device

DESCRIPTION
       CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the x86 CPU.

       This  device is accessed by lseek(2) or pread(2) to the appropriate CPUID
       level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.  A larger read size means multi&#8208;
       ple reads of consecutive levels.

       The  lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming %eax, and
       the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming %ecx,  the  latter
       intended for &quot;counting&quot; eax levels like eax=4.

       This driver uses /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid, where CPUNUM is the minor number,
       and on an SMP box will direct the access  to  CPU  CPUNUM  as  listed  in
       /proc/cpuinfo.

       This  file  is protected so that it can only be read by the user root, or
       members of the group root.

NOTES
       The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program using  inline
       assembler.   However  this  device  allows  convenient access to all CPUs
       without changing process affinity.

       Most of the information in cpuid is reported by the kernel in cooked form
       either  in  /proc/cpuinfo  or through subdirectories in /sys/devices/sys&#8208;
       tem/cpu.  Direct CPUID access through this device should only be used  in
       exceptional cases.

       The  cpuid  driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you might need
       to use the following command to load it explicitly before use:

            $ modprobe cpuid

       There is no support for CPUID functions  that  require  additional  input
       registers.

       Very old x86 CPUs don&apos;t support CPUID.
