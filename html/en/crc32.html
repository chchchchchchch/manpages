CRC32(1)                                                                CRC32(1)



NAME
       crc32 - compute CRC-32 checksums for the given files

SYNOPSIS
       crc32 filename [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       crc32 is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum for each of
       the given files.

       Note that the CRC-32 checksum is  merely  used  for  error  detection  in
       transmission  and storage.  It is not intended to guard against the mali&#8208;
       cious modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash).

       This utility is supplied with the Archive::Zip module for Perl.

SEE ALSO
       Archive::Zip(3pm).

AUTHOR
       The Archive::Zip module was written by Ned Konz.
       This manual page was prepared by  Ben  Burton  &lt;bab@debian.org&gt;  for  the
       Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
