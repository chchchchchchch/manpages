CRDA(8)                               Linux                              CRDA(8)



NAME
       crda  - send to the kernel a wireless regulatory domain for a given ISO /
       IEC 3166 alpha2

SYNOPSIS
       crda




Description
       crda is the Linux wireless central regulatory domain agent.  crda is
       intended to be used by udev scripts and should not be run manually unless
       debugging udev scripts.  crda is triggered to run by the kernel by send&#8208;
       ing a udev event upon a new regulatory domain change. Regulatory domain
       changes are triggered by the wireless kernel subsystem (upon initializa&#8208;
       tion and on reception of country IEs), wireless drivers, or userspace
       (see iw ). Upon a regulatory domain change the kernel sends a udev change
       event for the regulatory platform. The kernel ignores regulatory domains
       sent to it if it does not expect them. The regulatory domain is read by
       crda from the regulatory.bin file.



RSA Digital Signature
       If built with openssl or gcrypt support crda will have embedded into it
       an RSA digital signature which will prevent it from reading corrupted or
       non-authored regulatory.bin files. Authorship is respected by the RSA
       public key packed into crda.  This specific crda package has been built
       with an RSA public key from John Linville (the Linux wireless kernel
       maintainer) and as such will only read regulatory.bin files signed by
       him. For further information see the regulatory.bin man page.



UDEV RULE
       A udev regulatory rule must be put in place in order to receive and parse
       udev events from the kernel in order to get udev to call crda with the
       passed ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 country code.  An example udev rule which
       can be used (usually in /lib/udev/rules.d/85-regulatory.rules ):

       KERNEL==&quot;regulatory*&quot;, ACTION==&quot;change&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;platform&quot;,
       RUN+=&quot;/sbin/crda&quot;



Environment variable
       Set the COUNTRY environment variable with a specific ISO / IEC 3166
       alpha2 country code and then run crda without arguments. This will send a
       regulatory domain for that alpha2 to the kernel.
