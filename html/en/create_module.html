CREATE_MODULE(2)            Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual           CREATE_MODULE(2)



NAME
       create_module - create a loadable module entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;

       caddr_t create_module(const char *name, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       Note: This system call is present only in kernels before Linux 2.6.

       create_module()  attempts  to  create a loadable module entry and reserve
       the kernel memory that will be needed to hold the  module.   This  system
       call requires privilege.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  returns the kernel address at which the module will reside.
       On error -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EEXIST A module by that name already exists.

       EFAULT name is outside the program&apos;s accessible address space.

       EINVAL The requested size is too small even for the module header  infor&#8208;
              mation.

       ENOMEM The  kernel  could not allocate a contiguous block of memory large
              enough for the module.

       ENOSYS create_module() is not supported in this  version  of  the  kernel
              (e.g., the kernel is version 2.6 or later).

       EPERM  The  caller  was  not  privileged (did not have the CAP_SYS_MODULE
              capability).

VERSIONS
       This system call is only present on Linux up until  kernel  2.4;  it  was
       removed in Linux 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       create_module() is Linux-specific.
