CRONTAB(1)                                                            CRONTAB(1)



NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [ -u user ] file
       crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }

DESCRIPTION
       crontab is the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables used
       to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each user can have their  own
       crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are
       not intended to be edited directly.

       If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per
       line)  therein  in  order  to  be  allowed  to  use this command.  If the
       /etc/cron.allow file does not exist  but  the  /etc/cron.deny  file  does
       exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to
       use this command.

       If neither of these files exists, then depending on  site-dependent  con&#8208;
       figuration  parameters,  only  the super user will be allowed to use this
       command, or all users will be able to use this command.

       If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes  precedence.  Which  means
       that  /etc/cron.deny  is  not  considered and your user must be listed in
       /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab.

       Regardless of the existance of any of these files, the  root  administra&#8208;
       tive user is always allowed to setup a crontab.  For standard Debian sys&#8208;
       tems, all users may use this command.

       If the -u option is given, it  specifies  the  name  of  the  user  whose
       crontab  is to be used (when listing) or modified (when editing). If this
       option is not given, crontab examines &quot;your&quot; crontab, i.e.,  the  crontab
       of the person executing the command.  Note that su(8) can confuse crontab
       and that if you are running inside of su(8) you should always use the  -u
       option for safety&apos;s sake.

       The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some
       named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ``-&apos;&apos; is given.

       The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard out&#8208;
       put. See the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.

       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor speci&#8208;
       fied by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.  After you exit  from
       the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically. If nei&#8208;
       ther of the environment variables is defined,  then  the  default  editor
       /usr/bin/editor is used.

       The  -i  option  modifies  the  -r  option to prompt the user for a &apos;y/Y&apos;
       response before actually removing the crontab.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       The &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; behaviour for crontab -l is  to  display  the  three
       line  &quot;DO  NOT  EDIT THIS FILE&quot; header that is placed at the beginning of
       the crontab when it is installed.  The  problem  is  that  it  makes  the
       sequence

       crontab -l | crontab -

       non-idempotent  -- you keep adding copies of the header. This causes pain
       to scripts that use sed to edit a crontab. Therefore, the default  behav&#8208;
       iour of the -l option has been changed to not output such header. You may
       obtain  the  original  behaviour  by  setting  the  environment  variable
       CRONTAB_NOHEADER  to &apos;N&apos;, which will cause the crontab -l command to emit
       the extraneous header.

SEE ALSO
       crontab(5), cron(8)

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs

       There   is   one   file   for   each    user&apos;s    crontab    under    the
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs  directory.  Users  are  not allowed to edit the
       files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed  by
       the  system  to  run  periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically
       correct crontabs will be written there.  This is enforced by  having  the
       directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab com&#8208;
       mand with the setgid bid set for that specific group.

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE  Std1003.2-1992  (``POSIX&apos;&apos;).   This
       new  command syntax differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well
       as from the classic SVR3 syntax.


DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad  com&#8208;
       mand line.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If
       the last entry in a crontab is missing the newline,  cron  will  consider
       the crontab (at least partially) broken and refuse to install it.
