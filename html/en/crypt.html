CRYPT(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   CRYPT(3)



NAME
       crypt, crypt_r - password and data encryption

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       char *crypt(const char *key, const char *salt);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;crypt.h&gt;

       char *crypt_r(const char *key, const char *salt,
                     struct crypt_data *data);

       Link with -lcrypt.

DESCRIPTION
       crypt()  is  the  password  encryption function.  It is based on the Data
       Encryption Standard  algorithm  with  variations  intended  (among  other
       things) to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search.

       key is a user&apos;s typed password.

       salt  is  a two-character string chosen from the set [a&#8211;zA&#8211;Z0&#8211;9./].  This
       string is used to perturb the algorithm in one of 4096 different ways.

       By taking the lowest 7 bits of each of the first eight characters of  the
       key,  a  56-bit  key  is  obtained.   This  56-bit key is used to encrypt
       repeatedly a constant string (usually a string consisting of all  zeros).
       The  returned  value  points  to  the  encrypted password, a series of 13
       printable ASCII characters (the first two characters represent  the  salt
       itself).   The  return value points to static data whose content is over&#8208;
       written by each call.

       Warning: The key space consists of 2**56 equal  7.2e16  possible  values.
       Exhaustive searches of this key space are possible using massively paral&#8208;
       lel computers.  Software, such  as  crack(1),  is  available  which  will
       search the portion of this key space that is generally used by humans for
       passwords.  Hence, password selection should, at  minimum,  avoid  common
       words  and  names.  The use of a passwd(1) program that checks for crack&#8208;
       able passwords during the selection process is recommended.

       The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks  which  make  the  use  of  the
       crypt()  interface  a  very  poor choice for anything other than password
       authentication.  If you are planning on using the crypt() interface for a
       cryptography  project, don&apos;t do it: get a good book on encryption and one
       of the widely available DES libraries.

       crypt_r() is a reentrant version of crypt().  The structure pointed to by
       data  is  used  to  store result data and bookkeeping information.  Other
       than allocating it, the only thing that the caller should  do  with  this
       structure  is  to  set data-&gt;initialized to zero before the first call to
       crypt_r().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a pointer to the encrypted password is returned.   On  error,
       NULL is returned.

ERRORS
       ENOSYS The  crypt()  function  was  not  implemented, probably because of
              U.S.A. export restrictions.

CONFORMING TO
       crypt(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  crypt_r() is a GNU extension.

NOTES
   Glibc Notes
       The glibc2 version of this function supports additional encryption  algo&#8208;
       rithms.

       If  salt  is  a character string starting with the characters &quot;$id$&quot; fol&#8208;
       lowed by a string terminated by &quot;$&quot;:

              $id$salt$encrypted

       then instead of using the  DES  machine,  id  identifies  the  encryption
       method  used and this then determines how the rest of the password string
       is interpreted.  The following values of id are supported:

              l l.  ID  | Method _ 1   | MD5 2a  |  Blowfish  (not  in  mainline
              glibc; added in some
                  |  Linux  distributions) 5   | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7) 6   |
              SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7)

       So $5$salt$encrypted is an SHA-256 encoded password and $6$salt$encrypted
       is an SHA-512 encoded one.

       &quot;salt&quot;  stands  for the up to 16 characters following &quot;$id$&quot; in the salt.
       The encrypted part of the password string is the  actual  computed  pass&#8208;
       word.  The size of this string is fixed:

       l  l.  MD5     | 22 characters SHA-256 | 43 characters SHA-512 | 86 char&#8208;
       acters

       The  characters  in  &quot;salt&quot;  and  &quot;encrypted&quot;  are  drawn  from  the  set
       [a&#8211;zA&#8211;Z0&#8211;9./].  In the MD5 and SHA implementations the entire key is sig&#8208;
       nificant (instead of only the first 8 bytes in DES).
