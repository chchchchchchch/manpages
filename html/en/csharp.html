NAME
       csharp, gsharp - Interactive C# Shell

SYNOPSIS
       csharp [--attach PID] [-e EXPRESSION] [file1 [file2]] [options]

       gsharp [file1 [file2]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  csharp  is an interactive C# shell that allows the user to enter and
       evaluate C# statements and expressions from the command line.   The regu&#8208;
       lar mcs command line options can be used in this version of the compiler.

       The  gsharp command is a GUI version of the C# interpreter that uses Gtk#
       and provides an area to attach widgets as well.      This version can  be
       attached  to  other  Gtk# applications in a safe way as it injects itself
       into the main loop of a Gtk# application, avoiding any  problems  arising
       from the multi-threaded nature of injecting itself into a target process.

       Files  specified  in  the  command  line  will  be loaded and executed as
       scripts.

       Starting with Mono 2.10, the csharp command can be used as an interpreter
       executed  by executables flagged with the Unix execute attribute.   To do
       this, make the first line of your C# source code look like this:
       &quot;#!/usr/bin/csharp&quot;
       Console.WriteLine (&quot;Hello, World&quot;);

OPTIONS
       The commands accept all of the commands that are  available  to  the  mcs
       command,  so  you can reference assemblies, specify paths, language level
       and so on from the command line.   In  addition,  the  following  command
       line options are supported:

       --attach
              This  is  an advanced option and should only be used if you have a
              deep understanding of multi-threading.     This option is availble
              on  the csharp command and allows the compiler to be injected into
              other processes.  This is done by injecting the C# shell in a sep&#8208;
              arate  thread  that runs concurrently with your application.  This
              means that you must take special measures to  avoid  crashing  the
              target application while using it.  For example, you might have to
              take the proper locks  before  issuing  any  commands  that  might
              affect  the  target  process  state, or sending commands through a
              method dispatcher.

       -e EXPRESSION
              This will evaluate the specified C# EXPRESSION and exit

OPERATION
       Once you launch the csharp command, you will be greeted with the interac&#8208;
       tive prompt:

       $ csharp
       Mono C# Shell, type &quot;help;&quot; for help

       Enter statements below.
       csharp&gt;

       A number of namespaces are pre-defined with C# these include System, Sys&#8208;
       tem.Linq, System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic.  Unlike  the
       compiled  mode,  it  is  possible to add new using statements as you type
       code, for example:

       csharp&gt; new XmlDocument ();
       &lt;interactive&gt;(1,6): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `XmlDocument&apos; could not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?
       csharp&gt; using System.Xml;
       csharp&gt; new XmlDocument ();
       System.Xml.XmlDocument

       Every time a command is typed, the scope of that  command  is  one  of  a
       class  that  derives  from  the class Mono.CSharp.InteractiveBase.   This
       class defines a number of static properties and methods.   To  display  a
       list of available commands access the `help&apos; property:
       csharp&gt; help;
       &quot;Static methods:
         LoadPackage (pkg); - Loads the given Package (like -pkg:FILE)
         [...]
         ShowVars ();       - Shows defined local variables.
         ShowUsing ();      - Show active using decltions.
         help;
       &quot;
       csharp&gt;

       When  expressions  are  entered,  the C# shell will display the result of
       executing the expression:

       csharp&gt; Math.Sin (Math.PI/4);
       0.707106781186547
       csharp&gt; 1+1;
       2
       csharp&gt; &quot;Hello, world&quot;.IndexOf (&apos;,&apos;);
       5

       The C# shell uses the ToString() method on the returned object to display
       the  object,  this  sometimes  can  be limiting since objects that do not
       override the ToString() method will get the default  behavior  from  Sys&#8208;
       tem.Object which is merely to display their type name:

       csharp&gt; var a = new XmlDocument ();
       csharp&gt; a;
       System.Xml.Document
       csharp&gt; csharp&gt; a.Name;
       &quot;#document&quot;
       csharp&gt;

       A  few  datatypes  are handled specially by the C# interactive shell like
       arrays, System.Collections.Hashtable, objects that implement  System.Col&#8208;
       lections.IEnumerable  and  IDictionary and are rendered specially instead
       of just using ToString ():

       csharp&gt; var pages = new Hashtable () {
             &gt;  { &quot;Mono&quot;,    &quot;http://www.mono-project.com/&quot; },
             &gt;  { &quot;Linux&quot;,   &quot;http://kernel.org&quot; } };
       csharp&gt; pages;
       {{ &quot;Mono&quot;, &quot;http://www.mono-project.com/&quot; }, { &quot;Linux&quot;, &quot;http://kernel.org&quot; }}

       It is possible to use LINQ directly in the C# interactive shell since the
       System.Linq  namespace has been imported at startup.   The following sam&#8208;
       ple gets a list of all the files that have not been accessed  in  a  week
       from /tmp:

       csharp&gt; using System.IO;
       csharp&gt; var last_week = DateTime.Now - TimeSpan.FromDays (7);
       csharp&gt; var old_files = from f in Directory.GetFiles (&quot;/tmp&quot;)
             &gt;   let fi = new FileInfo (f)
             &gt;   where fi.LastAccessTime &lt; LastWeek select f;
       csharp&gt;

       You can of course print the results in a single statement as well:

       csharp&gt; using System.IO;
       csharp&gt; var last_week = DateTime.Now - TimeSpan.FromDays (7);
       csharp&gt; from f in Directory.GetFiles (&quot;/tmp&quot;)
             &gt;   let fi = new FileInfo (f)
             &gt;   where fi.LastAccessTime &lt; last_week select f;
       [...]
       csharp&gt;

       LINQ and its functional foundation produce on-demand code for IEnumerable
       return values.  For instance, the return value from a using `from&apos; is  an
       IEnumerable  that  is  evaluated  on demand.   The automatic rendering of
       IEnumerables on the command line will trigger the IEnumerable pipeline to
       execute  at  that  point  instead of having its execution delayed until a
       later point.

       If you want to avoid having the IEnumerable rendered at this point,  sim&#8208;
       ply assign the value to a variable.

       Unlike compiled C#, the type of a variable can be changed if a new decla&#8208;
       ration is entered, for example:

       csharp&gt; var a = 1;
       csharp&gt; a.GetType ();
       System.Int32
       csharp&gt; var a = &quot;Hello&quot;;
       csharp&gt; a.GetType ();
       System.String
       csharp&gt; ShowVars ();
       string a = &quot;Hello&quot;

       In the case that an expression or a statement is not completed in a  sin&#8208;
       gle line, a continuation prompt is displayed, for example:

       csharp&gt; var protocols = new string [] {
             &gt;    &quot;ftp&quot;,
             &gt;    &quot;http&quot;,
             &gt;    &quot;gopher&quot;
             &gt; };
       csharp&gt; protocols;
       { &quot;ftp&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &quot;gopher&quot; }

       Long  running  computations  can  be  interrupted  by using the Control-C
       sequence:

       csharp&gt; var done = false;
       csharp&gt; while (!done) { }
       Interrupted!
       System.Threading.ThreadAbortException: Thread was being aborted
         at Class1.Host (System.Object&amp; $retval) [0x00000]
         at Mono.CSharp.InteractiveShell.ExecuteBlock (Mono.CSharp.Class host, Mono.CSharp.Undo undo) [0x00000]
       csharp&gt;

INTERACTIVE EDITING
       The C# interactive shell contains a  line-editor  that  provides  a  more
       advanced  command  line  editing  functionality than the operating system
       provides.   These are available in the command line version, the GUI ver&#8208;
       sions uses the standard Gtk# key bindings.

       The  command  set is similar to many other applications (cursor keys) and
       incorporates some of the Emacs commands for editing as well as a  history
       mechanism to

       The following keyboard input is supported:

       Home Key, Control-a
              Goes to the beginning of the line.

       End Key, Control-e
              Goes to the end of the line.

       Left Arrow Key, Control-b
              Moves the cursor back one character.

       Right Arrow Key, Control-f
              Moves the cursor forward one character.

       Up Arrow Key, Control-p
              Goes  back in the history, replaces the current line with the pre&#8208;
              vious line in the history.

       Down Arrow Key, Control-n
              Moves forward in the history, replaces the current line  with  the
              next lien in the history.

       Return Executes  the  current line if the statement or expression is com&#8208;
              plete, or waits for further input.

       Control-C
              Cancel the current line being edited.  This  will  kill  any  cur&#8208;
              rently  in-progress  edits  or  partial  editing  and go back to a
              toplevel definition.

       Backspace Key
              Deletes the character before the cursor

       Delete Key, Control-d
              Deletes the character at the current cursor position.

       Control-k
              Erases the contents of the line until the  end  of  the  line  and
              places the result in the cut and paste buffer.

       Alt-D  Deletes  the word starting at the cursor position and appends into
              the cut and paste buffer.    By pressing Alt-d repeatedly,  multi&#8208;
              ple words can be appended into the paste buffer.

       Control-Y
              Pastes  the content of the kill buffer at the current cursor posi&#8208;
              tion.

       Control-Q
              This is the quote character.   It allows the user  to  enter  con&#8208;
              trol-characters  that  are  otherwise taken by the command editing
              facility.   Press Control-Q followed by the character you want  to
              insert, and it will be inserted verbatim into the command line.

       Control-D
              Terminates  the  program.   This terminates the input for the pro&#8208;
              gram.

STATIC PROPERTIES AND METHODS
       Since the methods and properties of the base class from where the  state&#8208;
       ments  and  expressions  are  executed  are  static,  they can be invoked
       directly from the shell.   These are the available properties  and  meth&#8208;
       ods:

       void LoadAssembly(string assembly)
              Loads the given assembly.   This is equivalent to passing the com&#8208;
              piler the -r: flag with the specified string.

       void LoadPackage(string package)
              Imports the package specified.   This is  equivalent  to  invoking
              the compiler with the -pkg: flag with the specified string.

       string Prompt { get; set }
              The  prompt  used by the shell.  It defaults to the value &quot;csharp&gt;
              &quot;.  string ContinuationPrompt { get; set; } The prompt used by the
              shell when further input is required to complete the expression or
              statement.

       void ShowVars()
              Displays all the variables that have been defined so far and their
              types.     In the csharp shell declaring new variables will shadow
              previous variable declarations, this is  different  than  C#  when
              compiled.   void  ShowUsing() Displays all the using statements in
              effect.  TimeSpan Time (Action a) Handy routine to time  the  time
              that some code takes to execute.   The parameter is an Action del&#8208;
              egate, and the return value is a TimeSpan.  For example:

       csharp&gt; Time (() =&gt; { for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) Console.WriteLine (i);});
       0
       1
       2
       3
       4
       00:00:00.0043230
       csharp&gt;

       The return value is a TimeSpan, that you can  store  in  a  variable  for
       benchmarking purposes.

GUI METHODS AND PROPERTIES
       In  addition  to the methods and properties available in the console ver&#8208;
       sion there are a handful of extra properties available on  the  GUI  ver&#8208;
       sion.    For  example a &quot;PaneContainer&quot; Gtk.Container is exposed that you
       can use to host Gtk# widgets while prototyping or the &quot;MainWindow&quot;  prop&#8208;
       erty that gives you access to the current toplevel window.

STARTUP FILES
       The  C#  shell  will  load  all  the  Mono assemblies and C# script files
       located in the ~/.config/csharp directory on Unix.   The  assemblies  are
       loaded before the source files are loaded.

       C#  script  files  are  files that have the extension .cs and they should
       only contain statements and expressions, they can not contain full  class
       definitions (at least not as of Mono 2.0).  Full class definitions should
       be compiled into dlls and stored in that directory.
