ctest(1)                                                                ctest(1)



NAME
         ctest - Testing driver provided by CMake.


USAGE
         ctest [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The &quot;ctest&quot; executable is the CMake test driver program.  CMake-generated
       build trees created for projects that use the ENABLE_TESTING and ADD_TEST
       commands  have  testing  support.   This  program  will run the tests and
       report results.


OPTIONS
       -C &lt;cfg&gt;, --build-config &lt;cfg&gt;
              Choose configuration to test.

              Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build  configu&#8208;
              rations  in  the  same  tree.   This option can be used to specify
              which one should be tested.  Example  configurations  are  &quot;Debug&quot;
              and &quot;Release&quot;.


       -V,--verbose
              Enable verbose output from tests.

              Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
              displayed.  This option will show all test output.


       -VV,--extra-verbose
              Enable more verbose output from tests.

              Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
              displayed.  This option will show even more test output.


       --debug
              Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.

              This  feature will result in large number of output that is mostly
              useful for debugging dashboard problems.


       --output-on-failure
              Output anything outputted by the test program if the  test  should
              fail.   This option can also be enabled by setting the environment
              variable CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE


       -F     Enable failover.

              This option allows ctest to resume a test set execution  that  was
              previously  interrupted.   If  no  interruption  occurred,  the -F
              option will have no effect.


       -j &lt;jobs&gt;, --parallel &lt;jobs&gt;
              Run the tests in parallel using thegiven number of jobs.
&#12;              This option tells ctest to run the tests in parallel  using  given
              number of jobs.


       -Q,--quiet
              Make ctest quiet.

              This option will suppress all the output. The output log file will
              still be generated if the --output-log is specified. Options  such
              as  --verbose, --extra-verbose, and --debug are ignored if --quiet
              is specified.


       -O &lt;file&gt;, --output-log &lt;file&gt;
              Output to log file

              This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log file.


       -N,--show-only
              Disable actual execution of tests.

              This option tells ctest to list the tests that would  be  run  but
              not  actually  run them.  Useful in conjunction with the -R and -E
              options.


       -L &lt;regex&gt;, --label-regex &lt;regex&gt;
              Run tests with labels matching regular expression.

              This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose  labels  match
              the given regular expression.


       -R &lt;regex&gt;, --tests-regex &lt;regex&gt;
              Run tests matching regular expression.

              This  option  tells  ctest to run only the tests whose names match
              the given regular expression.


       -E &lt;regex&gt;, --exclude-regex &lt;regex&gt;
              Exclude tests matching regular expression.

              This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
              given regular expression.


       -LE &lt;regex&gt;, --label-exclude &lt;regex&gt;
              Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.

              This  option  tells  ctest to NOT run the tests whose labels match
              the given regular expression.


       -D &lt;dashboard&gt;, --dashboard &lt;dashboard&gt;
              Execute dashboard test

              This option tells ctest to perform act as a Dart client  and  per&#8208;
              form  a dashboard test. All tests are &lt;Mode&gt;&lt;Test&gt;, where Mode can
              be Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can  be  Start,
              Update, Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.


       -D &lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
              Define a variable for script mode
&#12;              Pass  in  variable  values on the command line. Use in conjunction
              with -S to pass variable values to a dashboard script. Parsing  -D
              arguments  as  variable values is only attempted if the value fol&#8208;
              lowing -D does not match any of the known dashboard types.


       -M &lt;model&gt;, --test-model &lt;model&gt;
              Sets the model for a dashboard

              This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client  where  the  Test&#8208;
              Model  can  be Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous. Combining -M
              and -T is similar to -D


       -T &lt;action&gt;, --test-action &lt;action&gt;
              Sets the dashboard action to perform

              This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and  perform  some
              action such as start, build, test etc. Combining -M and -T is sim&#8208;
              ilar to -D


       --track &lt;track&gt;
              Specify the track to submit dashboard to

              Submit dashboard to specified track instead  of  default  one.  By
              default,  the  dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or
              Continuous track, but by specifying this option, the track can  be
              arbitrary.


       -S &lt;script&gt;, --script &lt;script&gt;
              Execute a dashboard for a configuration

              This  option  tells  ctest to load in a configuration script which
              sets a number of parameters such as the binary and source directo&#8208;
              ries.  Then  ctest  will  do  what is required to create and run a
              dashboard. This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs
              ctest -D with the appropriate options.


       -SP &lt;script&gt;, --script-new-process &lt;script&gt;
              Execute a dashboard for a configuration

              This  option does the same operations as -S but it will do them in
              a separate process. This is primarily useful in  cases  where  the
              script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified
              environment to impact other -S scripts.


       -A &lt;file&gt;, --add-notes &lt;file&gt;
              Add a notes file with submission

              This option tells ctest to include a notes  file  when  submitting
              dashboard.


       -I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], --tests-information
              Run a specific number of tests by number.

              This  option  causes  ctest to run tests starting at number Start,
              ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride.  Any  additional
              numbers  after  Stride  are  considered  individual  test numbers.
              Start, End,or stride can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given
              that contains the same syntax as the command line.
&#12;       -U, --union
              Take the Union of -I and -R

              When  both  -R and -I are specified by default the intersection of
              tests are run. By specifying -U the union of tests is run instead.


       --max-width &lt;width&gt;
              Set the max width for a test name to output

              Set the maximum width for each test name to show  in  the  output.
              This  allows  the  user  to widen the output to avoid clipping the
              test name which can be very annoying.


       --interactive-debug-mode [0|1]
              Set the interactive mode to 0 or 1.

              This option causes ctest to run tests  in  either  an  interactive
              mode  or  a  non-interactive  mode.  On Windows this means that in
              non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked.
              In dashboard mode (Experimental, Nightly, Continuous), the default
              is non-interactive.  When just running tests not for  a  dashboard
              the default is to allow popups and interactive debugging.


       --no-label-summary
              Disable timing summary information for labels.

              This  option tells ctest not to print summary information for each
              label associated with the tests run. If there are no labels on the
              tests, nothing extra is printed.


       --build-and-test
              Configure, build and run a test.

              This  option  tells ctest to configure (i.e. run cmake on), build,
              and or execute a test. The configure and test steps are  optional.
              The  arguments  to  this  command  line  are the source and binary
              directories. By default this will  run  CMake  on  the  Source/Bin
              directories  specified  unless  --build-nocmake is specified. Both
              --build-makeprogram and --build-generator MUST be provided to  use
              --built-and-test. If --test-command is specified then that will be
              run after the build is complete. Other options  that  affect  this
              mode    are   --build-target   --build-nocmake,   --build-run-dir,
              --build-two-config,                               --build-exe-dir,
              --build-project,--build-noclean, --build-options


       --build-target
              Specify a specific target to build.

              This option goes with the --build-and-test option, if left out the
              all target is built.


       --build-nocmake
              Run the build without running cmake first.

              Skip the cmake step.


       --build-run-dir
              Specify directory to run programs from.

              Directory where programs will be after it has been compiled.


       --build-two-config
              Run CMake twice


       --build-exe-dir
              Specify the directory for the executable.


       --build-generator
              Specify the generator to use.


       --build-project
              Specify the name of the project to build.


       --build-makeprogram
              Specify the make program to use.


       --build-noclean
              Skip the make clean step.


       --build-config-sample
              A sample executable to use to determine the configuration

              A sample executable to use to  determine  the  configuration  that
              should be used. e.g. Debug/Release/etc


       --build-options
              Add extra options to the build step.

              This  option  must  be  the  last  option  with  the  exception of
              --test-command


       --test-command
              The test to run with the --build-and-test option.


       --test-timeout
              The time limit in seconds, internal use only.


       --tomorrow-tag
              Nightly or experimental starts with next day tag.

              This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.


       --ctest-config
              The configuration file used to initialize CTest state when submit&#8208;
              ting dashboards.

              This  option  tells  CTest  to  use  different initialization file
              instead of CTestConfiguration.tcl. This way  multiple  initializa&#8208;
              tion  files  can  be  used for example to submit to multiple dash&#8208;
              boards.


       --overwrite
              Overwrite CTest configuration option.
&#12;              By default ctest uses  configuration  options  from  configuration
              file. This option will overwrite the configuration option.


       --extra-submit &lt;file&gt;[;&lt;file&gt;]
              Submit extra files to the dashboard.

              This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.


       --force-new-ctest-process
              Run child CTest instances as new processes

              By  default  CTest  will run child CTest instances within the same
              process. If this behavior  is  not  desired,  this  argument  will
              enforce new processes for child CTest processes.


       --schedule-random
              Use a random order for scheduling tests

              This  option  will run the tests in a random order. It is commonly
              used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.


       --submit-index
              Submit individual dashboard tests with specific index

              This option allows performing the same CTest action (such as test)
              multiple  times and submit all stages to the same dashboard (Dart2
              required). Each execution requires different index.


       --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Set a global timeout on all tests.

              This option will set a global timeout on all  tests  that  do  not
              already have a timeout set on them.


       --stop-time &lt;time&gt;
              Set a time at which all tests should stop running.

              Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout. Example:
              7:00:00 -0400. Any time format understood by the curl date  parser
              is accepted. Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.


       --http1.0
              Submit using HTTP 1.0.

              This  option  will  force CTest to use HTTP 1.0 to submit files to
              the dashboard, instead of HTTP 1.1.


       --no-compress-output
              Do not compress test output when submitting.

              This flag will turn off automatic compression of test output.  Use
              this  to  maintain  compatibility  with  an older version of CDash
              which doesn&apos;t support compressed test output.


       --print-labels
              Print all available test labels.

              This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the  list
              of all labels associated with the test set.


       --help-command &lt;cmd&gt; [&lt;file&gt;]
              Show help for a single command and exit.

              Prints  the  help  for  the  command to stdout or to the specified
              file.


       --help-command-list [&lt;file&gt;]
              List available commands and exit.

              Prints the list of all available listfile commands  to  stdout  or
              the specified file.


       --help-commands [&lt;file&gt;]
              Print help for all commands and exit.

              Prints  the  help  for  all commands to stdout or to the specified
              file.


       --copyright [file]
              Print the CMake copyright and exit.

              If a file is specified, the copyright is written into it.


       --help,-help,-usage,-h,-H,/?
              Print usage information and exit.

              Usage describes the basic command line interface and its options.


       --help-full [file]
              Print full help and exit.

              Full help displays most of the documentation provided by the  UNIX
              man  page.   It  is provided for use on non-UNIX platforms, but is
              also convenient if the man page is not installed.  If  a  file  is
              specified, the help is written into it.


       --help-html [file]
              Print full help in HTML format.

              This  option  is  used by CMake authors to help produce web pages.
              If a file is specified, the help is written into it.


       --help-man [file]
              Print full help as a UNIX man page and exit.

              This option is used by the cmake build to generate  the  UNIX  man
              page.  If a file is specified, the help is written into it.


       --version,-version,/V [file]
              Show program name/version banner and exit.

              If a file is specified, the version is written into it.


GENERATORS
       The following generators are available on this platform:
&#12;
COMMANDS
       break  Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

                break()

              Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop


       build_name
              Deprecated.    Use   ${CMAKE_SYSTEM}   and   ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
              instead.

                build_name(variable)

              Sets the specified variable to a string representing the  platform
              and compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
              CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.


       cmake_minimum_required
              Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

                cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
                                       [FATAL_ERROR])

              If the current version of CMake is lower  than  that  required  it
              will stop processing the project and report an error.  When a ver&#8208;
              sion higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])

              which sets the cmake policy version level to  the  version  speci&#8208;
              fied.   When  version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly
              invokes


                cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)

              which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.


              The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by  CMake  2.6  and
              higher.   It  should  be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower
              fail with an error instead of just a warning.


       cmake_policy
              Manage CMake Policy settings.

              As CMake evolves it is  sometimes  necessary  to  change  existing
              behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of exist&#8208;
              ing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep
              existing  projects  building  as  new  versions of CMake introduce
              changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given
              an identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where &quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer
              index.  Documentation associated with each  policy  describes  the
              OLD  and  NEW  behavior  and the reason the policy was introduced.
              Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When
              CMake  needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting
              specified by the project.  If no  setting  is  available  the  OLD
              behavior  is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the
              policy be set.


              The cmake_policy command is used to set policies  to  OLD  or  NEW
              behavior.   While  setting  policies individually is supported, we
              encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.


                cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])

              Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the  given
              version  of  CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified ver&#8208;
              sion or earlier will be set to use  NEW  behavior.   All  policies
              introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless vari&#8208;
              able CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This  effec&#8208;
              tively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and
              tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.   The
              policy  version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will
              report an error.  In order to get compatibility features  support&#8208;
              ing versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.


                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
                cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)

              Tell  CMake  to  use  the  OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.
              Projects depending on the old  behavior  of  a  given  policy  may
              silence  a  policy  warning  by  setting  the policy state to OLD.
              Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new  behav&#8208;
              ior and set the policy state to NEW.


                cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Check  whether  a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The
              output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot; or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set,
              and empty otherwise.


              CMake  keeps  policy  settings  on a stack, so changes made by the
              cmake_policy command affect only the top  of  the  stack.   A  new
              entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdi&#8208;
              rectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a
              new  entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() com&#8208;
              mands except when invoked with  the  NO_POLICY_SCOPE  option  (see
              also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an inter&#8208;
              face to manage custom entries on the policy stack:


                cmake_policy(PUSH)
                cmake_policy(POP)

              Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This  is
              useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.


              Functions  and macros record policy settings when they are created
              and use the pre-record policies when they  are  invoked.   If  the
              function  or macro implementation sets policies, the changes auto&#8208;
              matically propagate up through callers until they reach the  clos&#8208;
              est nested policy stack entry.


       configure_file
              Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

                configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
                               [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                               [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

              Copies  a  file  &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and substitutes variable
              values referenced in the file content.  If &lt;input&gt; is  a  relative
              path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory.
              The &lt;input&gt; must be a file, not a directory.   If  &lt;output&gt;  is  a
              relative  path  it is evaluated with respect to the current binary
              directory.  If &lt;output&gt; names an existing directory the input file
              is placed in that directory with its original name.


              This  command  replaces any variables in the input file referenced
              as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a
              variable  is  not  defined,  it will be replaced with nothing.  If
              COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.
              If  ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be
              C-style escaped.  The file will be  configured  with  the  current
              values  of  CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables
              of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and  ${VAR}  will  be  ignored.
              This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occur&#8208;
              rences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced  with  either  #define
              VAR  or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake.
              Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either
              #define  VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates
              to TRUE or FALSE in CMake.


              With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be adjusted:


                  &apos;UNIX&apos; or &apos;LF&apos; for \n, &apos;DOS&apos;, &apos;WIN32&apos; or &apos;CRLF&apos; for \r\n.

              COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.



       ctest_build
              Build the project.

                ctest_build([BUILD build_dir] [TARGET target] [RETURN_VALUE res]
                            [APPEND][NUMBER_ERRORS val] [NUMBER_WARNINGS val])

              Builds the given build directory and stores results in  Build.xml.
              If no BUILD is given, the CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY variable is used.


              The  TARGET  variable  can  be used to specify a build target.  If
              none is specified, the &quot;all&quot; target will be built.


              The RETURN_VALUE option specifies a variable in which to store the
              return  value of the native build tool. The NUMBER_ERRORS and NUM&#8208;
              BER_WARNINGS options specify variables in which to store the  num&#8208;
              ber of build errors and warnings detected.


              The  APPEND  option  marks  results for append to those previously
              submitted to  a  dashboard  server  since  the  last  ctest_start.
              Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.


       ctest_configure
              Configure the project build tree.

                ctest_configure([BUILD build_dir] [SOURCE source_dir] [APPEND]
                                [OPTIONS options] [RETURN_VALUE res])

              Configures the given build directory and stores results in Config&#8208;
              ure.xml. If no BUILD is given, the CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY variable
              is  used.  If no SOURCE is given, the CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY vari&#8208;
              able is used. The OPTIONS argument specifies  command  line  argu&#8208;
              ments  to  pass to the configuration tool. The RETURN_VALUE option
              specifies a variable in which to store the  return  value  of  the
              native build tool.


              The  APPEND  option  marks  results for append to those previously
              submitted to  a  dashboard  server  since  the  last  ctest_start.
              Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.


       ctest_coverage
              Collect coverage tool results.

                ctest_coverage([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res] [APPEND]
                               [LABELS label1 [label2 [...]]])

              Perform  the  coverage  of  the  given  build directory and stores
              results in Coverage.xml. The second argument is  a  variable  that
              will hold value.


              The  LABELS  option  filters  the  coverage report to include only
              source files labeled with at least one of the labels specified.


              The APPEND option marks results for  append  to  those  previously
              submitted  to  a  dashboard  server  since  the  last ctest_start.
              Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.


       ctest_empty_binary_directory
              empties the binary directory

                ctest_empty_binary_directory( directory )

              Removes a binary directory. This command will perform some  checks
              prior  to  deleting the directory in an attempt to avoid malicious
              or accidental directory deletion.


       ctest_memcheck
              Run tests with a dynamic analysis tool.

                ctest_memcheck([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res] [APPEND]
                           [START start number] [END end number]
                           [STRIDE stride number] [EXCLUDE exclude regex ]
                           [INCLUDE include regex]
                           [EXCLUDE_LABEL exclude regex]
                           [INCLUDE_LABEL label regex]
                           [PARALLEL_LEVEL level] )

              Tests the  given  build  directory  and  stores  results  in  Mem&#8208;
              Check.xml. The second argument is a variable that will hold value.
              Optionally, you can specify the starting test  number  START,  the
              ending  test  number END, the number of tests to skip between each
              test STRIDE, a regular expression for tests to run INCLUDE,  or  a
              regular expression for tests not to run EXCLUDE. EXCLUDE_LABEL and
              INCLUDE_LABEL are regular expressions for tests to be included  or
              excluded  by the test property LABEL. PARALLEL_LEVEL should be set
              to a positive number representing the number of tests to be run in
              parallel.


              The  APPEND  option  marks  results for append to those previously
              submitted to  a  dashboard  server  since  the  last  ctest_start.
              Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.


       ctest_read_custom_files
              read CTestCustom files.
&#12;                ctest_read_custom_files( directory ... )

              Read all the CTestCustom.ctest or CTestCustom.cmake files from the
              given directory.


       ctest_run_script
              runs a ctest -S script

                ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name script_file_name1
                            script_file_name2 ... [RETURN_VALUE var])

              Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from ctest -S. If
              no  argument  is provided then the current script is run using the
              current settings of the variables.  If  NEW_PROCESS  is  specified
              then each script will be run in a separate process.If RETURN_VALUE
              is specified the return value of the last script run will  be  put
              into var.


       ctest_sleep
              sleeps for some amount of time

                ctest_sleep(&lt;seconds&gt;)

              Sleep for given number of seconds.


                ctest_sleep(&lt;time1&gt; &lt;duration&gt; &lt;time2&gt;)

              Sleep for t=(time1 + duration - time2) seconds if t &gt; 0.


       ctest_start
              Starts the testing for a given model

                ctest_start(Model [TRACK &lt;track&gt;] [APPEND] [source [binary]])

              Starts the testing for a given model. The command should be called
              after the binary directory is initialized.  If  the  &apos;source&apos;  and
              &apos;binary&apos;    directory    are   not   specified,   it   reads   the
              CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY. If the track is
              specified,  the  submissions  will  go  to the specified track. If
              APPEND is used, the existing TAG is used rather  than  creating  a
              new one based on the current time stamp.


       ctest_submit
              Submit results to a dashboard server.

                ctest_submit([PARTS ...] [FILES ...] [RETRY_COUNT count]                [RETRY_DELAY delay][RETURN_VALUE res])

              By  default all available parts are submitted if no PARTS or FILES
              are specified.  The PARTS option lists a subset  of  parts  to  be
              submitted.  Valid part names are:


                Start      = nothing
                Update     = ctest_update results, in Update.xml
                Configure  = ctest_configure results, in Configure.xml
                Build      = ctest_build results, in Build.xml
                Test       = ctest_test results, in Test.xml
                Coverage   = ctest_coverage results, in Coverage.xml
                MemCheck   = ctest_memcheck results, in DynamicAnalysis.xml
                Notes      = Files listed by CTEST_NOTES_FILES, in Notes.xml
                ExtraFiles = Files listed by CTEST_EXTRA_SUBMIT_FILES
                Submit     = nothing

              The  FILES option explicitly lists specific files to be submitted.
              Each individual file must exist at the time of the call.


              The RETRY_DELAY option specifies how long in seconds to wait after
              a timed-out submission before attempting to re-submit.


              The  RETRY_COUNT  option  specifies  how  many  times  to  retry a
              timed-out submission.



       ctest_test
              Run tests in the project build tree.

                ctest_test([BUILD build_dir] [APPEND]
                           [START start number] [END end number]
                           [STRIDE stride number] [EXCLUDE exclude regex ]
                           [INCLUDE include regex] [RETURN_VALUE res]
                           [EXCLUDE_LABEL exclude regex]
                           [INCLUDE_LABEL label regex]
                           [PARALLEL_LEVEL level]
                           [SCHEDULE_RANDOM on]
                           [STOP_TIME time of day])

              Tests the given build directory and stores  results  in  Test.xml.
              The  second  argument  is a variable that will hold value. Option&#8208;
              ally, you can specify the starting test number START,  the  ending
              test  number  END,  the  number of tests to skip between each test
              STRIDE, a regular expression for tests to run INCLUDE, or a  regu&#8208;
              lar  expression  for  tests  to not run EXCLUDE. EXCLUDE_LABEL and
              INCLUDE_LABEL are regular expression for test to  be  included  or
              excluded  by the test property LABEL. PARALLEL_LEVEL should be set
              to a positive number representing the number of tests to be run in
              parallel. SCHEDULE_RANDOM will launch tests in a random order, and
              is typically used to detect implicit test dependencies.  STOP_TIME
              is the time of day at which the tests should all stop running.


              The  APPEND  option  marks  results for append to those previously
              submitted to  a  dashboard  server  since  the  last  ctest_start.
              Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.


       ctest_update
              Update the work tree from version control.

                ctest_update([SOURCE source] [RETURN_VALUE res])

              Updates   the   given  source  directory  and  stores  results  in
              Update.xml. If no  SOURCE  is  given,  the  CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
              variable  is used. The RETURN_VALUE option specifies a variable in
              which to store the result, which is the number of files updated or
              -1 on error.


       ctest_upload
              Upload files to a dashboard server.

                ctest_upload(FILES ...)

              Pass  a  list  of files to be sent along with the build results to
              the dashboard server.

                endwhile(expression)

              See the while command.


       exec_program
              Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.

              Run an executable program during  the  processing  of  the  CMake&#8208;
              List.txt file.


                exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
                             [ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;]
                             [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                             [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])

              The  executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
              executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
              better  to  use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to
              the program.   This is because cmake will then be able  to  escape
              spaces  in the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARI&#8208;
              ABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture
              the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUT&#8208;
              PUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output  will  go  to  the  std&#8208;
              out/stderr of the console running cmake.



       execute_process
              Execute one or more child processes.

                execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
                                [COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]]

                                [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])

              Runs  the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard
              output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A
              single  standard  error  pipe is used for all processes.  If WORK&#8208;
              ING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  of  the  child processes.  If TIMEOUT is
              given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish
              in  the  specified  number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If
              RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to  contain  the
              result  of  running the processes.  This will be an integer return
              code from the last child or a string describing  an  error  condi&#8208;
              tion.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable
              named will be set with the contents of  the  standard  output  and
              standard  error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is named
              for both pipes their output will be merged in the order  produced.
              If  INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named
              will be attached to the standard input of the first process, stan&#8208;
              dard  output  of  the  last process, or standard error of all pro&#8208;
              cesses respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then
              the  standard  output  or  standard  error results will be quietly
              ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for
              the  same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or
              ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the  cor&#8208;
              responding pipes of the CMake process itself.


              The  execute_process  command  is a newer more powerful version of
              exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.

              WRITE will write a message into a file called &apos;filename&apos;. It over&#8208;
              writes  the  file if it already exists, and creates the file if it
              does not exist.


              APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,  except  it
              will append it to the end of the file


              READ  will  read the content of a file and store it into the vari&#8208;
              able. It will start at the given offset and read up  to  numBytes.
              If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to
              hexadecimal representation and this will be stored  in  the  vari&#8208;
              able.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the content of a file.


              STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file  and  store
              it  in  a  variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage
              return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also  for  Intel  Hex
              and  Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to
              binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVER&#8208;
              SION.


              LIMIT_COUNT   sets  the  maximum  number  of  strings  to  return.
              LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of  bytes  to  read  from  the
              input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store
              in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length  of
              a  string  to  return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM
              sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are
              split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CON&#8208;
              SUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead  of  termi&#8208;
              nating them.


              REGEX  specifies  a regular expression that a string must match to
              be returned. Typical usage


                file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

              stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in which  each  item  is  a
              line from the input file.


              GLOB  will  generate  a  list of all files that match the globbing
              expressions and store it into the variable.  Globbing  expressions
              are  similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE
              flag is specified for an expression, the results will be  returned
              as  a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using
              GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.   If
              no  CMakeLists.txt  file changes when a source is added or removed
              then the generated build system cannot know when to ask  CMake  to
              regenerate.)
&#12;
              Examples of globbing expressions include:


                 *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
                 *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
                 f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

              GLOB_RECURSE  will  generate  a  list similar to the regular GLOB,
              except it will traverse all  the  subdirectories  of  the  matched
              directory  and  match  the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks
              are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is  given  or  cmake  policy
              CMP0009  is  not  set  to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for
              more information.


              Examples of recursive globbing include:


                 /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

              MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories,  also  if  their
              parent directories don&apos;t exist yet


              RENAME  moves  a  file or directory within a filesystem, replacing
              the destination atomically.


              REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories


              REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and  directories,  also
              non-empty directories


              RELATIVE_PATH  will  determine relative path from directory to the
              given file.


              TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with  unix
              /.   The  input  can  be  a  single  path  or  a  system path like
              &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;.   Note  the  double  quotes  around  the  ENV   call
              TO_CMAKE_PATH  only  takes   one  argument. This command will also
              convert the native list delimiters for a list of  paths  like  the
              PATH environment variable.


              TO_NATIVE_PATH  works  just  like  TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert
              from  a cmake style path into the native path style \ for  windows
              and / for UNIX.


              DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var
              is specified a log of the download will be put in var.  If  STATUS
              var  is  specified the status of the operation will be put in var.
              The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is
              the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element
              is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no  error
              in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will
              timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as  an  inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of inactivity after  which  the  operation  should  terminate.  If
              EXPECTED_MD5  sum is specified, the operation will verify that the
              downloaded file&apos;s actual md5 sum matches the expected value. If it
              does   not   match,   the   operation  fails  with  an  error.  If
              SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will  be  printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.
&#12;
              UPLOAD  will upload the given file to the given URL. If LOG var is
              specified a log of the upload will be put in var. If STATUS var is
              specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The sta&#8208;
              tus is returned in a list of length 2. The first  element  is  the
              numeric  return value for the operation, and the second element is
              a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error  in
              the  operation.  If  TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will
              timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as  an  inte&#8208;
              ger. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds
              of inactivity after  which  the  operation  should  terminate.  If
              SHOW_PROGRESS  is  specified, progress information will be printed
              as status messages until the operation is complete.


              The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:


                file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                     [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
                     [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
                     [FILES_MATCHING]
                     [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                      [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

              The COPY signature copies files, directories, and  symlinks  to  a
              destination  folder.   Relative  input  paths  are  evaluated with
              respect to the current source directory, and a  relative  destina&#8208;
              tion  is  evaluated  with  respect to the current build directory.
              Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a  file
              if  it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying
              preserves  input  permissions  unless  explicit   permissions   or
              NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS  are  given  (default  is USE_SOURCE_PERMIS&#8208;
              SIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for  documentation  of
              permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.


              The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status
              messages,  and  NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS  is  default.   Installation
              scripts  generated  by  the  install()  command use this signature
              (with some undocumented options for internal use).


       find_file
              Find the full path to a file.

                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many  cases.   It  is the same as find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_file(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find a full path to named  file.  A  cache
              entry  named  by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this com&#8208;
              mand.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in
              the  variable and the search will not be repeated unless the vari&#8208;
              able is  cleared.   If  nothing  is  found,  the  result  will  be
              &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,  and  the  search will be attempted again the next
              time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the
              full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names
              listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can
              be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the
              HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will  be  read
              and  converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style
              list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way  to  list  the
              system  path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
              documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies  addi&#8208;
              tional subdirectories to check below each search path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.

              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       find_library
              Find a library.

                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many cases.  It is the same as find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_library(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find a library. A  cache  entry  named  by
              &lt;VAR&gt;  is  created  to  store  the result of this command.  If the
              library is found the result is stored  in  the  variable  and  the
              search  will  not  be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If
              nothing is found, the  result  will  be  &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,  and  the
              search  will  be  attempted  again  the  next time find_library is
              invoked with the same variable.  The name of the library  that  is
              searched  for  is  specified  by  the names listed after the NAMES
              argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the
              PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
              the environment variable var will be read  and  converted  from  a
              system  environment  variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For
              example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path  variable.
              The  argument  after DOC will be used for the documentation string
              in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies  additional  subdirectories
              to check below each search path.


              If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  specified,  then  no additional paths are
              added to the search. If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH  is  not  specified,  the
              search process is as follows:


              1.  Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache variables.
              These are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with  a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These are intended to be set in the  user&apos;s  shell  configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3.  Search  the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4. Search the standard system environment variables. This  can  be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 LIB

              5.  Search  cmake  variables defined in the Platform files for the
              current system.  This can be skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH  is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
                 &lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6.  Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  PATHS option or in the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set  to  the
              full  path  to  the  framework &lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full
              path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -frame&#8208;
              work A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the target.


              If  the  global  property  FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is set all
              search paths will be tested as normal, with  &quot;64/&quot;  appended,  and
              with  all  matches of &quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;. This property
              is automatically set for the platforms that are known to  need  it
              if  at least one of the languages supported by the PROJECT command
              is enabled.


       find_package
              Load settings for an external project.

                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Finds  and  loads  settings  from  an  external  project.   &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND  will be set to indicate whether the package was found.
              When the package is found package-specific information is provided
              through  variables  documented  by  the package itself.  The QUIET
              option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The MOD&#8208;
              ULE  option  disables  the second signature documented below.  The
              REQUIRED option stops processing with  an  error  message  if  the
              package cannot be found.


              A package-specific list of required components may be listed after
              the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED option  if  present).
              Additional optional components may be listed after OPTIONAL_COMPO&#8208;
              NENTS.  Available components and  their  influence  on  whether  a
              package  is considered to be found are defined by the target pack&#8208;
              age.


              The [version] argument requests a version with which  the  package
              found       should       be       compatible       (format      is
              major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT  option  requests  that
              the  version be matched exactly.  If no [version] and/or component
              list is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module,  the
              corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer
              call (including the EXACT flag for [version]).  Version support is
              currently  provided  only  on  a package-by-package basis (details
              below).


              User code should generally look for packages using the above  sim&#8208;
              ple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation speci&#8208;
              fies the full command signature and details of the search process.
              Project  maintainers  wishing  to provide a package to be found by
              this command are encouraged to read on.


              The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: &quot;Mod&#8208;
              ule&quot;  mode  and  &quot;Config&quot; mode.  Module mode is available when the
              command is  invoked  with  the  above  reduced  signature.   CMake
              searches for a file called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the CMAKE_MOD&#8208;
              ULE_PATH followed by the  CMake  installation.   If  the  file  is
              found,  it  is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for
              finding the package,  checking  the  version,  and  producing  any
              needed  messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no support
              for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no  module  is
              found  and  the MODULE option is not given the command proceeds to
              Config mode.
&#12;              The complete Config mode command signature is:


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
                             [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                             [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
                             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
                             [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
                             [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
                             [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
                             [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                             [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                             [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
                             [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                              ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

              The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode  explicitly  and
              switch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using NO_MODULE.  Con&#8208;
              fig mode is also implied by use of options not  specified  in  the
              reduced signature.


              Config  mode  attempts  to locate a configuration file provided by
              the package to be found.  A cache entry  called  &lt;package&gt;_DIR  is
              created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the
              command searches for a package with the name  &lt;package&gt;.   If  the
              NAMES  option  is given the names following it are used instead of
              &lt;package&gt;.  The command searches for  a  file  called  &quot;&lt;name&gt;Con&#8208;
              fig.cmake&quot; or &quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each name spec&#8208;
              ified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may
              be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is speci&#8208;
              fied below.  Once found, the configuration file is read  and  pro&#8208;
              cessed  by  CMake.   Since  the file is provided by the package it
              already knows the location of package contents.  The full path  to
              the  configuration  file  is  stored  in the cmake variable &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_CONFIG.


              All configuration files which have been considered by CMake  while
              searching  for  an installation of the package with an appropriate
              version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CON&#8208;
              FIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.


              If  the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will gen&#8208;
              erate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is
              specified.   If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found
              a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.
              If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a con&#8208;
              figuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.


              When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find  a
              version   of  the  package  that  claims  compatibility  with  the
              requested version (format is  major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).   If
              the  EXACT  option is given only a version of the package claiming
              an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake  does
              not  establish  any convention for the meaning of version numbers.
              Package version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files provided by
              the  packages  themselves.   For a candidate package configuration
              file  &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot;  the  corresponding  version  file  is
              located  next to it and named either &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot;
              or &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;.   If  no  such  version  file  is
              available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compat&#8208;
              ible with any requested version.  A basic version file  containing
              generic  version  matching  code  can  be  created using the macro
              write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation for more
              details.   When  a version file is found it is loaded to check the
              requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a  nested
              scope in which the following variables have been defined:


                PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
                PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version
              and sets these variables:


                PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
                PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
                PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
                PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version

              These variables are checked by the find_package command to  deter&#8208;
              mine  whether  the  configuration file provides an acceptable ver&#8208;
              sion.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.
              If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:


                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION       = full provided version string
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
                &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4

              and  the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When
              multiple package configuration files are available  whose  version
              files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspec&#8208;
              ified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest
              or closest version number.


              Config  mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.
              Much of the interface is provided for  completeness  and  for  use
              internally  by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code
              should simply call


                find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])

              in order to find a package.  Package maintainers  providing  CMake
              package  configuration  files  are  encouraged to name and install
              them such that the procedure outlined below will find them without
              requiring use of additional options.


              CMake  constructs  a set of possible installation prefixes for the
              package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
              configuration   file.   The  tables  below  show  the  directories
              searched.  Each entry is meant for  installation  trees  following
              Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A) conventions.
&#12;                &lt;prefix&gt;/                                               (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/                                       (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/          (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/                (U)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)

              On  systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the
              following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles  con&#8208;
              taining a configuration file:


                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/                    (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
                &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

              In  all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as case-insensitive and corre&#8208;
              sponds to any of the names specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given  by
              NAMES).  Paths with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHI&#8208;
              TECTURE is set.  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified  the  suffixes  are
              appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.


              This  set  of  directories is intended to work in cooperation with
              projects that provide configuration files  in  their  installation
              trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for instal&#8208;
              lations on Windows where the prefix may point at  the  top  of  an
              application&apos;s  installation  directory.  Those marked with (U) are
              intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the  prefix  is
              shared  by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so all
              (W) and (U) directories  are  still  searched  on  all  platforms.
              Directories  marked  with  (A)  are  intended for installations on
              Apple platforms.  The  cmake  variables  CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  and
              CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE  determine  the order of preference as speci&#8208;
              fied below.


              The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the  follow&#8208;
              ing  steps.   If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_* options are
              enabled.


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;package&gt;_DIR
                 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should  be
              paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by
              the location of another item already  found.   Hard-coded  guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH  is  passed.   Path  entries
              ending  in  &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot; are automatically converted to their
              parent directories.


                 PATH

              5. Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake  GUI.
              This  can  be  skipped  if  NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed.  It is
              intended for the case when a user is building  multiple  dependent
              projects one after another.


              6.  Search  paths stored in the CMake user package registry.  This
              can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On Windows
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as  a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory containing the package configuration file.  On UNIX platforms
              a &lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory


                ~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;

              as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the direc&#8208;
              tory  containing  the  package  configuration   file.    See   the
              export(PACKAGE)  command  to  create user package registry entries
              for project build trees.


              7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package registry.  This
              can  be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  On
              Windows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key


                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;package&gt;

              as a REG_SZ value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the  direc&#8208;
              tory  containing the package configuration file.  There is no sys&#8208;
              tem package registry on non-Windows platforms.


              9. Search paths specified by the PATHS option.   These  are  typi&#8208;
              cally hard-coded guesses.


              On  Darwin  or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake vari&#8208;
              able    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty  or  one  of  the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On  Darwin  or  systems  supporting  OS X Application Bundles, the
              cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one  of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The  CMake  variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one or more
              directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default it is empty. It is especially useful when  cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will search there too. By default at first the directories  listed
              in  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  and then the non-rooted directories will
              be searched. The default  behavior  can  be  adjusted  by  setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.   This behavior can be manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the    search    order    will   be   as   described   above.   If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be  used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The default search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to
              least-specific  for  common  use cases.  Projects may override the
              order by simply calling the command multiple times and  using  the
              NO_* options:


                 find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_package(&lt;package&gt;)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled by  setting
              the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
              documentation for the  CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt;  vari&#8208;
              able for more information.


              When   loading   a  find  module  or  package  configuration  file
              find_package defines variables to provide  information  about  the
              call  arguments  (and restores their original state before return&#8208;
              ing):


               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED      = true if REQUIRED option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY       = true if QUIET option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option was given
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS    = list of requested components
               &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;  = true if component &lt;c&gt; is required
                                              false if component &lt;c&gt; is optional

              In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor  the
              request  detailed  by  these  variables;  see  the find module for
              details.  In Config mode find_package handles REQUIRED, QUIET, and
              version options automatically but leaves it to the package config&#8208;
              uration file to handle components in a way that  makes  sense  for
              the  package.   The  package  configuration  file  may  set &lt;pack&#8208;
              age&gt;_FOUND to false to tell find_package that  component  require&#8208;
              ments are not satisfied.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       find_path
              Find the directory containing a file.

                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This is the short-hand signature for the command  that  is  suffi&#8208;
              cient  in  many  cases.   It  is the same as find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_path(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This command is used to find  a  directory  containing  the  named
              file.  A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result
              of this command.  If the file in a directory is found  the  result
              is  stored  in  the  variable  and the search will not be repeated
              unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found,  the  result
              will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the
              next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.   The  name
              of  the  file  in a directory that is searched for is specified by
              the names listed after the  NAMES  argument.    Additional  search
              locations  can  be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var
              is found in the HINTS or PATHS section  the  environment  variable
              var  will be read and converted from a system environment variable
              to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would  be  a
              way  to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will
              be used for the documentation string in the cache.   PATH_SUFFIXES
              specifies  additional  subdirectories  to  check below each search
              path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH
                 INCLUDE

              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


              When  searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h,
              then the framework search will look  for  A.framework/Headers/b.h.
              If  that  is  found the path will be set to the path to the frame&#8208;
              work. CMake will convert this to the correct -F option to  include
              the file.


       find_program
              Find an executable program.

                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

              This  is  the  short-hand signature for the command that is suffi&#8208;
              cient in many cases.  It is the same as  find_program(&lt;VAR&gt;  name1
              [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


                 find_program(
                           &lt;VAR&gt;
                           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
                           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
                           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
                           [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
                           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                          )

              This  command  is  used  to find a program. A cache entry named by
              &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the pro&#8208;
              gram  is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
              will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.   If  nothing
              is  found,  the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will
              be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with  the
              same  variable.   The  name of the program that is searched for is
              specified by the names listed after the  NAMES  argument.    Addi&#8208;
              tional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
              If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the  environment
              variable  var will be read and converted from a system environment
              variable to a cmake style list of paths.   For  example  ENV  PATH
              would  be  a  way  to  list the system path variable. The argument
              after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the  cache.
              PATH_SUFFIXES  specifies  additional subdirectories to check below
              each search path.


              If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified,  then  no  additional  paths  are
              added  to  the  search.  If  NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the
              search process is as follows:


              1. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.
              These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the  command  line  with a
              -DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
              These  are  intended  to be set in the user&apos;s shell configuration.
              This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.   These  should
              be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided
              by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses
              should be specified with the PATHS option.


              4.  Search  the standard system environment variables. This can be
              skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


                 PATH


              5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the
              current  system.   This  can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is
              passed.


                 &lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
                 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

              6. Search the paths specified  by  the  PATHS  option  or  in  the
              short-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard-coded
              guesses.


              On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the  cmake  vari&#8208;
              able     CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK  can  be  set to empty or one of the
              following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find frameworks before standard
                            libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find frameworks after standard
                            libraries or headers.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find frameworks.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find frameworks.

              On Darwin or systems supporting  OS  X  Application  Bundles,  the
              cmake  variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of
              the following:


                 &quot;FIRST&quot;  - Try to find application bundles before standard
                            programs. This is the default on Darwin.
                 &quot;LAST&quot;   - Try to find application bundles after standard
                            programs.
                 &quot;ONLY&quot;   - Only try to find application bundles.
                 &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find application bundles.

              The CMake variable  CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  specifies  one  or  more
              directories  to be prepended to all other search directories. This
              effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the entire search under given locations. By
              default  it is empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling
              to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
              will  search there too. By default at first the directories listed
              in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted  directories  will
              be  searched.  The  default  behavior  can  be adjusted by setting
              CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM.  This behavior can be  manually
              overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
              the   search   order   will   be   as    described    above.    If
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not
              be used.  If  ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  is  used  then  only  the
              re-rooted directories will be searched.


              The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be most-specific to
              least-specific for common use cases.  Projects  may  override  the
              order  by  simply calling the command multiple times and using the
              NO_* options:


                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
                 find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

              Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and
              stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


       foreach
              Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

                foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endforeach(loop_var)

              All  commands  between  foreach  and  the  matching endforeach are
              recorded without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated,
              the  recorded  list  of commands is invoked once for each argument
              listed in the original foreach command.  Before each iteration  of
              the  loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot; will be set as a variable with the current
              value in the list.


                foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
                foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])

              Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers.  There
              are three types of this iteration:


              * When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to
              &quot;total&quot;.


              * When specifying two numbers, the range will have  elements  from
              the first number to the second number.


              *  The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from
              the first number to the second number.


                foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                                    [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])

              Iterates over a precise list of items.   The  LISTS  option  names
              list-valued  variables  to  be traversed, including empty elements
              (an empty string is a zero-length list).  The  ITEMS  option  ends
              argument  parsing  and  includes all arguments following it in the
              iteration.


       function
              Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

                function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that  takes  arguments  named  arg1
              arg2  arg3  (...).  Commands listed after function, but before the
              matching endfunction,  are  not  invoked  until  the  function  is
              invoked.   When  it is invoked, the commands recorded in the func&#8208;
              tion are first modified by replacing formal  parameters  (${arg1})
              with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In
              addition to referencing the formal parameters  you  can  reference
              the  variable  ARGC  which  will be set to the number of arguments
              passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1  ARGV2  ...  which
              will  have  the  actual  values  of  the arguments passed in. This
              facilitates creating functions with optional arguments.  Addition&#8208;
              ally  ARGV  holds  the list of all arguments given to the function
              and ARGN holds the list of argument past the last  expected  argu&#8208;
              ment.


              See  the  cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of
              policies inside functions.


       get_cmake_property

                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)

              Store a property of directory scope in the named variable.  If the
              property is not defined the empty-string is returned.  The  DIREC&#8208;
              TORY  argument  specifies another directory from which to retrieve
              the property value.  The specified  directory  must  have  already
              been traversed by CMake.


                get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                                       DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)

              Get  a  variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful
              to get a variable definition from another directory.


              See also the more general get_property() command.


       get_filename_component
              Get a specific component of a full filename.

                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH
                                       [CACHE])

              Set &lt;VAR&gt; to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file  extension
              (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, the full
              path (ABSOLUTE), or the  full  path  with  all  symlinks  resolved
              (REALPATH).   Note that the path is converted to Unix slashes for&#8208;
              mat and has no trailing slashes. The  longest  file  extension  is
              always  considered.  If  the optional CACHE argument is specified,
              the result variable is added to the cache.


                get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName
                                       PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;]
                                       [CACHE])

              The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or
              left  as  a  full  path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS is present with PROGRAM,
              then any command-line arguments present in the FileName string are
              split from the program name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;.  This is used
              to separate a program name from its arguments in  a  command  line
              string.


       get_property
              Get a property.

                get_property(&lt;variable&gt;
                             &lt;GLOBAL             |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                              TARGET    &lt;target&gt; |
                              SOURCE    &lt;source&gt; |
                              TEST      &lt;test&gt;   |
                              CACHE     &lt;entry&gt;  |
                              VARIABLE&gt;
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
                             [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

              Get  one  property from one object in a scope.  The first argument
              specifies the variable in which to store the result.   The  second
              argument  determines the scope from which to get the property.  It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY scope defaults to  the  current  directory  but  another
              directory  (already  processed  by  CMake) may be named by full or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope must name one existing target.


              SOURCE scope must name one source file.


              TEST scope must name one existing test.


              CACHE scope must name one cache entry.


              VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by  the  name
              of the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value
              is returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to  a
              boolean  value  indicating  whether the property has been set.  If
              the DEFINED option is given the variable is set to a boolean value
              indicating  whether  the  property  has  been defined such as with
              define_property. If BRIEF_DOCS or  FULL_DOCS  is  given  then  the
              variable  is  set  to  a  string  containing documentation for the
              requested property.  If documentation is requested for a  property
              that has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.


       if     Conditionally execute a group of commands.

                if(expression)

                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endif(expression)

              Evaluates  the  given expression.  If the result is true, the com&#8208;
              mands in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in
              the  else  section  are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are
              optional. You may have multiple  elseif  clauses.  Note  that  the
              expression  in the else and endif clause is optional. Long expres&#8208;
              sions can be used and there is a traditional order of  precedence.
              Parenthetical  expressions  are  evaluated first followed by unary
              operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED.  Then  any  EQUAL,
              LESS,  GREATER,  STRLESS,  STRGREATER,  STREQUAL,  MATCHES will be
              evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR  operators  will
              be evaluated. Possible expressions are:


                if(&lt;constant&gt;)

              True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
              False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, &quot;&quot;, or ends
              in   the   suffix   &apos;-NOTFOUND&apos;.    Named  boolean  constants  are
              case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these  constants,
              it is treated as a variable:


                if(&lt;variable&gt;)

              True  if  the  variable  is defined to a value that is not a false
              constant.  False otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are  not  vari&#8208;
              ables.)


                if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)

              True if the expression is not true.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if both expressions would be considered true individually.


                if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)

              True if either expression would be considered true individually.


                if(COMMAND command-name)

              True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
              invoked.


                if(POLICY policy-id)

              True if the  given  name  is  an  existing  policy  (of  the  form
              CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).


                if(TARGET target-name)

              True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.


                if(EXISTS file-name)
                if(EXISTS directory-name)

              True   if  the  named  file  or  directory  exists.   Behavior  is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)

              True if file1 is newer than file2 or  if  one  of  the  two  files
              doesn&apos;t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)

              True  if  the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined
              only for full paths.


                if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)

              True  if  the  given  name  is  a  symbolic  link.   Behavior   is
              well-defined only for full paths.


                if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)

              True if the given path is an absolute path.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)

              True  if  the  given  string or variable&apos;s value matches the given
              regular expression.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True if the given string or variable&apos;s value is a valid number and
              the inequality or equality is true.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              True  if the given string or variable&apos;s value is lexicographically
              less (or greater, or equal) than the string  or  variable  on  the
              right.


                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)
                if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)

              Component-wise  integer  version number comparison (version format
              is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).


                if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)

              True if the given variable is defined. It does not matter  if  the
              variable is true or false just if it has been set.


                if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))

              The  expressions  inside  the  parenthesis are evaluated first and
              then the remaining expression is  evaluated  as  in  the  previous
              examples.  Where  there  are  nested parenthesis the innermost are
              evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.


              The if command was written very early in CMake&apos;s history,  predat&#8208;
              ing the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evalu&#8208;
              ates variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signa&#8208;
              tures.   Note  that  normal  variable  evaluation with ${} applies
              before the if command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code
              like


                set(var1 OFF)
                set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;)
                if(${var2})

              appears to the if command as


                if(var1)

              and  is  evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;) case documented
              above.  The result is OFF which is false.  However, if  we  remove
              the ${} from the example then the command sees
&#12;                if(var2)

              which  is  true  because  var2 is defined to &quot;var1&quot; which is not a
              false constant.


              Automatic evaluation applies  in  the  other  cases  whenever  the
              above-documented signature accepts &lt;variable|string&gt;:


              1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it
              is a defined variable, if so the variable&apos;s value is used,  other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              2)  If  the  left  hand  argument to MATCHES is missing it returns
              false without error


              3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS  GREATER  EQUAL  are
              independently  tested  to see if they are defined variables, if so
              their defined values are used  otherwise  the  original  value  is
              used.


              4)  Both  left  and  right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STR&#8208;
              GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined  vari&#8208;
              ables,  if so their defined values are used otherwise the original
              value is used.


              5) Both left  and  right  hand  argumemnts  to  VERSION_LESS  VER&#8208;
              SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they
              are defined variables, if so their defined values are used  other&#8208;
              wise the original value is used.


              6)  The  right  hand  argument  to NOT is tested to see if it is a
              boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed
              to be a variable and it is dereferenced.


              7)  The  left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently
              tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they  are  used
              as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are deref&#8208;
              erenced.



       include
              Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

                include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;VAR&gt;]
                                      [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

              Reads CMake listfile code from the given file.   Commands  in  the
              file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of
              the include command.  If OPTIONAL is present,  then  no  error  is
              raised  if  the  file does not exist.  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given
              the variable will be set to  the  full  filename  which  has  been
              included or NOTFOUND if it failed.


              If  a  module  is  specified instead of a file, the file with name
              &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in
              the CMake module directory. There is one exception to this: if the
              file which calls include() is located itself in the  CMake  module
              directory,  then  first the CMake module directory is searched and
              CMAKE_MODULE_PATH afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.


              See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the
              NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.


       list   List operations.

                list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element index&gt; ...]
                     &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(APPEND &lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
                list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_ITEM &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt; ...])
                list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;)
                list(REVERSE &lt;list&gt;)
                list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)

              LENGTH will return a given list&apos;s length.


              GET  will  return  list  of elements specified by indices from the
              list.


              APPEND will append elements to the list.


              FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or
              -1 if it wasn&apos;t found.


              INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.


              REMOVE_AT  and  REMOVE_ITEM  will  remove items from the list. The
              difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items,  while
              REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.


              REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.


              REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.


              SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.


              The  list  subcommands  APPEND,  INSERT,  REMOVE_AT,  REMOVE_ITEM,
              REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create new values for  the
              list  within  the current CMake variable scope. Similar to the SET
              command, the LIST command creates new variable values in the  cur&#8208;
              rent  scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a par&#8208;
              ent scope. To propagate the results of these  operations  upwards,
              use  SET with PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other
              means of value propagation.


              NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To  cre&#8208;
              ate a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c
              d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) cre&#8208;
              ates a string or a list with one item in it.


              When  specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or greater,
              it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0  representing
              the  first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is
              indexed from the end of the list, with -1  representing  the  last
              list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they
              do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the  first  list  ele&#8208;
              ment.



       macro  Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

                macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)

              Define  a  macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1 arg2
              arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the  matching
              endmacro,  are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is
              invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified  by
              replacing  formal  parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed,
              and then invoked as normal commands. In  addition  to  referencing
              the  formal  parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which
              will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as
              well  as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual
              values of the  arguments  passed  in.  This  facilitates  creating
              macros  with  optional  arguments.  Additionally ${ARGV} holds the
              list of all arguments given to the macro  and  ${ARGN}  holds  the
              list  of  argument  past the last expected argument. Note that the
              parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in
              the  usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the
              c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake vari&#8208;
              ables you should look at the function command.


              See  the  cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of
              policies inside macros.


       make_directory
              Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.

                make_directory(directory)

              Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
              parent  directories  that  do not exist will also be created.  Use
              with care.


       mark_as_advanced
              Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

                mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)

              Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable
              will  not  be  displayed  in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show
              advanced option is on.  If CLEAR is the  first  argument  advanced
              variables  are  changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is the first
              argument, then the variable is made advanced.   If  neither  FORCE
              nor CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but
              if the variable already has  an  advanced/non-advanced  state,  it
              will not be changed.


              It does nothing in script mode.


       math   Mathematical expressions.
&#12;                math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math expression&gt;)

              EXPR  evaluates  mathematical  expression and return result in the
              output variable. Example mathematical expression is &apos;5 * ( 10 + 13
              )&apos;.   Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %.  They
              have the same meaning  as they do in c code.


       message
              Display a message to the user.

                message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
                        &quot;message to display&quot; ...)

              The optional keyword determines the type of message:


                (none)         = Important information
                STATUS         = Incidental information
                WARNING        = CMake Warning, continue processing
                AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
                SEND_ERROR     = CMake Error, continue but skip generation
                FATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop all processing

              The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and
              all  other  message  types  on stderr.  The CMake GUI displays all
              messages in its log area.  The  interactive  dialogs  (ccmake  and
              CMakeSetup)  show  STATUS  messages one at a time on a status line
              and other messages in interactive pop-up boxes.


              CMake Warning and Error  message  text  displays  using  a  simple
              markup  language.   Non-indented text is formatted in line-wrapped
              paragraphs delimited by newlines.   Indented  text  is  considered
              pre-formatted.


       option Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

                option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string describing option&quot;
                       [initial value])

              Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no ini&#8208;
              tial value is provided, OFF is used.


              If you have options that depend on the values  of  other  options,
              see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.


       remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.

                remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

              Removes  VALUE  from  the variable VAR.  This is typically used to
              remove entries from a  vector  (e.g.  semicolon  separated  list).
              VALUE is expanded.


       return Return from a file, directory or function.

                return()

              Returns  from  a file, directory or function. When this command is
              encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()),
              it  causes  processing  of the current file to stop and control is
              returned to the including file. If it is  encountered  in  a  file
              which is not included by another file, e.g. a CMakeLists.txt, con&#8208;
              trol is returned to the parent  directory  if  there  is  one.  If
              return  is called in a function, control is returned to the caller
              of the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does  not
              handle return like a function does.


       separate_arguments
              Parse space-separated arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

                separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt; &lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)

              Parses  a  unix- or windows-style command-line string &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; and
              stores a semicolon-separated list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;.   The
              entire command line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; argument.


              The  UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.
              It recognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs.   A  back&#8208;
              slash  escapes  the next literal character (\&quot; is &quot;); there are no
              special escapes (\n is just n).


              The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line  using  the
              same syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.
              It separates arguments by whitespace that  is  not  double-quoted.
              Backslashes  are  literal  unless they precede double-quotes.  See
              the MSDN article &quot;Parsing C Command-Line Arguments&quot; for details.


                separate_arguments(VARIABLE)

              Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated list.  All
              spaces  are replaced with &apos;;&apos;.  This helps with generating command
              lines.


       set    Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a given value.

                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;
                    [[CACHE &lt;type&gt; &lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])

              Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the  value  &lt;value&gt;.   &lt;value&gt;  is
              expanded before &lt;variable&gt; is set to it.  Normally, set will set a
              regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then  the  &lt;variable&gt;
              is  put  in  the cache instead, unless it is already in the cache.
              See section &apos;Variable types in CMake&apos; below for details of regular
              and  cache  variables  and  their  interactions. If CACHE is used,
              &lt;type&gt; and &lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by  the  CMake
              GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value. The value
              for &lt;type&gt; may be one of


                FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
                PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
                STRING   = Arbitrary string.
                BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
                INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).

              If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked  as  internal,
              and will not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui. This is
              intended for values that should be persisted  in  the  cache,  but
              which users should not normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.


              Normally,  set(...CACHE...)  creates cache variables, but does not
              modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of the  cache  vari&#8208;
              able  is  set,  even if the variable is already in the cache. This
              should normally be avoided, as it will remove any changes  to  the
              cache variable&apos;s value by the user.
&#12;
              If  PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope
              above the current scope. Each new directory or function creates  a
              new  scope. This command will set the value of a variable into the
              parent directory or calling function (whichever is  applicable  to
              the case at hand). PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.


              If  &lt;value&gt;  is not specified then the variable is removed instead
              of set.  See also: the unset() command.


                set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ... &lt;valueN&gt;)

              In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon  separated  list  of
              values.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )

              in which case the environment variable will be set.


              *** Variable types in CMake ***


              In  CMake  there  are two types of variables: normal variables and
              cache variables. Normal variables are meant for the  internal  use
              of the script (just like variables in most programming languages);
              they are not persisted across CMake runs. Cache variables  (unless
              set  with INTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings
              where the first CMake run determines  a  suitable  default  value,
              which  the user can then override, by editing the cache with tools
              such as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables  are  stored  in  the
              CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.


              Both  types can exist at the same time with the same name but dif&#8208;
              ferent values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks  for  a
              normal  variable &apos;FOO&apos; in scope and uses it if set. If and only if
              no normal variable exists then it falls back to the cache variable
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              Some examples:


              The  code  &apos;set(FOO  &quot;x&quot;)&apos; sets the normal variable &apos;FOO&apos;. It does
              not touch the cache, but it will hide  any  existing  cache  value
              &apos;FOO&apos;.


              The  code  &apos;set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...)&apos; checks for &apos;FOO&apos; in the cache,
              ignoring any normal variable of the same name. If &apos;FOO&apos; is in  the
              cache  then  nothing  happens to either the normal variable or the
              cache variable. If &apos;FOO&apos; is not in the cache, then it is added  to
              the cache.


              Finally,  whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a com&#8208;
              mand, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of  the  same  name
              from the current scope so that an immediately following evaluation
              of it will expose the newly cached value.


              Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of
              the same name, as this interaction can be hard to follow. However,
              in some situations it can be useful. One  example  (used  by  some
              projects):


              A  project  has a subproject in its source tree. The child project
              has its own CMakeLists.txt, which  is  included  from  the  parent
              CMakeLists.txt  using  add_subdirectory().  Now, if the parent and
              the child project provide the same option (for example a  compiler
              option),  the  parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable
              option to the cache. Normally, the child would then use  the  same
              value  that  the  parent  uses.  However,  it  may be necessary to
              hard-code the value for the child  project&apos;s  option  while  still
              allowing  the  user  to edit the value used by the parent project.
              The parent project can achieve this simply  by  setting  a  normal
              variable with the same name as the option in a scope sufficient to
              hide the option&apos;s cache variable from the  child  completely.  The
              parent  has  already  set  the  cache  variable,   so  the child&apos;s
              set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the option  vari&#8208;
              able  will use the value from the normal variable, which hides the
              cache variable.


       set_directory_properties
              Set a property of the directory.

                set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

              Set a property for the current directory  and  subdirectories.  If
              the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The proper&#8208;
              ties include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, INCLUDE_REGU&#8208;
              LAR_EXPRESSION,     and     ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.     ADDI&#8208;
              TIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as
              a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.


       set_property
              Set a named property in a given scope.

                set_property(&lt;GLOBAL                            |
                              DIRECTORY [dir]                   |
                              TARGET    [target1 [target2 ...]] |
                              SOURCE    [src1 [src2 ...]]       |
                              TEST      [test1 [test2 ...]]     |
                              CACHE     [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
                             [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
                             PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1 [value2 ...]])

              Set  one  property  on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first
              argument determines the scope in which the property  is  set.   It
              must be one of the following:


              GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


              DIRECTORY  scope  defaults  to  the  current directory but another
              directory (already processed by CMake) may be  named  by  full  or
              relative path.


              TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.


              SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
              file properties are visible only to  targets  added  in  the  same
              directory (CMakeLists.txt).
&#12;              TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.


              CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.


              The  required  PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name
              of the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used  to  compose
              the  property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.  If
              the APPEND option is given the list is appended  to  any  existing
              property  value.If the APPEND_STRING option is given the string is
              append to any existing property value as string, i.e.  it  results
              in a longer string and not a list of strings.


       site_name
              Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

                site_name(variable)


       string String operations.

              REGEX  MATCH  will match the regular expression once and store the
              match in the output variable.


              REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times  as
              possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.


              REGEX  REPLACE  will match the regular expression as many times as
              possible and substitute the replacement expression for  the  match
              in  the  output.  The replace expression may refer to paren-delim&#8208;
              ited subexpressions of the match using \1, \2, ..., \9.  Note that
              two  backslashes  (\\1)  are required in CMake code to get a back&#8208;
              slash through argument parsing.


              REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the  input
              with replace_string and store the result in the output.


              MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will compute a cryp&#8208;
              tographic hash of the input string.


              COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the  strings  and
              store true or false in the output variable.


              ASCII  will  convert  all numbers into corresponding ASCII charac&#8208;
              ters.


              CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a
              file.


              TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.


              LENGTH will return a given string&apos;s length.


              SUBSTRING  will return a substring of a given string. If length is
              -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin will be returned.


              STRIP will return a substring of a given string with  leading  and
              trailing spaces removed.


              RANDOM  will  return a random string of given length consisting of
              characters from the given alphabet. Default length is 5 characters
              and  default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case let&#8208;
              ters.  If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be  used
              to seed the random number generator.


              FIND  will return the position where the given substring was found
              in the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was used, the  command
              will  search for the position of the last occurrence of the speci&#8208;
              fied substring.


              The following characters have special meaning in  regular  expres&#8208;
              sions:


                 ^         Matches at beginning of a line
                 $         Matches at end of a line
                 .         Matches any single character
                 [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
                 [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
                  -        Matches any character in range on either side of a dash
                 *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
                 +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
                 ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
                 |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
                 ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced
                           in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved
                           by all regular expression-related commands, including
                           e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).


       unset  Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

                unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])
&#12;              Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If
              CACHE is present then the  variable  is  removed  from  the  cache
              instead of the current scope.


              &lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:


                unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})

              in  which case the variable will be removed from the current envi&#8208;
              ronment.


       use_mangled_mesa
              Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

                use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

              The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.   The  mesa
              headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
              mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by  being  added
              to the include directory path earlier.


       variable_watch
              Watch the CMake variable for change.

                variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to execute&gt;])

              If  the  specified  variable  changes, the message will be printed
              about the variable being changed. If the command is specified, the
              command  will  be executed. The command will receive the following
              arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
              &lt;stack&gt;)


       while  Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

                while(condition)
                  COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
                  COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
                  ...
                endwhile(condition)

              All  commands between while and the matching endwhile are recorded
              without being  invoked.   Once  the  endwhile  is  evaluated,  the
              recorded  list  of commands is invoked as long as the condition is
              true. The condition is evaluated using the same logic  as  the  if
              command.


       write_file
              Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.

                write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;... [APPEND])

              The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
              messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified,  then  the
              message will be appended.


              NOTE  1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as
              this one but add some more functionality.


              NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used  as
              an  input  to  CMake  (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it
              will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you  want  to
              generate input files to CMake.


PROPERTIES
         CMake Properties - Properties supported by CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.


       This  is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake. Proper&#8208;
       ties can have different scopes. They can either be assigned to  a  source
       file, a directory, a target or globally to CMake. By modifying the values
       of properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.


COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS
         CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.


       This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from  previ&#8208;
       ous  CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility reasons.
       You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;-)
