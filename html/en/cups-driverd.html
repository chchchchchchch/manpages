NAME
       cups-driverd - cups driver daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cups-driverd cat ppd-name
       cups-driverd list request_id limit options

DESCRIPTION
       cups-driverd shows or lists PPD files. It is run in response to CUPS-Add-
       Modify-Printer or CUPS-Get-Devices  requests.   The  first  form  (&quot;cups-
       driverd  cat  ppd-name&quot;)  writes the named PPD file to stdout. The output
       format is an uncompressed PPD file.

       The second form lists the available manufacturers or PPD files to  stdout
       as  indicated  by  the  options  argument.  The  output  format is an IPP
       response message. The request_id argument is  the  request  ID  from  the
       original  IPP request, typically 1. The limit argument is the limit value
       from the original IPP request - 0 means no limit.  Finally,  the  options
       argument  is a space-delimited list of attributes (&quot;name=value name=value
       ...&quot;) that were passed in with the request. Currently cups-driverd  looks
       for the ppd-make and requested-attributes attributes and tailors the out&#8208;
       put accordingly.

DRIVERS
       Drivers can be static PPD files under the /usr/share/cups/model directory
       or  programs  under  the /usr/lib/cups/driver directory. Static PPD files
       must conform to the Adobe PPD File Format Specification version  4.3  and
       may  be compressed using the gzip(1) program. Driver programs must imple&#8208;
       ment the command-line interface shown in the next section.

   DRIVER PROGRAMS
       Driver programs provide a  interface to dynamically-generated PPD  files.
       The following arguments are currently defined:

       drivername list
            Lists the supported PPD files to stdout.

       drivername cat ppdname
            Writes the named PPD file to stdout.

       Driver  programs  MUST  NOT query hardware or make other long-term opera&#8208;
       tions that would delay the return of a driver list. See the NOTES section
       below for specific recommendations.

   LISTING FILES (drivername list)
       When  run  with  the  single  argument  &quot;list&quot;, the program must list the
       available PPD files it can generate to stdout using the following format:
           &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot;
           &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284 device id&quot;
           &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284 device id&quot; &quot;(PPD product)&quot;
           &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284 device id&quot; &quot;(PPD product)&quot; &quot;PostScript version&quot;
           &quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot; &quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284 device id&quot; &quot;(PPD product)&quot; &quot;PostScript version&quot; &quot;type&quot;

       Drivername is the name of the driver program. Ppdname is the name used to
       select  the  given  driver.  Language  is  the locale associated with the
       default language of the PPD file, typically &quot;en&quot;. Make  is  the  Manufac&#8208;
       turer  name  from  the PPD file. Make and model is the NickName name from
       the PPD file. 1284 device id is the 1284DeviceId from the  PPD  file,  if
       any.  (PPD  product)  is the Product string as it would appear in the PPD
       file or from a PostScript query.  PostScript  version  is  the  PSVersion
       string  as  it  would  appear in the PPD file or from a PostScript query.
       Type is &quot;postscript&quot; for PostScript printers,  &quot;pdf&quot;  for  PDF  printers,
       &quot;raster&quot; for raster printers, or &quot;fax&quot; for facsimile devices.

   WRITING FILES (drivername cat ppdname)
       When  the driver program is run with the &quot;cat ppdname&quot; arguments, it must
       write the named PPD file to stdout, uncompressed. If the named  PPD  file
       does  not  exist,  the driver program must not write any output to stdout
       and report the error to stderr instead.

   DRIVER ERROR MESSAGES
       Error messages can be relayed back to cupsd by writing  them  to  stderr.
       The following prefixes are recognized:

       DEBUG: [drivername]
            Debugging messages

       ERROR: [drivername]
            Error messages

       INFO: [drivername]
            Informational messages

NOTES
       Due  to  performance considerations, driver programs have been officially
       deprecated and should not be used for new development. Currently only the
       CUPS  web  interface  and  lpinfo(8)  command will request lists from all
       driver programs.
