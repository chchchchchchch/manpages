NAME
       cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to lpd clients

SYNOPSIS
       cups-lpd [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -n ] [ -o option=value ]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-lpd  is  the  CUPS Line Printer Daemon (&quot;LPD&quot;) mini-server that sup&#8208;
       ports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol. cups-lpd does  not
       act  as a standalone network daemon but instead operates using the Inter&#8208;
       net &quot;super-server&quot; inetd(8) or xinetd(8). If you are using inetd, add the
       following line to the inetd.conf file to enable the cups-lpd mini-server:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd \
               -o document-format=application/octet-stream

       Note:  If  you  are  using  Solaris 10 or higher, you must run the inetd&#8208;
       conv(1m) program to register the changes to the inetd.conf file.

       If you are  using  the  newer  xinetd(8)  daemon,  create  a  file  named
       /etc/xinetd.d/cups containing the following lines:

           service printer
           {
               socket_type = stream
               protocol = tcp
               wait = no
               user = lp
            group = sys
            passenv =
               server = /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd
            server_args = -o document-format=application/octet-stream
           }

OPTIONS
       -h hostname[:port]
            Sets the CUPS server (and port) to use.

       -n
            Disables reverse address lookups; normally cups-lpd will try to dis&#8208;
            cover the hostname of the client via a reverse DNS lookup.

       -o name=value
            Inserts options for all print queues. Most often  this  is  used  to
            disable  the  &quot;l&quot;  filter  so that remote print jobs are filtered as
            needed for printing; the examples in the previous  section  set  the
            &quot;document-format&quot;  option to &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; which forces
            autodetection of the print file format.

PERFORMANCE
       cups-lpd performs well with small numbers of clients and  printers.  How&#8208;
       ever,  since  a new process is created for each connection and since each
       process must query the printing system before  each  job  submission,  it
       does  not  scale to larger configurations. We highly recommend that large
       configurations use the native IPP support provided by CUPS instead.

SECURITY
       cups-lpd currently does not perform any access control based on the  set&#8208;
       tings  in  cupsd.conf(5)  or in the hosts.allow(5) or hosts.deny(5) files
       used by TCP wrappers. Therefore, running cups-lpd  on  your  server  will
       allow  any  computer on your network (and perhaps the entire Internet) to
       print to your server.

       While xinetd has built-in access control support, you should use the  TCP
       wrappers  package with inetd to limit access to only those computers that
       should be able to print through your server.

       cups-lpd is not enabled by the standard CUPS distribution.   Please  con&#8208;
       sult with your operating system vendor to determine whether it is enabled
       on your system.

COMPATIBILITY
       cups-lpd does not enforce the restricted source port number specified  in
       RFC  1179,  as using restricted ports does not prevent users from submit&#8208;
       ting print jobs. While this behavior is different than standard  Berkeley
       LPD implementations, it should not affect normal client operations.

       The  output  of the status requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping between LPD
       and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD implementations stray from this defini&#8208;
       tion, remote status reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.
