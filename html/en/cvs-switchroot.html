CVS-SWITCHROOT(1)         BSD General Commands Manual        CVS-SWITCHROOT(1)

NAME
     cvs-switchroot &#8212; change repository or tag in a cvs working copy

SYNOPSIS
     cvs-switchroot [-T] newroot [file ...]

     cvs-switchroot [-T] - srcpath [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cvs-switchroot utility manipulates a CVS working copy directly, modify&#8208;
     ing the information stored in the administrative subdirectory and saving
     space by hardlinking if possible.

     If the -T option is given, the sticky tag is operated on, otherwise, the
     repository path (CVSROOT).

     The information (Tag or Root) is set to the same as in srcpath if the first
     non-option argument newroot is a sole dash (&#8216;-&#8217;), the literal value newroot
     otherwise.

EXAMPLES
     Change all Root information in the current sandbox to /cvs:

          $ cvs-switchroot /cvs .

     Set all roots in the current working directory and all its subdirectories
     to the Root of the parent directory:

          $ cvs-switchroot - .. .

     Hardlink the Tag information in the current working directory, for example
     /usr/src, and /usr/ports with each other:

          $ cvs-switchroot -T - . . /usr/ports
