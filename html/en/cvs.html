CVS(1)                                                                    CVS(1)



NAME
       cvs - Concurrent Versions System

SYNOPSIS
       cvs [ cvs_options ]
              cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]

NOTE
       This  manpage  is  a summary of some of the features of cvs.  It is auto-
       generated from an appendix of the CVS manual.  For more in-depth documen&#8208;
       tation,  please  consult  the Cederqvist manual (via the cvs(GNU) link in
       the MirBSD online (HTML) manual pages, the info CVS command or otherwise,
       as  described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).  Cross-references
       in this man page refer to nodes in the same.

CVS commands
   Guide to CVS commands
       This appendix describes  the  overall  structure  of  cvs  commands,  and
       describes  some commands in detail (others are described elsewhere; for a
       quick reference to cvs commands, see node &apos;Invoking CVS&apos; in the CVS  man&#8208;
       ual).


Structure
   Overall structure of CVS commands
       The overall format of all cvs commands is:


         cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]






       cvs

         The name of the cvs program.



       cvs_options

         Some  options that affect all sub-commands of cvs.  These are described
         below.



       cvs_command

         One of several different  sub-commands.   Some  of  the  commands  have
         aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the refer&#8208;
         ence manual for that command.  There are only two situations where  you
         may  omit cvs_command: cvs -H elicits a list of available commands, and
         cvs -v displays version information on cvs itself.



       command_options

         Options that are specific for the command.
&#12;

       command_args

         Arguments to the commands.

         There is unfortunately some  confusion  between  cvs_options  and  com&#8208;
         mand_options.   When  given  as  a cvs_option, some options only affect
         some of the commands.  When given as a command_option  it  may  have  a
         different  meaning,  and be accepted by more commands.  In other words,
         do not take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at the  docu&#8208;
         mentation instead.


Exit status
   CVS&apos;s exit status
       cvs  can  indicate  to  the  calling  environment whether it succeeded or
       failed by setting its exit status.  The exact way  of  testing  the  exit
       status  will vary from one operating system to another.  For example in a
       unix shell script the $? variable will be 0 if the last command  returned
       a  successful exit status, or greater than 0 if the exit status indicated
       failure.

       If cvs is successful, it returns a successful  status;  if  there  is  an
       error,  it prints an error message and returns a failure status.  The one
       exception to this is the cvs diff command.  It will return  a  successful
       status if it found no differences, or a failure status if there were dif&#8208;
       ferences or if there was an error.  Because  this  behavior  provides  no
       good  way  to  detect  errors, in the future it is possible that cvs diff
       will be changed to behave like the other cvs commands.


~/.cvsrc
   Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file
       There are some command_options that are used so often that you might have
       set  up an alias or some other means to make sure you always specify that
       option.  One example (the one that drove the implementation of the .cvsrc
       support,  actually)  is  that  many people find the default output of the
       diff command to be very hard to read, and that either  context  diffs  or
       unidiffs are much easier to understand.

       The  ~/.cvsrc  file is a way that you can add default options to cvs_com&#8208;
       mands within cvs, instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

       The format of the ~/.cvsrc file is simple.  The file is  searched  for  a
       line  that  begins  with the same name as the cvs_command being executed.
       If a match is found, then the remainder of  the  line  is  split  up  (at
       whitespace  characters)  into  separate  options and added to the command
       arguments before any options from the command line.

       If a command has two names (e.g., checkout and co),  the  official  name,
       not  necessarily  the one used on the command line, will be used to match
       against the file.  So if this is the  contents  of  the  user&apos;s  ~/.cvsrc
       file:


         log -N
         diff -uN
         rdiff -u
         update -Pd
         checkout -P
         release -d




       the  command cvs checkout foo would have the -P option added to the argu&#8208;
       ments, as well as cvs co foo.

       With the example file above, the output from cvs diff foobar will  be  in
       unidiff format.  cvs diff -c foobar will provide context diffs, as usual.
       Getting &quot;old&quot; format diffs would be slightly  more  complicated,  because
       diff  doesn&apos;t  have  an option to specify use of the &quot;old&quot; format, so you
       would need cvs -f diff foobar.

       In place of the command name you can use cvs to  specify  global  options
       (see node &apos;Global options&apos; in the CVS manual).  For example the following
       line in .cvsrc


         cvs -z6




       causes cvs to use compression level 6.


Global options
       The available cvs_options (that are given to  the  left  of  cvs_command)
       are:



       --allow-root=rootdir

         May  be  invoked  multiple times to specify one legal cvsroot directory
         with each invocation.  Also causes CVS to  preparse  the  configuration
         file  for  each  specified  root,  which can be useful when configuring
         write proxies,  See node &apos;Password authentication server&apos;  in  the  CVS
         manual &amp; node &apos;Write proxies&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -a

         Authenticate all communication between the client and the server.  Only
         has an effect on the cvs client.  As of  this  writing,  this  is  only
         implemented  when using a GSSAPI connection (see node &apos;GSSAPI authenti&#8208;
         cated&apos; in the CVS manual).  Authentication prevents  certain  sorts  of
         attacks  involving  hijacking  the  active  tcp  connection.   Enabling
         authentication does not enable encryption.



       -b bindir

         In cvs 1.9.18 and older, this specified that rcs programs  are  in  the
         bindir directory.  Current versions of cvs do not run rcs programs; for
         compatibility this option is accepted, but it does nothing.



       -T tempdir

         Use tempdir as the directory where temporary files are located.

         The cvs client and server store temporary files in a  temporary  direc&#8208;
         tory.   The  path  to  this temporary directory is set via, in order of
         precedence:


       &#183;   The argument to the global -T option.
&#12;
       &#183;   The value set for TmpDir in the config file (server only -  see  node
           &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual).


       &#183;   The contents of the $TMPDIR environment variable (%TMPDIR% on Windows
           - see node &apos;Environment variables&apos; in the CVS manual).


       &#183;   /tmp


           Temporary directories should always be specified as an absolute path&#8208;
           name.   When running a CVS client, -T affects only the local process;
           specifying -T for the client has no effect on  the  server  and  vice
           versa.



       -d cvs_root_directory

         Use  cvs_root_directory  as  the root directory pathname of the reposi&#8208;
         tory.  Overrides the setting of the $CVSROOT environment variable.  See
         node &apos;Repository&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -e editor

         Use editor to enter revision log information.  Overrides the setting of
         the $CVSEDITOR and $EDITOR environment variables.   For  more  informa&#8208;
         tion, see node &apos;Committing your changes&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -f

         Do  not read the ~/.cvsrc file.  This option is most often used because
         of the non-orthogonality of the cvs option set.  For example,  the  cvs
         log  option  -N  (turn off display of tag names) does not have a corre&#8208;
         sponding option to turn the display on.  So  if  you  have  -N  in  the
         ~/.cvsrc entry for log, you may need to use -f to show the tag names.



       -g

         Forges  group-writable  permissions on files in the working copy.  This
         option is typically used when you have multiple users sharing a  single
         checked  out  source tree, allowing them to operate their shells with a
         less dangerous umask at the expense of cvs security.  To use this  fea&#8208;
         ture, create a directory to hold the checked-out source tree, set it to
         a private group, and set up the directory such that files created under
         it inherit the gid of the directory.  On BSD systems, this occurs auto&#8208;
         matically. On SYSV systems and GNU/Linux, the sgid bit must be  set  on
         the  directory  for  this.   The users who are to share the checked out
         tree must be placed in that group which owns the directory.

         Note that the sharing of a single checked-out source tree is very  dif&#8208;
         ferent  from  giving  several  users access to a common cvs repository.
         Access to a common cvs repository already maintains shared  group-write
         permissions and does not require this option.

         Due  to the security implications, setting this option globally in your
         .cvsrc file is strongly discouraged; if you  must,  ensure  all  source
         checkouts  are  &quot;firewalled&quot;  within  a private group or a private mode
         0700 directory.

         This option is a MidnightBSD extension merged into MirBSD cvs.



       -H




       --help

         Display usage information about the specified cvs_command (but  do  not
         actually  execute  the  command).  If you don&apos;t specify a command name,
         cvs -H displays overall help for cvs, including a list  of  other  help
         options.



       -R

         Turns  on read-only repository mode.  This allows one to check out from
         a read-only repository, such as within an anoncvs  server,  or  from  a
         cd-rom repository.

         Same  effect as if the CVSREADONLYFS environment variable is set. Using
         -R can also considerably speed up checkouts over NFS.



       -n

         Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the cvs_command, but  only
         to  issue  reports; do not remove, update, or merge any existing files,
         or create any new files.

         Note that cvs will not necessarily produce exactly the same  output  as
         without  -n.   In  some cases the output will be the same, but in other
         cases cvs will skip  some  of  the  processing  that  would  have  been
         required to produce the exact same output.



       -Q

         Cause  the  command  to be really quiet; the command will only generate
         output for serious problems.



       -q

         Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages, such as
         reports of recursion through subdirectories, are suppressed.



       -r

         Make new working files read-only.  Same effect as if the $CVSREAD envi&#8208;
         ronment variable is set (see node &apos;Environment variables&apos;  in  the  CVS
         manual).  The default is to make working files writable, unless watches
         are on (see node &apos;Watches&apos; in the CVS manual).



       -s variable=value
&#12;         Set a user variable (see node &apos;Variables&apos; in the CVS manual).



       -t

         Trace program execution; display messages  showing  the  steps  of  cvs
         activity.   Particularly useful with -n to explore the potential impact
         of an unfamiliar command.



       -v




       --version

         Display version and copyright information for cvs.



       -w

         Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the setting of the  $CVS&#8208;
         READ  environment  variable.   Files are created read-write by default,
         unless $CVSREAD is set or -r is given.



       -x

         Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  Only  has
         an  effect  on the cvs client.  As of this writing, this is only imple&#8208;
         mented when using a GSSAPI connection (see node &apos;GSSAPI  authenticated&apos;
         in the CVS manual) or a Kerberos connection (see node &apos;Kerberos authen&#8208;
         ticated&apos; in the CVS manual).  Enabling encryption implies that  message
         traffic  is also authenticated.  Encryption support is not available by
         default;  it  must  be  enabled  using  a  special  configure   option,
         --enable-encryption, when you build cvs.



       -z level

         Request  compression  level  for network traffic.  cvs interprets level
         identically to the gzip program.  Valid levels are 1 (high  speed,  low
         compression)  to  9 (low speed, high compression), or 0 to disable com&#8208;
         pression (the default).  Data sent to the server will be compressed  at
         the requested level and the client will request the server use the same
         compression level for data returned.  The server will use  the  closest
         level  allowed  by  the server administrator to compress returned data.
         This option only has an effect when passed to the cvs client.


Common options
   Common command options
       This section describes the command_options that are available across sev&#8208;
       eral  cvs  commands.   These  options  are  always  given to the right of
       cvs_command. Not all commands support all of these options;  each  option
       is  only  supported  for  commands where it makes sense.  However, when a
       command has one of these options you can almost always count on the  same
       behavior  of  the  option  as in other commands.  (Other command options,
       which are listed with the individual commands, may have different  behav&#8208;
       ior from one cvs command to the other).

       Note:  the history command is an exception; it supports many options that
       conflict even with these standard options.



       -D date_spec

         Use the most recent revision no later than date_spec.  date_spec  is  a
         single argument, a date description specifying a date in the past.

         The specification is sticky when you use it to make a private copy of a
         source file; that is, when you get a working file using -D, cvs records
         the  date  you specified, so that further updates in the same directory
         will use the same date (for more information on sticky tags/dates,  see
         node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in the CVS manual).

         -D is available with the annotate, checkout, diff, export, history, ls,
         rdiff, rls, rtag, tag, and update commands.  (The history command  uses
         this  option in a slightly different way; see node &apos;history options&apos; in
         the CVS manual).

         For a complete description of the date formats  accepted  by  cvs,  see
         node &apos;Date input formats&apos; in the CVS manual.

         Remember  to  quote  the  argument  to  the  -D flag so that your shell
         doesn&apos;t interpret spaces as argument separators.  A command  using  the
         -D flag can look like this:


           $ cvs diff -D &quot;1 hour ago&quot; cvs.texinfo






       -f

         When  you  specify  a particular date or tag to cvs commands, they nor&#8208;
         mally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not exist  prior
         to  the  date) that you specified.  Use the -f option if you want files
         retrieved even when there is no match for the tag or date.   (The  most
         recent revision of the file will be used).

         Note  that even with -f, a tag that you specify must exist (that is, in
         some file, not necessary in every file).  This is so that cvs will con&#8208;
         tinue to give an error if you mistype a tag name.

         -f is available with these commands: annotate, checkout, export, rdiff,
         rtag, and update.

         WARNING:  The commit and remove commands also have a -f option, but  it
         has a different behavior for those commands.  See node &apos;commit options&apos;
         in the CVS manual, and node &apos;Removing files&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -k kflag

         Override the default processing of RCS keywords other  than  -kb.   See
         node  &apos;Keyword  substitution&apos;  in  the  CVS  manual, for the meaning of
         kflag.  Used with the checkout and update commands, your kflag specifi&#8208;
         cation  is sticky; that is, when you use this option with a checkout or
         update command, cvs associates your selected kflag with  any  files  it
         operates  on,  and  continues to use that kflag with future commands on
         the same files until you specify otherwise.

         The -k option is  available  with  the  add,  checkout,  diff,  export,
         import, rdiff, and update commands.

         WARNING:  Prior  to  CVS  version  1.12.2, the -k flag overrode the -kb
         indication for a binary file.   This  could  sometimes  corrupt  binary
         files.  See node &apos;Merging and keywords&apos; in the CVS manual, for more.



       -l

         Local;  run  only  in  current working directory, rather than recursing
         through subdirectories.

         Available with the  following  commands:  annotate,  checkout,  commit,
         diff,  edit,  editors,  export,  log, rdiff, remove, rtag, status, tag,
         unedit, update, watch, and watchers.



       -m message

         Use message as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         Available with the following commands: add, commit and import.



       -n

         Do not run any tag program.  (A program can be specified to run in  the
         modules  database  (see  node &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual); this option
         bypasses it).

         Note: this is not the same as the cvs -n program option, which you  can
         specify to the left of a cvs command!

         Available with the checkout, commit, export, and rtag commands.



       -P

         Prune  empty  directories.   See node &apos;Removing directories&apos; in the CVS
         manual.



       -p

         Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output, rather
         than  writing them in the current directory.  Available with the check&#8208;
         out and update commands.



       -R

         Process directories recursively.  This is the default for all cvs  com&#8208;
         mands, with the exception of ls &amp; rls.

         Available  with  the  following  commands:  annotate, checkout, commit,
         diff, edit, editors, export, ls, rdiff, remove, rls, rtag, status, tag,
         unedit, update, watch, and watchers.



       -r tag
&#12;
       -r tag[:date]

         Use  the  revision specified by the tag argument (and the date argument
         for the commands which accept it) instead of the default head revision.
         As  well  as  arbitrary  tags defined with the tag or rtag command, two
         special tags are always available: HEAD refers to the most recent  ver&#8208;
         sion  available  in  the  repository (also known as the tip of the MAIN
         branch, also known as trunk; the name of a branch refers  to  its  tip;
         this  version  of cvs introduces .bhead, but only for the diff command,
         for the same), and BASE refers to the revision  you  last  checked  out
         into the current working directory.

         The  tag  specification  is  sticky  when you use this with checkout or
         update to make your own copy of a file: cvs remembers the tag and  con&#8208;
         tinues to use it on future update commands, until you specify otherwise
         (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node &apos;Sticky  tags&apos;  in
         the CVS manual).

         The  tag  can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as described in node
         &apos;Tags&apos; in the CVS manual, or the name of a branch, as described in node
         &apos;Branching  and  merging&apos; in the CVS manual.  When tag is the name of a
         branch, some commands accept the optional date argument to specify  the
         revision  as of the given date on the branch.  When a command expects a
         specific revision, the name of a branch  is  interpreted  as  the  most
         recent revision on that branch.

         As  a  MirOS  cvs extension, specifying BASE as the date portion of the
         argument yields the base revision of the branch specified  by  the  tag
         portion of the argument, i.e. the revision on the parent branch the tag
         branch split off, or, where both branches were the same.   This  option
         has not received very much testing, beware!

         Specifying  the  -q  global  option along with the -r command option is
         often useful, to suppress the warning messages when the rcs  file  does
         not contain the specified tag.

         Note:  this is not the same as the overall cvs -r option, which you can
         specify to the left of a cvs command!

         -r tag is available with the commit and history commands.

         -r tag[:date] is available with the annotate, checkout,  diff,  export,
         rdiff, rtag, and update commands.



       -W

         Specify  file  names  that should be filtered.  You can use this option
         repeatedly.  The spec can be a file name pattern of the same type  that
         you can specify in the .cvswrappers file.  Available with the following
         commands: import, and update.



admin
   Administration
       &#183; Requires: repository, working directory.

       &#183; Changes: repository.

       &#183; Synonym: rcs

         This is the cvs interface to assorted administrative facilities.   Some
         of  them  have questionable usefulness for cvs but exist for historical
         purposes.  Some of the questionable options are likely to disappear  in
         the future.  This command does work recursively, so extreme care should
         be used.

         On unix, if there is a group named cvsadmin, only members of that group
         can  run cvs admin commands, except for those specified using the User&#8208;
         AdminOptions configuration option in the CVSROOT/config file.   Options
         specified  using  UserAdminOptions  can  be  run by any user.  See node
         &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual for more on UserAdminOptions.

         The cvsadmin group should exist on the server, or  any  system  running
         the non-client/server cvs.  To disallow cvs admin for all users, create
         a group with no users in it.  On NT,  the  cvsadmin  feature  does  not
         exist and all users can run cvs admin.


admin options
       Some  of these options have questionable usefulness for cvs but exist for
       historical purposes.  Some even make it impossible to use cvs  until  you
       undo the effect!



       -Aoldfile

         Might not work together with cvs.  Append the access list of oldfile to
         the access list of the rcs file.



       -alogins

         Might not work together with cvs.  Append the login names appearing  in
         the comma-separated list logins to the access list of the rcs file.



       -b[rev]

         Set  the default branch to rev.  In cvs, you normally do not manipulate
         default branches; sticky tags (see node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in the  CVS  man&#8208;
         ual)  are  a  better  way  to  decide which branch you want to work on.
         There is one reason to run cvs admin -b: to revert to the vendor&apos;s ver&#8208;
         sion  when using vendor branches (see node &apos;Reverting local changes&apos; in
         the CVS manual).  There can be no space between -b and its argument.



       -cstring

         Sets the comment leader to string.  The comment leader is not  used  by
         current  versions  of cvs or rcs 5.7.  Therefore, you can almost surely
         not worry about it.  See node &apos;Keyword substitution&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -e[logins]

         Might not work together with cvs.  Erase the login names  appearing  in
         the  comma-separated  list logins from the access list of the RCS file.
         If logins is omitted, erase the entire access list.  There  can  be  no
         space between -e and its argument.



       -I

         Run  interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.  This
         option does not work with the client/server cvs and is likely to disap&#8208;
         pear in a future release of cvs.
&#12;
       -i

         Useless with cvs.  This creates and initializes a new rcs file, without
         depositing a revision.  With cvs, add files with the  cvs  add  command
         (see node &apos;Adding files&apos; in the CVS manual).



       -ksubst

         Set  the default keyword substitution to subst.  See node &apos;Keyword sub&#8208;
         stitution&apos; in the CVS manual.  Giving an  explicit  -k  option  to  cvs
         update, cvs export, or cvs checkout overrides this default.



       -l[rev]

         Lock the revision with number rev.  If a branch is given, lock the lat&#8208;
         est revision on that branch.  If rev is omitted, lock the latest  revi&#8208;
         sion  on  the default branch.  There can be no space between -l and its
         argument.

         This can be used in conjunction with the rcslock.pl script in the  con&#8208;
         trib  directory  of  the  cvs  source  distribution to provide reserved
         checkouts (where only one user can be editing a given file at a  time).
         See  the  comments in that file for details (and see the README file in
         that directory for disclaimers about the  unsupported  nature  of  con&#8208;
         trib).   According to comments in that file, locking must set to strict
         (which is the default).



       -L

         Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the owner of  an  RCS
         file  is not exempt from locking for checkin.  For use with cvs, strict
         locking must be set; see the discussion under the -l option above.



       -mrev:msg

         Replace the log message of revision rev with msg.



       -Nname[:[rev]]

         Act like -n, except override any previous assignment of name.  For  use
         with magic branches, see node &apos;Magic branch numbers&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -nname[:[rev]]

         Associate  the  symbolic name name with the branch or revision rev.  It
         is normally better to use cvs tag or cvs rtag instead.  Delete the sym&#8208;
         bolic  name  if  both  : and rev are omitted; otherwise, print an error
         message if name is already associated with another number.  If  rev  is
         symbolic,  it  is  expanded  before association.  A rev consisting of a
         branch number followed by a . stands for the current latest revision in
         the  branch.  A : with an empty rev stands for the current latest revi&#8208;
         sion on the default branch, normally the trunk.  For example, cvs admin
         -nname: associates name with the current latest revision of all the RCS
         files; this contrasts with cvs admin  -nname:$  which  associates  name
         with  the revision numbers extracted from keyword strings in the corre&#8208;
         sponding working files.



       -orange

         Deletes (outdates) the revisions given by range.

         Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless you  know  exactly
         what  you  are  doing (for example see the warnings below about how the
         rev1:rev2 syntax is confusing).

         If you are short on disc this option might help you.  But  think  twice
         before using it&#8212;there is no way short of restoring the latest backup to
         undo this command!  If you delete different revisions than you planned,
         either  due  to  carelessness or (heaven forbid) a cvs bug, there is no
         opportunity to correct the error before the revisions are deleted.   It
         probably would be a good idea to experiment on a copy of the repository
         first.

         Specify range in one of the following ways:


         rev1::rev2

           Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that cvs only stores
           the differences associated with going from rev1 to rev2, not interme&#8208;
           diate steps.  For example, after -o 1.3::1.5 one can  retrieve  revi&#8208;
           sion  1.3,  revision  1.5, or the differences to get from 1.3 to 1.5,
           but not the revision 1.4, or the differences  between  1.3  and  1.4.
           Other  examples:  -o 1.3::1.4 and -o 1.3::1.3 have no effect, because
           there are no intermediate revisions to remove.


         ::rev

           Collapse revisions between the beginning of the branch containing rev
           and  rev itself.  The branchpoint and rev are left intact.  For exam&#8208;
           ple, -o ::1.3.2.6 deletes revision  1.3.2.1,  revision  1.3.2.5,  and
           everything in between, but leaves 1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.


         rev::

           Collapse  revisions  between rev and the end of the branch containing
           rev.  Revision rev is left intact but the head revision is deleted.


         rev

           Delete the revision rev.  For example, -o 1.3  is  equivalent  to  -o
           1.2::1.4.


         rev1:rev2

           Delete  the  revisions  from  rev1  to  rev2,  inclusive, on the same
           branch.  One will not be able to retrieve rev1 or rev2 or any of  the
           revisions   in   between.    For   example,  the  command  cvs  admin
           -oR_1_01:R_1_02 . is rarely useful.  It means to delete revisions  up
           to,  and  including, the tag R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files
           that have not changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the  file  will  have
           the  same  numerical  revision number assigned to the tags R_1_02 and
           R_1_03.  So not only will it be impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03
           will also have to be restored from the tapes!  In most cases you want
           to specify rev1::rev2 instead.


         :rev
&#12;           Delete revisions from the beginning of the branch containing  rev  up
           to and including rev.


         rev:

           Delete  revisions from revision rev, including rev itself, to the end
           of the branch containing rev.

           None of the revisions to be deleted may have branches or locks.

           If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic  names,  and  one
           specifies one of the :: syntaxes, then cvs will give an error and not
           delete any revisions.  If you really want to delete both the symbolic
           names and the revisions, first delete the symbolic names with cvs tag
           -d, then run cvs admin -o.  If one  specifies  the  non-::  syntaxes,
           then  cvs  will  delete  the  revisions  but leave the symbolic names
           pointing to nonexistent revisions.  This behavior  is  preserved  for
           compatibility  with  previous  versions  of cvs, but because it isn&apos;t
           very useful, in the future it may change to be like the :: case.

           Due to the way cvs handles branches rev cannot be specified  symboli&#8208;
           cally  if it is a branch.  See node &apos;Magic branch numbers&apos; in the CVS
           manual, for an explanation.

           Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the revision you out&#8208;
           date.   Strange  things will happen if he starts to edit it and tries
           to check it back in.  For this reason, this option is not a good  way
           to  take back a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
           change instead (see node &apos;Merging two revisions&apos; in the CVS manual).



       -q

         Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.



       -sstate[:rev]

         Useful with cvs.  Set the state attribute of the revision rev to state.
         If  rev  is a branch number, assume the latest revision on that branch.
         If rev is omitted, assume the latest revision on  the  default  branch.
         Any  identifier is acceptable for state.  A useful set of states is Exp
         (for experimental), Stab (for stable),  and  Rel  (for  released).   By
         default,  the state of a new revision is set to Exp when it is created.
         The state is visible in the output from cvs log (see node &apos;log&apos; in  the
         CVS  manual),  and in the $Log$ and $State$ keywords (see node &apos;Keyword
         substitution&apos; in the CVS manual).  Note that cvs uses  the  dead  state
         for  its  own  purposes (see node &apos;Attic&apos; in the CVS manual); to take a
         file to or from the dead state use commands like cvs remove and cvs add
         (see node &apos;Adding and removing&apos; in the CVS manual), not cvs admin -s.



       -t[file]

         Useful with cvs.  Write descriptive text from the contents of the named
         file into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.  The file  pathname
         may  not  begin with -.  The descriptive text can be seen in the output
         from cvs log (see node &apos;log&apos; in the CVS manual).  There can be no space
         between -t and its argument.

         If  file is omitted, obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
         end-of-file or by a line containing . by itself.  Prompt for  the  text
         if interaction is possible; see -I.
&#12;
       -t-string

         Similar  to -tfile. Write descriptive text from the string into the rcs
         file, deleting the existing text.  There can be no space between -t and
         its argument.



       -U

         Set  locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means that the owner of
         a file need not lock a revision for checkin.  For use with cvs,  strict
         locking must be set; see the discussion under the -l option above.



       -u[rev]

         See  the  option  -l  above, for a discussion of using this option with
         cvs.  Unlock the revision with number  rev.   If  a  branch  is  given,
         unlock  the  latest revision on that branch.  If rev is omitted, remove
         the latest lock held by the caller.  Normally, only  the  locker  of  a
         revision  may  unlock it; somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the
         lock.  This causes the original locker to be sent a commit notification
         (see node &apos;Getting Notified&apos; in the CVS manual).  There can be no space
         between -u and its argument.



       -Vn

         In previous versions of cvs, this option meant to  write  an  rcs  file
         which  would be acceptable to rcs version n, but it is now obsolete and
         specifying it will produce an error.



       -xsuffixes

         In previous versions of cvs, this was documented as a way of specifying
         the  names of the rcs files.  However, cvs has always required that the
         rcs files used by cvs end in ,v, so this option has never done anything
         useful.



annotate
   What revision modified each line of a file?
       &#183; Synopsis: annotate [options] files...

       &#183; Requires: repository.

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

         For  each file in files, print the head revision of the trunk, together
         with information on the last modification for each line.  If  backwards
         annotation  is  requested, show the first modification after the speci&#8208;
         fied revision.  (Backwards annotation currently appears to be broken.)


annotate options
       These standard options  are  supported  by  annotate  (see  node  &apos;Common
       options&apos; in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -b
&#12;         Backwards,  show when a line was removed.  Currently appears to be bro&#8208;
         ken.



       -l

         Local directory only, no recursion.



       -R

         Process directories recursively.



       -f

         Use head revision if tag/date not found.



       -F

         Annotate binary files.



       -r tag[:date]

         Annotate file as of specified revision/tag or, when date  is  specified
         and  tag is a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed
         on date.  See node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -D date

         Annotate file as of specified date.


annotate example
       For example:


         $ cvs annotate ssfile
         Annotations for ssfile
         ***************
         1.1          (mary     27-Mar-96): ssfile line 1
         1.2          (joe      28-Mar-96): ssfile line 2




       The file ssfile currently contains two lines.  The ssfile line 1 line was
       checked  in  by  mary  on  March 27.  Then, on March 28, joe added a line
       ssfile line 2, without modifying the ssfile line  1  line.   This  report
       doesn&apos;t  tell  you  anything  about  lines  which  have  been  deleted or
       replaced; you need to use cvs diff for that (see node &apos;diff&apos; in  the  CVS
       manual).

       The  options to cvs annotate are listed in node &apos;Invoking CVS&apos; in the CVS
       manual, and can be used to select the files and  revisions  to  annotate.
       The  options  are  described  in  more  detail  there and in node &apos;Common
       options&apos; in the CVS manual.


checkout
   Check out sources for editing
       &#183; Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...
&#12;       &#183; Requires: repository.

       &#183; Changes: working directory.

       &#183; Synonyms: co, get

         Create or update a working directory containing copies  of  the  source
         files  specified  by  modules.   You must execute checkout before using
         most of the other cvs commands, since most  of  them  operate  on  your
         working directory.

         The  modules  are  either  symbolic names for some collection of source
         directories and files, or paths to directories or files in the  reposi&#8208;
         tory.   The  symbolic  names are defined in the modules file.  See node
         &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual.

         Depending on the modules you specify, checkout may  recursively  create
         directories  and  populate them with the appropriate source files.  You
         can then edit these source files at any  time  (regardless  of  whether
         other software developers are editing their own copies of the sources);
         update them to include new changes applied  by  others  to  the  source
         repository;  or  commit  your  work as a permanent change to the source
         repository.

         Note that checkout is used to create directories.  The top-level direc&#8208;
         tory  created  is  always  added  to  the  directory  where checkout is
         invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified module.  In the
         case  of a module alias, the created sub-directory may have a different
         name, but you can be sure that it will be  a  sub-directory,  and  that
         checkout  will  show  the  relative  path leading to each file as it is
         extracted into your private work area (unless you specify the -Q global
         option).

         The  files  created  by  checkout are created read-write, unless the -r
         option to cvs (see node &apos;Global options&apos; in the CVS manual)  is  speci&#8208;
         fied, the CVSREAD environment variable is specified (see node &apos;Environ&#8208;
         ment variables&apos; in the CVS manual), or a watch is in  effect  for  that
         file (see node &apos;Watches&apos; in the CVS manual).

         Note  that  running checkout on a directory that was already built by a
         prior checkout is also permitted.  This is similar to specifying the -d
         option  to  the  update  command in the sense that new directories that
         have been created in the repository will  appear  in  your  work  area.
         However,  checkout takes a module name whereas update takes a directory
         name.  Also to use checkout this way it must be run from the top  level
         directory  (where  you originally ran checkout from), so before you run
         checkout to update an existing directory, don&apos;t forget to  change  your
         directory to the top level directory.

         For  the  output produced by the checkout command see node &apos;update out&#8208;
         put&apos; in the CVS manual.


checkout options
       These standard options  are  supported  by  checkout  (see  node  &apos;Common
       options&apos; in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -D date

         Use  the  most  recent  revision  no  later  than date.  This option is
         sticky, and implies -P.  See node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in the CVS manual,  for
         more information on sticky tags/dates.



       -f

         Only useful with the -D or -r flags.  If no matching revision is found,
         retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).
&#12;

       -k kflag

         Process keywords according to kflag.  See node  &apos;Keyword  substitution&apos;
         in  the CVS manual.  This option is sticky; future updates of this file
         in this working directory will use the same kflag.  The status  command
         can  be  viewed  to see the sticky options.  See node &apos;Invoking CVS&apos; in
         the CVS manual, for more information on the status command.



       -l

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       -n

         Do not run any checkout program (as specified with the -o option in the
         modules file; see node &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual).



       -P

         Prune empty directories.  See node &apos;Moving directories&apos; in the CVS man&#8208;
         ual.



       -p

         Pipe files to the standard output.



       -R

         Checkout directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       -r tag[:date]

         Checkout the revision specified by tag or, when date is  specified  and
         tag  is  a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed on
         date.  This option is sticky, and implies -P.  See node  &apos;Sticky  tags&apos;
         in  the  CVS  manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.  Also,
         see node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.

         In addition to those, you can use these special  command  options  with
         checkout:



       -A

         Reset any sticky tags, dates, or -k options.  See node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in
         the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.



       -c

         Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of creat&#8208;
         ing or modifying any files or directories in your working directory.



       -d dir
&#12;         Create  a  directory called dir for the working files, instead of using
         the module name.  In general, using this flag is  equivalent  to  using
         mkdir dir; cd dir followed by the checkout command without the -d flag.

         There  is  an important exception, however.  It is very convenient when
         checking out a single item to have the output  appear  in  a  directory
         that  doesn&apos;t  contain  empty  intermediate  directories.  In this case
         only, cvs tries to ``shorten&apos;&apos; pathnames to avoid those empty  directo&#8208;
         ries.

         For  example, given a module foo that contains the file bar.c, the com&#8208;
         mand cvs co -d dir foo  will  create  directory  dir  and  place  bar.c
         inside.   Similarly,  given  a  module  bar  which has subdirectory baz
         wherein there is a file quux.c, the command cvs co -d dir bar/baz  will
         create directory dir and place quux.c inside.

         Using  the  -N  flag  will defeat this behavior.  Given the same module
         definitions above, cvs co -N -d dir foo will create directories dir/foo
         and  place  bar.c  inside,  while  cvs co -N -d dir bar/baz will create
         directories dir/bar/baz and place quux.c inside.



       -j tag

         With two -j options, merge changes from the revision specified with the
         first  -j  option  to  the revision specified with the second j option,
         into the working directory.

         With one -j option, merge changes from the  ancestor  revision  to  the
         revision specified with the -j option, into the working directory.  The
         ancestor revision is the common ancestor  of  the  revision  which  the
         working  directory  is  based  on, and the revision specified in the -j
         option.

         In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date  specification
         which,  when  used  with branches, can limit the chosen revision to one
         within a specific date.  An optional date  is  specified  by  adding  a
         colon (:) to the tag: -jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier.

         See node &apos;Branching and merging&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -N

         Only  useful  together  with  -d  dir.   With this option, cvs will not
         ``shorten&apos;&apos; module paths in your working directory when you check out a
         single module.  See the -d flag for examples and a discussion.



       -s

         Like -c, but include the status of all modules, and sort it by the sta&#8208;
         tus string.  See node &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual, for info  about  the
         -s  option  that is used inside the modules file to set the module sta&#8208;
         tus.


checkout examples
       Get a copy of the module tc:


         $ cvs checkout tc




       Get a copy of the module tc as it looked one day ago:


         $ cvs checkout -D yesterday tc
&#12;



commit
   Check files into the repository
       &#183; Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m &apos;log_message&apos; |  -F  file]  [-r  revision]
         [files...]

       &#183; Requires: working directory, repository.

       &#183; Changes: repository.

       &#183; Synonym: ci

         Use  commit  when  you  want  to  incorporate changes from your working
         source files into the source repository.

         If you don&apos;t specify particular files to commit, all of  the  files  in
         your  working  current  directory  are  examined.  commit is careful to
         change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.
         By  default (or if you explicitly specify the -R option), files in sub&#8208;
         directories are also examined and committed if they have  changed;  you
         can use the -l option to limit commit to the current directory only.

         commit verifies that the selected files are up to date with the current
         revisions in the source repository; it will notify you, and exit  with&#8208;
         out  committing,  if  any  of  the specified files must be made current
         first with update (see node &apos;update&apos; in the CVS manual).   commit  does
         not  call the update command for you, but rather leaves that for you to
         do when the time is right.

         When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log mes&#8208;
         sage  that  will  be  written to one or more logging programs (see node
         &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual, and see node &apos;loginfo&apos; in the CVS  manual)
         and placed in the rcs file inside the repository.  This log message can
         be retrieved with the log command; see node &apos;log&apos; in  the  CVS  manual.
         You can specify the log message on the command line with the -m message
         option, and thus avoid the editor invocation, or use the -F file option
         to specify that the argument file contains the log message.

         At  commit,  a  unique  commitid  is  placed in the rcs file inside the
         repository. All files committed at once get the same commitid, a string
         consisting  only  of  hexadecimal  digits (usually 16 in GNU cvs, 19 in
         MirBSD and MirDebian GNU cvs).  FSF GNU cvs 1.11, MirOS GNU  cvs  1.11,
         and  OpenBSD OpenCVS do not support commitids yet.  The commitid can be
         retrieved with the log and status command; see node &apos;log&apos;  in  the  CVS
         manual and node &apos;File status&apos; in the CVS manual.


commit options
       These standard options are supported by commit (see node &apos;Common options&apos;
       in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -l

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       -R

         Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.



       -r revision

         Commit to revision.  revision must be either a branch, or a revision on
         the  main  trunk  that is higher than any existing revision number (see
         node &apos;Assigning revisions&apos; in the CVS manual).  You cannot commit to  a
         specific revision on a branch.

         commit also supports these options:



       -c

         Refuse  to  commit files unless the user has registered a valid edit on
         the file via cvs edit.  This is most useful when commit -c and edit  -c
         have  been  placed in all .cvsrc files.  A commit can be forced anyways
         by either regestering an edit retroactively via cvs edit (no changes to
         the  file  will be lost) or using the -f option to commit.  Support for
         commit -c requires  both  client  and  a  server  versions  1.12.10  or
         greater.



       -F file

         Read the log message from file, instead of invoking an editor.



       -f

         Note that this is not the standard behavior of the -f option as defined
         in node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.

         Force cvs to commit a new revision even if you haven&apos;t made any changes
         to  the  file.  As of cvs version 1.12.10, it also causes the -c option
         to be ignored.  If the current revision of file is 1.7, then  the  fol&#8208;
         lowing two commands are equivalent:


           $ cvs commit -f file
           $ cvs commit -r 1.8 file




         The  -f  option disables recursion (i.e., it implies -l).  To force cvs
         to commit a new revision for all files in all subdirectories, you  must
         use -f -R.



       -m message

         Use message as the log message, instead of invoking an editor.


commit examples
   Committing to a branch
       You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots)
       with the -r option.  To create a branch revision, use the  -b  option  of
       the  rtag  or  tag  commands (see node &apos;Branching and merging&apos; in the CVS
       manual).  Then, either checkout or  update  can  be  used  to  base  your
       sources  on  the  newly  created  branch.  From that point on, all commit
       changes made within these working sources will be automatically added  to
       a  branch  revision,  thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
       way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the 1.2 version of the
       product,  even  though  the 2.0 version is already under development, you
       might do:


         $ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cd product_module
         [[ hack away ]]
         $ cvs commit




       This works automatically since the -r option is sticky.


   Creating the branch after editing
       Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software,  based
       on  whatever  revision  you happened to checkout last week.  If others in
       your group would like to work on this software with you, but without dis&#8208;
       turbing  main-line  development,  you  could  commit your change to a new
       branch.  Others can then checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the
       full benefit of cvs conflict resolution.  The scenario might look like:


         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs update -r EXPR1
         $ cvs commit




       The  update  command  will  make the -r EXPR1 option sticky on all files.
       Note that your changes to the files will never be removed by  the  update
       command.   The  commit  will  automatically commit to the correct branch,
       because the -r is sticky.  You could also do like this:


         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs commit -r EXPR1




       but then, only those files that were changed by  you  will  have  the  -r
       EXPR1  sticky  flag.  If you hack away, and commit without specifying the
       -r EXPR1 flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main trunk.

       To work with you on the experimental change, others would simply do


         $ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module





diff
   Show differences between revisions
       &#183; Synopsis: diff [-lR] [-k kflag] [format_options] [(-r rev1[:date1] | -D
         date1) [-r rev2[:date2] | -D date2]] [files...]

       &#183; Requires: working directory, repository.

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

         The  diff command is used to compare different revisions of files.  The
         default action is to compare your working files with the revisions they
         were based on, and report any differences that are found.

         If  any  file  names  are given, only those files are compared.  If any
         directories are given, all files under them will be compared.

         The exit status for diff is different than for other cvs commands;  for
         details see node &apos;Exit status&apos; in the CVS manual.


diff options
       These  standard  options are supported by diff (see node &apos;Common options&apos;
       in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -D date

         Use the most recent revision no later than date.  See -r for  how  this
         affects the comparison.



       -k kflag

         Process  keywords  according to kflag.  See node &apos;Keyword substitution&apos;
         in the CVS manual.



       -l

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       -R

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       -r tag[:date]

         Compare with revision specified by tag or, when date is  specified  and
         tag  is  a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed on
         date.  Zero, one or two -r options can be present.  With no -r  option,
         the  working  file  will be compared with the revision it was based on.
         With one -r, that revision will be compared  to  your  current  working
         file.   With  two  -r options those two revisions will be compared (and
         your working file will not affect the outcome in any way).

         One or both -r options can be replaced by a -D date  option,  described
         above.

         The  following options specify the format of the output.  They have the
         same meaning as in GNU diff.  Most options have two  equivalent  names,
         one  of  which is a single letter preceded by -, and the other of which
         is a long name preceded by --.



       -lines

         Show lines (an integer) lines of context.  This option does not specify
         an output format by itself; it has no effect unless it is combined with
         -c or -u.  This option is obsolete.  For proper operation, patch  typi&#8208;
         cally needs at least two lines of context.



       -a

         Treat  all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they do
         not seem to be text.



       -b

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one  or
         more white space characters to be equivalent.



       -B

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.



       --binary

         Read and write data in binary mode.
&#12;

       --brief

         Report  only  whether  the files differ, not the details of the differ&#8208;
         ences.



       -c

         Use the context output format.



       -C lines




       --context[=lines]

         Use the context output format, showing lines (an integer) lines of con&#8208;
         text, or three if lines is not given.  For proper operation, patch typ&#8208;
         ically needs at least two lines of context.



       --changed-group-format=format

         Use format to output a line group containing differing lines from  both
         files in if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line group formats&apos; in the CVS
         manual.



       -d

         Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set  of  changes.   This
         makes diff slower (sometimes much slower).



       -e




       --ed

         Make output that is a valid ed script.



       --expand-tabs

         Expand  tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
         in the input files.



       -f

         Make output that looks vaguely like an ed script but has changes in the
         order they appear in the file.



       -F regexp

         In  context and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some
         of the last preceding line that matches regexp.



       --forward-ed
&#12;         Make output that looks vaguely like an ed script but has changes in the
         order they appear in the file.



       -H

         Use  heuristics  to  speed  handling  of large files that have numerous
         scattered small changes.



       --horizon-lines=lines

         Do not discard the last lines lines of the common prefix and the  first
         lines lines of the common suffix.



       -i

         Ignore  changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case letters equiva&#8208;
         lent.



       -I regexp

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.



       --ifdef=name

         Make merged if-then-else output using name.



       --ignore-all-space

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.



       --ignore-blank-lines

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.



       --ignore-case

         Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.



       --ignore-matching-lines=regexp

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.



       --ignore-space-change

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one  or
         more white space characters to be equivalent.



       --initial-tab

         Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a line in normal or
         context format.  This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to  look
         normal.



       -L label
&#12;         Use  label  instead  of the file name in the context format and unified
         format headers.



       --label=label

         Use label instead of the file name in the context  format  and  unified
         format headers.



       --left-column

         Print only the left column of two common lines in side by side format.



       --line-format=format

         Use  format to output all input lines in if-then-else format.  See node
         &apos;Line formats&apos; in the CVS manual.



       --minimal

         Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set  of  changes.   This
         makes diff slower (sometimes much slower).



       -n

         Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each command specifies the
         number of lines affected.



       -N




       --new-file

         In directory comparison, if a file is  found  in  only  one  directory,
         treat it as present but empty in the other directory.



       --new-group-format=format

         Use  format  to output a group of lines taken from just the second file
         in if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line group formats&apos; in the CVS  man&#8208;
         ual.



       --new-line-format=format

         Use  format  to  output  a  line  taken  from  just  the second file in
         if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line formats&apos; in the CVS manual.



       --old-group-format=format

         Use format to output a group of lines taken from just the first file in
         if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line group formats&apos; in the CVS manual.



       --old-line-format=format

         Use  format  to  output  a  line  taken  from  just  the  first file in
         if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line formats&apos; in the CVS manual.
&#12;
       -p

         Show which C function each change is in.



       --rcs

         Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each command specifies the
         number of lines affected.



       --report-identical-files




       -s

         Report when two files are the same.



       --show-c-function

         Show which C function each change is in.



       --show-function-line=regexp

         In  context and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some
         of the last preceding line that matches regexp.



       --side-by-side

         Use the side by side output format.



       --speed-large-files

         Use heuristics to speed handling of  large  files  that  have  numerous
         scattered small changes.



       --suppress-common-lines

         Do not print common lines in side by side format.



       -t

         Expand  tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
         in the input files.



       -T

         Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a line in normal or
         context  format.  This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look
         normal.



       --text

         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they  do
         not appear to be text.



       -u
&#12;         Use the unified output format.



       --unchanged-group-format=format

         Use  format  to output a group of common lines taken from both files in
         if-then-else format.  See node &apos;Line group formats&apos; in the CVS manual.



       --unchanged-line-format=format

         Use format to output a line common to both files in  if-then-else  for&#8208;
         mat.  See node &apos;Line formats&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -U lines




       --unified[=lines]

         Use the unified output format, showing lines (an integer) lines of con&#8208;
         text, or three if lines is not given.  For proper operation, patch typ&#8208;
         ically needs at least two lines of context.



       -w

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.



       -W columns




       --width=columns

         Use an output width of columns in side by side format.



       -y

         Use the side by side output format.


Line group formats
       Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many applications
       that allow if-then-else input, including programming languages  and  text
       formatting  languages.   A  line group format specifies the output format
       for a contiguous group of similar lines.

       For example, the following command compares the TeX file myfile with  the
       original  version from the repository, and outputs a merged file in which
       old regions are surrounded by \begin{em}-\end{em} lines, and new  regions
       are surrounded by \begin{bf}-\end{bf} lines.


         cvs diff \

            --old-group-format=&apos;\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         &apos; \

            --new-group-format=&apos;\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         &apos; \

            myfile




       The  following  command  is  equivalent to the above example, but it is a
       little more verbose, because it spells out the default  line  group  for&#8208;
       mats.


         cvs diff \

            --old-group-format=&apos;\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         &apos; \

            --new-group-format=&apos;\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         &apos; \

            --unchanged-group-format=&apos;%=&apos; \

            --changed-group-format=&apos;\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         \begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         &apos; \

            myfile




       Here  is a more advanced example, which outputs a diff listing with head&#8208;
       ers containing line numbers in a ``plain English&apos;&apos; style.


         cvs diff \

            --unchanged-group-format=&apos;&apos; \

            --old-group-format=&apos;-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted at %df:
         %&lt;&apos; \

            --new-group-format=&apos;-------- %dN line%(N=1?:s) added after %de:
         %&gt;&apos; \

            --changed-group-format=&apos;-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) changed at %df:
         %&lt;-------- to:
         %&gt;&apos; \

            myfile




       To specify a line group format, use one of the options listed below.  You
       can  specify  up  to  four  line group formats, one for each kind of line
       group.  You should quote format,  because  it  typically  contains  shell
       metacharacters.



       --old-group-format=format

         These  line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file.
         The default old group format is the same as the changed group format if
         it  is  specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line group
         as-is.



       --new-group-format=format

         These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second file.
         The  default new group format is same as the changed group format if it
         is specified; otherwise it is a format  that  outputs  the  line  group
         as-is.



       --changed-group-format=format

         These  line  groups  are  hunks  containing lines from both files.  The
         default changed group format is the concatenation of the  old  and  new
         group formats.
&#12;

       --unchanged-group-format=format

         These  line  groups  contain  lines  common to both files.  The default
         unchanged group format is a format that outputs the line group as-is.

         In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves;  con&#8208;
         version  specifications  start  with  %  and  have one of the following
         forms.



       %&lt;

         stands for the lines from the first file, including the  trailing  new&#8208;
         line.   Each  line  is  formatted according to the old line format (see
         node &apos;Line formats&apos; in the CVS manual).



       %&gt;

         stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing  new&#8208;
         line.  Each line is formatted according to the new line format.



       %=

         stands  for the lines common to both files, including the trailing new&#8208;
         line.  Each line is formatted according to the unchanged line format.



       %%

         stands for %.



       %c&apos;C&apos;

         where C is a single character, stands for C.  C may not be a  backslash
         or  an  apostrophe.  For example, %c&apos;:&apos; stands for a colon, even inside
         the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon  would  normally
         terminate.



       %c&apos;\O&apos;

         where  O is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the charac&#8208;
         ter with octal code O.  For example, %c&apos;\0&apos; stands for a  null  charac&#8208;
         ter.



       Fn

         where  F  is a printf conversion specification and n is one of the fol&#8208;
         lowing letters, stands for n&apos;s value formatted with F.


         e

           The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.


         f

           The line number of the first line in  the  group  in  the  old  file;
           equals e + 1.


         l

           The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.


         m
&#12;           The  line  number  of  the line just after the group in the old file;
           equals l + 1.


         n

           The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals l - f + 1.


         E, F, L, M, N

           Likewise, for lines in the new file.


           The printf conversion specification can be %d, %o, %x, or %X,  speci&#8208;
           fying decimal, octal, lower case hexadecimal, or upper case hexadeci&#8208;
           mal output respectively.  After  the  %  the  following  options  can
           appear  in  sequence:  a  - specifying left-justification; an integer
           specifying the minimum field width;  and  a  period  followed  by  an
           optional  integer specifying the minimum number of digits.  For exam&#8208;
           ple, %5dN prints the number of new lines in the group in a  field  of
           width 5 characters, using the printf format &quot;%5d&quot;.



       (A=B?T:E)

         If  A  equals  B then T else E.  A and B are each either a decimal con&#8208;
         stant or a single letter interpreted as above.   This  format  spec  is
         equivalent  to T if A&apos;s value equals B&apos;s; otherwise it is equivalent to
         E.

         For example, %(N=0?no:%dN) line%(N=1?:s) is equivalent to no lines if N
         (the number of lines in the group in the new file) is 0, to 1 line if N
         is 1, and to %dN lines otherwise.


Line formats
       Line formats control how each line taken from an input file is output  as
       part of a line group in if-then-else format.

       For  example, the following command outputs text with a one-column change
       indicator to the left of the text.  The first column of output is  -  for
       deleted  lines,  | for added lines, and a space for unchanged lines.  The
       formats contain newline characters where newlines are desired on output.


         cvs diff \

            --old-line-format=&apos;-%l
         &apos; \

            --new-line-format=&apos;|%l
         &apos; \

            --unchanged-line-format=&apos; %l
         &apos; \

            myfile




       To specify a line format, use one of the following options.   You  should
       quote format, since it often contains shell metacharacters.



       --old-line-format=format

         formats lines just from the first file.



       --new-line-format=format

         formats lines just from the second file.



       --unchanged-line-format=format
&#12;         formats lines common to both files.



       --line-format=format

         formats  all lines; in effect, it sets all three above options simulta&#8208;
         neously.

         In a line format, ordinary characters represent themselves;  conversion
         specifications start with % and have one of the following forms.



       %l

         stands  for the contents of the line, not counting its trailing newline
         (if any).  This format ignores whether the line is incomplete.



       %L

         stands for the contents of the line, including its trailing newline (if
         any).   If  a line is incomplete, this format preserves its incomplete&#8208;
         ness.



       %%

         stands for %.



       %c&apos;C&apos;

         where C is a single character, stands for C.  C may not be a  backslash
         or an apostrophe.  For example, %c&apos;:&apos; stands for a colon.



       %c&apos;\O&apos;

         where  O is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the charac&#8208;
         ter with octal code O.  For example, %c&apos;\0&apos; stands for a  null  charac&#8208;
         ter.



       Fn

         where  F is a printf conversion specification, stands for the line num&#8208;
         ber formatted with F.  For example, %.5dn prints the line number  using
         the  printf  format  &quot;%.5d&quot;.   See node &apos;Line group formats&apos; in the CVS
         manual, for more about printf conversion specifications.


         The default line format is %l followed by a newline character.

         If the input contains tab characters and it is important that they line
         up  on output, you should ensure that %l or %L in a line format is just
         after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding %l or %L with a tab character),  or
         you should use the -t or --expand-tabs option.

         Taken  together,  the  line and line group formats let you specify many
         different formats.  For example, the following command  uses  a  format
         similar  to  diff&apos;s  normal format.  You can tailor this command to get
         fine control over diff&apos;s output.


         cvs diff \

            --old-line-format=&apos;&lt; %l
         &apos; \

            --new-line-format=&apos;&gt; %l
         &apos; \

            --old-group-format=&apos;%df%(f=l?:,%dl)d%dE
         %&lt;&apos; \

            --new-group-format=&apos;%dea%dF%(F=L?:,%dL)
         %&gt;&apos; \

            --changed-group-format=&apos;%df%(f=l?:,%dl)c%dF%(F=L?:,%dL)
         %&lt;&#8212;
         %&gt;&apos; \

            --unchanged-group-format=&apos;&apos; \

            myfile





diff examples
       The following line produces a Unidiff (-u flag) between revision 1.14 and
       1.19  of  backend.c.  Due to the -kk flag no keywords are substituted, so
       differences that only depend on keyword substitution are ignored.


         $ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c




       Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a set of files  tagged
       RELEASE_1_0.   To see what has happened on that branch, the following can
       be used:


         $ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1




       A command like this can be used to produce a  context  diff  between  two
       releases:


         $ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &gt; diffs




       If  you  are  maintaining  ChangeLogs,  a command like the following just
       before you commit your changes may help you write  the  ChangeLog  entry.
       All local modifications that have not yet been committed will be printed.


         $ cvs diff -u | less





export
   Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout
       &#183; Synopsis: export [-flNnR] (-r rev[:date] | -D date) [-k subst] [-d dir]
         module...

       &#183; Requires: repository.

       &#183; Changes: current directory.

         This command is a variant of checkout; use it when you want a  copy  of
         the  source for module without the cvs administrative directories.  For
         example, you might use export to prepare source for shipment  off-site.
         This  command  requires that you specify a date or tag (with -D or -r),
         so that you can count on reproducing the source you ship to others (and
         thus it always prunes empty directories).

         One  often would like to use -kv with cvs export.  This causes any key&#8208;
         words to be expanded such that an import done at some other  site  will
         not  lose  the keyword revision information.  But be aware that doesn&apos;t
         handle an export containing binary files correctly.  Also be aware that
         after  having  used -kv, one can no longer use the ident command (which
         is part of the rcs suite&#8212;see ident(1)) which looks for keyword strings.
         If you want to be able to use ident you must not use -kv.


export options
       These standard options are supported by export (see node &apos;Common options&apos;
       in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -D date

         Use the most recent revision no later than date.



       -f

         If no matching revision is found, retrieve  the  most  recent  revision
         (instead of ignoring the file).



       -l

         Local; run only in current working directory.



       -n

         Do not run any checkout program.



       -R

         Export directories recursively.  This is on by default.



       -r tag[:date]

         Export the revision specified by tag or, when date is specified and tag
         is a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed on date.
         See node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.

         In addition, these options (that are common to checkout and export) are
         also supported:



       -d dir

         Create a directory called dir for the working files, instead  of  using
         the  module  name.   See node &apos;checkout options&apos; in the CVS manual, for
         complete details on how cvs handles this flag.



       -k subst

         Set keyword expansion mode (see node &apos;Substitution modes&apos;  in  the  CVS
         manual).



       -N

         Only  useful  together with -d dir.  See node &apos;checkout options&apos; in the
         CVS manual, for complete details on how cvs handles this flag.


history
   Show status of files and users
       &#183; Synopsis:     history [-report] [-flags] [-options args] [files...]

       &#183; Requires: the file $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

         cvs can keep a history log that tracks each use of most  cvs  commands.
         You can use history to display this information in various formats.

         To  enable  logging,  the  LogHistory config option must be set to some
         value other than the empty string and the history file specified by the
         HistoryLogPath option must be writable by all users who may run the cvs
         executable (see node &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual).

         To enable the history command, logging must be enabled as above and the
         HistorySearchPath  config  option (see node &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual)
         must be set to specify some number of the history logs created  thereby
         and these files must be readable by each user who might run the history
         command.

         Creating a repository via the cvs init command will enable  logging  of
         all possible events to a single history log file ($CVSROOT/CVSROOT/his&#8208;
         tory) with read and write permissions for all users (see node &apos;Creating
         a repository&apos; in the CVS manual).

         Note:  history  uses  -f, -l, -n, and -p in ways that conflict with the
         normal use inside cvs (see node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual).


history options
       Several options (shown above as -report)  control  what kind of report is
       generated:



       -c

         Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the repository was
         modified).



       -e

         Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to specifying  -x  with  all
         record  types.   Of course, -e will also include record types which are
         added in a future version of cvs; if you are writing a script which can
         only handle certain record types, you&apos;ll want to specify -x.



       -m module

         Report  on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use -m more than
         once on the command line.)



       -o

         Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.



       -T

         Report on all tags.



       -x type

         Extract a particular set of record types type  from  the  cvs  history.
         The  types  are  indicated  by single letters, which you may specify in
         combination.

         Certain commands have a single record type:


         F

           release

         O

           checkout

         E

           export

         T

           rtag

           One of five record types may result from an update:
&#12;         C

           A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring  manual
           merging).

         G

           A merge was necessary and it succeeded.

         U

           A working file was copied from the repository.

         P

           A working file was patched to match the repository.

         W

           The  working copy of a file was deleted during update (because it was
           gone from the repository).

           One of three record types results from commit:


         A

           A file was added for the first time.

         M

           A file was modified.

         R

           A file was removed.

           The options shown as -flags constrain or expand  the  report  without
           requiring option arguments:



       -a

         Show  data for all users (the default is to show data only for the user
         executing history).



       -l

         Show last modification only.



       -w

         Show only the records for modifications  done  from  the  same  working
         directory where history is executing.

         The  options  shown  as  -options args constrain the report based on an
         argument:



       -b str

         Show data back to a record containing  the  string str  in  either  the
         module name, the file name, or the repository path.



       -D date

         Show  data  since date.  This is slightly different from the normal use
         of -D date, which selects the newest revision older than date.



       -f file

         Show data for a particular file (you can specify several -f options  on
         the  same  command line).  This is equivalent to specifying the file on
         the command line.



       -n module

         Show data for a particular module (you can specify several  -n  options
         on the same command line).



       -p repository

         Show  data for a particular source repository  (you can specify several
         -p options on the same command line).



       -r rev

         Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag named rev
         appears  in  individual  rcs  files.  Each rcs file is searched for the
         revision or tag.



       -t tag

         Show records since tag tag was last added to the  history  file.   This
         differs  from the -r flag above in that it reads only the history file,
         not the rcs files, and is much faster.



       -u name

         Show records for user name.



       -z timezone

         Show times in the  selected  records  using  the  specified  time  zone
         instead of UTC.


import
   Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches
       &#183; Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...

       &#183; Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.

       &#183; Changes: repository.

         Use import to incorporate an entire source distribution from an outside
         source (e.g., a source vendor) into your source  repository  directory.
         You can use this command both for initial creation of a repository, and
         for wholesale updates to the module from the outside source.  See  node
         &apos;Tracking sources&apos; in the CVS manual, for a discussion on this subject.

         The  repository  argument gives a directory name (or a path to a direc&#8208;
         tory) under the cvs root directory for repositories; if  the  directory
         did not exist, import creates it.

         When  you  use  import  for updates to source that has been modified in
         your source repository (since a prior import), it will  notify  you  of
         any  files that conflict in the two branches of development; use check&#8208;
         out -j to reconcile the differences, as import instructs you to do.

         If cvs decides a file should be ignored (see node  &apos;cvsignore&apos;  in  the
         CVS  manual), it does not import it and prints I  followed by the file&#8208;
         name (see node &apos;import output&apos;  in  the  CVS  manual,  for  a  complete
         description of the output).

         If  the  file $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers exists, any file whose names
         match the specifications in that file will be treated as  packages  and
         the  appropriate  filtering  will  be  performed  on the file/directory
         before being imported.  See node &apos;Wrappers&apos; in the CVS manual.

         The outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by default  1.1.1.
         Updates  are  leaves  of this branch; for example, files from the first
         imported collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then files from
         the first imported update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so on.

         At  least  three arguments are required.  repository is needed to iden&#8208;
         tify the collection of source.  vendortag  is  a  tag  for  the  entire
         branch  (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at least one release&#8208;
         tag to uniquely identify the files at the leaves created each time  you
         execute  import.  The releasetag should be new, not previously existing
         in the repository file, and uniquely identify the imported release,

         Note that import does not change the directory in which you invoke  it.
         In  particular,  it  does  not  set  up that directory as a cvs working
         directory; if you want to work with the sources import them  first  and
         then  check  them out into a different directory (see node &apos;Getting the
         source&apos; in the CVS manual).


import options
       This standard option is supported by import (see node &apos;Common options&apos; in
       the CVS manual, for a complete description):



       -m message

         Use message as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         There are the following additional special options.



       -b branch

         See node &apos;Multiple vendor branches&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -k subst

         Indicate  the  keyword expansion mode desired.  This setting will apply
         to all files created during the import, but not to any files that  pre&#8208;
         viously  existed  in  the repository.  See node &apos;Substitution modes&apos; in
         the CVS manual, for a list of valid -k settings.



       -I name

         Specify file names that should be ignored during import.  You  can  use
         this option repeatedly.  To avoid ignoring any files at all (even those
         ignored by default), specify `-I !&apos;.

         name can be a file name pattern of the same type that you  can  specify
         in the .cvsignore file.  See node &apos;cvsignore&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -W spec

         Specify  file names that should be filtered during import.  You can use
         this option repeatedly.

         spec can be a file name pattern of the same type that you  can  specify
         in the .cvswrappers file. See node &apos;Wrappers&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -X

         Modify  the  algorithm used by cvs when importing new files so that new
         files do not immediately appear on the main trunk.

         Specifically, this flag causes cvs to mark new files as  if  they  were
         deleted  on the main trunk, by taking the following steps for each file
         in addition to those normally taken on import: creating a new  revision
         on  the  main trunk indicating that the new file is dead, resetting the
         new file&apos;s default branch, and placing the file in the Attic (see  node
         &apos;Attic&apos; in the CVS manual) directory.

         Use  of this option can be forced on a repository-wide basis by setting
         the ImportNewFilesToVendorBranchOnly option in CVSROOT/config (see node
         &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual).


import output
       import  keeps  you  informed  of its progress by printing a line for each
       file, preceded by one character indicating the status of the file:



       U file

         The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally mod&#8208;
         ified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).



       N file

         The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.



       C file

         The  file  already  exists in the repository but has been locally modi&#8208;
         fied; you will have to merge the changes.



       I file

         The file is being ignored (see node &apos;cvsignore&apos; in the CVS manual).



       L file

         The file is a symbolic link; cvs import ignores symbolic links.  People
         periodically suggest that this behavior should be changed, but if there
         is a consensus on what it should be changed to,  it  is  not  apparent.
         (Various  options  in the modules file can be used to recreate symbolic
         links on checkout, update, etc.; see node &apos;modules&apos; in the CVS manual.)


import examples
       See node &apos;Tracking sources&apos; in the CVS manual, and node &apos;From  files&apos;  in
       the CVS manual.


log
   Print out log information for files
       &#183; Synopsis: log [options] [files...]

       &#183; Requires: repository, working directory.

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

         Display  log  information  for files.  log used to call the rcs utility
         rlog.  Although this is no longer true in  the  current  sources,  this
         history  determines the format of the output and the options, which are
         not quite in the style of the other cvs commands.

         The output includes the location of the rcs  file,  the  head  revision
         (the  latest revision on the trunk), all symbolic names (tags) and some
         other things.  For each revision, the revision number,  the  date,  the
         author,  the  number  of  lines added/deleted, the commitid and the log
         message are printed.  All dates are displayed  in  local  time  at  the
         client.  This  is  typically specified in the $TZ environment variable,
         which can be set to govern how log displays dates.

         Note: log uses -R in a way that conflicts with the  normal  use  inside
         cvs (see node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual).


log options
       By  default,  log  prints  all  information that is available.  All other
       options restrict the output.  Note that the  revision  selection  options
       (-d, -r, -s, and -w) have no effect, other than possibly causing a search
       for files in Attic directories, when used in conjunction with the options
       that  restrict  the output to only log header fields (-b, -h, -R, and -t)
       unless the -S option is also specified.



       -b

         Print information about the revisions on the default  branch,  normally
         the highest branch on the trunk.



       -d dates
&#12;         Print information about revisions with a checkin date/time in the range
         given by the semicolon-separated  list  of  dates.   The  date  formats
         accepted are those accepted by the -D option to many other cvs commands
         (see node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual).  Dates can  be  combined
         into ranges as follows:


         d1&lt;d2



         d2&gt;d1

           Select the revisions that were deposited between d1 and d2.


         &lt;d



         d&gt;

           Select all revisions dated d or earlier.


         d&lt;



         &gt;d

           Select all revisions dated d or later.


         d

           Select the single, latest revision dated d or earlier.

           The  &gt;  or &lt; characters may be followed by = to indicate an inclusive
           range rather than an exclusive one.

           Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).



       -h

         Print only the name of the rcs file, name of the file  in  the  working
         directory,  head,  default  branch, access list, locks, symbolic names,
         and suffix.



       -l

         Local; run only in current  working  directory.   (Default  is  to  run
         recursively).



       -N

         Do  not  print the list of tags for this file.  This option can be very
         useful when your site uses a lot of tags,  so  rather  than  &quot;more&quot;&apos;ing
         over 3 pages of tag information, the log information is presented with&#8208;
         out tags at all.



       -R

         Print only the name of the rcs file.



       -rrevisions

         Print information about revisions given  in  the  comma-separated  list
         revisions  of  revisions  and ranges.  The following table explains the
         available range formats:


         rev1:rev2

           Revisions rev1 to rev2 (which must be on the same branch).
&#12;         rev1::rev2

           The same, but excluding rev1.


         :rev



         ::rev

           Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and including rev.


         rev:

           Revisions starting with rev to the end of the branch containing rev.


         rev::

           Revisions starting just after rev to the end of the branch containing
           rev.


         branch

           An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that branch.


         branch1:branch2



         branch1::branch2

           A  range  of  branches  means  all  revisions on the branches in that
           range.


         branch.

           The latest revision in branch.

           A bare -r with no revisions means the latest revision on the  default
           branch,  normally  the  trunk.   There can be no space between the -r
           option and its argument.



       -S

         Suppress the header if no revisions are selected.



       -s states

         Print information about revisions whose state attributes match  one  of
         the states given in the comma-separated list states.  Individual states
         may be any text string, though cvs commonly only uses two  states,  Exp
         and dead.  See node &apos;admin options&apos; in the CVS manual for more informa&#8208;
         tion.



       -t

         Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.



       -wlogins

         Print information about revisions checked in by users with login  names
         appearing  in  the  comma-separated list logins.  If logins is omitted,
         the user&apos;s login is assumed.  There can be  no  space  between  the  -w
         option and its argument.

         log  prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the options
         -d, -s, and -w, intersected with the union of the revisions selected by
         -b and -r.


log examples
       Since  log shows dates in local time, you might want to see them in Coor&#8208;
       dinated Universal Time (UTC) or some other timezone.  To do this you  can
       set your $TZ environment variable before invoking cvs:


         $ TZ=UTC cvs log foo.c
         $ TZ=EST cvs log bar.c




       (If  you are using a csh-style shell, like tcsh, you would need to prefix
       the examples above with env.)


ls &amp; rls
       &#183; ls [-e | -l] [-RP] [-r tag[:date]] [-D date] [path...]

       &#183; Requires: repository for rls, repository &amp; working directory for ls.

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

       &#183; Synonym: dir &amp; list are synonyms for ls and rdir &amp; rlist  are  synonyms
         for rls.

         The  ls  and rls commands are used to list files and directories in the
         repository.

         By default ls lists the files and directories that belong in your work&#8208;
         ing directory, what would be there after an update.

         By  default rls lists the files and directories on the tip of the trunk
         in the topmost directory of the repository.

         Both commands accept an optional list of file and directory names, rel&#8208;
         ative  to the working directory for ls and the topmost directory of the
         repository for rls.  Neither is recursive by default.


ls &amp; rls options
       These standard options are supported by ls &amp; rls:



       -d

         Show dead revisions (with tag when specified).



       -e

         Display in CVS/Entries format.  This format is meant to  remain  easily
         parsable by automation.



       -l

         Display all details.



       -P

         Don&apos;t list contents of empty directories when recursing.



       -R

         List recursively.



       -r tag[:date]

         Show  files  specified  by  tag or, when date is specified and tag is a
         branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed on date.  See
         node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -D date

         Show files from date.


rls examples
         $ cvs rls
         cvs rls: Listing module: `.&apos;
         CVSROOT
         first-dir

rdiff
   &apos;patch&apos; format diffs between releases
       &#183; rdiff  [-flags] [-V vn] (-r tag1[:date1] | -D date1) [-r tag2[:date2] |
         -D date2] modules...

       &#183; Requires: repository.

       &#183; Changes: nothing.

       &#183; Synonym: patch

         Builds a Larry Wall format patch(1) file between two releases, that can
         be  fed  directly  into  the  patch  program  to  bring  an old release
         up-to-date with the new release.  (This is one of the few cvs  commands
         that operates directly from the repository, and doesn&apos;t require a prior
         checkout.) The diff output is sent to the standard output device.

         You can specify (using the standard -r and -D options) any  combination
         of  one  or  two  revisions  or dates.  If only one revision or date is
         specified, the patch file reflects differences between that revision or
         date and the current head revisions in the rcs file.

         Note  that  if  the software release affected is contained in more than
         one directory, then it may be necessary to specify the -p option to the
         patch  command  when patching the old sources, so that patch is able to
         find the files that are located in other directories.


rdiff options
       These standard options are supported by rdiff (see node &apos;Common  options&apos;
       in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -D date

         Use the most recent revision no later than date.



       -f

         If  no  matching  revision  is found, retrieve the most recent revision
         (instead of ignoring the file).



       -k kflag

         Process keywords according to kflag.  See node  &apos;Keyword  substitution&apos;
         in the CVS manual.



       -l

         Local; don&apos;t descend subdirectories.



       -R

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.



       -r tag

         Use the revision specified by tag, or when date is specified and tag is
         a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it  existed  on  date.
         See node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.

         In addition to the above, these options are available:



       -c

         Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.



       -p

         Show which C function each change is in.



       -s

         Create  a  summary  change  report  instead  of  a  patch.  The summary
         includes information about files that were changed or added between the
         releases.   It  is  sent to the standard output device.  This is useful
         for finding out, for example, which  files  have  changed  between  two
         dates or revisions.



       -t

         A  diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output device.
         This is most useful for seeing what the last change to a file was.



       -u

         Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  Remember that  old  ver&#8208;
         sions  of  the patch program can&apos;t handle the unidiff format, so if you
         plan to post this patch to the net you should probably not use -u.



       -V vn

         Expand keywords according to the rules current in rcs version  vn  (the
         expansion format changed with rcs version 5).  Note that this option is
         no longer accepted.  cvs will always expand keywords the way  that  rcs
         version 5 does.


rdiff examples
       Suppose  you  receive mail from foo@example.net asking for an update from
       release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You have no such patches on hand,
       but with cvs that can easily be fixed with a command such as this:


         $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
         $$ Mail -s &apos;The patches you asked for&apos; foo@example.net




       Suppose  you  have  made release 1.3, and forked a branch called R_1_3fix
       for bug fixes.  R_1_3_1 corresponds to release 1.3.1, which was made some
       time ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has been done on the
       branch.  This command can be used:


         $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
         cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
         File ChangeLog,v changed from revision 1.52.2.5 to 1.52.2.6
         File foo.c,v changed from revision 1.52.2.3 to 1.52.2.4
         File bar.h,v changed from revision 1.29.2.1 to 1.2





release
   Indicate that a Module is no longer in use
       &#183; release [-d] directories...

       &#183; Requires: Working directory.

       &#183; Changes: Working directory, history log.

         This command is meant to safely cancel  the  effect  of  cvs  checkout.
         Since  cvs  doesn&apos;t lock files, it isn&apos;t strictly necessary to use this
         command.  You can always simply delete your working directory,  if  you
         like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave
         no trace in the cvs history file (see node &apos;history file&apos;  in  the  CVS
         manual) that you&apos;ve abandoned your checkout.

         Use  cvs  release to avoid these problems.  This command checks that no
         uncommitted changes are present; that you are executing it from immedi&#8208;
         ately  above  a cvs working directory; and that the repository recorded
         for your files is the same as the  repository  defined  in  the  module
         database.

         If  all  these  conditions are true, cvs release leaves a record of its
         execution (attesting to your intentionally abandoning your checkout) in
         the cvs history log.


release options
       The release command supports one command option:



       -d

         Delete  your working copy of the file if the release succeeds.  If this
         flag is not given your files will remain in your working directory.

         WARNING:  The release command deletes all directories and files  recur&#8208;
         sively.   This has the very serious side-effect that any directory that
         you have created inside your checked-out sources, and not added to  the
         repository  (using  the add command; see node &apos;Adding files&apos; in the CVS
         manual) will be silently deleted&#8212;even if it is non-empty!


release output
       Before release releases your sources it will print a one-line message for
       any file that is not up-to-date.



       U file




       P file

         There  exists  a newer revision of this file in the repository, and you
         have not modified your local copy of the file (U and P  mean  the  same
         thing).



       A file

         The  file  has  been added to your private copy of the sources, but has
         not yet been committed to the repository.  If you delete your  copy  of
         the sources this file will be lost.



       R file

         The  file  has  been removed from your private copy of the sources, but
         has not yet been removed from the repository, since you  have  not  yet
         committed the removal.  See node &apos;commit&apos; in the CVS manual.



       M file

         The  file is modified in your working directory.  There might also be a
         newer revision inside the repository.



       ? file

         file is in your working directory, but does not correspond to  anything
         in  the  source  repository, and is not in the list of files for cvs to
         ignore (see the description of the -I option, and see node  &apos;cvsignore&apos;
         in the CVS manual).  If you remove your working sources, this file will
         be lost.


release examples
       Release the tc directory, and delete  your  local  working  copy  of  the
       files.


         $ cd ..         # You must stand immediately above the

                         # sources when you issue cvs release.
         $ cvs release -d tc
         You have [0] altered files in this repository.
         Are you sure you want to release (and delete) directory `tc&apos;: y
         $

   Act as a server for a client on stdin/stdout
       &#183; pserver [-c path]

         server [-c path]

       &#183; Requires: repository, client conversation on stdin/stdout

       &#183; Changes: Repository or, indirectly, client working directory.

         The  cvs  server  and  pserver  commands are used to provide repository
         access to remote clients and expect a client conversation  on  stdin  &amp;
         stdout.   Typically  these  commands are launched from inetd or via ssh
         (see node &apos;Remote repositories&apos; in the CVS manual).

         server expects that the client has already been authenticated  somehow,
         typically  via  ssh,  and  pserver  attempts to authenticate the client
         itself.

         Only one option is available with the server and pserver commands:



       -c path

         Load configuration from path rather than  the  default  location  $CVS&#8208;
         ROOT/CVSROOT/config  (see  node &apos;config&apos; in the CVS manual).  path must
         be /etc/cvs.conf or prefixed by /etc/cvs/.  This  option  is  supported
         beginning with cvs release 1.12.13.


suck
   Download RCS ,v file raw
       &#183; suck module/path

       &#183; Requires: repository

         Locates the file module/path,v or module/pa/Attic/th,v and downloads it
         raw as RCS comma-v file.

         Output consists of the real pathname of the comma-v file,  relative  to
         the  CVS  repository, followed by a newline and the binary file content
         immediately thereafter.


update
   Bring work tree in sync with repository
       &#183; update  [-ACdflPpR]  [-I  name]  [-j  rev  [-j  rev]]  [-k  kflag]  [-r
         tag[:date] | -D date] [-W spec] files...

       &#183; Requires: repository, working directory.

       &#183; Changes: working directory.

         After  you&apos;ve  run  checkout to create your private copy of source from
         the common repository, other developers will continue changing the cen&#8208;
         tral source.  From time to time, when it is convenient in your develop&#8208;
         ment process, you can use the update command from within  your  working
         directory  to  reconcile  your  work  with any revisions applied to the
         source repository since your last checkout or update.  Without  the  -C
         option,  update  will also merge any differences between the local copy
         of files and their base revisions into any destination revisions speci&#8208;
         fied with -r, -D, or -A.


update options
       These  standard  options  are  available  with  update  (see node &apos;Common
       options&apos; in the CVS manual, for a complete description of them):



       -D date

         Use the most recent revision  no  later  than  date.   This  option  is
         sticky,  and implies -P.  See node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in the CVS manual, for
         more information on sticky tags/dates.



       -f

         Only useful with the -D or -r flags.  If no matching revision is found,
         retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).



       -k kflag

         Process  keywords  according to kflag.  See node &apos;Keyword substitution&apos;
         in the CVS manual.  This option is sticky; future updates of this  file
         in  this working directory will use the same kflag.  The status command
         can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See node  &apos;Invoking  CVS&apos;  in
         the CVS manual, for more information on the status command.



       -l

         Local;  run  only  in  current  working directory.  See node &apos;Recursive
         behavior&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -P

         Prune empty directories.  See node &apos;Moving directories&apos; in the CVS man&#8208;
         ual.



       -p

         Pipe files to the standard output.



       -R

         Update  directories  recursively (default).  See node &apos;Recursive behav&#8208;
         ior&apos; in the CVS manual.



       -r tag[:date]

         Retrieve the revisions specified by tag or, when date is specified  and
         tag  is  a branch tag, the version from the branch tag as it existed on
         date.  This option is sticky, and implies -P.  See node  &apos;Sticky  tags&apos;
         in  the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates. Also see
         node &apos;Common options&apos; in the CVS manual.

         These special options are also available with update.



       -A

         Reset any sticky tags, dates, or -k options.  See node &apos;Sticky tags&apos; in
         the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.



       -C

         Overwrite  locally modified files with clean copies from the repository
         (the modified file is saved in .#file.revision, however).



       -d

         Create any directories that exist in the repository if they&apos;re  missing
         from  the working directory.  Normally, update acts only on directories
         and files that were already enrolled in your working directory.

         This is useful for updating directories that were created in the repos&#8208;
         itory  since  the  initial  checkout;  but  it  has an unfortunate side
         effect.  If you deliberately avoided certain directories in the reposi&#8208;
         tory  when  you created your working directory (either through use of a
         module name or by listing explicitly  the  files  and  directories  you
         wanted  on  the  command line), then updating with -d will create those
         directories, which may not be what you want.



       -I name

         Ignore files whose names match name (in your working directory)  during
         the  update.   You can specify -I more than once on the command line to
         specify several files to ignore.  Use -I ! to avoid ignoring any  files
         at all.  See node &apos;cvsignore&apos; in the CVS manual, for other ways to make
         cvs ignore some files.



       -Wspec

         Specify file names that should be filtered during update.  You can  use
         this option repeatedly.

         spec  can  be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify
         in the .cvswrappers file. See node &apos;Wrappers&apos; in the CVS manual.
&#12;
       -jrevision

         With two -j options, merge changes from the revision specified with the
         first  -j  option  to  the revision specified with the second j option,
         into the working directory.

         With one -j option, merge changes from the  ancestor  revision  to  the
         revision specified with the -j option, into the working directory.  The
         ancestor revision is the common ancestor  of  the  revision  which  the
         working  directory  is  based  on, and the revision specified in the -j
         option.

         Note that using a single -j tagname option rather than -j branchname to
         merge  changes  from  a  branch  will often not remove files which were
         removed on the branch.  See node &apos;Merging adds and removals&apos; in the CVS
         manual, for more.

         In  addition, each -j option can contain an optional date specification
         which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen  revision  to  one
         within  a  specific  date.   An  optional date is specified by adding a
         colon (:) to the tag: -jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier.

         See node &apos;Branching and merging&apos; in the CVS manual.



update output
       update and checkout keep you informed of their  progress  by  printing  a
       line  for  each  file, preceded by one character indicating the status of
       the file:



       U file

         The file was brought up to date with respect to the  repository.   This
         is  done  for  any  file  that exists in the repository but not in your
         working directory, and for files that you haven&apos;t changed but  are  not
         the most recent versions available in the repository.



       P file

         Like  U,  but  the  cvs server sends a patch instead of an entire file.
         This accomplishes the same thing as U using less bandwidth.



       A file

         The file has been added to your private copy of the sources,  and  will
         be  added  to  the  source  repository when you run commit on the file.
         This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.



       R file

         The file has been removed from your private copy of  the  sources,  and
         will  be  removed from the source repository when you run commit on the
         file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.



       M file

         The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

         M can indicate one of two states for a file you&apos;re working  on:  either
         there were no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that
         your file remains as you last saw it; or there  were  modifications  in
         the  repository  as well as in your copy, but they were merged success&#8208;
         fully, without conflict, in your working directory.

         cvs will print some messages if it merges your work, and a backup  copy
         of your working file (as it looked before you ran update) will be made.
         The exact name of that file is printed while update runs.



       C file

         A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to file with
         changes  from  the  source  repository.  file (the copy in your working
         directory) is now the result of attempting to merge the two  revisions;
         an unmodified copy of your file is also in your working directory, with
         the name .#file.revision where revision is the revision that your modi&#8208;
         fied  file  started  from.   Resolve  the conflict as described in node
         &apos;Conflicts example&apos; in the CVS manual.  (Note that some  systems  auto&#8208;
         matically purge files that begin with .# if they have not been accessed
         for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy of your original file, it
         is  a  very  good  idea to rename it.)  Under vms, the file name starts
         with __ rather than .#.



       ? file

         file is in your working directory, but does not correspond to  anything
         in  the  source  repository, and is not in the list of files for cvs to
         ignore (see the description of the -I option, and see node  &apos;cvsignore&apos;
         in the CVS manual).
