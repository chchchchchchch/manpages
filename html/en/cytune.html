CYTUNE(8)                     System Administration                    CYTUNE(8)



NAME
       cytune - tune driver parameters for Cyclades-Z multiport serial card

SYNOPSIS
       cytune  [-q  [-i  interval]]  [{-s|-S}  value]  [-g|-G] [{-t|-T} timeout]
       tty...

DESCRIPTION
       cytune queries and modifies the interruption threshold for  the  Cyclades
       driver.  Each serial line on a Cyclades card has a 12-byte FIFO for input
       (and another 12-byte FIFO for output).   The  &quot;threshold&quot;  specifies  how
       many  input characters must be present in the FIFO before an interruption
       is raised.  When a Cyclades tty is opened, this threshold  is  set  to  a
       default value based on baud rate:

                  Baud        Threshold

              50-4800            10
              9600                8
              19200               4
              38400               2
              57600-150000        1

       If  the  threshold  is set too low, the large number of interruptions can
       load the machine and decrease overall system throughput.  If the  thresh&#8208;
       old is set too high, the FIFO buffer can overflow, and characters will be
       lost.  Slower machines, however, may not be able to deal with the  inter&#8208;
       rupt load, and will require that the threshold be adjusted upwards.

       If  the  cyclades driver was compiled with ENABLE_MONITORING defined, the
       cytune command can be used with the -q option to report  interrupts  over
       the  monitoring  interval  and characters transferred over the monitoring
       interval.  It will also report the state of the FIFO.  The maximum number
       of  characters  in the FIFO when an interrupt occurred, the instantaneous
       count of characters in the FIFO, and how many characters are now  in  the
       FIFO are reported.  This output might look like this:

              /dev/cubC0:  830  ints, 9130 chars; fifo: 11 threshold, 11 max, 11
              now
                 166.259866 interrupts/second, 1828.858521 characters/second

       This output indicates that for this  monitoring  period,  the  interrupts
       were  always  being  handled within one character time, because max never
       rose above threshold.  This is good, and you can probably run  this  way,
       provided that a large number of samples come out this way.  You will lose
       characters if you overrun the FIFO, as the  Cyclades  hardware  does  not
       seem to support the RTS RS-232 signal line for hardware flow control from
       the DCE to the DTE.

       In query mode cytune will produce a summary report when ended with a SIG&#8208;
       INT or when the threshold or timeout is changed.

       There  may  be  a  responsiveness  vs. throughput tradeoff.  The Cyclades
       card, at the higher speeds, is capable of putting a very  high  interrupt
       load  on  the  system.  This will reduce the amount of CPU time available
       for other tasks on your system.  However, the time it takes to respond to
       a  single character may be increased if you increase the threshold.  This
       might be noticed by monitoring ping(8) times on a SLIP link controlled by
       a  Cyclades  card.   If  your SLIP link is generally used for interactive
       work such as telnet(1), you may want to leave the threshold low, so  that
       characters are responded to as quickly as possible.  If your SLIP link is
       generally used for file transfer, WWW, and the like, setting the FIFO  to
       a  high  value is likely to reduce the load on your system while not sig&#8208;
       nificantly affecting throughput.  Alternatively, see the -t or -T options
       to  adjust  the  time that the cyclades waits before flushing its buffer.
       Units are 5ms.

       If you are running a mouse on a Cyclades port,  it  is  likely  that  you
       would want to maintain the threshold and timeout at a low value.

OPTIONS
       -s value
              Set  the  current threshold to value characters.  Note that if the
              tty is not being held open by another process, the threshold  will
              be  reset  on the next open.  Only values between 1 and 12, inclu&#8208;
              sive, are permitted.

       -t value
              Set the current flush timeout to value units.  Note  that  if  the
              tty  is not being held open by another process, the threshold will
              be reset on the next open.  Only values between 0 and 255,  inclu&#8208;
              sive,  are  permitted.   Setting value to zero forces the default,
              currently 0x20 (160ms), but soon to be 0x02 (10ms).  Units  are  5
              ms.

       -g     Get the current threshold and timeout.

       -S value
              Set  the  default  threshold to value characters.  When the tty is
              next opened, this value will be used instead of the default.  Only
              values between 1 and 12, inclusive, are permitted.

       -T value
              Set  the  default  flush  timeout to value units.  When the tty is
              next opened, this value will be used instead of the  default.   If
              value  is  zero,  then the the value will default to 0x20 (160ms),
              soon to be 0x02 (10ms).

       -G     Get the default threshold and flush timeout values.

       -q     Gather statistics about the tty.  The results are  only  valid  if
              the  Cyclades  driver  has  been  compiled  with ENABLE_MONITORING
              defined.  This is probably not the default.

       -i interval
              Statistics will be gathered every interval seconds.

BUGS
       If you run two copies of cytune at the same  time  to  report  statistics
       about  the  same port, the &apos;ints&apos;, &apos;chars&apos;, and &apos;max&apos; value will be reset
       and not reported correctly.  cytune should prevent this, but does not.
