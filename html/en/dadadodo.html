NAME
       dadadodo - exterminate all rational thought

SYNOPSIS
       dadadodo [ options ] [ input-files ]

DESCRIPTION
       dadadodo is a program that analyses texts for Markov chains of word prob&#8208;
       abilities and then generates random sentences based on  those  probabili&#8208;
       ties.   Sometimes  these  sentences  are nonsense, but sometimes they cut
       right through to the heart of the matter and reveal hidden meanings.

OPTIONS
       dadadodo accepts the following options:

       -c, -count n
              Generate n sentences.

       -h, -help
              Show summary of options and exit.

       -html  Output HTML instead of plain text.

       -l, -load file
              Load compiled data from file (&#8216;-&#8217; for standard input).

       -o, -output file
              Save compiled data in file (&#8216;-&#8217; for standard output).

       -p, -pause s
              Delay s seconds between paragraphs.

       -w, -columns columns
              Format output for a device columns character cells in  width.   If
              not  specified,  the  value of the environment variable COLUMNS is
              used to determine the width.  If that variable is not  defined,  a
              width of 72 is assumed.

NOTES
       Non-option  arguments  are  input files.  These should be text files, but
       may be mail folders or HTML.  MIME messages are handled  sensibly.   When
       no  output  file is specified, sentences will be generated from the input
       data directly.  However, loading a saved file is far faster than re-pars&#8208;
       ing the text files each time.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS
              Determines the width (in character cells) of the output if the -w,
              -columns option is not used.   If  not  set,  a  width  of  72  is
              assumed.
