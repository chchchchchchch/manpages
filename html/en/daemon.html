DAEMON(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  DAEMON(3)



NAME
       daemon - run in the background

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int daemon(int nochdir, int noclose);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       daemon(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)

DESCRIPTION
       The  daemon()  function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from
       the controlling terminal and run in the background as system daemons.

       If nochdir is zero, daemon() changes the calling process&apos;s current  work&#8208;
       ing directory to the root directory (&quot;/&quot;); otherwise, the current working
       directory is left unchanged.

       If noclose is zero, daemon() redirects standard  input,  standard  output
       and  standard error to /dev/null; otherwise, no changes are made to these
       file descriptors.

RETURN VALUE
       (This function forks, and if  the  fork(2)  succeeds,  the  parent  calls
       _exit(2), so that further errors are seen by the child only.)  On success
       daemon() returns zero.  If an error occurs, daemon() returns -1 and  sets
       errno to any of the errors specified for the fork(2) and setsid(2).

CONFORMING TO
       Not  in  POSIX.1-2001.  A similar function appears on the BSDs.  The dae&#8208;
       mon() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

NOTES
       The glibc implementation can also return -1 when /dev/null exists but  is
       not  a  character  device  with the expected major and minor numbers.  In
       this case errno need not be set.

SEE ALSO
       fork(2), setsid(2)
