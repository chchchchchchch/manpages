           --disable-opencl
           -t num_threads

DESCRIPTION
       darktable is a digital photography workflow application for Linux and Mac
       OS X in the lines of Adobe Lightroom and Apple Aperture.

       The application is designed to ease editing and consistent processing of
       large photo sessions and provides a easy to use digital light-table and a
       set of sophisticated postprocessing tools.

       Most processing is done in 32-bit floating point per channel mode in
       device independent CIE L*a*b* color space. darktable is also fully color
       managed, which gives you full control over the look of the photos.

       The application relies on a modern plug-in architecture thus making it
       easy for 3rd party developers to extend the existing capabilities of the
       application.  All light-table and darkroom features are implemented as
       plug-ins, so you can create your plug-ins reusing existing code.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       IMG_1234.CR2 or /path/to/load/
           Loads the given image in darkroom mode, or imports the given folder.

       -d control
           Enable job queue debugging. If you redirect darktables output to
           control.log and call ./tools/create_control_svg.sh control.log, you
           will get a nice control.svg with a visualization of the threads&apos;
           work.

       -d cache
           This will give you a lot of debugging info about the mipmap cache for
           light table mode. If compiled in debug mode, this will also tell you
           where in the code a certain buffer has last been locked.

       -d perf
           Use this for performance tweaking your darkroom modules. It will
           rdtsc-measure the runtimes of all plugins and print them to stdout.

       -d all
           Enable all debugging output.

       --library override.db
           Uses override.db instead of the gconf/darktablerc specified library
           file. Should be an absolute path.

       --disable-opencl
           For opencl builds only. Disables GPU computing at runtime. Useful to
           check for bugs in our opencl code and to avoid buggy drivers on
           certain machines.

       -t num_threads
           For openmp builds only. Overrides the default number of threads (=
           number of cores).

&#12;RELATED
       darktable-faster first copies the library to ram and then starts dt. On
       close, it is copied back, so even in case of crashes no data loss is
       anticipated.

HISTORY
       The project was started by Johannes Hanika in early 2009 to fill the gap
       (or, rather, a black hole) of a digital photography workflow tool on
       Linux.
