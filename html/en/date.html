&#12;       %:::z  numeric  time  zone  with  :  to  necessary  precision (e.g., -04,
              +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional
       flags may follow `%&apos;:

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After  any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then
       an optional modifier, which is either E to  use  the  locale&apos;s  alternate
       representations  if available, or O to use the locale&apos;s alternate numeric
       symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date=&apos;@2147483647&apos;

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ=&apos;America/Los_Angeles&apos; date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date=&apos;TZ=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; 09:00 next Fri&apos;

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such
       as  &quot;Sun,  29  Feb  2004 16:21:42 -0800&quot; or &quot;2004-02-29 16:21:42&quot; or even
       &quot;next Thursday&quot;.  A date string may  contain  items  indicating  calendar
       date,  time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of  the  day.   The
       date  string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is
       fully described in the info documentation.
