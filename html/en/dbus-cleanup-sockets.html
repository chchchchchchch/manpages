NAME
       dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in a directory

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]


DESCRIPTION
       The  dbus-cleanup-sockets command cleans up unused D-Bus connection sock&#8208;
       ets. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for  more  information
       about the big picture.


       If  given  no  arguments,  dbus-cleanup-sockets  cleans up sockets in the
       standard default socket directory for the per-user-login-session  message
       bus;  this  is usually /tmp.  Optionally, you can pass a different direc&#8208;
       tory on the command line.


       On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults  to
       using  &quot;abstract sockets&quot; that exist only in memory and don&apos;t have a cor&#8208;
       responding file in /tmp.


       On most other flavors of UNIX, it&apos;s possible for the socket files to leak
       when  programs using D-Bus exit abnormally or without closing their D-Bus
       connections. Thus, it might be interesting to run dbus-cleanup-sockets in
       a  cron  job  to  mop  up any leaked sockets.  Or you can just ignore the
       leaked sockets, they aren&apos;t really hurting anything, other than  clutter&#8208;
       ing the output of &quot;ls /tmp&quot;


AUTHOR
       dbus-cleanup-sockets    was    adapted    by    Havoc   Pennington   from
       linc-cleanup-sockets written by Michael Meeks.
