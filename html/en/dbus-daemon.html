NAME
       dbus-daemon - Message bus daemon

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-daemon   dbus-daemon   [--version]  [--session]  [--system]  [--con&#8208;
       fig-file=FILE] [--print-address[=DESCRIPTOR]]  [--print-pid[=DESCRIPTOR]]
       [--fork]


DESCRIPTION
       dbus-daemon  is  the  D-Bus  message bus daemon. See http://www.freedesk&#8208;
       top.org/software/dbus/ for more information about the big picture.  D-Bus
       is first a library that provides one-to-one communication between any two
       applications; dbus-daemon is an application that  uses  this  library  to
       implement  a message bus daemon. Multiple programs connect to the message
       bus daemon and can exchange messages with one another.

       There are two standard message bus instances: the systemwide message  bus
       (installed  on  many  systems  as  the &quot;messagebus&quot; init service) and the
       per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a  user  logs  in).
       dbus-daemon  is  used  for  both of these instances, but with a different
       configuration file.

       The --session option  is  equivalent  to  &quot;--config-file=/etc/dbus-1/ses&#8208;
       sion.conf&quot;   and   the   --system   option   is   equivalent  to  &quot;--con&#8208;
       fig-file=/etc/dbus-1/system.conf&quot;. By creating  additional  configuration
       files and using the --config-file option, additional special-purpose mes&#8208;
       sage bus daemons could be created.

       The systemwide daemon is normally launched by an init script,  standardly
       called simply &quot;messagebus&quot;.

       The  systemwide  daemon  is  largely used for broadcasting system events,
       such as changes to the printer queue, or adding/removing devices.

       The per-session daemon is used  for  various  interprocess  communication
       among  desktop  applications  (however, it is not tied to X or the GUI in
       any way).

       SIGHUP will cause the D-Bus daemon to PARTIALLY reload its  configuration
       file  and  to flush its user/group information caches. Some configuration
       changes would require kicking all apps off the bus;  so  they  will  only
       take  effect if you restart the daemon. Policy changes should take effect
       with SIGHUP.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --config-file=FILE
              Use the given configuration file.

       --fork Force the message bus to fork and become a  daemon,  even  if  the
              configuration  file does not specify that it should.  In most con&#8208;
              texts the configuration file  already  gets  this  right,  though.
              --nofork  Force  the  message bus not to fork and become a daemon,
              even if the configuration file specifies that it should.

       --print-address[=DESCRIPTOR]
              Print the address of the message bus to standard output, or to the
              given  file  descriptor.  This is used by programs that launch the
              message bus.

       --print-pid[=DESCRIPTOR]
              Print the process ID of the message bus to standard output, or  to
              the  given  file  descriptor. This is used by programs that launch
              the message bus.

       --session
              Use the standard configuration file for the per-login-session mes&#8208;
              sage bus.

       --system
              Use  the  standard  configuration  file for the systemwide message
              bus.

       --version
              Print the version of the daemon.

       --introspect
              Print the introspection information for all D-Bus internal  inter&#8208;
              faces.

       --address[=ADDRESS]
              Set  the  address  to listen on. This option overrides the address
              configured in the configuration file.

       --systemd-activation
              Enable systemd-style service activation. Only useful  in  conjunc&#8208;
              tion with the systemd system and session manager on Linux.

       --nopidfile
              Don&apos;t write a PID file even if one is configured in the configura&#8208;
              tion files.


CONFIGURATION FILE
       A message bus daemon has a configuration file that specializes it  for  a
       particular  application. For example, one configuration file might set up
       the message bus to be a systemwide message bus, while another  might  set
       it up to be a per-user-login-session bus.

       The configuration file also establishes resource limits, security parame&#8208;
       ters, and so forth.

       The configuration file is not part of any interoperability  specification
       and  its backward compatibility is not guaranteed; this document is docu&#8208;
       mentation, not specification.

       The standard systemwide and per-session message bus setups are configured
       in  the  files  &quot;/etc/dbus-1/system.conf&quot; and &quot;/etc/dbus-1/session.conf&quot;.
       These files normally &lt;include&gt; a system-local.conf or session-local.conf;
       you can put local overrides in those files to avoid modifying the primary
       configuration files.


       The configuration file is an XML document. It  must  have  the  following
       doctype declaration:

          &lt;!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC &quot;-//freedesktop//DTD D-Bus Bus Configuration 1.0//EN&quot;
           &quot;http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd&quot;&gt;



       The following elements may be present in the configuration file.


       &lt;busconfig&gt;
&#12;       Root element.


       &lt;type&gt;


       The  well-known type of the message bus. Currently known values are &quot;sys&#8208;
       tem&quot; and &quot;session&quot;; if other values are set, they should be either  added
       to  the  D-Bus  specification,  or  namespaced.   The last &lt;type&gt; element
       &quot;wins&quot; (previous values are ignored). This element  only  controls  which
       message  bus specific environment variables are set in activated clients.
       Most of the policy that distinguishes a session bus from the  system  bus
       is controlled from the other elements in the configuration file.


       If  the  well-known  type  of  the  message  bus  is  &quot;session&quot;, then the
       DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE environment variable will be set to  &quot;session&quot;  and
       the  DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS  environment  variable  will  be set to the
       address of the session bus.  Likewise, if the type of the message bus  is
       &quot;system&quot;, then the DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE environment variable will be set
       to &quot;system&quot; and the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable will be
       set  to  the address of the system bus (which is normally well known any&#8208;
       way).


       Example: &lt;type&gt;session&lt;/type&gt;


       &lt;include&gt;


       Include a file &lt;include&gt;filename.conf&lt;/include&gt; at this  point.   If  the
       filename  is  relative,  it is located relative to the configuration file
       doing the including.


       &lt;include&gt;  has  an  optional  attribute  &quot;ignore_missing=(yes|no)&quot;  which
       defaults  to &quot;no&quot; if not provided. This attribute controls whether it&apos;s a
       fatal error for the included file to be absent.


       &lt;includedir&gt;


       Include all files in &lt;includedir&gt;foo.d&lt;/includedir&gt; at this point.  Files
       in  the  directory are included in undefined order.  Only files ending in
       &quot;.conf&quot; are included.


       This is intended to allow extension of the system bus by particular pack&#8208;
       ages.  For  example, if CUPS wants to be able to send out notification of
       printer queue changes, it could install a  file  to  /etc/dbus-1/system.d
       that  allowed  all  apps  to receive this message and allowed the printer
       daemon user to send it.


       &lt;user&gt;


       The user account the daemon should run as, as either a username or a UID.
       If  the  daemon  cannot  change to this UID on startup, it will exit.  If
       this element is not present, the daemon will not change or care about its
       UID.


       The last &lt;user&gt; entry in the file &quot;wins&quot;, the others are ignored.
&#12;       The user is changed after the bus has completed initialization.  So sock&#8208;
       ets etc. will be created before changing user, but no data will  be  read
       from  clients before changing user. This means that sockets and PID files
       can be created in a location that requires root privileges for writing.


       &lt;fork&gt;


       If present, the bus daemon becomes a real daemon (forks  into  the  back&#8208;
       ground, etc.). This is generally used rather than the --fork command line
       option.


       &lt;keep_umask&gt;


       If present, the bus daemon keeps its original umask when  forking.   This
       may be useful to avoid affecting the behavior of child processes.


       &lt;listen&gt;


       Add an address that the bus should listen on. The address is in the stan&#8208;
       dard D-Bus format that contains a transport name  plus  possible  parame&#8208;
       ters/options.


       Example: &lt;listen&gt;unix:path=/tmp/foo&lt;/listen&gt;


       Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=1234&lt;/listen&gt;


       If there are multiple &lt;listen&gt; elements, then the bus listens on multiple
       addresses. The bus will pass its address to  started  services  or  other
       interested  parties  with  the last address given in &lt;listen&gt; first. That
       is, apps will try to connect to the last &lt;listen&gt; address first.


       tcp sockets can accept IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses or hostnames.  If a
       hostname  resolves  to multiple addresses, the server will bind to all of
       them. The family=ipv4 or family=ipv6 options can be used to force  it  to
       bind to a subset of addresses


       Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=0,family=ipv4&lt;/listen&gt;


       A  special  case  is  using a port number of zero (or omitting the port),
       which means to choose an available port selected by the operating system.
       The  port  number chosen can be obtained with the --print-address command
       line parameter and will be  present  in  other  cases  where  the  server
       reports its own address, such as when DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set.


       Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=0&lt;/listen&gt;


       tcp  addresses also allow a bind=hostname option, which will override the
       host option specifying what address to  bind  to,  without  changing  the
       address reported by the bus. The bind option can also take a special name
       &apos;*&apos; to cause the bus to listen on all  local  address  (INADDR_ANY).  The
       specified host should be a valid name of the local machine or weird stuff
       will happen.
&#12;       Example: &lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,bind=*,port=0&lt;/listen&gt;


       &lt;auth&gt;


       Lists permitted authorization mechanisms. If this element doesn&apos;t  exist,
       then all known mechanisms are allowed.  If there are multiple &lt;auth&gt; ele&#8208;
       ments, all the listed mechanisms are allowed.  The order in which  mecha&#8208;
       nisms are listed is not meaningful.


       Example: &lt;auth&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/auth&gt;


       Example: &lt;auth&gt;DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1&lt;/auth&gt;


       &lt;servicedir&gt;


       Adds  a  directory  to  scan  for .service files. Directories are scanned
       starting with the last to appear in the config file (the  first  .service
       file found that provides a particular service will be used).


       Service  files  tell  the bus how to automatically start a program.  They
       are primarily used with the per-user-session bus, not the systemwide bus.


       &lt;standard_session_servicedirs/&gt;


       &lt;standard_session_servicedirs/&gt; is equivalent to specifying a  series  of
       &lt;servicedir/&gt;  elements for each of the data directories in the &quot;XDG Base
       Directory Specification&quot; with the subdirectory &quot;dbus-1/services&quot;, so  for
       example  &quot;/usr/share/dbus-1/services&quot;  would  be  among  the  directories
       searched.


       The &quot;XDG Base Directory Specification&quot; can be found  at  http://freedesk&#8208;
       top.org/wiki/Standards/basedir-spec  if  it  hasn&apos;t  moved, otherwise try
       your favorite search engine.


       The  &lt;standard_session_servicedirs/&gt;  option  is  only  relevant  to  the
       per-user-session  bus daemon defined in /etc/dbus-1/session.conf. Putting
       it in any other configuration file would probably be nonsense.


       &lt;standard_system_servicedirs/&gt;


       &lt;standard_system_servicedirs/&gt; specifies the standard system-wide activa&#8208;
       tion  directories that should be searched for service files.  This option
       defaults to /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services.


       The  &lt;standard_system_servicedirs/&gt;  option  is  only  relevant  to   the
       per-system  bus  daemon defined in /etc/dbus-1/system.conf. Putting it in
       any other configuration file would probably be nonsense.


       &lt;servicehelper/&gt;


       &lt;servicehelper/&gt; specifies the setuid helper that is used to launch  sys&#8208;
       tem  daemons  with  an  alternate  user.  Typically  this  should  be the
       dbus-daemon-launch-helper executable in located in libexec.


       The &lt;servicehelper/&gt; option is only relevant to the per-system bus daemon
       defined in /etc/dbus-1/system.conf. Putting it in any other configuration
       file would probably be nonsense.


       &lt;limit&gt;


       &lt;limit&gt; establishes a resource limit. For example:
         &lt;limit name=&quot;max_message_size&quot;&gt;64&lt;/limit&gt;
         &lt;limit name=&quot;max_completed_connections&quot;&gt;512&lt;/limit&gt;


       The name attribute is mandatory.  Available limit names are:
             &quot;max_incoming_bytes&quot;         : total size in bytes of messages
                                            incoming from a single connection
             &quot;max_incoming_unix_fds&quot;      : total number of unix fds of messages
                                            incoming from a single connection
             &quot;max_outgoing_bytes&quot;         : total size in bytes of messages
                                            queued up for a single connection
             &quot;max_outgoing_unix_fds&quot;      : total number of unix fds of messages
                                            queued up for a single connection
             &quot;max_message_size&quot;           : max size of a single message in
                                            bytes
             &quot;max_message_unix_fds&quot;       : max unix fds of a single message
             &quot;service_start_timeout&quot;      : milliseconds (thousandths) until
                                            a started service has to connect
             &quot;auth_timeout&quot;               : milliseconds (thousandths) a
                                            connection is given to
                                            authenticate
             &quot;max_completed_connections&quot;  : max number of authenticated connections
             &quot;max_incomplete_connections&quot; : max number of unauthenticated
                                            connections
             &quot;max_connections_per_user&quot;   : max number of completed connections from
                                            the same user
             &quot;max_pending_service_starts&quot; : max number of service launches in
                                            progress at the same time
             &quot;max_names_per_connection&quot;   : max number of names a single
                                            connection can own
             &quot;max_match_rules_per_connection&quot;: max number of match rules for a single
                                               connection
             &quot;max_replies_per_connection&quot; : max number of pending method
                                            replies per connection
                                            (number of calls-in-progress)
             &quot;reply_timeout&quot;              : milliseconds (thousandths)
                                            until a method call times out


       The max incoming/outgoing queue sizes allow a new message to be queued if
       one  byte  remains  below  the  max. So you can in fact exceed the max by
       max_message_size.


       max_completed_connections divided by max_connections_per_user is the num&#8208;
       ber  of users that can work together to denial-of-service all other users
       by using up all connections on the systemwide bus.


       Limits are normally only of interest on the systemwide bus, not the  user
       session buses.


       &lt;policy&gt;
&#12;       The &lt;policy&gt; element defines a security policy to be applied to a partic&#8208;
       ular set of connections to the bus. A policy is made up  of  &lt;allow&gt;  and
       &lt;deny&gt; elements. Policies are normally used with the systemwide bus; they
       are analogous to a firewall in that they allow expected traffic and  pre&#8208;
       vent unexpected traffic.


       Currently,  the  system  bus has a default-deny policy for sending method
       calls and owning bus names.  Everything else, in  particular  reply  mes&#8208;
       sages, receive checks, and signals has a default allow policy.


       In  general,  it  is best to keep system services as small, targeted pro&#8208;
       grams which run in their own process  and  provide  a  single  bus  name.
       Then,  all  that is needed is an &lt;allow&gt; rule for the &quot;own&quot; permission to
       let the process claim the bus name,  and  a  &quot;send_destination&quot;  rule  to
       allow traffic from some or all uids to your service.


       The &lt;policy&gt; element has one of four attributes:
         context=&quot;(default|mandatory)&quot;
         at_console=&quot;(true|false)&quot;
         user=&quot;username or userid&quot;
         group=&quot;group name or gid&quot;


       Policies are applied to a connection as follows:
          - all context=&quot;default&quot; policies are applied
          - all group=&quot;connection&apos;s user&apos;s group&quot; policies are applied
            in undefined order
          - all user=&quot;connection&apos;s auth user&quot; policies are applied
            in undefined order
          - all at_console=&quot;true&quot; policies are applied
          - all at_console=&quot;false&quot; policies are applied
          - all context=&quot;mandatory&quot; policies are applied


       Policies  applied  later  will  override  those applied earlier, when the
       policies overlap. Multiple policies with the same user/group/context  are
       applied in the order they appear in the config file.


       &lt;deny&gt; &lt;allow&gt;


       A  &lt;deny&gt;  element  appears  below  a &lt;policy&gt; element and prohibits some
       action. The &lt;allow&gt; element makes an exception to previous &lt;deny&gt;  state&#8208;
       ments, and works just like &lt;deny&gt; but with the inverse meaning.


       The possible attributes of these elements are:
          send_interface=&quot;interface_name&quot;
          send_member=&quot;method_or_signal_name&quot;
          send_error=&quot;error_name&quot;
          send_destination=&quot;name&quot;
          send_type=&quot;method_call&quot; | &quot;method_return&quot; | &quot;signal&quot; | &quot;error&quot;
          send_path=&quot;/path/name&quot;

          receive_interface=&quot;interface_name&quot;
          receive_member=&quot;method_or_signal_name&quot;
          receive_error=&quot;error_name&quot;
          receive_sender=&quot;name&quot;
          receive_type=&quot;method_call&quot; | &quot;method_return&quot; | &quot;signal&quot; | &quot;error&quot;

       Examples:
          &lt;deny send_destination=&quot;org.freedesktop.Service&quot; send_interface=&quot;org.freedesktop.System&quot; send_member=&quot;Reboot&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;deny send_destination=&quot;org.freedesktop.System&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;deny receive_sender=&quot;org.freedesktop.System&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;deny user=&quot;john&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;deny group=&quot;enemies&quot;/&gt;


       The  &lt;deny&gt;  element&apos;s  attributes determine whether the deny &quot;matches&quot; a
       particular action. If it matches, the  action  is  denied  (unless  later
       rules in the config file allow it).

       send_destination  and  receive_sender rules mean that messages may not be
       sent to or received from the *owner* of the given name, not that they may
       not  be sent *to that name*. That is, if a connection owns services A, B,
       C, and sending to A is denied, sending to B or C will not work either.

       The other send_* and receive_*  attributes  are  purely  textual/by-value
       matches against the given field in the message header.

       &quot;Eavesdropping&quot;  occurs  when  an application receives a message that was
       explicitly addressed to a name the application does  not  own,  or  is  a
       reply to such a message. Eavesdropping thus only applies to messages that
       are addressed to services and replies to such messages (i.e. it does  not
       apply to signals).

       For  &lt;allow&gt;,  eavesdrop=&quot;true&quot; indicates that the rule matches even when
       eavesdropping. eavesdrop=&quot;false&quot; is the default and means that  the  rule
       only  allows  messages  to  go to their specified recipient.  For &lt;deny&gt;,
       eavesdrop=&quot;true&quot; indicates that the rule matches only when eavesdropping.
       eavesdrop=&quot;false&quot;  is the default for &lt;deny&gt; also, but here it means that
       the rule applies always,  even  when  not  eavesdropping.  The  eavesdrop
       attribute  can  only be combined with send and receive rules (with send_*
       and receive_* attributes).

       The  [send|receive]_requested_reply  attribute  works  similarly  to  the
       eavesdrop  attribute. It controls whether the &lt;deny&gt; or &lt;allow&gt; matches a
       reply that is expected (corresponds to a previous method  call  message).
       This  attribute  only  makes  sense for reply messages (errors and method
       returns), and is ignored for other message types.


       For &lt;allow&gt;, [send|receive]_requested_reply=&quot;true&quot;  is  the  default  and
       indicates   that   only  requested  replies  are  allowed  by  the  rule.
       [send|receive]_requested_reply=&quot;false&quot; means that  the  rule  allows  any
       reply even if unexpected.


       For  &lt;deny&gt;,  [send|receive]_requested_reply=&quot;false&quot;  is  the default but
       indicates that the rule matches only when the reply  was  not  requested.
       [send|receive]_requested_reply=&quot;true&quot;  indicates  that  the  rule applies
       always, regardless of pending reply state.


       user and group denials mean that the given user or group may not  connect
       to the message bus.


       For  &quot;name&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;groupname&quot;, etc.  the character &quot;*&quot; can be sub&#8208;
       stituted, meaning &quot;any.&quot; Complex globs like  &quot;foo.bar.*&quot;  aren&apos;t  allowed
       for  now  because  they&apos;d be work to implement and maybe encourage sloppy
       security anyway.


       &lt;allow own_prefix=&quot;a.b&quot;/&gt; allows you to own the name &quot;a.b&quot;  or  any  name
       whose  first dot-separated elements are &quot;a.b&quot;: in particular, you can own
       &quot;a.b.c&quot; or &quot;a.b.c.d&quot;, but not &quot;a.bc&quot; or &quot;a.c&quot;.  This is useful when  ser&#8208;
       vices  like  Telepathy and ReserveDevice define a meaning for subtrees of
       well-known  names,   such   as   org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ConnectionMan&#8208;
       ager.(anything) and org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.(anything).


       It  does  not  make sense to deny a user or group inside a &lt;policy&gt; for a
       user or group; user/group denials can only be inside context=&quot;default&quot; or
       context=&quot;mandatory&quot; policies.


       A  single  &lt;deny&gt;  rule  may  specify  combinations of attributes such as
       send_destination and send_interface and  send_type.  In  this  case,  the
       denial  applies  only  if both attributes match the message being denied.
       e.g. &lt;deny send_interface=&quot;foo.bar&quot;  send_destination=&quot;foo.blah&quot;/&gt;  would
       deny messages with the given interface AND the given bus name.  To get an
       OR effect you specify multiple &lt;deny&gt; rules.


       You can&apos;t include both send_ and receive_ attributes on  the  same  rule,
       since  &quot;whether the message can be sent&quot; and &quot;whether it can be received&quot;
       are evaluated separately.


       Be careful with send_interface/receive_interface, because  the  interface
       field  in  messages  is  optional.   In  particular, do NOT specify &lt;deny
       send_interface=&quot;org.foo.Bar&quot;/&gt;!  This will cause no-interface messages to
       be  blocked  for  all  services,  which  is almost certainly not what you
       intended.   Always   use   rules   of   the   form:   &lt;deny   send_inter&#8208;
       face=&quot;org.foo.Bar&quot; send_destination=&quot;org.foo.Service&quot;/&gt;


       &lt;selinux&gt;


       The  &lt;selinux&gt;  element  contains  settings  related to Security Enhanced
       Linux.  More details below.


       &lt;associate&gt;


       An &lt;associate&gt; element appears below an &lt;selinux&gt; element and  creates  a
       mapping. Right now only one kind of association is possible:
          &lt;associate own=&quot;org.freedesktop.Foobar&quot; context=&quot;foo_t&quot;/&gt;


       This  means  that  if  a  connection  asks to own the name &quot;org.freedesk&#8208;
       top.Foobar&quot; then the source context will be the context of the connection
       and  the  target  context  will  be &quot;foo_t&quot; - see the short discussion of
       SELinux below.


       Note, the context here is the target context when requesting a name,  NOT
       the context of the connection owning the name.


       There&apos;s  currently no way to set a default for owning any name, if we add
       this syntax it will look like:
          &lt;associate own=&quot;*&quot; context=&quot;foo_t&quot;/&gt;
       If you find a reason this is useful, let the developers know.  Right  now
       the default will be the security context of the bus itself.


       If  two &lt;associate&gt; elements specify the same name, the element appearing
       later in the configuration file will be used.


SELinux
       See http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/ for full details on SELinux. Some  useful
       excerpts:


               Every  subject  (process)  and  object  (e.g.  file,  socket, IPC
               object, etc) in the system is assigned a collection  of  security
               attributes,  known as a security context. A security context con&#8208;
               tains all of the security attributes associated with a particular
               subject or object that are relevant to the security policy.


               In  order  to better encapsulate security contexts and to provide
               greater efficiency, the policy enforcement code of SELinux  typi&#8208;
               cally  handles  security  identifiers (SIDs) rather than security
               contexts. A SID is an integer that  is  mapped  by  the  security
               server to a security context at runtime.


               When a security decision is required, the policy enforcement code
               passes a pair of SIDs (typically the SID of a subject and the SID
               of  an  object, but sometimes a pair of subject SIDs or a pair of
               object SIDs), and  an  object  security  class  to  the  security
               server.  The  object security class indicates the kind of object,
               e.g. a process, a regular file, a directory, a TCP socket, etc.


               Access decisions specify whether or not a permission  is  granted
               for  a  given pair of SIDs and class. Each object class has a set
               of  associated  permissions  defined  to  control  operations  on
               objects with that class.


       D-Bus performs SELinux security checks in two places.


       First,  any  time a message is routed from one connection to another con&#8208;
       nection, the bus daemon will check permissions with the security  context
       of the first connection as source, security context of the second connec&#8208;
       tion as target, object class &quot;dbus&quot; and requested permission &quot;send_msg&quot;.


       If a security context is not available for a connection (impossible  when
       using  UNIX  domain sockets), then the target context used is the context
       of the bus daemon itself.  There is  currently  no  way  to  change  this
       default,  because  we&apos;re  assuming  that only UNIX domain sockets will be
       used to connect to the systemwide bus. If this  changes,  we&apos;ll  probably
       add a way to set the default connection context.


       Second,  any  time  a  connection asks to own a name, the bus daemon will
       check permissions with the security context of the connection as  source,
       the security context specified for the name in the config file as target,
       object class &quot;dbus&quot; and requested permission &quot;acquire_svc&quot;.


       The security context for a bus name is  specified  with  the  &lt;associate&gt;
       element  described  earlier  in this document.  If a name has no security
       context associated in the configuration file, the security context of the
       bus daemon itself will be used.
&#12;DEBUGGING
       If  you&apos;re  trying to figure out where your messages are going or why you
       aren&apos;t getting messages, there are several things you can try.

       Remember that the system bus is heavily locked down and  if  you  haven&apos;t
       installed  a security policy file to allow your message through, it won&apos;t
       work. For the session bus, this is not a concern.

       The simplest way to figure out what&apos;s happening on the bus is to run  the
       dbus-monitor  program,  which  comes with the D-Bus package. You can also
       send test messages with dbus-send. These  programs  have  their  own  man
       pages.

       If  you  want to know what the daemon itself is doing, you might consider
       running a separate copy of the daemon to test against.  This  will  allow
       you  to  put  the daemon under a debugger, or run it with verbose output,
       without messing up your real session and system daemons.

       To run a separate test copy of the daemon, for example you might  open  a
       terminal and type:
         DBUS_VERBOSE=1 dbus-daemon --session --print-address

       The  test daemon address will be printed when the daemon starts. You will
       need to copy-and-paste this address and  use  it  as  the  value  of  the
       DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS  environment variable when you launch the appli&#8208;
       cations you want to test. This will cause those applications  to  connect
       to  your  test  bus  instead of the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS of your real
       session bus.

       DBUS_VERBOSE=1 will have NO EFFECT unless your copy of D-Bus was compiled
       with  verbose  mode enabled. This is not recommended in production builds
       due to performance impact. You may need to rebuild D-Bus if your copy was
       not  built  with  debugging in mind. (DBUS_VERBOSE also affects the D-Bus
       library and thus applications using D-Bus; it may be useful to  see  ver&#8208;
       bose output on both the client side and from the daemon.)

       If  you  want to get fancy, you can create a custom bus configuration for
       your test bus (see the session.conf and system.conf files that define the
       two  default configurations for example). This would allow you to specify
       a different directory for .service files, for example.
