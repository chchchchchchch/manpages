NAME
       dcfujiturn/dcfujiturn16 - Alternative rotation for dcraw processed images

SYNOPSIS
       dcraw -c -j dscf0000.raf | dcfujiturn &gt; dscf0000.ppm
       dcraw -c -j -4 dscf0000.raf | dcfujiturn16 &gt; dscf0000.ppm


DESCRIPTION
       UNIX filter to correct the 45-degree rotation in images from Fuji digital
       cameras.
       Some Fuji digital cameras have a unique CCD sensor placed at a 45  degree
       angle.   The raw output for this sensor is rotated relative to other cam&#8208;
       era brands.  dcfujiturn and dcfujiturn16 provide an  alternative  to  the
       automatic rotation present in dcraw producing a larger resolution image.

       dcfujiturn16 works on 16 bit linear ppm data if you are using dcraw -4 to
       generate your output
