deb-control(5)                       Debian                       deb-control(5)



NAME
       deb-control - Debian packages&apos; master control file format

SYNOPSIS
       control

DESCRIPTION
       Each  Debian package contains the master `control&apos; file, which contains a
       number of fields, or comments when the line starts with &apos;#&apos;.  Each  field
       begins  with  a  tag, such as Package or Version (case insensitive), fol&#8208;
       lowed by a colon, and the body of the field.  Fields are  delimited  only
       by  field  tags.  In  other  words,  field  text may be multiple lines in
       length, but the installation tools will generally join  lines  when  pro&#8208;
       cessing  the  body  of  the  field (except in the case of the Description
       field, see below).

REQUIRED FIELDS
       Package: package-name
              The value of this field determines the package name, and  is  used
              to generate file names by most installation tools.

       Version: version-string
              Typically,  this is the original package&apos;s version number in what&#8208;
              ever form the program&apos;s author uses. It may also include a  Debian
              revision  number  (for  non-native packages). The exact format and
              sorting algorithm are described in deb-version(5).

       Maintainer: fullname-email
              Should be in the format `Joe  Bloggs  &lt;jbloggs@foo.com&gt;&apos;,  and  is
              typically  the  person  who created the package, as opposed to the
              author of the software that was packaged.

       Description: short-description
               long-description
              The format for the package description is a short brief summary on
              the  first  line  (after  the  &quot;Description&quot; field). The following
              lines should be used as a longer, more detailed description.  Each
              line  of  the  long  description  must be preceded by a space, and
              blank lines in the long description must contain a single &apos;.&apos; fol&#8208;
              lowing the preceding space.

OPTIONAL FIELDS
       Section: section
              This is a general field that gives the package a category based on
              the software that it installs. Some common sections  are  `utils&apos;,
              `net&apos;, `mail&apos;, `text&apos;, `x11&apos; etc.

       Priority: priority
              Sets the importance of this package in relation to the system as a
              whole.  Common priorities are `required&apos;, `standard&apos;,  `optional&apos;,
              `extra&apos; etc.

       In Debian, the Section and Priority fields have a defined set of accepted
       values based on the Policy  Manual.   A  list  of  these  values  can  be
       obtained from the latest version of the debian-policy package.

       Essential: yes|no
              This  field  is  usually  only  needed  when the answer is yes. It
              denotes a package that is required for  proper  operation  of  the
              system.  Dpkg  or  any  other  installation tool will not allow an
              Essential package to be removed (at least not without using one of
              the force options).

       Architecture: arch|all
              The architecture specifies which type of hardware this package was
              compiled for. Common architectures are  `i386&apos;,  `m68k&apos;,  `sparc&apos;,
              `alpha&apos;,  `powerpc&apos;  etc.  Note  that  the all option is meant for
              packages that are architecture independent. Some examples of  this
              are shell and Perl scripts, and documentation.

       Origin: name
              The name of the distribution this package is originating from.

       Bugs: url
              The  url  of the bug tracking system for this package. The current
              used    format    is     bts-type://bts-address,     like     deb&#8208;
              bugs://bugs.debian.org.

       Homepage: url
              The upstream project home page url.

       Tag: tag-list
              List of tags describing the qualities of the package. The descrip&#8208;
              tion and list of supported tags can be found in the debtags  pack&#8208;
              age.

       Multi-Arch: same|foreign|allowed
              This field is used to indicate how this package should behave on a
              multi-arch installations. The value same means that the package is
              co-installable with itself, but it must not be used to satisfy the
              dependency of any package of a different architecture from itself.
              The  value  foreign  means  that the package is not co-installable
              with itself, but should be allowed to satisfy the dependency of  a
              package  of a different arch from itself. The value allowed allows
              reverse-dependencies to indicate in their Depends field that  they
              accept  a  package  from a foreign architecture, but has no effect
              otherwise.

       Source: source-name
              The name of the source package that this binary package came from,
              if different than the name of the package itself.


       Subarchitecture: value
       Kernel-Version: value
       Installer-Menu-Item: value
              These  fields are used by the debian-installer and are usually not
              needed.    See   /usr/share/doc/debian-installer/devel/modules.txt
              from the debian-installer package for more details about them.


       Depends: package-list
              List  of  packages that are required for this package to provide a
              non-trivial amount of functionality. The package maintenance soft&#8208;
              ware  will  not  allow  a  package to be installed if the packages
              listed in its Depends field aren&apos;t installed (at least not without
              using  the  force  options).   In  an  installation,  the postinst
              scripts of packages listed in Depends: fields are run before those
              of  the  packages  which  depend  on  them.  On the opposite, in a
              removal, the prerm script of a package is run before those of  the
              packages listed in its Depends: field.

       Pre-Depends: package-list
              List of packages that must be installed and configured before this
              one can be installed. This is usually used in the case where  this
              package requires another package for running its preinst script.

       Recommends: package-list
              Lists  packages  that would be found together with this one in all
              but unusual installations. The package maintenance  software  will
              warn  the  user  if they install a package without those listed in
              its Recommends field.

       Suggests: package-list
              Lists packages that are  related  to  this  one  and  can  perhaps
              enhance  its usefulness, but without which installing this package
              is perfectly reasonable.

       The syntax of Depends, Pre-Depends, Recommends and Suggests fields  is  a
       list  of groups of alternative packages. Each group is a list of packages
       separated by vertical bar (or `pipe&apos;) symbols, `|&apos;. The groups are  sepa&#8208;
       rated  by commas. Commas are to be read as `AND&apos;, and pipes as `OR&apos;, with
       pipes binding more tightly. Each package name is optionally followed by a
       version number specification in parentheses.

       A  version  number may start with a `&gt;&gt;&apos;, in which case any later version
       will match, and may specify or omit the Debian packaging revision  (sepa&#8208;
       rated  by  a hyphen). Accepted version relationships are &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; for greater
       than, &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; for less than, &quot;&gt;=&quot; for greater than or  equal  to,  &quot;&lt;=&quot;  for
       less than or equal to, and &quot;=&quot; for equal to.

       Breaks: package-list
              Lists  packages that this one breaks, for example by exposing bugs
              when the named packages rely on this one. The package  maintenance
              software  will  not allow broken packages to be configured; gener&#8208;
              ally the resolution is to upgrade the packages named in  a  Breaks
              field.

       Conflicts: package-list
              Lists  packages  that  conflict with this one, for example by con&#8208;
              taining files with the same names. The package  maintenance  soft&#8208;
              ware  will  not  allow conflicting packages to be installed at the
              same time. Two conflicting packages should  each  include  a  Con&#8208;
              flicts line mentioning the other.

       Replaces: package-list
              List  of packages files from which this one replaces. This is used
              for allowing this package to overwrite the files of another  pack&#8208;
              age  and is usually used with the Conflicts field to force removal
              of the other package, if this one also has the same files  as  the
              conflicted package.

       Provides: package-list
              This is a list of virtual packages that this one provides. Usually
              this is used in the case of several  packages  all  providing  the
              same  service.  For example, sendmail and exim can serve as a mail
              server, so they provide a common package  (`mail-transport-agent&apos;)
              on  which  other  packages can depend. This will allow sendmail or
              exim to serve as a valid option to satisfy  the  dependency.  This
              prevents  the packages that depend on a mail server from having to
              know the package names for all of them, and using `|&apos; to  separate
              the list.

       The syntax of Breaks, Conflicts, Replaces and Provides is a list of pack&#8208;
       age names, separated by commas (and optional whitespace).  In the  Breaks
       and  Conflicts fields, the comma should be read as `OR&apos;. An optional ver&#8208;
       sion can also be given with the same syntax as above for the Breaks, Con&#8208;
       flicts and Replaces fields.

       Built-Using: package-list
              This  field  lists extra source packages that were used during the
              build of this binary package.  This is an indication  to  the  ar&#8208;
              chive  maintenance  software that these extra source packages must
              be kept whilst this binary package is maintained.  This field must
              be  a  list  of source package names with strict (=) version rela&#8208;
              tionships.  Note that the archive maintenance software  is  likely
              to  refuse  to accept an upload which declares a Built-Using rela&#8208;
              tionship which cannot be satisfied within the archive.

EXAMPLE
       # Comment
       Package: grep
       Essential: yes
       Priority: required
       Section: base
       Maintainer: Wichert Akkerman &lt;wakkerma@debian.org&gt;
       Architecture: sparc
       Version: 2.4-1
       Pre-Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.0.105)
       Provides: rgrep
       Conflicts: rgrep
       Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep.
        The GNU family of grep utilities may be the &quot;fastest grep in the west&quot;.
        GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
        twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
        search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
        considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
        look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
        than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
        will run more slowly, however).
