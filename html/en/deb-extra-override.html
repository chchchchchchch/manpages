NAME
       deb-extra-override - Debian archive extra override file

SYNOPSIS
       override

DESCRIPTION
       While  most information about a binary/source package can be found in the
       control/.dsc file, all of it can be  overridden  when  it&apos;s  exported  to
       Packages/Sources files. The extra override file contains those overrides.

       The  extra  override  file has a simple whitespace-delimited format. Com&#8208;
       ments are allowed (denoted with a #).

            package field-name value

       package is the name of the binary/source package.

       field-name is the name of the field that is  overridden.   value  is  the
       value  to put in the field. It can contain spaces as the line is split in
       no more than 3 columns when it&apos;s parsed.

       The extra override files used to make the official Packages lists may  be
       found in the indices directory on any Debian mirror.
