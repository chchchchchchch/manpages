deb-old(5)                           Debian                           deb-old(5)



NAME
       deb-old - old style Debian binary package format

SYNOPSIS
       filename.deb

DESCRIPTION
       The  .deb  format  is  the Debian binary package file format. This manual
       page describes the old format, used before Debian 0.93. Please see deb(5)
       for details of the new format.

FORMAT
       The  file  is  two lines of format information as ASCII text, followed by
       two concatenated gzipped ustar files.

       The first line is the format version number padded to 8  digits,  and  is
       0.939000 for all old-format archives.

       The  second  line is a decimal string (without leading zeroes) giving the
       length of the first gzipped tarfile.

       Each of these lines is terminated with a single newline character.

       The first tarfile contains the control information, as a series of  ordi&#8208;
       nary  files.  The  file  control must be present, as it contains the core
       control information.

       In some very old archives, the files in the control tarfile  may  option&#8208;
       ally  be  in a DEBIAN subdirectory. In that case, the DEBIAN subdirectory
       will be in the control tarfile too, and the  control  tarfile  will  have
       only  files in that directory. Optionally the control tarfile may contain
       an entry for `.&apos;, that is, the current directory.

       The second gzipped tarfile is the filesystem  archive,  containing  path&#8208;
       names  relative  to  the root directory of the system to be installed on.
       The pathnames do not have leading slashes.
