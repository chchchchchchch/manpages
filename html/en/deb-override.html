NAME
       deb-override - Debian archive override file

SYNOPSIS
       override

DESCRIPTION
       While  most information about a package can be found in the control file,
       some is managed centrally by the distribution czars rather  than  by  the
       maintainer  in  order to offer some global consistency.  This information
       is found in the override file.

       The override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format. Comments  are
       allowed (denoted with a #).

            package priority section [maintainerinfo]

       package  is  the  name  of  the package. Entries in the override file for
       packages not found in the tree of binary packages are ignored.

       priority and section correspond to the respective control  fields  avail&#8208;
       able in the .deb. The allowed values are listed in the Debian policy.

       maintainerinfo, if present, can be either the name of a maintainer for an
       unconditional override, or else oldmaintainer =&gt; newmaintainer to perform
       a substitution.

       The  override files used to make the official Packages lists may be found
       in the indices directory on any Debian mirror.
