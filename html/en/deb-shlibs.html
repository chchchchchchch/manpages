NAME
       deb-shlibs - Debian shared library information file

DESCRIPTION
       shlibs files map shared library names and versions (sonames) to dependen&#8208;
       cies suitable for a package control file.  There is one entry  per  line.
       Blank  lines  are  not  allowed.  Lines beginning with an # character are
       considered commentary, and are ignored.  All other lines  must  have  the
       format

              [type:] library version dependencies

       The  library  and version fields are whitespace-delimited, but the depen&#8208;
       dencies field extends to the end of the line.  The type field is optional
       and normally not needed.

       The  dependencies  field  has  the  same syntax as the Depends field in a
       binary control file, see deb-control(5).  See also the Debian Policy Man&#8208;
       ual for further details.

EXAMPLES
       The  shlibs  file  for  a typical library package, named libcrunch1, that
       provides one library whose soname is libcrunch.so.1, might read

              libcrunch 1 libcrunch1 (&gt;= 1.2-1)

       The dependencies must mention the most recent version of the package that
       added  new symbols to the library: in the above example, new symbols were
       added to version 1.2 of libcrunch.  This  is  not  the  only  reason  the
       dependencies  might  need  to  be tightened; again, see the Debian Policy
       Manual for details.
