deb-split(5)                         Debian                         deb-split(5)



NAME
       deb-split - Debian multi-part binary package format

SYNOPSIS
       filename.deb

DESCRIPTION
       The  multi-part  .deb  format  is used to split big packages into smaller
       pieces to ease transport in small media.

FORMAT
       The file is an ar archive with a magic value of !&lt;arch&gt;.  The file  names
       might contain a trailing slash (since dpkg 1.15.6).

       The  first  member  is named debian-split and contains a series of lines,
       separated by newlines. Currently eight lines are present:

       &#183;   The format version number, 2.1 at the time this manual page was writ&#8208;
           ten.

       &#183;   The package name.

       &#183;   The package version.

       &#183;   The md5sum of the package.

       &#183;   The total size of the package.

       &#183;   The maximum part size.

       &#183;   The  current part number, followed by a slash and the total amount of
           parts (as in &#8216;1/10&#8217;).

       &#183;   The package architecture (since dpkg 1.16.1).

       Programs which read multi-part archives should be prepared for the  minor
       format version number to be increased and additional lines to be present,
       and should ignore these if this is the case.

       If the major format version number has changed,  an  incompatible  change
       has  been  made and the program should stop. If it has not, then the pro&#8208;
       gram should be able to safely continue, unless  it  encounters  an  unex&#8208;
       pected member in the archive (except at the end), as described below.

       The  second,  last  required  member is named data.N, where N denotes the
       part number. It contains the raw part data.

       These members must occur in this  exact  order.  Current  implementations
       should  ignore  any additional members after data.N.  Further members may
       be defined in the future, and (if possible) will be  placed  after  these
       two.
