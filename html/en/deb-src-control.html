deb-src-control(5)                   Debian                   deb-src-control(5)



NAME
       deb-src-control - Debian source packages&apos; master control file format

SYNOPSIS
       control

DESCRIPTION
       Each Debian source package contains the master &quot;control&quot; file, which con&#8208;
       tains at least 2 paragraphs, separated by a blank line. The  first  para&#8208;
       graph  lists  all  information about the source package in general, while
       each following paragraph describes exactly one binary package. Each para&#8208;
       graph  consists  of  at least one field. A field starts with a fieldname,
       such as Package or Section (case insensitive), followed by a  colon,  the
       body of the field and a newline.  Multi-line fields are also allowed, but
       each supplementary line, without a fieldname, should start with at  least
       one  space. The content of the multi-line fields is generally joined to a
       single line by the tools (except in the case of  the  Description  field,
       see  below).  To insert empty lines into a multi-line field, insert a dot
       after the space. Lines starting with a &apos;#&apos; are treated as comments.

SOURCE FIELDS
       Source: source-package-name (required)
              The value of this field is the name of  the  source  package,  and
              should   match   the   name   of   the   source   package  in  the
              debian/changelog file. A package name must consist only  of  lower
              case  letters  (a-z),  digits (0-9), plus (+) and minus (-) signs,
              and periods (.). Package names must be  at  least  two  characters
              long and must start with an alphanumeric character.


       Maintainer: fullname-email (required)
              Should be in the format &quot;Joe Bloggs &lt;jbloggs@foo.com&gt;&quot;, and refer&#8208;
              ences the person who currently maintains the package,  as  opposed
              to the author of the software or the original packager.


       Uploaders: fullname-email
              Lists  all  the names and email addresses of co-maintainers of the
              package, in the same format as the Maintainer field. Multiple  co-
              maintainers should be separated by a comma.


       Standards-Version: version-string
              This  documents  the  most  recent version of the standards (which
              consists of the Debian Policy Manual and referenced texts from the
              debian-policy package) this package complies to.


       DM-Upload-Allowed: yes|no
              This field indicates whether the package can be uploaded by Debian
              Maintainers appearing in the Maintainer or  Uploaders  field.  The
              default value is &quot;no&quot;.


       Homepage: url
              The upstream project home page URL.


       Bugs: url
              The  url  of the bug tracking system for this package. The current
              used    format    is     bts-type://bts-address,     like     deb&#8208;
              bugs://bugs.debian.org. This field is usually not needed.


       Vcs-*: url
              The  url of the Version Control System repository used to maintain
              this package. Currently supported are  Arch,  Bzr  (Bazaar),  Cvs,
              Darcs,  Git,  Hg (Mercurial), Mtn (Monotone) and Svn (Subversion).
              Usually this field points to the latest version  of  the  package,
              such as the main branch or the trunk.


       Vcs-Browser: url
              The  url  of  a  webinterface to browse the Version Control System
              repository.


       Origin: name
              The name of the distribution this  package  is  originating  from.
              This field is usually not needed.


       Section: section
              This is a general field that gives the package a category based on
              the software that it installs. Some common sections  are  &quot;utils&quot;,
              &quot;net&quot;, &quot;mail&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;x11&quot;, etc.


       Priority: priority
              Sets the importance of this package in relation to the system as a
              whole.  Common priorities are &quot;required&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;,  &quot;optional&quot;,
              &quot;extra&quot;, etc.

              In  Debian,  the Section and Priority fields have a defined set of
              accepted values based on the Policy Manual.  A list of these  val&#8208;
              ues  can  be obtained from the latest version of the debian-policy
              package.


       Build-Depends: package-list
              A list of packages that need to be installed and configured to  be
              able  to  build the source package. Including a dependency in this
              list   has   the   same   effect   as   including   it   in   both
              Build-Depends-Arch  and  Build-Depends-Indep,  with the additional
              effect of being used for source-only builds.


       Build-Depends-Arch: package list
              Same as Build-Depends, but they are only needed when building  the
              architecture   dependent  packages.  The  Build-Depends  are  also
              installed in this case. This field was introduced in dpkg  version
              1.16.4;  in order to build with older dpkg versions, Build-Depends
              should be used instead.


       Build-Depends-Indep: package-list
              Same as Build-Depends, but they are only needed when building  the
              architecture  independent  packages.  The  Build-Depends  are also
              installed in this case.


       Build-Conflicts: package list
              A list of packages that should not be installed when  the  package
              is built, for example because they interfere with the build system
              used.  Including a dependency in this list has the same effect  as
              including   it   in   both   Build-Conflicts-Arch  and  Build-Con&#8208;
              flicts-Indep, with the additional effect of being used for source-
              only builds.


       Build-Conflicts-Arch: package list
              Same  as  Build-Conflicts, but only when building the architecture
              dependent packages. This field  was  introduced  in  dpkg  version
              1.16.4;  in  order  to  build with older dpkg versions, Build-Con&#8208;
              flicts should be used instead.


       Build-Conflicts-Indep: package-list
              Same as Build-Conflicts, but only when building  the  architecture
              independent packages.


       The    syntax    of    the    Build-Depends,    Build-Depends-Arch    and
       Build-Depends-Indep fields is a list of groups of  alternative  packages.
       Each  group  is  a list of packages separated by vertical bar (or &quot;pipe&quot;)
       symbols, &quot;|&quot;. The groups are separated by commas. Commas are to  be  read
       as  &quot;AND&quot;, and pipes as &quot;OR&quot;, with pipes binding more tightly. Each pack&#8208;
       age name is optionally followed by  a  version  number  specification  in
       parentheses and an architecture specification in square brackets.

       The  syntax  of  the Build-Conflicts, Build-Conflicts-Arch and Build-Con&#8208;
       flicts-Indep fields is a list of comma-separated package names, where the
       comma is read as an &quot;AND&quot;. Specifying alternative packages using a &quot;pipe&quot;
       is not supported.  Each package name is optionally followed by a  version
       number  specification in parentheses and an architecture specification in
       square brackets.

       A version number may start with a &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, in which case any  later  version
       will  match, and may specify or omit the Debian packaging revision (sepa&#8208;
       rated by a hyphen). Accepted version relationships are &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;  for  greater
       than,  &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;  for  less  than, &quot;&gt;=&quot; for greater than or equal to, &quot;&lt;=&quot; for
       less than or equal to, and &quot;=&quot; for equal to.

       A architecture specification consists of one or more architecture  names,
       separated  by  whitespace.  Exclamation marks may be prepended to each of
       the names, meaning &quot;NOT&quot;.

       Note that dependencies on packages in  the  build-essential  set  can  be
       omitted  and that declaring build conflicts against them is impossible. A
       list of these packages is in the build-essential package.



BINARY FIELDS
       Note that the Priority, Section and Homepage fields  can  also  be  in  a
       binary paragraph to override the global value from the source package.


       Package: binary-package-name (required)
              This  field  is  used  to  name  the binary package name. The same
              restrictions as to a source package name apply.


       Architecture: arch|all|any (required)
              The architecture specifies on which type of hardware this  package
              runs.  For  packages  that  run  on all architectures, use the any
              value. For packages that are  architecture  independent,  such  as
              shell  and  Perl  scripts  or documentation, use the all value. To
              restrict the packages to a certain set of  architectures,  specify
              the  architecture  names, separated by a space. It&apos;s also possible
              to put architecture wildcards in  that  list  (see  dpkg-architec&#8208;
              ture(1) for more information about them).
&#12;       Package-Type: deb|udeb
              This  field  defines  the type of the package. &quot;udeb&quot; is for size-
              constrained packages used by the debian installer.  &quot;deb&quot;  is  the
              default  value,  it&apos;s  assumed  if the field is absent. More types
              might be added in the future.


       Subarchitecture: value
       Kernel-Version: value
       Installer-Menu-Item: value
              These fields are used by the debian-installer and are usually  not
              needed.    See   /usr/share/doc/debian-installer/devel/modules.txt
              from the debian-installer package for more details about them.

       Essential: yes|no
       Multi-Arch: same|foreign|allowed
       Tag: tag-list
       Description: short-description (required)
              These fields are described in the deb-control(5) manual  page,  as
              they  are copied literally to the control file of the binary pack&#8208;
              age.

       Depends: package-list
       Pre-Depends: package-list
       Recommends: package-list
       Suggests: package-list
       Breaks: package-list
       Enhances: package-list
       Replaces: package-list
       Conflicts: package-list
       Provides: package-list
       Built-Using: package-list
              These fields declare relationships between packages. They are dis&#8208;
              cussed  in  the  deb-control(5)  manpage  and in the debian-policy
              package.

USER-DEFINED FIELDS
       It is allowed to add additional user-defined fields to the control  file.
       The  tools  will ignore these fields. If you want the fields to be copied
       over to the output files, such as the binary packages, you need to use  a
       custom  naming  scheme: the fields should start with a X, followed by one
       or more of the letters BCS and a hypen. If the  letter  B  is  used,  the
       field will appear in the control file in the binary package, see deb-con&#8208;
       trol(5), for the letter S in the source  package  control  file  as  con&#8208;
       structed  by  dpkg-source(1)  and  for the letter C in the upload control
       (.changes) file. Note that the X[BCS]- prefixes  are  stripped  when  the
       fields  are  copied over to the output files. A field XC-Approved-By will
       appear as Approved-By in the changes file and  will  not  appear  in  the
       binary or source package control files.

       Take into account that these user-defined fields will be using the global
       namespace, which might at some point in the  future  collide  with  offi&#8208;
       cially  recognized fields. To avoid such potential situation you can pre&#8208;
       fix those fields with Private-, such as XB-Private-New-Field, which as  a
       side effect will make dpkg-deb not warn on them as unknown fields.
