deb-substvars(5)                 dpkg utilities                 deb-substvars(5)



NAME
       deb-substvars - Debian source substitution variables

SYNOPSIS
       substvars

DESCRIPTION
       Before  dpkg-source, dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-genchanges write their con&#8208;
       trol information (to the source control file .dsc for dpkg-source and  to
       standard  output  for  dpkg-gencontrol  and dpkg-genchanges) they perform
       some variable substitutions on the output file.

       A variable substitution has the form  ${variable-name}.   Variable  names
       consist  of  alphanumerics, hyphens and colons and start with an alphanu&#8208;
       meric. Variable substitutions are performed  repeatedly  until  none  are
       left;  the  full text of the field after the substitution is rescanned to
       look for more substitutions.

       After all the substitutions have been done each occurrence of the  string
       ${} (which is not a legal substitution) is replaced with a $ sign.

       While  variable substitution is done on all control fields, some of those
       fields are used and needed during the build when the substitution did not
       yet  occur. That&apos;s why you can&apos;t use variables in the Package, Source and
       Architecture fields.

       Variable substitution happens on the content of  the  fields  after  they
       have  been  parsed,  thus  if you want a variable to expand over multiple
       lines you do not have to include a space after the newline. This is  done
       implicitly  when  the  field  is  output.  For  example,  if the variable
       ${Description} is set to &quot;foo is bar.${Newline}foo is great.&quot; and if  you
       have the following field:

        Description: foo application
         ${Description}
         .
         More text.

       It will result in:

        Description: foo application
         foo is bar.
         foo is great.
         .
         More text.

       Variables  can be set using the -V common option. They can be also speci&#8208;
       fied in the file debian/substvars (or whatever other  file  is  specified
       using the -T option). This file consists of lines of the form name=value.
       Trailing whitespace on each line, blank lines, and lines starting with  a
       # symbol (comments) are ignored.

       Additionally, the following standard variables are available:

       Arch   The current build architecture (from dpkg --print-architecture).

       source:Version
              The source package version.

       source:Upstream-Version
              The  upstream source package version, including the Debian version
              epoch if any.

       binary:Version
              The binary package version (which may differ  from  source:Version
              in a binNMU for example).

       Source-Version
              The  source  package version (from the changelog file). This vari&#8208;
              able is now deprecated as its meaning is different from its  func&#8208;
              tion, please use the source:Version or binary:Version as appropri&#8208;
              ate.

       Installed-Size
              The total size of the package&apos;s installed  files.  This  value  is
              copied  into the corresponding control file field; setting it will
              modify the value  of  that  field.  If  this  variable  isn&apos;t  set
              dpkg-gencontrol  will  use  du  -k  debian/tmp to find the default
              value.

       Extra-Size
              Additional disk space used when the package is installed. If  this
              variable  is  set its value is added to that of the Installed-Size
              variable (whether set  explicitly  or  using  the  default  value)
              before it is copied into the Installed-Size control file field.

       F:fieldname
              The  value  of  the output field fieldname (which must be given in
              the canonical capitalisation).  Setting  these  variables  has  no
              effect other than on places where they are expanded explicitly.

       Format The  .changes file format version generated by this version of the
              source packaging scripts. If you set this variable the contents of
              the Format field in the .changes file will change too.

       Newline, Space, Tab
              These variables each hold the corresponding character.

       shlibs:dependencyfield
              Variable  settings  with  names  of  this  form  are  generated by
              dpkg-shlibdeps.

       dpkg:Upstream-Version
              The upstream version of dpkg.

       dpkg:Version
              The full version of dpkg.

       If a variable is referred to but not defined it generates a  warning  and
       an empty value is assumed.

FILES
       debian/substvars

BUGS
       The  point  at which field overriding occurs compared to certain standard
       output field settings is rather confused.
