NAME
       deb-symbols - Debian&apos;s extended shared library information file

SYNOPSIS
       symbols

DESCRIPTION
       The format for an extended shared library dependency information entry in
       these files is:

       library-soname main-dependency-template
       [| alternative-dependency-template]
       [...]
       [* field-name: field-value]
       [...]
        symbol minimal-version [id-of-dependency-template]

       The library-soname is exactly the value of the SONAME field  as  exported
       by  objdump(1).  A  dependency-template is a dependency where #MINVER# is
       dynamically replaced either by a version  check  like  &quot;(&gt;=  minimal-ver&#8208;
       sion)&quot; or by nothing (if an unversioned dependency is deemed sufficient).

       Each  exported  symbol (listed as name@version, with version being &quot;Base&quot;
       if the library is not versioned) is associated to  a  minimal-version  of
       its  dependency  template (the main dependency template is used if id-of-
       dependency-template is not present).  The  first  alternative  dependency
       template is numbered 1, the second one 2, etc.

       Each  entry  for a library can also have some fields of meta-information.
       Those fields are stored on lines starting with  an  asterisk.  Currently,
       the  only  valid field is Build-Depends-Package, it indicates the name of
       the &quot;-dev&quot; package associated to the library and is used  by  dpkg-shlib&#8208;
       deps  to make sure that the dependency generated is at least as strict as
       the corresponding build dependency.

EXAMPLES
   Simple symbols file
       libftp.so.3 libftp3 #MINVER#
        DefaultNetbuf@Base 3.1-1-6
        FtpAccess@Base 3.1-1-6
        [...]

   Advanced symbols file
       libGL.so.1 libgl1
       | libgl1-mesa-glx #MINVER#
       * Build-Depends-Package: libgl1-mesa-dev
        publicGlSymbol@Base 6.3-1
        [...]
        implementationSpecificSymbol@Base 6.5.2-7 1
