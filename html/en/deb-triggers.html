deb-triggers(5)                  dpkg utilities                  deb-triggers(5)



NAME
       deb-triggers - package triggers

SYNOPSIS
       triggers

DESCRIPTION
       A  package  declares  its  relationship to some trigger(s) by including a
       triggers file in its control archive (i.e. DEBIAN/triggers during package
       creation).

       This  file contains directives, one per line. Leading and trailing white&#8208;
       space and everything after the first # on any line will be  trimmed,  and
       empty lines will be ignored.

       The trigger control directives currently supported are:

            interest trigger-name

            interest-noawait trigger-name

            Specifies  that  the package is interested in the named trigger. All
            triggers in which a package is interested must be listed using  this
            directive  in  the triggers control file. The &quot;noawait&quot; variant does
            not put the triggering  packages  in  triggers-awaited  state.  This
            should be used when the functionality provided by the trigger is not
            crucial.

            activate trigger-name

            activate-noawait trigger-name

            Arranges that changes to this  package&apos;s  state  will  activate  the
            specified trigger. The trigger will be activated at the start of the
            following operations: unpack, configure, remove (including  for  the
            benefit  of  a  conflicting  package),  purge  and deconfigure.  The
            &quot;noawait&quot; variant does not put  the  triggering  packages  in  trig&#8208;
            gers-awaited  state. This should be used when the functionality pro&#8208;
            vided by the trigger is not crucial.

            If this package disappears during the unpacking of  another  package
            the  trigger  will  be  activated  when  the  disappearance is noted
            towards the end of the unpack. Trigger  processing,  and  transition
            from  triggers-awaited to installed, does not cause activations.  In
            the case of unpack, triggers mentioned in both the old and new  ver&#8208;
            sions of the package will be activated.

       Unknown  directives  are  an error which will prevent installation of the
       package.

       The &quot;-noawait&quot; variants are only supported by dpkg 1.16.1 or  newer,  and
       will lead to errors if used with an older dpkg. It is thus recommended to
       add a &quot;Pre-Depends: dpkg (&gt;= 1.16.1)&quot; to any package  that  wish  to  use
       those directives.
