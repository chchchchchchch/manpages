deb-version(5)                       Debian                       deb-version(5)



NAME
       deb-version - Debian package version number format

SYNOPSIS
       [epoch:]upstream-version[-debian-revision]

DESCRIPTION
       Version  numbers as used for Debian binary and source packages consist of
       three components. These are:

       epoch  This is a single (generally small) unsigned integer.   It  may  be
              omitted, in which case zero is assumed.  If it is omitted then the
              upstream-version may not contain any colons.

              It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers  of  older
              versions  of a package, and also a package&apos;s previous version num&#8208;
              bering schemes, to be left behind.

       upstream-version
              This is the main part of the version number.  It  is  usually  the
              version number of the original (&quot;upstream&quot;) package from which the
              .deb file has been made, if this is applicable.  Usually this will
              be in the same format as that specified by the upstream author(s);
              however, it may need to be reformatted to  fit  into  the  package
              management system&apos;s format and comparison scheme.

              The  comparison  behavior  of  the  package management system with
              respect to the upstream-version is described below. The  upstream-
              version portion of the version number is mandatory.

              The  upstream-version may contain only alphanumerics (&quot;A-Za-z0-9&quot;)
              and the characters . + - : ~  (full  stop,  plus,  hyphen,  colon,
              tilde) and should start with a digit.  If there is no debian-revi&#8208;
              sion then hyphens are not allowed;  if  there  is  no  epoch  then
              colons are not allowed.

       debian-revision
              This  part  of  the  version  number  specifies the version of the
              Debian package based on the upstream version.  It may contain only
              alphanumerics  and  the  characters + . ~ (plus, full stop, tilde)
              and is compared in the same way as the upstream-version is.

              It is optional; if it isn&apos;t present then the upstream-version  may
              not  contain  a  hyphen.   This format represents the case where a
              piece of software was written specifically to  be  turned  into  a
              Debian package, and so there is only one &quot;debianisation&quot; of it and
              therefore no revision indication is required.

              It is conventional to restart the debian-revision at &apos;1&apos; each time
              time the upstream-version is increased.

              Dpkg will break the version number apart at the last hyphen in the
              string (if there is one) to  determine  the  upstream-version  and
              debian-revision. The absence of a debian-revision compares earlier
              than the presence of one (but note that the debian-revision is the
              least significant part of the version number).

   Sorting Algorithm
       The  upstream-version and debian-revision parts are compared by the pack&#8208;
       age management system using the same algorithm:

       The strings are compared from left to right.

       First the initial part of each string consisting  entirely  of  non-digit
       characters  is  determined.   These two parts (one of which may be empty)
       are compared lexically.  If a difference is found it  is  returned.   The
       lexical  comparison  is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that all
       the letters sort earlier than all the non-letters and  so  that  a  tilde
       sorts  before anything, even the end of a part.  For example, the follow&#8208;
       ing parts are in sorted order: &apos;~~&apos;, &apos;~~a&apos;, &apos;~&apos;, the empty part, &apos;a&apos;.

       Then the initial part of the remainder  of  each  string  which  consists
       entirely  of  digit  characters  is  determined.  The numerical values of
       these two parts are compared, and any difference found is returned as the
       result  of the comparison.  For these purposes an empty string (which can
       only occur at the end of one or  both  version  strings  being  compared)
       counts as zero.

       These  two  steps  (comparing  and removing initial non-digit strings and
       initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference is found  or  both
       strings are exhausted.

       Note  that  the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind mistakes
       in version numbering, and to cope with situations where the version  num&#8208;
       bering  scheme  changes.  It is not intended to cope with version numbers
       containing strings of letters which the package management system  cannot
       interpret (such as &apos;ALPHA&apos; or &apos;pre-&apos;), or with silly orderings.

CAVEATS
       The tilde character and its special sorting properties were introduced in
       dpkg, version 1.10 and some parts of dpkg-dev only gained support for  it
       later in the 1.10.x series.
