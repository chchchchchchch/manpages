deb(5)                               Debian                               deb(5)



NAME
       deb - Debian binary package format

SYNOPSIS
       filename.deb

DESCRIPTION
       The  .deb  format  is the Debian binary package file format. It is under&#8208;
       stood by dpkg 0.93.76 and later, and is generated by default by all  ver&#8208;
       sions of dpkg since 1.2.0 and all i386/ELF versions since 1.1.1elf.

       The  format  described here is used since Debian 0.93; details of the old
       format are described in deb-old(5).

FORMAT
       The file is an ar archive with a magic value of !&lt;arch&gt;.  Only the common
       ar  archive  format  is supported, with no long file name extensions, but
       with file names containing an optional trailing slash, which limits their
       length to 15 characters (from the 16 allowed).  File sizes are limited to
       10 ASCII decimal digits, allowing for up  to  approximately  9536.74  MiB
       member files.

       The  tar  archives  currently allowed are, the old-style (v7) format, the
       pre-POSIX ustar format, a subset of the GNU format (only  the  new  style
       long  pathnames  and  long linknames, supported since dpkg 1.4.1.17), and
       the POSIX ustar format (long names supported since dpkg 1.15.0).   Unrec&#8208;
       ognized tar typeflags are considered an error.

       The  first  member is named debian-binary and contains a series of lines,
       separated by newlines. Currently only one line  is  present,  the  format
       version  number,  2.0 at the time this manual page was written.  Programs
       which read new-format archives should be prepared for the minor number to
       be increased and new lines to be present, and should ignore these if this
       is the case.

       If the major number has changed, an incompatible change has been made and
       the  program  should stop. If it has not, then the program should be able
       to safely continue, unless it encounters an unexpected member in the  ar&#8208;
       chive (except at the end), as described below.

       The  second required member is named control.tar.gz.  It is a gzipped tar
       archive containing the package control information, as a series of  plain
       files,  of which the file control is mandatory and contains the core con&#8208;
       trol information. The control tarball may optionally contain an entry for
       `.&apos;, the current directory.

       The  third,  last  required  member  is  named data.tar.  It contains the
       filesystem as a tar archive, either not compressed (supported since  dpkg
       1.10.24),  or  compressed  with  gzip  (with .gz extension), xz (with .xz
       extension, supported since dpkg 1.15.6), bzip2 (with .bz2 extension, sup&#8208;
       ported since dpkg 1.10.24) or lzma (with .lzma extension, supported since
       dpkg 1.13.25).

       These members must occur in this  exact  order.  Current  implementations
       should ignore any additional members after data.tar.  Further members may
       be defined in the future, and (if possible) will be  placed  after  these
       three.  Any  additional  members  that  may  need  to  be inserted before
       data.tar and which should be safely ignored by older programs, will  have
       names starting with an underscore, `_&apos;.

       Those  new  members  which  won&apos;t  be  able  to be safely ignored will be
       inserted before data.tar with names starting with  something  other  than
       underscores,  or  will (more likely) cause the major version number to be
       increased.
