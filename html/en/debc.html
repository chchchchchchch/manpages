DEBC(1)                                                                  DEBC(1)



NAME
       debc - view contents of a generated Debian package

SYNOPSIS
       debc [options] [changes file] [package ...]

DESCRIPTION
       debc  figures  out the current version of a package and displays informa&#8208;
       tion about the .deb and .udeb files which have been generated in the cur&#8208;
       rent build process.  If a .changes file is specified on the command line,
       the filename must end with .changes, as this is how the  program  distin&#8208;
       guishes  it  from package names.  If not, then debc has to be called from
       within the source code directory tree.  In this case, it  will  look  for
       the .changes file corresponding to the current package version (by deter&#8208;
       mining the name and version number from the changelog, and the  architec&#8208;
       ture  in  the same way as dpkg-buildpackage(1) does).  It then runs dpkg-
       deb -I and dpkg-deb -c on every .deb and  .udeb  archive  listed  in  the
       .changes  file  to  display  information about the contents of the .deb /
       .udeb files.  It precedes every .deb or .udeb file with the name  of  the
       file.  It assumes that all of the .deb / .udeb archives live  in the same
       directory as the .changes file.  It  is  useful  for  ensuring  that  the
       expected files have ended up in the Debian package.

       If  a list of packages is given on the command line, then only those debs
       or udebs with names in this list of packages will be processed.

Directory name checking
       In common with several other scripts in the devscripts package, debc will
       climb  the  directory  tree until it finds a debian/changelog file.  As a
       safeguard against stray files causing potential problems, it will examine
       the name of the parent directory once it finds the debian/changelog file,
       and check that the directory name corresponds to the package name.   Pre&#8208;
       cisely how it does this is controlled by two configuration file variables
       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL  and  DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX,  and
       their   corresponding   command-line  options  --check-dirname-level  and
       --check-dirname-regex.

       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL can take the following values:

       0      Never check the directory name.

       1      Only check the directory name if we have had to  change  directory
              in  our  search  for debian/changelog.  This is the default behav&#8208;
              iour.

       2      Always check the directory name.

       The directory name is checked by testing whether  the  current  directory
       name  (as determined by pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configura&#8208;
       tion file option DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by  the  command  line
       option  --check-dirname-regex  regex.   Here  regex  is a Perl regex (see
       perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning and the end.   If
       regex  contains  a  &apos;/&apos;,  then it must match the full directory path.  If
       not, then it must match the full directory name.  If regex  contains  the
       string  &#180;PACKAGE&apos;,  this  will be replaced by the source package name, as
       determined from the changelog.  The  default  value  for  the  regex  is:
       &#180;PACKAGE(-.+)?&apos;,  thus matching directory names such as PACKAGE and PACK&#8208;
       AGE-version.

OPTIONS
       -adebian-architecture, -tGNU-system-type
              See dpkg-architecture(1) for a description of these options.  They
              affect  the  search  for  the .changes file.  They are provided to
              mimic the behaviour of dpkg-buildpackage when determining the name
              of the .changes file.

       --debs-dir directory
              Look  for  the .changes, .deb and .udeb files in directory instead
              of the parent of the source directory.  This should either  be  an
              absolute path or relative to the top of the source directory.

       --check-dirname-level N
              See  the  above section Directory name checking for an explanation
              of this option.

       --check-dirname-regex regex
              See the above section Directory name checking for  an  explanation
              of this option.

       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
              first option given on the command-line.

       --help, --version
              Show help message and version information respectively.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf  and  ~/.devscripts  are
       sourced  in  that  order  to  set  configuration variables.  Command line
       options can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised
       variables are:

       DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR
              This specifies the directory in which to look  for  the  .changes,
              .deb  and  .udeb files, and is either an absolute path or relative
              to the top of the source tree.  This corresponds to the --debs-dir
              command  line  option.  This directive could be used, for example,
              if you always use pbuilder or svn-buildpackage to build your pack&#8208;
              ages.   Note  that  it also affects debrelease(1) in the same way,
              hence the strange name of the option.

       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL, DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
              See the above section Directory name checking for  an  explanation
              of  these  variables.  Note that these are package-wide configura&#8208;
              tion variables, and will therefore affect all  devscripts  scripts
              which check their value, as described in their respective manpages
              and in devscripts.conf(5).
