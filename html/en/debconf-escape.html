DEBCONF-ESCAPE(1)                    Debconf                   DEBCONF-ESCAPE(1)



NAME
       debconf-escape - helper when working with debconf&apos;s escape capability

SYNOPSIS
        debconf-escape -e &lt; unescaped-text
        debconf-escape -u &lt; escaped-text

DESCRIPTION
       When debconf has the &apos;escape&apos; capability set, it will expect commands you
       send it to have backslashes and newlines escaped (as &quot;\\&quot; and &quot;\n&quot;
       respectively) and will in turn escape backslashes and newlines in its
       replies. This can be used, for example, to substitute multi-line strings
       into templates, or to get multi-line extended descriptions reliably using
       &quot;METAGET&quot;.

SEE ALSO
       debconf-devel(7) (available in the debconf-doc package)
