DEBCONF-UPDATEPO(1)                po-debconf                DEBCONF-UPDATEPO(1)



NAME
       debconf-updatepo - update PO files about debconf templates

SYNOPSIS
       debconf-updatepo [-v] [-h] [--podir=DIR] [--skip-pot] [--skip-merge]
       [--msgid-bugs-address=EMAIL]

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads po/POTFILES.in to determine which master files need to
       be processed, then extracts new gettext strings into  po/templates.pot
       and updates all po/*.po files.  This script can be called either in the
       top-level directory, or in the debian or debian/po subdirectories.  It is
       run by developer and/or translator to update PO files when the English
       text is modified in templates files.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display a usage summary and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           Process in verbose mode.

       --podir=DIR
           Set directory for PO files.  By default PO files are searched in
           debian/po, po and ../po directories in that order.

       --skip-pot
           Do not generate a new po/templates.pot file.

       --skip-merge
           Do not merge existing PO files with po/templates.pot.

       --msgid-bugs-address=EMAIL
           Set the email address that will be specified in the POT&apos;s Report-
           Msgid-Bugs-To field.

           By default, this field is set to &lt;package&gt;@package.debian.org.

           It is intended for the maintainers of Debian based distributions, and
           should be used in the following cases:

           o   The package is not present in Debian (and thus the
               &lt;package&gt;@packages.debian.org address does not exist).

           o   The maintainer made significant changes in the debconf templates
               (or added templates to a Debian package without templates), and
               does not want to bother the Debian maintainer with bug reports
               that won&apos;t be relevant for the Debian maintainer.

           The default address is preferred to avoid corrections in the Debian
           based distribution without a notification to the Debian maintainer.
