DEBPKG(1)                                                              DEBPKG(1)



NAME
       debpkg - wrapper for dpkg

SYNOPSIS
       debpkg dpkg-options

DESCRIPTION
       debpkg simply invokes dpkg(1) but first becomes superuser so that dpkg is
       able to install and remove packages.  It also cleans the environment  and
       resets          PATH          to          a         sane         default:
       &quot;/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11&quot; so that  local  versions  of
       programs are not run by accident.

REQUIREMENTS
       debpkg  must  be given superuser privileges in some way to function prop&#8208;
       erly.  Access to debpkg with those privileges is the same as having supe&#8208;
       ruser access to your machine.  debpkg will abort if it finds that it nei&#8208;
       ther being run by root nor setuid root.

       The devscripts package has been designed  to  allow  debpkg  to  be  made
       setuid  root.  This works by using a compiled wrapper script, which means
       that suidperl is not required.  See dpkg-statoverride(8) if you  wish  to
       make  this  program setuid root.  sudo or super could also conceivably be
       used.
