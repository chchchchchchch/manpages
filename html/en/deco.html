NAME
       deco - draw tacky 70s basement wall panelling

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       The deco program subdivides and colors  rectangles  randomly.   It  looks
       kind  of like Brady-Bunch-era rec-room wall paneling.  (Raven says: &quot;This
       screensaver is ugly enough to peel paint.&quot;)  Can also produce  more  aes&#8208;
       thetically pleasing displays via options.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
