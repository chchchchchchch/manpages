NAME
       deleg_method - Creation of comm delegates (snit methods)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.3

       package require snit  ?1.1?

       package require interp::delegate::method  ?0.2?

       ::interp::delegate::method ?-async? name arguments comm id

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  provides a single command for use within snit type defini&#8208;
       tion (i.e. actually a snit::macro) for the convenient creation of methods
       which  delegate the actual work to a remote location via a &quot;channel&quot; cre&#8208;
       ated by the package comm.

API
       ::interp::delegate::method ?-async? name arguments comm id
              This commands creates a method which is named by name. All invoka&#8208;
              tions  of  this method will delegate the actual work to the remote
              location identified by the comm channel comm and the endpoint id.

              The name of the remote method invoked by the delegator is  identi&#8208;
              cal to the name of the method itself.

              Normally the generated method marshalls the arguments, and returns
              the result from the remote method as its own  result.  If  however
              the option -async was specified then the generated method will not
              wait for a result and return immediately.
