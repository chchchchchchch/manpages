NAME
       deleg_proc - Creation of comm delegates (procedures)

       ::interp::delegate::proc ?-async? name arguments comm id

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  provides  a  single command for the convenient creation of
       procedures which delegate the actual work to  a  remote  location  via  a
       &quot;channel&quot; created by the package comm.

API
       ::interp::delegate::proc ?-async? name arguments comm id
              This  commands  creates  a  procedure  which  is named by name and
              returns its fully-qualified name. All invokations of  this  proce&#8208;
              dure  will delegate the actual work to the remote location identi&#8208;
              fied by the comm channel comm and the endpoint id.

              The name of the remote  procedure  invoked  by  the  delegator  is
              [namespace  tail  name].  I.e.,  namespace information is stripped
              from the call.

              Normally the generated  procedure  marshalls  the  arguments,  and
              returns the result from the remote procedure as its own result. If
              however the option -async was specified then the generated  proce&#8208;
              dure will not wait for a result and return immediately.
