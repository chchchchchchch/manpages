DEPMOD.D(5)                         depmod.d                         DEPMOD.D(5)



NAME
       depmod.d - Configuration directory for depmod

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/depmod.d/*.conf

       /etc/depmod.d/*.conf

       /run/depmod.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The order in which modules are processed by the depmod command can be
       altered on a global or per-module basis. This is typically useful in
       cases where built-in kernel modules are complemented by custom built
       versions of the same and the user wishes to affect the priority of
       processing in order to override the module version supplied by the
       kernel.

       The format of files under depmod.d is simple: one command per line, with
       blank lines and lines starting with &apos;#&apos; ignored (useful for adding
       comments). A &apos;\&apos; at the end of a line causes it to continue on the next
       line, which makes the files a bit neater.

COMMANDS
       search subdirectory...
           This allows you to specify the order in which /lib/modules (or other
           configured module location) subdirectories will be processed by
           depmod. Directories are listed in order, with the highest priority
           given to the first listed directory and the lowest priority given to
           the last directory listed. The special keyword built-in refers to the
           standard module directories installed by the kernel.

           By default, depmod will give a higher priority to a directory with
           the name updates using this built-in search string: &quot;updates
           built-in&quot; but more complex arrangements are possible and are used in
           several popular distributions.

       override modulename kernelversion modulesubdirectory
           This command allows you to override which version of a specific
           module will be used when more than one module sharing the same name
           is processed by the depmod command. It is possible to specify one
           kernel or all kernels using the * wildcard.  modulesubdirectory is
           the name of the subdirectory under /lib/modules (or other module
           location) where the target module is installed.

           For example, it is possible to override the priority of an updated
           test module called kmod by specifying the following command:
           &quot;override kmod * extra&quot;. This will ensure that any matching module
           name installed under the extra subdirectory within /lib/modules (or
           other module location) will take priority over any likenamed module
           already provided by the kernel.
