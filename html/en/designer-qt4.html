DESIGNER-QT4(1)                                                  DESIGNER-QT4(1)



NAME
       designer-qt4 - Visual user interface designer for Qt4.

DESCRIPTION
       Qt  Designer  simplifies  the process of designing and creating graphical
       user interfaces (GUI) using the award-winning Qt toolkit. Qt Designer  is
       easy  to learn.  There are tutorials, walkthrough examples and the refer&#8208;
       ence documentation accelerating you through  the  learning  phase.  After
       that,  Qt  Designer greatly reduces the time and effort needed to develop
       even the most complex dialogs with an easy-to-use GUI and  an  integrated
       help system.

        Qt Designer provides a rich set of features aimed at making the creation
       of dialogs as easy and smooth as possible without reducing the  power  of
       Qt.  It  offers  all  the  strength  of  the  Qt  layout  system  with  a
       well-designed user interface.  This,  combined  with  the  Qt  Designer&apos;s
       undo/redo  system  makes  it  simple to try different arrangements of the
       widgets until the result satisfies you.

        Using Qt Designer&apos;s convenient property editor along with the dynamic Qt
       property system it is easy to set the initial state of your widgets. Spe&#8208;
       cial editors for some widgets (like listboxes,  comboboxes,  etc.)  allow
       you  to  fill these widgets with content without writing any code.  Using
       the object hierarchy view, the parent-child relationship between the wid&#8208;
       gets of a dialog can be understood at a glance.

        Integrating  dialogs  into a Qt project is straightforward thanks to the
       User Interface Compiler (UIC), which generates C++ code from the XML dia&#8208;
       log  description  on  the fly. The programmer can easily extend the func&#8208;
       tionality of the generated classes by subclassing without touching gener&#8208;
       ated code at all or running the risk of loosing their changes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       QTDIR  Specifies the Qt base directory.  On Debian systems this should be
              set to /usr/share/qt4.
