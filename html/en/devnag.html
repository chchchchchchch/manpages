NAME
       devnag - Devanagari for TeX preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       devnag in[.dn] [out[.tex]]

DESCRIPTION
       devnag  is  a  preprocessor  that  reads  transliterated Devanagari input
       delimited by n and converts it into a form with which TeX is familiar.

       The preprocessor handles the details of character placement such  as  the
       alignment  of  vowel  diacritics and consonant ligatures. The rest of the
       layout, however, must be managed by the user.

       For specification of the format please see the documentation accompanying
       the package.

OPTIONS
       in[.dn] out[.tex]
              The  default  file  extension  for an input file is .dn and for an
              output file .tex. The output filename is optional.  If  an  output
              filename is not specified, the preprocessor will name it after the
              input file.
