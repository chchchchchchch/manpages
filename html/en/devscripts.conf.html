DEVSCRIPTS.CONF(5)                                            DEVSCRIPTS.CONF(5)



NAME
       devscripts.conf - configuration file for the devscripts package

DESCRIPTION
       The  devscripts  package provides a collection of scripts which may be of
       use to Debian developers and others wishing  to  build  Debian  packages.
       Many  of  these have options which can be configured on a system-wide and
       per-user basis.

       Every script in the devscripts package which makes  use  of  values  from
       these  configuration  files describes the specific settings recognised in
       its  own  manpage.   (For   a   list   of   the   scripts,   either   see
       /usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz  or  look  at  the  output of dpkg -L
       devscripts | grep /usr/bin.)

       The two configuration  files  are  /etc/devscripts.conf  for  system-wide
       defaults  and ~/.devscripts for per-user settings.  They are written with
       bash(1) syntax, but should only have comments and simple variable assign&#8208;
       ments  in  them;  they  are  both  sourced  (if  present)  by many of the
       devscripts scripts.  Variables corresponding to  simple  switches  should
       have  one  of  the  values  yes  and no; any other setting is regarded as
       equivalent to the default setting.

       All variable names are written in uppercase, and begin  with  the  script
       name.   Package-wide  variables  begin  with &quot;DEVSCRIPTS&quot;, and are listed
       below, as well as in the relevant manpages.

       For a list of all of the available options variables,  along  with  their
       default     settings,     see     the    example    configuration    file
       /usr/share/doc/devscripts/devscripts.conf.ex.    This   is   copied    to
       /etc/devscripts.conf  when  the  devscripts  package  is first installed.
       Information about configuration options introduced in newer  versions  of
       the  package will be appended to /etc/devscripts.conf when the package is
       upgraded.

       Every script which reads the configuration files can be forced to  ignore
       them by using --no-conf as the first command-line option.

PACKAGE-WIDE VARIABLES
       The currently recognised package-wide variables are:

       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL, DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
              These  variables  control scripts which change directory to find a
              debian/changelog file or suchlike, and  some  other  miscellaneous
              cases.  In order to prevent unwanted, even possibly dangerous, be&#8208;
              haviour, these variables control when actions will  be  performed.
              The scripts which currently make use of these variables are: debc,
              debchange/dch, debclean, debi, debrelease, debuild and uscan,  but
              this  list  may change with time (and I may not remember to update
              this manpage).  Please see the manpages of individual scripts  for
              details of the specific behaviour for each script.
