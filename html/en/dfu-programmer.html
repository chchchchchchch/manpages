DFU-PROGRAMMER(1)                                              DFU-PROGRAMMER(1)



NAME
       dfu-programmer - USB firmware upgrading for Atmel microcontrollers

SYNOPSIS
       dfu-programmer target command [options] [parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       dfu-programmer  is  a  Linux  command  line Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
       based programmer for the flash memory on Atmel AVR, AVR32 and 8051  based
       microcontrollers  which  ship  with  a  USB  boot loader.  It supports In
       System Programming (ISP) for developers and potentially  product  updates
       in  the  field.   Those boot loaders are patterned after the standard USB
       DFU 1.0 class specification, but depend on extensions defined by Atmel to
       the extent that standard DFU drivers will not work.

       To  use  it, first connect the device to be programmed and ensure that it
       comes up in DFU mode.  The microcontrollers  come  up  in  that  mode  as
       shipped  by Atmel; or they may reenter that mode after a special hardware
       reset.  Then invoke this program to issue one or more DFU commands.   You
       will  normally  need to start by issuing the &quot;erase&quot; command; the default
       security  policies  prevent  extracting  firmware,  to  prevent   reverse
       engineering of what is usually proprietary code.

USAGE
       There  are  no  mechanisms  for  selecting  which single device should be
       programmed, or to implement  gang  programming.   Accordingly,  you  will
       usually  avoid  connecting  more  than one device of a given family (AVR,
       AVR32 or 8051) at a time.

       All of these commands support the &quot;global options&quot;.  Unless you  override
       it, commands which write to the microcontroller will perform a validation
       step that rereads the data which was written, compares it to the expected
       result, and reports any errors.

       configure register [--suppress-validation] data
              Bootloaders  for  8051  based  controllers support writing certain
              configuration bytes.

       dump
              Reads all the available flash memory, and writes it as binary data
              to stdout.

       dump-eeprom
              Reads  all  the  available  eeprom memory, and writes it as binary
              data to stdout.

       dump-user
              Reads the user space flash on the AVR32 chips  and  writes  it  as
              binary data to stdout.

       erase [--suppress-validation]
              Erases  all  the  flash  memory.   This  is  required  before  the
              bootloader will perform other commands.

       flash [--suppress-validation] [--suppress-bootloader-mem] file or STDIN
              Writes flash memory.  The input  file  (or  stdin)  must  use  the
              &quot;ihex&quot;    file    format    convention   for   a   memory   image.
              --suppress-bootloader-mem  ignores  any  data   written   to   the
              bootloader  memory space when flashing the device.  This option is
              particularly useful for the AVR32 chips trampoline code.

       flash-user [--suppress-validation] file or STDIN
              Writes to user space flash on the  AVR32  chips.   This  block  of
              flash  is  out of the normal range of flash blocks and is designed
              to contain configuration parameters.  The input  file  (or  stdin)
              mus use the &quot;ihex&quot; file format convention for a memory image.

       eeprom-flash [--suppress-validation] file or STDIN
              Writes  to  eeprom memory.  The input file (or stdin) must use the
              &quot;ihex&quot; file format convention for a memory image.

       get register
              Displays various product identifier bytes.

       reset
              Resets microcontroller using watchdog timer

       start
              Starts the application firmware by having the microcontroller jump
              to address zero.

       version
              This prints a string identifying the version of this utility.

   Global Options
       --quiet - minimizes the output

       --debug level - enables verbose output at the specified level

   Configure Registers
       The  standard bootloader for 8051 based chips supports writing data bytes
       which are not relevant for the AVR based chips.

       BSB - boot status byte
       SBV - software boot vector
       SSB - software security byte
       EB  - extra byte
       HSB - hardware security byte

   Get Register
       bootloader-version - currently flashed bootloader version
       ID1 - device boot identification 1
       ID2 - device boot identification 2
       manufacturer - the hardware manufacturer code
       family - the product family code
       product-name - the product name
       product-revision - the product revision
       HSB - same as the configure_register version
       BSB - same as the configure_register version
       SBV - same as the configure_register version
       SSB - same as the configure_register version
       EB  - same as the configure_register version

BUGS
       None known.

KNOWN ISSUES
       The at90usb series chips do not make  available  any  read/write  protect
       flags  so  the  dump  or  flash command may fail with a less than helpful
       error message.

       To remove any write or read  protection  from  any  chips,  a  full  chip
       erasure is required.

       You  may need to be a member of the uucp group in order to have access to
       the device without needing to be root.
