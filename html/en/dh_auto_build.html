DH_AUTO_BUILD(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_AUTO_BUILD(1)



NAME
       dh_auto_build - automatically builds a package

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_build [build&#194; system&#194; options] [debhelper&#194; options] [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_build is a debhelper program that tries to automatically build a
       package. It does so by running the appropriate command for the build
       system it detects the package uses. For example, if a Makefile is found,
       this is done by running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is
       set). If there&apos;s a setup.py, or Build.PL, it is run to build the package.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn&apos;t work,
       you&apos;re encouraged to skip using dh_auto_build at all, and just run the
       build process manually.

OPTIONS
       See &quot;BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS&quot; in debhelper(7) for a list of common build
       system selection and control options.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that
           dh_auto_build usually passes.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
