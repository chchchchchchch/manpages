DH_AUTO_CLEAN(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_AUTO_CLEAN(1)



NAME
       dh_auto_clean - automatically cleans up after a build

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_clean [build&#194; system&#194; options] [debhelper&#194; options] [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that tries to automatically clean up
       after a package build. It does so by running the appropriate command for
       the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if there&apos;s a
       Makefile and it contains a distclean, realclean, or clean target, then
       this is done by running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is
       set). If there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it is run to clean the package.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn&apos;t work,
       or tries to use the wrong clean target, you&apos;re encouraged to skip using
       dh_auto_clean at all, and just run make clean manually.

OPTIONS
       See &quot;BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS&quot; in debhelper(7) for a list of common build
       system selection and control options.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that
           dh_auto_clean usually passes.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
