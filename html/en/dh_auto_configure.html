DH_AUTO_CONFIGURE(1)                Debhelper               DH_AUTO_CONFIGURE(1)



NAME
       dh_auto_configure - automatically configure a package prior to building

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_configure [build&#194; system&#194; options] [debhelper&#194; options]
       [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_configure is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       configure a package prior to building. It does so by running the
       appropriate command for the build system it detects the package uses.
       For example, it looks for and runs a ./configure script, Makefile.PL,
       Build.PL, or cmake. A standard set of parameters is determined and passed
       to the program that is run. Some build systems, such as make, do not need
       a configure step; for these dh_auto_configure will exit without doing
       anything.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn&apos;t work,
       you&apos;re encouraged to skip using dh_auto_configure at all, and just run
       ./configure or its equivalent manually.

OPTIONS
       See &quot;BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS&quot; in debhelper(7) for a list of common build
       system selection and control options.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that
           dh_auto_configure usually passes. For example:

             dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --enable-bar
