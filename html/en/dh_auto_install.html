DH_AUTO_INSTALL(1)                  Debhelper                 DH_AUTO_INSTALL(1)



NAME
       dh_auto_install - automatically runs make install or similar

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_install [build&#194; system&#194; options] [debhelper&#194; options]
       [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_install is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       install built files. It does so by running the appropriate command for
       the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if there&apos;s a
       Makefile and it contains a install target, then this is done by running
       make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is set). If there is a
       setup.py or Build.PL, it is used. Note that the Ant build system does not
       support installation, so dh_auto_install will not install files built
       using Ant.

       Unless --destdir option is specified, the files are installed into
       debian/package/ if there is only one binary package. In the multiple
       binary package case, the files are instead installed into debian/tmp/,
       and should be moved from there to the appropriate package build directory
       using dh_install(1).

       DESTDIR is used to tell make where to install the files.  If the Makefile
       was generated by MakeMaker from a Makefile.PL, it will automatically set
       PREFIX=/usr too, since such Makefiles need that.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn&apos;t work,
       or tries to use the wrong install target, you&apos;re encouraged to skip using
       dh_auto_install at all, and just run make install manually.

OPTIONS
       See &quot;BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS&quot; in debhelper(7) for a list of common build
       system selection and control options.

       --destdir=directory
           Install files into the specified directory. If this option is not
           specified, destination directory is determined automatically as
           described in the &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; section.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that
           dh_auto_install usually passes.
