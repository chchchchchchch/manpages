DH_CLEAN(1)                         Debhelper                        DH_CLEAN(1)



NAME
       dh_clean - clean up package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_clean [debhelper&#194; options] [-k] [-d] [-Xitem] [file&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning up after
       a package is built. It removes the package build directories, and removes
       some other files including debian/files, and any detritus left behind by
       other debhelper commands. It also removes common files that should not
       appear in a Debian diff:
         #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp

       It does not run &quot;make clean&quot; to clean up after the build process. Use
       dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like that.

       dh_clean (or &quot;dh clean&quot;) should be the last debhelper command run in the
       clean target in debian/rules.

FILES
       debian/clean
           Can list other files to be removed.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keep
           This is deprecated, use dh_prep(1) instead.

       -d, --dirs-only
           Only clean the package build directories, do not clean up any other
           files at all.

       -Xitem --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           deleted, even if they would normally be deleted. You may use this
           option multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.

       file ...
           Delete these files too.

SEE ALSO

       This program is a part of debhelper.
