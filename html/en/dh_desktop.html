DH_DESKTOP(1)                       Debhelper                      DH_DESKTOP(1)



NAME
       dh_desktop - deprecated no-op

SYNOPSIS
       dh_desktop [debhelper&#194; options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_desktop was a debhelper program that registers .desktop files.
       However, it no longer does anything, and is now deprecated.

       If a package ships desktop files, they just need to be installed in the
       correct location (/usr/share/applications) and they will be registered by
       the appropriate tools for the corresponding desktop environments.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper

       This program is a part of debhelper.
