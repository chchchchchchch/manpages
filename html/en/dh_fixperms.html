DH_FIXPERMS(1)                      Debhelper                     DH_FIXPERMS(1)



NAME
       dh_fixperms - fix permissions of files in package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_fixperms [debhelper&#194; options] [-Xitem]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_fixperms is a debhelper program that is responsible for setting the
       permissions of files and directories in package build directories to a
       sane state -- a state that complies with Debian policy.

       dh_fixperms makes all files in usr/share/doc in the package build
       directory (excluding files in the examples/ directory) be mode 644. It
       also changes the permissions of all man pages to mode 644. It makes all
       files be owned by root, and it removes group and other write permission
       from all files. It removes execute permissions from any libraries,
       headers, Perl modules, or desktop files that have it set. It makes all
       files in the standard bin and sbin directories, usr/games/ and etc/init.d
       executable (since v4). Finally, it removes the setuid and setgid bits
       from all files in the package.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from
           having their permissions changed. You may use this option multiple
           times to build up a list of things to exclude.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
