DH_GENCONTROL(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_GENCONTROL(1)



NAME
       dh_gencontrol - generate and install control file

SYNOPSIS
       dh_gencontrol [debhelper&#194; options] [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_gencontrol is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       control files, and installing them into the DEBIAN directory with the
       proper permissions.

       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-gencontrol(1), which calls
       it once for each package being acted on, and passes in some additional
       useful flags.

OPTIONS
       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).

       -uparams, --dpkg-gencontrol-params=params
           This is another way to pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).  It is
           deprecated; use -- instead.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
