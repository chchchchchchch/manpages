DH_INSTALL(1)                       Debhelper                      DH_INSTALL(1)



NAME
       dh_install - install files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_install [-Xitem] [--autodest] [--sourcedir=dir] [debhelper&#194; options]
       [file|dir&#194; ...&#194; destdir]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_install is a debhelper program that handles installing files into
       package build directories. There are many dh_install* commands that
       handle installing specific types of files such as documentation,
       examples, man pages, and so on, and they should be used when possible as
       they often have extra intelligence for those particular tasks.
       dh_install, then, is useful for installing everything else, for which no
       particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for the old
       dh_movefiles command.

       This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file or
       two that the upstream Makefile does not install for you, you can run
       dh_install on them to move them into place. On the other hand, maybe you
       have a large package that builds multiple binary packages. You can use
       the upstream Makefile to install it all into debian/tmp, and then use
       dh_install to copy directories and files from there into the proper
       package build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, dh_install will fall back to
       looking in debian/tmp for files, if it doesn&apos;t find them in the current
       directory (or whereever you&apos;ve told it to look using --sourcedir).

FILES
       debian/package.install
           List the files to install into each package and the directory they
           should be installed to. The format is a set of lines, where each line
           lists a file or files to install, and at the end of the line tells
           the directory it should be installed in. The name of the files (or
           directories) to install should be given relative to the current
           directory, while the installation directory is given relative to the
           package build directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the
           files to install (in v3 mode and above).

           Note that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-pattern on a
           line by itself, with no explicit destination, then dh_install will
           automatically guess the destination to use, the same as if the
           --autodest option were used.

OPTIONS
       --list-missing
           This option makes dh_install keep track of the files it installs, and
           then at the end, compare that list with the files in the source
           directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source directory
           were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr about that.

           This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure
           that you don&apos;t miss installing newly added files in new upstream
           releases.

           Note that files that are excluded from being moved via the -X option
           are not warned about.

       --fail-missing
           This option is like --list-missing, except if a file was missed, it
           will not only list the missing files, but also fail with a nonzero
           exit code.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           installed.

       --sourcedir=dir
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.

           Note that this is not the same as the --sourcedirectory option used
           by the dh_auto_* commands. You rarely need to use this option, since
           dh_install automatically looks for files in debian/tmp in debhelper
           compatibility level 7 and above.

       --autodest
           Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If this is
           specified, you should not list destination directories in
           debian/package.install files or on the command line. Instead,
           dh_install will guess as follows:

           Strip off debian/tmp (or the sourcedir if one is given) from the
           front of the filename, if it is present, and install into the dirname
           of the filename. So if the filename is debian/tmp/usr/bin, then that
           directory will be copied to debian/package/usr/. If the filename is
           debian/tmp/etc/passwd, it will be copied to debian/package/etc/.

       file|dir ... destdir
           Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install them to.
           The files will be installed into the first package dh_install acts
           on.

LIMITATIONS
       dh_install cannot rename files or directories, it can only install them
       with the names they already have into wherever you want in the package
       build tree.
