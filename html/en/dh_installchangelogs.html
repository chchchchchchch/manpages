DH_INSTALLCHANGELOGS(1)             Debhelper            DH_INSTALLCHANGELOGS(1)



NAME
       dh_installchangelogs - install changelogs into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installchangelogs [debhelper&#194; options] [-k] [-Xitem] [upstream]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installchangelogs is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing changelogs into package build directories.

       An upstream changelog file may be specified as an option. If none is
       specified, it looks for files with names that seem likely to be
       changelogs.  (In compatibility level 7 and above.)

       If there is an upstream changelog file, it will be be installed as
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog in the package build directory. If the
       changelog is a html file (determined by file extension), it will be
       installed as usr/share/doc/package/changelog.html instead, and will be
       converted to plain text with html2text to generate
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog.

FILES
       debian/changelog
       debian/NEWS
       debian/package.changelog
       debian/package.NEWS
           Automatically installed into usr/share/doc/package/ in the package
           build directory.

           Use the package specific name if package needs a different NEWS or
           changelog file.

           The changelog file is installed with a name of changelog for native
           packages, and changelog.Debian for non-native packages.  The NEWS
           file is always installed with a name of NEWS.Debian.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keep
           Keep the original name of the upstream changelog. This will be
           accomplished by installing the upstream changelog as changelog, and
           making a symlink from that to the original name of the changelog
           file. This can be useful if the upstream changelog has an unusual
           name, or if other documentation in the package refers to the
           changelog file.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude upstream changelog files that contain item anywhere in their
           filename from being installed.

       upstream
           Install this file as the upstream changelog.
