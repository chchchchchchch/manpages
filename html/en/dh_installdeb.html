DH_INSTALLDEB(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_INSTALLDEB(1)



NAME
       dh_installdeb - install files into the DEBIAN directory

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installdeb [debhelper&#194; options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installdeb is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
       files into the DEBIAN directories in package build directories with the
       correct permissions.

FILES
       package.postinst
       package.preinst
       package.postrm
       package.prerm
           These maintainer scripts are installed into the DEBIAN directory.

           Inside the scripts, the token #DEBHELPER# is replaced with shell
           script snippets generated by other debhelper commands.

       package.triggers
       package.shlibs
           These control files are installed into the DEBIAN directory.

       package.conffiles
           This control file will be installed into the DEBIAN directory.

           In v3 compatibility mode and higher, all files in the etc/ directory
           in a package will automatically be flagged as conffiles by this
           program, so there is no need to list them manually here.

       package.maintscript
           Lines in this file correspond to dpkg-maintscript-helper(1) commands
           and parameters.  Any shell metacharacters will be escaped, so
           arbitrary shell code cannot be inserted here.  For example, a line
           such as &quot;mv_conffile /etc/oldconffile /etc/newconffile&quot; will insert
           maintainer script snippets into all maintainer scripts sufficient to
           move that conffile.

           A versioned Pre-Dependency on dpkg is needed to use
           dpkg-maintscript-helper(1). An appropriate Pre-Dependency is set in
           ${misc:Pre-Depends} ; you should make sure to put that token into an
           appropriate place in your debian/control file.
