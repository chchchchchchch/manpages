DH_INSTALLDOCS(1)                   Debhelper                  DH_INSTALLDOCS(1)



NAME
       dh_installdocs - install documentation into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installdocs [debhelper&#194; options] [-A] [-Xitem] [file&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installdocs is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
       documentation into usr/share/doc/package in package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.docs
           List documentation files to be installed into package.

       debian/copyright
           The copyright file is installed into all packages, unless a more
           specific copyright file is available.

       debian/package.copyright
       debian/package.README.Debian
       debian/package.TODO
           Each of these files is automatically installed if present for a
           package.

       debian/README.Debian
       debian/TODO
           These files are installed into the first binary package listed in
           debian/control.

           Note that README.debian files are also installed as README.Debian,
           and TODO files will be installed as TODO.Debian in non-native
           packages.

       debian/package.doc-base
           Installed as doc-base control files. Note that the doc-id will be
           determined from the Document: entry in the doc-base control file in
           question.

       debian/package.doc-base.*
           If your package needs to register more than one document, you need
           multiple doc-base files, and can name them like this.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           installed. Note that this includes doc-base files.

       --link-doc=package
           Make the documentation directory of all packages acted on be a
           symlink to the documentation directory of package. This has no effect
           when acting on package itself, or if the documentation directory to
           be created already exists when dh_installdocs is run. To comply with
           policy, package must be a binary package that comes from the same
           source package.

           debhelper will try to avoid installing files into linked
           documentation directories that would cause conflicts with the linked
           package. The -A option will have no effect on packages with linked
           documentation directories, and copyright, changelog, README.Debian,
           and TODO files will not be installed.

           (An older method to accomplish the same thing, which is still
           supported, is to make the documentation directory of a package be a
           dangling symlink, before calling dh_installdocs.)

       file ...
           Install these files as documentation into the first package acted on.
           (Or in all packages if -A is specified).

EXAMPLES
       This is an example of a debian/package.docs file:

         README
         TODO
         debian/notes-for-maintainers.txt
         docs/manual.txt
         docs/manual.pdf
         docs/manual-html/

NOTES
       Note that dh_installdocs will happily copy entire directory hierarchies
       if you ask it to (similar to cp -a). If it is asked to install a
       directory, it will install the complete contents of the directory.

       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
