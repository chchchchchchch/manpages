DH_INSTALLEXAMPLES(1)               Debhelper              DH_INSTALLEXAMPLES(1)



NAME
       dh_installexamples - install example files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installexamples [debhelper&#194; options] [-A] [-Xitem] [file&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installexamples is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing examples into usr/share/doc/package/examples in package build
       directories.

FILES
       debian/package.examples
           Lists example files or directories to be installed.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install any files specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           installed.

       file ...
           Install these files (or directories) as examples into the first
           package acted on. (Or into all packages if -A is specified.)

NOTES
       Note that dh_installexamples will happily copy entire directory
       hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to cp -a). If it is asked to
       install a directory, it will install the complete contents of the
       directory.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
