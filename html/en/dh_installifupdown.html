NAME
       dh_installifupdown - install if-up and if-down hooks

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installifupdown [debhelper&#194; options] [--name=name]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installifupdown is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing if-up, if-down, if-pre-up, and if-post-down hook scripts into
       package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.if-up
       debian/package.if-down
       debian/package.if-pre-up
       debian/package.if-post-down
           These files are installed into etc/network/if-*.d/package in the
           package build directory.

OPTIONS
       --name=name
           Look for files named debian/package.name.if-* and install them as
           etc/network/if-*/name, instead of using the usual files and
           installing them as the package name.
