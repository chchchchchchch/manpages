DH_INSTALLINIT(1)                   Debhelper                  DH_INSTALLINIT(1)



NAME
       dh_installinit - install init scripts and/or upstart jobs into package
       build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installinit [debhelper&#194; options] [--name=name] [-n] [-R] [-r] [-d]
       [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installinit is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
       init scripts with associated defaults files, as well as upstart job files
       into package build directories.

       It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm and prerm
       commands needed to set up the symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ to start and stop
       the init scripts.

FILES
       debian/package.init
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/init.d/package in the
           package build directory.

       debian/package.default
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/default/package in the
           package build directory.

       debian/package.upstart
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/init/package.conf in the
           package build directory.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.

       -o, --onlyscripts
           Only modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts, do not actually install
           any init script, default files, or upstart job. May be useful if the
           init script or upstart job is shipped and/or installed by upstream in
           a way that doesn&apos;t make it easy to let dh_installinit find it.

       -R, --restart-after-upgrade
           Do not stop the init script until after the package upgrade has been
           completed. This is different than the default behavior, which stops
           the script in the prerm, and starts it again in the postinst.

           This can be useful for daemons that should not have a possibly long
           downtime during upgrade. But you should make sure that the daemon
           will not get confused by the package being upgraded while it&apos;s
           running before using this option.

       -r, --no-restart-on-upgrade
           Do not stop init script on upgrade.

       --no-start
           Do not start the init script on install or upgrade, or stop it on
           removal.  Only call update-rc.d. Useful for rcS scripts.

       -d, --remove-d
           Remove trailing d from the name of the package, and use the result
           for the filename the upstart job file is installed as in etc/init/ ,
           and for the filename the init script is installed as in etc/init.d
           and the default file is installed as in etc/default/ . This may be
           useful for daemons with names ending in d. (Note: this takes
           precedence over the --init-script parameter described below.)

       -uparams --update-rcd-params=params
       -- params
           Pass params to update-rc.d(8). If not specified, defaults will be
           passed to update-rc.d(8).

       --name=name
           Install the init script (and default file) as well as upstart job
           file using the filename name instead of the default filename, which
           is the package name. When this parameter is used, dh_installinit
           looks for and installs files named debian/package.name.init,
           debian/package.name.default and debian/package.name.upstart instead
           of the usual debian/package.init, debian/package.default and
           debian/package.upstart.

       --init-script=scriptname
           Use scriptname as the filename the init script is installed as in
           etc/init.d/ (and also use it as the filename for the defaults file,
           if it is installed). If you use this parameter, dh_installinit will
           look to see if a file in the debian/ directory exists that looks like
           package.scriptname and if so will install it as the init script in
           preference to the files it normally installs.

           This parameter is deprecated, use the --name parameter instead. This
           parameter is incompatible with the use of upstart jobs.

       --error-handler=function
           Call the named shell function if running the init script fails. The
           function should be provided in the prerm and postinst scripts, before
           the #DEBHELPER# token.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
