NAME
       dh_installmenu - install Debian menu files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installmenu [debhelper&#194; options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installmenu is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
       files used by the Debian menu package into package build directories.

       It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands needed

       into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).

       debian/package.menu-method
           Debian menu method files, installed into etc/menu-methods/package in
           the package build directory.
