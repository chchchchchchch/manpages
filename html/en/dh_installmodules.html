DH_INSTALLMODULES(1)                Debhelper               DH_INSTALLMODULES(1)



NAME
       dh_installmodules - register modules with modutils

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installmodules [debhelper&#194; options] [-n] [--name=name]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installmodules is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       registering kernel modules.

       Kernel modules are searched for in the package build directory and if
       found, preinst, postinst and postrm commands are automatically generated
       to run depmod and register the modules when the package is installed.
       These commands are inserted into the maintainer scripts by
       dh_installdeb(1).

FILES
       debian/package.modprobe
           Installed to etc/modprobe.d/package.conf in the package build
           directory.

       debian/package.modules
           These files were installed for use by modutils, but are now not used
           and dh_installmodules will warn if these files are present.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify preinst/postinst/postrm scripts.

       --name=name
           When this parameter is used, dh_installmodules looks for and installs
           files named debian/package.name.modprobe instead of the usual
           debian/package.modprobe

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
