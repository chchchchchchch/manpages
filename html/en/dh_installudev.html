DH_INSTALLUDEV(1)                   Debhelper                  DH_INSTALLUDEV(1)



NAME
       dh_installudev - install udev rules files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installudev [debhelper&#194; options] [-n] [--name=name]
       [--priority=priority]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installudev is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
       udev rules files.

       Code is added to the preinst and postinst to handle the upgrade from the
       old udev rules file location.

FILES
       debian/package.udev
           Installed into lib/udev/rules.d/ in the package build directory.

OPTIONS
       --name=name
           When this parameter is used, dh_installudev looks for and installs
           files named debian/package.name.udev instead of the usual
           debian/package.udev.

       --priority=priority
           Sets the priority string of the rules.d symlink. Default is 60.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify preinst/postinst scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
