DH_INSTALLWM(1)                     Debhelper                    DH_INSTALLWM(1)



NAME
       dh_installwm - register a window manager

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installwm [debhelper&#194; options] [-n] [--priority=n] [wm&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       the postinst and prerm commands that register a window manager with
       update-alternatives(8). The window manager&apos;s man page is also registered
       as a slave symlink (in v6 mode and up), if it is found in
       usr/share/man/man1/ in the package build directory.

FILES
       debian/package.wm
           List window manager programs to register.

OPTIONS
       --priority=n
           Set the priority of the window manager. Default is 20, which is too
           low for most window managers; see the Debian Policy document for
           instructions on calculating the correct value.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts. Turns this command into a no-
           op.

       wm ...
           Window manager programs to register.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
