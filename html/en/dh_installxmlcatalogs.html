DH_INSTALLXMLCATALOGS(1)            Debhelper           DH_INSTALLXMLCATALOGS(1)



NAME
       dh_installxmlcatalogs - install and register XML catalog files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installxmlcatalogs [debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installxmlcatalogs is a debhelper program that installs and registers
       XML catalog files.  It complies with the Debian XML/SGML policy.

       The file debian/package.xmlcatalogs lists the local XML catalog files to
       be installed per package as well as the XML entities in those local XML
       catalog files that are to be registered in the XML catalog system.

       The local XML catalog file entries in that file should be of the form
       &quot;local;source;dest&quot;, where the verbatim &quot;local&quot; indicates this is an
       entry for a local XML catalog file, &quot;source&quot; indicates where the local
       XML catalog resides in the source tree, and &quot;dest&quot; indicates the
       destination location for the local XML catalog under the package build
       area.  &quot;dest&quot; should start with /usr/share/xml/.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the package XML
       catalog file should be of the form &quot;package;type;id;catalog&quot;, where the
       verbatim &quot;package&quot; indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be
       registered in the package XML catalog file, &quot;type&quot; indicates the XML
       entity type (public, system, uri), &quot;id&quot; indicates the XML entity id, and
       &quot;catalog&quot; indicates the local XML catalog file.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the root XML catalog
       file should be of the form &quot;root;type;id&quot;, where the verbatim &quot;root&quot;
       indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be registered in the root
       XML catalog file, &quot;type&quot; indicates the XML entity type (public, system,
       uri), and &quot;id&quot; indicates the XML entity id.

       If an entry for is to be registered identically in the root catalog and
       the package catalog file, you can use the form
       &quot;root-and-package;type;id;catalog&quot;, where the verbatim &quot;root-and-package&quot;
       indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be registered in both the
       root and package XML catalog files, &quot;type&quot; indicates the XML entity type
       (public, system, uri), &quot;id&quot; indicates the XML entity id, and &quot;catalog&quot;
       indicates the local XML catalog file.

       XML entity types are described in update-xmlcatalog(8).  Using the &quot;root&quot;
       or &quot;package&quot; commands, a type of &quot;public&quot; will general &quot;delegatePublic&quot;
       statements in the applicable catalog file. Generally you will want to use
       the types &quot;public&quot; for any formal public identifiers, and &quot;system&quot; for
       any files on the local filesystem or URLs.  &quot;uri&quot; is only used for non-
       local files which are not part of the external document subset, e.g.,
       they are not used for entities or DTDs.

       dh_installxmlcatalogs automatically adds maintainer script snippets for
       the registration and unregistration of the listed XML entities in the XML
       catalog system (unless -n is used).   A dependency on the xml-core
       package will be added to &quot;${misc:Depends}&quot;, so be sure to use that
       variable in the file debian/control.  See dh_installdeb(1) for an
       explanation of Debhelper maintainer script snippets.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. &quot;dh_clean -k&quot; should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
