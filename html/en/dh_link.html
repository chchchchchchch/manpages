DH_LINK(1)                          Debhelper                         DH_LINK(1)



NAME
       dh_link - create symlinks in package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_link [debhelper&#194; options] [-A] [-Xitem] [source&#194; destination&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_link is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package build
       directories.

       dh_link accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files. The
       source files are the already existing files that will be symlinked from.
       The destination files are the symlinks that will be created. There must
       be an equal number of source and destination files specified.

       Be sure you do specify the full filename to both the source and
       destination files (unlike you would do if you were using something like
       ln(1)).

       dh_link will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy - absolute
       when policy says they should be absolute, and relative links with as
       short a path as possible. It will also create any subdirectories it needs
       to to put the symlinks in.

       Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with symlinks.

       dh_link also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks which do
       not conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or later).

FILES
       debian/package.links
           Lists pairs of source and destination files to be symlinked. Each
           pair should be put on its own line, with the source and destination
           separated by whitespace.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Create any links specified by command line parameters in ALL packages
           acted on, not just the first.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude symlinks that contain item anywhere in their filename from
           being corrected to comply with Debian policy.

       source destination ...
           Create a file named destination as a link to a file named source. Do
           this in the package build directory of the first package acted on.
           (Or in all packages if -A is specified.)

EXAMPLES
        dh_link usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make bar.1 be a symlink to foo.1

        dh_link var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo \
          usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make /usr/lib/foo/ be a link to /var/lib/foo/, and bar.1 be a symlink to
       the foo.1

SEE ALSO
