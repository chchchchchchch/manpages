DH_MAKESHLIBS(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_MAKESHLIBS(1)



NAME
       dh_makeshlibs - automatically create shlibs file and call dpkg-gensymbols

SYNOPSIS
       dh_makeshlibs [debhelper&#194; options] [-mmajor] [-V[dependencies]] [-n]
       [-Xitem] [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_makeshlibs is a debhelper program that automatically scans for shared
       libraries, and generates a shlibs file for the libraries it finds.

       It also adds a call to ldconfig in the postinst and postrm scripts (in v3
       mode and above only) to any packages in which it finds shared libraries.

       Packages that support multiarch are detected, and a Pre-Dependency on
       multiarch-support is set in ${misc:Pre-Depends} ; you should make sure to
       put that token into an appropriate place in your debian/control file for
       packages supporting multiarch.

FILES
       debian/package.symbols
       debian/package.symbols.arch
           These symbols files, if present, are passed to dpkg-gensymbols(1) to
           be processed and installed. Use the arch specific names if you need
           to provide different symbols files for different architectures.

OPTIONS
       -mmajor, --major=major
           Instead of trying to guess the major number of the library with
           objdump, use the major number specified after the -m parameter. This
           is much less useful than it used to be, back in the bad old days when
           this program looked at library filenames rather than using objdump.

       -V, -Vdependencies
       --version-info, --version-info=dependencies
           By default, the shlibs file generated by this program does not make
           packages depend on any particular version of the package containing
           the shared library. It may be necessary for you to add some version
           dependency information to the shlibs file. If -V is specified with no
           dependency information, the current upstream version of the package
           is plugged into a dependency that looks like &quot;packagename (&gt;=
           packageversion)&quot;. Note that in debhelper compatibility levels before
           v4, the Debian part of the package version number is also included.
           If -V is specified with parameters, the parameters can be used to
           specify the exact dependency information needed (be sure to include
           the package name).

           Beware of using -V without any parameters; this is a conservative
           setting that always ensures that other packages&apos; shared library
           dependencies are at least as tight as they need to be (unless your
           library is prone to changing ABI without updating the upstream
           version number), so that if the maintainer screws up then they won&apos;t
           break. The flip side is that packages might end up with dependencies
           that are too tight and so find it harder to be upgraded.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename or
           directory from being treated as shared libraries.
&#12;       --add-udeb=udeb
           Create an additional line for udebs in the shlibs file and use udeb
           as the package name for udebs to depend on instead of the regular
           library package.

       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-gensymbols(1).

EXAMPLES
       dh_makeshlibs
           Assuming this is a package named libfoobar1, generates a shlibs file
           that looks something like:
            libfoobar 1 libfoobar1

       dh_makeshlibs -V
           Assuming the current version of the package is 1.1-3, generates a
           shlibs file that looks something like:
            libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.1)

       dh_makeshlibs -V &apos;libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.0)&apos;
           Generates a shlibs file that looks something like:
             libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.0)
