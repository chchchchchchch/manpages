DH_NATIVEJAVA(1)                    Debhelper                   DH_NATIVEJAVA(1)



NAME
       dh_nativejava - compile jar files to native code and register them

SYNOPSIS
       dh_nativejava [debhelper options] [-n] [-o] [--sourcedir=dir]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_nativejava is a debhelper program that is responsible for compiling
       jars to native code and to make them known to the system.

       It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands needed
       to updated the global classmap database and adds a dependency on libgcj-
       common in the misc:Depends substitution variable.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

       -o, --onlyscripts
           Only modify postinst/postrm scripts, do not actually compile any
           files or register them. May be useful if the files are already built
           and registered.

       --destdir=directory
           Use this if you want the compiled files to be put in a directory
           other than the default of &quot;/usr/lib/gcj&quot;

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. &quot;dh_clean -k&quot; should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
