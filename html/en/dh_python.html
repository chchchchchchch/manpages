DH_PYTHON(1)                        Debhelper                       DH_PYTHON(1)



NAME
       dh_python - calculates Python dependencies and adds postinst and prerm
       Python scripts (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       dh_python [debhelper&#194; options] [-n] [-V version] [module&#194; dirs&#194; ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Note: This program is deprecated. You should use dh_python2 instead.
       This program will do nothing if debian/pycompat or a Python-Version
       control file field exists.

       dh_python is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the
       ${python:Depends} substitutions and adding them to substvars files. It
       will also add a postinst and a prerm script if required.

       The program will look at Python scripts and modules in your package, and
       will use this information to generate a dependency on python, with the
       current major version, or on pythonX.Y if your scripts or modules need a
       specific python version. The dependency will be substituted into your
       package&apos;s control file wherever you place the token ${python:Depends}.

       If some modules need to be byte-compiled at install time, appropriate
       postinst and prerm scripts will be generated. If already byte-compiled
       modules are found, they are removed.

       If you use this program, your package should build-depend on python.

OPTIONS
       module dirs
           If your package installs Python modules in non-standard directories,
           you can make dh_python check those directories by passing their names
           on the command line. By default, it will check /usr/lib/site-python,
           /usr/lib/$PACKAGE, /usr/share/$PACKAGE, /usr/lib/games/$PACKAGE,
           /usr/share/games/$PACKAGE and /usr/lib/python?.?/site-packages.

           Note: only /usr/lib/site-python, /usr/lib/python?.?/site-packages and
           the extra names on the command line are searched for binary (.so)
           modules.

       -V version
           If the .py files your package ships are meant to be used by a
           specific pythonX.Y version, you can use this option to specify the
           desired version, such as 2.3. Do not use if you ship modules in
           /usr/lib/site-python.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.
