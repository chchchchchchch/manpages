DH_PYTHON2()                                                        DH_PYTHON2()



NAME
       dh_python2  -  calculates Python dependencies, adds maintainer scripts to
       byte compile files, etc.

SYNOPSIS
       dh_python2 -p PACKAGE [-V [X.Y][-][A.B]] DIR_OR_FILE [-X REGEXPR]

DESCRIPTION
   QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
       &#183; if necessary, describe supported Python versions  via  X-Python-Version
         field in debian/control,

       &#183; build-depend on python or python-all or python-all-dev (&gt;= 2.6.6-3~),

       &#183; build  module/application  using its standard build system, remember to
         build extensions for all supported Python versions  (loop  over  pyver&#8208;
         sions -vr),

       &#183; install  files  to  the standard locations, add --install-layout=deb to
         setup.py&apos;s install command if your package is using distutils,

       &#183; add python2 to dh&apos;s --with option, or:

       &#183; include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/python-distutils.mk in debian/rules and
         depend on cdbs (&gt;= 0.4.90), or:

       &#183; call dh_python2 in the binary-* target,

       &#183; add ${python:Depends} to Depends

   NOTES
       In order to support more than one Python version in the same binary pack&#8208;
       age, dh_python2 (unlike dh_pycentral and dh_pysupport)  creates  symlinks
       to  all  supported  Python  versions  at  build time. It means binNMU (or
       sourceful  upload  in  case  of  architecture  independent  packages)  is
       required  once a list of supported Python version is changed. It&apos;s faster
       and more robust than its competitors, though.

   dependencies
       dh_python2 tries to translate Python dependencies from requires.txt  file
       to Debian dependencies. Use debian/pydist-overrides or --no-guessing-deps
       option to override it if the guess is incorrect. If you  want  dh_python2
       to  generate more strict dependencies (f.e. to avoid ABI problems) create
       debian/python-foo.pydist                    file.                     See
       /usr/share/doc/python-doc/README.PyDist  (provided by python-doc package)
       for more information. If the pydist file contains PEP386 flag or  set  of
       (uscan like) rules, dh_python2 will make the depedency versioned (version
       requirements are ignored by default).

   namespace feature
       dh_python2 parses Egg&apos;s  namespace_packages.txt  files  (in  addition  to
       --namespace  command  line argument(s)) and drops empty __init__.py files
       from binary package. pycompile will regenerate them at install  time  and
       pyclean  will remove them at uninstall time (if they&apos;re no longer used in
       installed packages). It&apos;s still a good idea to provide  __init__.py  file
       in one of binary packages (even if all other packages use this feature).

   private dirs
       /usr/share/foo, /usr/share/games/foo, /usr/lib/foo and /usr/lib/games/foo
       private directories are scanned for Python files by default (where foo is
       binary  package  name).  If your package is shipping Python files in some
       other directory, add another dh_python2 call in debian/rules with  direc&#8208;
       tory  name  as an argument - you can use different set of options in this
       call. If you need to change options (f.e. a list of supported Python ver&#8208;
       sions)  for  a  private  directory  that  is  checked  by default, invoke
       dh_python2 with --skip-private option and add another call with a path to
       this directory and new options.

   debug packages
       In   binary   packages   which   name   ends  with  -dbg,  all  files  in
       /usr/lib/python2.X/{site,dist}-packages/ directory that  have  extensions
       different  than  so  or  h are removed by default.  Use --no-dbg-cleaning
       option to disable this feature.

   pyinstall files
       Files listed in debian/pkg.pyinstall file will  be  installed  as  public
       modules  for all requested Python versions (dh_install doesn&apos;t know about
       python&apos;s site- vs. dist-packages issue).

       Syntax: path/to/file [VERSION_RANGE] [NAMESPACE]

       debian directory is automatically removed from the path, so you can place
       your  files  in debian/ directory and install them from this location (if
       you want to install them in &quot;debian&quot; namespace, set NAMESPACE to debian).
       If NAMESPACE is set, all listed files will be installed in .../dist-pack&#8208;
       ages/NAMESPACE/ directory.

       Examples:

       &#183; foo.py installs .../dist-packages/foo.py for all supported Python  ver&#8208;
         sions

       &#183; foo/bar.py  2.6-  installs .../dist-packages/foo/bar.py for versions &gt;=
         2.6

       &#183; foo/bar.py spam installs .../dist-packages/spam/bar.py

       &#183; debian/*.py    spam.egg    2.5    installs     .../python2.5/site-pack&#8208;
         ages/spam/egg/*.py files

   pyremove files
       If you want to remove some files installed by build system (from all sup&#8208;
       ported Python versions or only from a subset of these versions), add them
       to debian/pkg.pyremove file.

       Examples:

       &#183; *.pth removes .pth files from .../dist-packages/

       &#183; bar/baz.py 2.5 removes .../python2.5/site-packages/bar/baz.py

   overriding supported / default Python versions
       If you want to override system&apos;s list of supported Python versions or the
       default one (f.e. to build a package that  includes  symlinks  for  older
       version  of  Python  or compile .py files only for given interpreter ver&#8208;
       sion), you can do that via DEBPYTHON_SUPPORTED  and/or  DEBPYTHON_DEFAULT
       env. variables.

       Example:  2.5,2.7  limits the list of supported Python versions to Python
       2.5 and Python 2.7.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program&apos;s version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show help message and exit
&#12;       --no-guessing-versions
              disable guessing other supported Python versions

       --no-guessing-deps
              disable guessing dependencies

       --no-dbg-cleaning
              do not remove any files from debug packages

       --no-shebang-rewrite
              do not rewrite shebangs

       --skip-private
              don&apos;t check private directories

       -v, --verbose
              turn verbose mode on

       -i, --indep
              act on architecture independent packages

       -a, --arch
              act on architecture dependent packages

       -q, --quiet
              be quiet

       -p PACKAGE, --package=PACKAGE
              act on the package named PACKAGE

       -N NO_PACKAGE, --no-package=NO_PACKAGE
              do not act on the specified package

       -V VRANGE
              specify list of supported Python versions.  See  pycompile(1)  for
              examples

       -X REGEXPR, --exclude=REGEXPR
              exclude  items  that  match given REGEXPR. You may use this option
              multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.

       --compile-all
              compile all files from given private directory  in  postinst/rtup&#8208;
              date  not  just the ones provided by the package (i.e. do not pass
              the --package parameter to pycompile/pyclean)

       --depends=DEPENDS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them
              to ${python:Depends}. Use it for missing items in requires.txt

       --recommends=RECOMMENDS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them
              to ${python:Recommends}

       --suggests=SUGGESTS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them
              to ${python:Suggests}

       --namespace

              ages.txt is not complete

       --ignore-namespace
              ignore Egg&apos;s namespace declaration and  --namespace  option.  This
              option  will  disable  removing  (and  recreating at install time)
              empty  __init__.py  files.  Removing  namespace_packages.txt  from
              egg-info directory has the same effect.

       --clean-pycentral
              generate maintainer script that will remove byte code generated by
              python-central helper

       --shebang=COMMAND
              use given command as shebang in scripts

       --ignore-shebangs
              do not translate shebangs into Debian dependencies
