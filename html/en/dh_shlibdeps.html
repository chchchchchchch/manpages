DH_SHLIBDEPS(1)                     Debhelper                    DH_SHLIBDEPS(1)



NAME
       dh_shlibdeps - calculate shared library dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       dh_shlibdeps [debhelper&#194; options] [-Lpackage] [-ldirectory] [-Xitem]
       [--&#194; params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that is responsible for calculating
       shared library dependencies for packages.

       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-shlibdeps(1) that calls it
       once for each package listed in the control file, passing it a list of
       ELF executables and shared libraries it has found.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           passed to dpkg-shlibdeps. This will make their dependencies be
           ignored.  This may be useful in some situations, but use it with
           caution. This option may be used more than once to exclude more than
           one thing.

       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).

       -uparams, --dpkg-shlibdeps-params=params
           This is another way to pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).  It is
           deprecated; use -- instead.

       -ldirectory[:directory ...]
           With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is generally not
           needed.

           Before dpkg-shlibdeps is run, LD_LIBRARY_PATH will have added to it
           the specified directory (or directories -- separate with colons).
           With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this is mostly only useful
           for packages that build multiple flavors of the same library, or
           other situations where the library is installed into a directory not
           on the regular library search path.

       -Lpackage, --libpackage=package
           With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is generally not
           needed, unless your package builds multiple flavors of the same
           library.

           It tells dpkg-shlibdeps (via its -S parameter) to look first in the
           package build directory for the specified package, when searching for
           libraries, symbol files, and shlibs files.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose that your source package produces libfoo1, libfoo-dev, and
       libfoo-bin binary packages. libfoo-bin links against libfoo1, and should
       depend on it. In your rules file, first run dh_makeshlibs, then
       dh_shlibdeps:

               dh_makeshlibs
               dh_shlibdeps

       This will have the effect of generating automatically a shlibs file for
       libfoo1, and using that file and the libfoo1 library in the
       debian/libfoo1/usr/lib directory to calculate shared library dependency
       information.

       If a libbar1 package is also produced, that is an alternate build of
       libfoo, and is installed into /usr/lib/bar/, you can make libfoo-bin
       depend on libbar1 as follows:

               dh_shlibdeps -Llibbar1 -l/usr/lib/bar
