DH_STRIP(1)                         Debhelper                        DH_STRIP(1)



NAME
       dh_strip - strip executables, shared libraries, and some static libraries

SYNOPSIS
       dh_strip [debhelper&#194; options] [-Xitem] [--dbg-package=package]
       [--keep-debug]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_strip is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping
       executables, shared libraries, and static libraries that are not used for
       debugging.

       This program examines your package build directories and works out what
       to strip on its own. It uses file(1) and file permissions and filenames
       to figure out what files are shared libraries (*.so), executable
       binaries, and static (lib*.a) and debugging libraries (lib*_g.a,
       debug/*.so), and strips each as much as is possible. (Which is not at all
       for debugging libraries.) In general it seems to make very good guesses,
       and will do the right thing in almost all cases.

       Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a module, and
       hard to determine how to strip a module, dh_strip does not currently deal
       with stripping binary modules such as .o files.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being
           stripped. You may use this option multiple times to build up a list
           of things to exclude.

       --dbg-package=package
           Causes dh_strip to save debug symbols stripped from the packages it
           acts on as independent files in the package build directory of the
           specified debugging package.

           For example, if your packages are libfoo and foo and you want to
           include a foo-dbg package with debugging symbols, use dh_strip
           --dbg-package=foo-dbg.

           Note that this option behaves significantly different in debhelper
           compatibility levels 4 and below. Instead of specifying the name of a
           debug package to put symbols in, it specifies a package (or packages)
           which should have separated debug symbols, and the separated symbols
           are placed in packages with -dbg added to their name.

       -k, --keep-debug
           Debug symbols will be retained, but split into an independent file in
           usr/lib/debug/ in the package build directory. --dbg-package is
           easier to use than this option, but this option is more flexible.

NOTES
       If the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable contains nostrip, nothing
       will be stripped, in accordance with Debian policy (section 10.1
       &quot;Binaries&quot;).

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 3.0.1
