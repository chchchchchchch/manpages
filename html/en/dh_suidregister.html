DH_SUIDREGISTER(1)                  Debhelper                 DH_SUIDREGISTER(1)



NAME
       dh_suidregister - suid registration program (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       Do not run!

DESCRIPTION
       This program used to register suid and sgid files with suidregister(1),
       but with the introduction of dpkg-statoverride(8), registration of files
       in this way is unnecessary, and even harmful, so this program is
       deprecated and should not be used.

CONVERTING TO STATOVERRIDE
       Converting a package that uses this program to use the new statoverride
       mechanism is easy. Just remove the call to dh_suidregister from
       debian/rules, and add a versioned conflicts into your control file, as
       follows:

         Conflicts: suidmanager (&lt;&lt; 0.50)

       The conflicts is only necessary if your package used to register things
       with suidmanager; if it did not, you can just remove the call to this
       program from your rules file.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
