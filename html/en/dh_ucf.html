DH_UCF(1)                           Debhelper                          DH_UCF(1)



NAME
       dh_ucf - register configuration files with ucf

SYNOPSIS
       dh_ucf [debhelper&#194; options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_ucf is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the
       postinst and postrm commands that register files with ucf(1) and ucfr(1).

FILES
       debian/package.ucf
           List pairs of source and destination files to register with ucf. Each
           pair should be put on its own line, with the source and destination
           separated by whitespace. Both source and destination must be absolute
           paths. The source should be a file that is provided by your package,
           typically in /usr/share/, while the destination is typically a file
           in /etc/.

           A dependency on ucf will be generated in ${misc:Depends}.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts. Turns this command into a no-
           op.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
