DH_USRLOCAL(1)                      Debhelper                     DH_USRLOCAL(1)



NAME
       dh_usrlocal - migrate usr/local directories to maintainer scripts

SYNOPSIS
       dh_usrlocal [debhelper&#194; options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_usrlocal is a debhelper program that can be used for building packages
       that will provide a subdirectory in /usr/local when installed.

       It finds subdirectories of usr/local in the package build directory, and
       removes them, replacing them with maintainer script snippets (unless -n
       is used) to create the directories at install time, and remove them when
       the package is removed, in a manner compliant with Debian policy. These
       snippets are inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See
       dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of debhelper maintainer script
       snippets.

       If the directories found in the build tree have unusual owners, groups,
       or permissions, then those values will be preserved in the directories
       made by the postinst script. However, as a special exception, if a
       directory is owned by root.root, it will be treated as if it is owned by
       root.staff and is mode 2775. This is useful, since that is the group and
       mode policy recommends for directories in /usr/local.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
       between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
       instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 2.2
