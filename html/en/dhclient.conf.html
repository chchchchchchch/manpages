dhclient.conf(5)                                                dhclient.conf(5)



NAME
       dhclient.conf - DHCP client configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  dhclient.conf  file contains configuration information for dhclient,
       the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client.

       The dhclient.conf file is a free-form ASCII text file.   It is parsed  by
       the  recursive-descent parser built into dhclient.   The file may contain
       extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords  in  the  file
       are  case-insensitive.    Comments may be placed anywhere within the file
       (except within quotes).   Comments begin with the # character and end  at
       the end of the line.

       The  dhclient.conf  file  can  be  used to configure the behaviour of the
       client in a wide variety of ways: protocol timing, information  requested
       from  the  server, information required of the server, defaults to use if
       the server does not provide certain information,  values  with  which  to
       override  information  provided  by  the  server, or values to prepend or
       append to information provided by the server.  The configuration file can
       also  be preinitialized with addresses to use on networks that don&apos;t have
       DHCP servers.

PROTOCOL TIMING
       The timing behaviour of the client need not be configured  by  the  user.
       If  no  timing configuration is provided by the user, a fairly reasonable
       timing behaviour will be used by default - one which  results  in  fairly
       timely updates without placing an inordinate load on the server.

       The  following  statements  can be used to adjust the timing behaviour of
       the DHCP client if required, however:

       The timeout statement

       timeout time ;

       The timeout statement determines  the  amount  of  time  that  must  pass
       between  the  time that the client begins to try to determine its address
       and the time that it decides that it&apos;s not going to be able to contact  a
       server.    By default, this timeout is sixty seconds.   After the timeout
       has passed, if there are any static leases defined in  the  configuration
       file,  or  any  leases  remaining in the lease database that have not yet
       expired, the client will loop through these leases attempting to validate
       them,  and  if  it  finds  one that appears to be valid, it will use that
       lease&apos;s address.   If there are  no  valid  static  leases  or  unexpired
       leases  in the lease database, the client will restart the protocol after
       the defined retry interval.

       The retry statement

        retry time;

       The retry statement determines the time that must pass after  the  client
       has determined that there is no DHCP server present before it tries again
       to contact a DHCP server.   By default, this is five minutes.

       The select-timeout statement

        select-timeout time;

       It is possible (some might say desirable) for there to be more  than  one
       DHCP  server  serving  any  given network.   In this case, it is possible
       that a client may be sent more than one offer in response to its  initial
       lease  discovery message.   It may be that one of these offers is prefer&#8208;
       able to the other (e.g., one offer may have the address the client previ&#8208;
       ously used, and the other may not).

       The  select-timeout  is  the  time after the client sends its first lease
       discovery request at which it stops  waiting  for  offers  from  servers,
       assuming  that  it  has  received at least one such offer.   If no offers
       have been received by the time the select-timeout has expired, the client
       will accept the first offer that arrives.

       By default, the select-timeout is zero seconds - that is, the client will
       take the first offer it sees.

       The reboot statement

        reboot time;

       When the client is restarted,  it  first  tries  to  reacquire  the  last
       address  it had.   This is called the INIT-REBOOT state.   If it is still
       attached to the same network it was attached to when it last ran, this is
       the  quickest  way  to  get started.   The reboot statement sets the time
       that must elapse after the  client  first  tries  to  reacquire  its  old
       address  before  it  gives  up  and tries to discover a new address.   By
       default, the reboot timeout is ten seconds.

       The backoff-cutoff statement

        backoff-cutoff time;

       The client uses an exponential backoff algorithm with some randomness, so
       that  if  many clients try to configure themselves at the same time, they
       will not make their requests in lockstep.   The backoff-cutoff  statement
       determines  the maximum amount of time that the client is allowed to back
       off, the actual value will be evaluated randomly between  1/2  to  1  1/2
       times the time specified.   It defaults to two minutes.

       The initial-interval statement

        initial-interval time;

       The  initial-interval statement sets the amount of time between the first
       attempt to reach a server and the second attempt to reach a server.  Each
       time  a  message is sent, the interval between messages is incremented by
       twice the current interval multiplied by a random number between zero and
       one.   If it is greater than the backoff-cutoff amount, it is set to that
       amount.  It defaults to ten seconds.

       The initial-delay statement

        initial-delay time;

       initial-delay parameter sets the maximum time client can wait after start
       before  commencing  first  transmission.   According  to  RFC2131 Section
       4.4.1, client should wait a random time between startup  and  the  actual
       first  transmission.  Previous  versions  of ISC DHCP client used to wait
       random time up to 5 seconds, but that  was  unwanted  due  to  impact  on
       startup time. As such, new versions have the default initial delay set to
       0. To restore old behavior, please set initial-delay to 5.

LEASE REQUIREMENTS AND REQUESTS
       The DHCP protocol allows the client to request that the  server  send  it
       specific  information,  and  not send it other information that it is not
       prepared to accept.   The protocol  also  allows  the  client  to  reject
       offers  from  servers if they don&apos;t contain information the client needs,
       or if the information provided is not satisfactory.

       There is a variety of data contained in offers that DHCP servers send  to
       DHCP  clients.   The  data that can be specifically requested is what are
       called DHCP Options.  DHCP Options are defined in
        dhcp-options(5).

       The request statement

        [ also ] request [ [ option-space . ] option ] [, ... ];

       The request statement causes  the  client  to  request  that  any  server
       responding  to  the  client  send the client its values for the specified
       options.   Only the option names  should  be  specified  in  the  request
       statement  -  not  option  parameters.    By  default,  the DHCPv4 client
       requests  the  subnet-mask,  broadcast-address,   time-offset,   routers,
       domain-name,  domain-name-servers  and host-name options while the DHCPv6
       client requests the dhcp6 name-servers and domain-search  options.   Note
       that if you enter a &#180;request&#180; statement, you over-ride these defaults and
       these options will not be requested.

       In some cases, it may be desirable to send no parameter request  list  at
       all.    To  do  this,  simply  write the request statement but specify no
       parameters:

            request;

       In most cases, it is desirable to simply add one option  to  the  request
       list which is of interest to the client in question.  In this case, it is
       best to &#180;also request&#180; the additional options:

            also request domain-search, dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses;

       The require statement

        [ also ] require [ [ option-space . ] option ] [, ... ];

       The require statement lists options that must be sent  in  order  for  an
       offer to be accepted.   Offers that do not contain all the listed options
       will be ignored.  There is no default require list.

            require name-servers;

            interface eth0 {
                 also require domain-search;
            }

       The
       send
       statement

        send { [ option declaration ]
       [, ... option declaration ]}

       The send statement causes the client to send the specified options to
       the server with the specified values.  These are full option
       declarations as described in dhcp-options(5).  Options that are
       always sent in the DHCP protocol should not be specified here, except
       that the client can specify a requested dhcp-lease-time option other
       than the default requested lease time, which is two hours.  The other
       obvious use for this statement is to send information to the server
       that will allow it to differentiate between this client and other
       clients or kinds of clients.

DYNAMIC DNS
       The client now has some very limited support for doing DNS updates when a
       lease  is  acquired.   This is prototypical, and probably doesn&apos;t do what
       you want.   It also only works if you happen to have  control  over  your
       DNS server, which isn&apos;t very likely.

       Note that everything in this section is true whether you are using DHCPv4
       or DHCPv6.  The exact same syntax is used for both.

       To make it work, you have to declare a key and zone as in the DHCP server
       (see  dhcpd.conf(5)  for  details).   You also need to configure the fqdn
       option on the client, as follows:

         send fqdn.fqdn &quot;grosse.fugue.com.&quot;;
         send fqdn.encoded on;
         send fqdn.server-update off;
         also request fqdn, dhcp6.fqdn;

       The fqdn.fqdn option MUST be a fully-qualified domain  name.    You  MUST
       define  a  zone  statement for the zone to be updated.   The fqdn.encoded
       option may need to be set to on or off, depending on the DHCP server  you
       are using.

       The do-forward-updates statement

        do-forward-updates [ flag ] ;

       If  you  want  to do DNS updates in the DHCP client script (see dhclient-
       script(8)) rather than having the DHCP client do the update directly (for
       example, if you want to use SIG(0) authentication, which is not supported
       directly by the DHCP client, you can instruct the client not  to  do  the
       update  using  the do-forward-updates statement.   Flag should be true if
       you want the DHCP client to do the update, and false if  you  don&apos;t  want
       the  DHCP  client to do the update.   By default, the DHCP client will do
       the DNS update.

OPTION MODIFIERS
       In some cases, a client may receive option data from the server which  is
       not  really  appropriate  for that client, or may not receive information
       that it needs, and for which a useful default value exists.   It may also
       receive  information  which is useful, but which needs to be supplemented
       with local information.   To handle these needs, several option modifiers
       are available.

       The default statement

        default [ option declaration ] ;

       If  for  some  option  the  client  should  use the value supplied by the
       server, but needs to use some default value if no value was  supplied  by
       the server, these values can be defined in the default statement.

       The supersede statement

        supersede [ option declaration ] ;

       If  for  some  option  the  client should always use a locally-configured
       value or values rather than whatever is supplied  by  the  server,  these
       values can be defined in the supersede statement.

       The prepend statement

        prepend [ option declaration ] ;

       If  for some set of options the client should use a value you supply, and
       then use the values supplied by the server, if any, these values  can  be
       defined  in  the  prepend  statement.   The prepend statement can only be
       used for options which allow more than one  value  to  be  given.    This
       restriction  is  not  enforced  - if you ignore it, the behaviour will be
       unpredictable.

       The append statement

        append [ option declaration ] ;

       If for some set of options the client should first use  the  values  sup&#8208;
       plied by the server, if any, and then use values you supply, these values
       can be defined in the append statement.   The append statement  can  only
       be  used  for options which allow more than one value to be given.   This
       restriction is not enforced - if you ignore it,  the  behaviour  will  be
       unpredictable.

LEASE DECLARATIONS
       The lease declaration

        lease { lease-declaration [ ... lease-declaration ] }

       The  DHCP  client may decide after some period of time (see PROTOCOL TIM&#8208;
       ING) that it is not going to succeed in contacting a  server.    At  that
       time,  it consults its own database of old leases and tests each one that
       has not yet timed out by pinging the listed router for that lease to  see
       if  that  lease  could work.   It is possible to define one or more fixed
       leases in the client configuration file for networks where  there  is  no
       DHCP or BOOTP service, so that the client can still automatically config&#8208;
       ure its address.   This is done with the lease statement.

       NOTE: the lease statement is also used in  the  dhclient.leases  file  in
       order  to  record leases that have been received from DHCP servers.  Some
       of the syntax for leases  as  described  below  is  only  needed  in  the
       dhclient.leases file.   Such syntax is documented here for completeness.

       A lease statement consists of the lease keyword, followed by a left curly
       brace, followed by one or more lease declaration statements, followed  by
       a right curly brace.   The following lease declarations are possible:

        bootp;

       The bootp statement is used to indicate that the lease was acquired using
       the BOOTP protocol rather than the DHCP protocol.   It is never necessary
       to  specify this in the client configuration file.   The client uses this
       syntax in its lease database file.

        interface &quot;string&quot;;

       The interface lease statement is used to indicate the interface on  which
       the lease is valid.   If set, this lease will only be tried on a particu&#8208;
       lar interface.   When the client receives  a  lease  from  a  server,  it
       always  records the interface number on which it received that lease.  If
       predefined leases are specified in the dhclient.conf file, the  interface
       should also be specified, although this is not required.

        fixed-address ip-address;

       The fixed-address statement is used to set the ip address of a particular
       lease.   This is required for all lease statements.   The IP address must
       be specified as a dotted quad (e.g., 12.34.56.78).

        filename &quot;string&quot;;

       The  filename  statement  specifies the name of the boot filename to use.
       This is not used by the standard  client  configuration  script,  but  is
       included for completeness.

        server-name &quot;string&quot;;
&#12;       The  server-name  statement specifies the name of the boot server name to
       use.   This is also not used by the standard client configuration script.

        option option-declaration;

       The option statement is used to specify the value of an  option  supplied
       by  the  server,  or,  in  the  case  of  predefined  leases  declared in
       dhclient.conf, the value that the user wishes  the  client  configuration
       script to use if the predefined lease is used.

        script &quot;script-name&quot;;

       The  script  statement is used to specify the pathname of the dhcp client
       configuration script.  This script is used by the dhcp client to set each
       interface&apos;s initial configuration prior to requesting an address, to test
       the address once it has been offered, and to set  the  interface&apos;s  final
       configuration  once a lease has been acquired.   If no lease is acquired,
       the script is used to test predefined leases, if  any,  and  also  called
       once  if  no  valid  lease can be identified.   For more information, see
       dhclient-script(8).

        vendor option space &quot;name&quot;;

       The vendor option space statement is used to specify which  option  space
       should  be used for decoding the vendor-encapsulate-options option if one
       is received.  The dhcp-vendor-identifier can be used to  request  a  spe&#8208;
       cific  class of vendor options from the server.   See dhcp-options(5) for
       details.

        medium &quot;media setup&quot;;

       The medium statement can be used on systems where network interfaces can&#8208;
       not  automatically  determine  the type of network to which they are con&#8208;
       nected.  The media setup string is a system-dependent parameter which  is
       passed  to  the  dhcp  client  configuration script when initializing the
       interface.  On Unix and Unix-like systems, the argument is passed on  the
       ifconfig command line when configuring the interface.

       The  dhcp client automatically declares this parameter if it uses a media
       type (see the media statement) when configuring the interface in order to
       obtain  a lease.  This statement should be used in predefined leases only
       if the network interface requires media type configuration.

        renew date;

        rebind date;

        expire date;

       The renew statement defines the time at  which  the  dhcp  client  should
       begin  trying  to  contact  its server to renew a lease that it is using.
       The rebind statement defines the time at which  the  dhcp  client  should
       begin  to  try  to  contact  any dhcp server in order to renew its lease.
       The expire statement defines the time at which the dhcp client must  stop
       using  a  lease  if  it has not been able to contact a server in order to
       renew it.

       These declarations are automatically set in leases acquired by  the  DHCP
       client,  but  must also be configured in predefined leases - a predefined
       lease whose expiry time has passed will not be used by the DHCP client.

       Dates are specified in one of two ways.  The software will  output  times
       in  these  two  formats  depending on if the db-time-format configuration
       parameter has been set to default or local.

       If it is set to default, then date values appear as follows:

        &lt;weekday&gt; &lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt;

       The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to tell when  a  lease
       expires  -  it&apos;s  specified as a number from zero to six, with zero being
       Sunday.  When declaring a predefined lease, it can always be specified as
       zero.   The year is specified with the century, so it should generally be
       four digits except for really long leases.  The month is specified  as  a
       number  starting  with  1  for January.  The day of the month is likewise
       specified starting with 1.  The hour is a number between 0  and  23,  the
       minute  a number between 0 and 59, and the second also a number between 0
       and 59.

       If the db-time-format configuration was set to local, then the date  val&#8208;
       ues appear as follows:

        epoch  &lt;seconds-since-epoch&gt;;  #  &lt;day-name&gt;  &lt;month-name&gt;  &lt;day-number&gt;
       &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt; &lt;year&gt;

       The seconds-since-epoch is as  according  to  the  system&apos;s  local  clock
       (often referred to as &quot;unix time&quot;).  The # symbol supplies a comment that
       describes what actual time this is as according to the  system&apos;s  config&#8208;
       ured  timezone,  at  the time the value was written.  It is provided only
       for human inspection, the epoch time is the only  recommended  value  for
       machine inspection.

       Note  that  when  defining a static lease, one may use either time format
       one wishes, and need not include the comment or values after it.

       If the time is infinite in duration, then the date is never instead of an
       actual date.

ALIAS DECLARATIONS
        alias {  declarations ... }

       Some  DHCP  clients  running TCP/IP roaming protocols may require that in
       addition to the lease they may acquire via DHCP, their interface also  be
       configured  with  a predefined IP alias so that they can have a permanent
       IP address even while roaming.   The  Internet  Systems  Consortium  DHCP
       client  doesn&apos;t  support  roaming  with  fixed addresses directly, but in
       order to facilitate such experimentation, the dhcp client can be  set  up
       to configure an IP alias using the alias declaration.

       The  alias declaration resembles a lease declaration, except that options
       other than the subnet-mask option are ignored by the standard client con&#8208;
       figuration  script, and expiry times are ignored.  A typical alias decla&#8208;
       ration includes an interface declaration, a fixed-address declaration for
       the  IP  alias  address, and a subnet-mask option declaration.   A medium
       statement should never be included in an alias declaration.

OTHER DECLARATIONS
        db-time-format [ default | local ] ;

       The db-time-format option determines which of two output methods are used
       for printing times in leases files.  The default format provides day-and-
       time in UTC, whereas local uses a seconds-since-epoch to store  the  time
       value,  and  helpfully  places  a local timezone time in a comment on the
       same line.  The formats are described in detail in this manpage,  whithin
       the LEASE DECLARATIONS section.

        reject cidr-ip-address [, ... cidr-ip-address ] ;

       The reject statement causes the DHCP client to reject offers from servers
       whose server identifier matches any of the specified  hosts  or  subnets.
       This can be used to avoid being configured by rogue or misconfigured dhcp
       servers, although it should be a last resort - better to track  down  the
       bad DHCP server and fix it.

       The  cidr-ip-address  configuration  type is of the form ip-address[/pre&#8208;
       fixlen], where ip-address is a dotted quad IP address, and  prefixlen  is
       the  CIDR prefix length of the subnet, counting the number of significant
       bits in the netmask starting from the leftmost end.   Example  configura&#8208;
       tion syntax:

       reject 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.5;

       The  above  example  would cause offers from any server identifier in the
       entire RFC 1918 &quot;Class C&quot; network 192.168.0.0/16, or the specific  single
       address 10.0.0.5, to be rejected.

        interface &quot;name&quot; { declarations ...  }

       A  client  with more than one network interface may require different be&#8208;
       haviour depending on which interface is being  configured.    All  timing
       parameters  and  declarations other than lease and alias declarations can
       be enclosed in an interface declaration, and those parameters  will  then
       be  used only for the interface that matches the specified name.   Inter&#8208;
       faces for which there is no interface declaration will use the parameters
       declared outside of any interface declaration, or the default settings.

       Note  well:  ISC dhclient only maintains one list of interfaces, which is
       either determined at startup from command line arguments, or otherwise is
       autodetected.   If  you  supplied  the  list of interfaces on the command
       line, this configuration clause will add the named interface to the  list
       in such a way that will cause it to be configured by DHCP.  Which may not
       be the result you had intended.  This is an undesirable side effect  that
       will be addressed in a future release.

        pseudo &quot;name&quot; &quot;real-name&quot; { declarations ...  }

       Under  some  circumstances it can be useful to declare a pseudo-interface
       and have the DHCP client acquire  a  configuration  for  that  interface.
       Each  interface  that  the  DHCP client is supporting normally has a DHCP
       client state machine running on it to acquire and maintain its lease.   A
       pseudo-interface  is  just another state machine running on the interface
       named real-name, with its own lease and its own state.   If you use  this
       feature,  you must provide a client identifier for both the pseudo-inter&#8208;
       face and the actual interface, and the two identifiers must be different.
       You  must  also provide a separate client script for the pseudo-interface
       to do what you want with the IP address.   For example:

            interface &quot;ep0&quot; {
                 send dhcp-client-identifier &quot;my-client-ep0&quot;;
            }
            pseudo &quot;secondary&quot; &quot;ep0&quot; {
                 send dhcp-client-identifier &quot;my-client-ep0-secondary&quot;;
                 script &quot;/etc/dhclient-secondary&quot;;
            }

       The client script for  the  pseudo-interface  should  not  configure  the
       interface up or down - essentially, all it needs to handle are the states
       where a lease has been acquired or renewed, and the states where a  lease
       has expired.   See dhclient-script(8) for more information.

        media &quot;media setup&quot; [ , &quot;media setup&quot;, ... ];

       The  media  statement  defines one or more media configuration parameters
       which may be tried while attempting to acquire an IP address.   The  dhcp
       client  will cycle through each media setup string on the list, configur&#8208;
       ing the interface using that setup and attempting to boot, and then  try&#8208;
       ing  the next one.   This can be used for network interfaces which aren&apos;t
       capable of sensing the media type unaided - whichever media type succeeds
       in  getting  a  request  to  the server and hearing the reply is probably
       right (no guarantees).

       The media setup is only used for the initial phase of address acquisition
       (the  DHCPDISCOVER  and  DHCPOFFER  packets).    Once an address has been
       acquired, the dhcp client will record it in its lease database  and  will
       record  the  media type used to acquire the address.  Whenever the client
       tries to renew the lease, it will use that same media type.    The  lease
       must  expire  before  the  client  will  go back to cycling through media
       types.

        hardware link-type mac-address;

       The hardware statement defines the hardware MAC address to use  for  this
       interface,  for DHCP servers or relays to direct their replies.  dhclient
       will determine the interface&apos;s MAC address automatically, so use of  this
       parameter  is  not  recommended.  The link-type corresponds to the inter&#8208;
       face&apos;s link layer type (example: &#180;ethernet&#180;), while the mac-address is  a
       string of colon-separated hexadecimal values for octets.

        anycast-mac link-type mac-address;

       The  anycast-mac  statement over-rides the all-ones broadcast MAC address
       dhclient will use when it is transmitting packets to the all-ones limited
       broadcast IPv4 address.  This configuration parameter is useful to reduce
       the number of broadcast packets transmitted by DHCP clients, but is  only
       useful  if you know the DHCP service(s) anycast MAC address prior to con&#8208;
       figuring your client.  The link-type and mac-address parameters are  con&#8208;
       figured in a similar manner to the hardware statement.

SAMPLE
       The  following configuration file is used on a laptop running NetBSD 1.3.
       The laptop has an IP alias of 192.5.5.213, and has one interface, ep0  (a
       3com  3C589C).    Booting intervals have been shortened somewhat from the
       default, because the client is known to spend most of its  time  on  net&#8208;
       works  with little DHCP activity.   The laptop does roam to multiple net&#8208;
       works.


       timeout 60;
       retry 60;
       reboot 10;
       select-timeout 5;
       initial-interval 2;
       reject 192.33.137.209;

       interface &quot;ep0&quot; {
           send host-name &quot;andare.fugue.com&quot;;
           hardware ethernet 00:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
           send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
           send dhcp-lease-time 3600;
           supersede domain-search &quot;fugue.com&quot;, &quot;rc.vix.com&quot;, &quot;home.vix.com&quot;;
           prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
           request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
                domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name;
           require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;
           script &quot;CLIENTBINDIR/dhclient-script&quot;;
           media &quot;media 10baseT/UTP&quot;, &quot;media 10base2/BNC&quot;;
       }

       alias {
         interface &quot;ep0&quot;;
         fixed-address 192.5.5.213;
         option subnet-mask 255.255.255.255;
       }
       This is a very complicated dhclient.conf file - in general, yours  should
       be much simpler.   In many cases, it&apos;s sufficient to just create an empty
       dhclient.conf file - the defaults are usually fine.
