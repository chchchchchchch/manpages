NAME
       dhclient.leases - DHCP client lease database

DESCRIPTION
       The  Internet  Systems Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent database
       of leases that it has acquired that are still valid.   The database is  a
       free-form  ASCII  file  containing  one valid declaration per lease.   If
       more than one declaration appears for a given lease, the last one in  the
       file  is  used.   The file is written as a log, so this is not an unusual
       occurrence.

       The format of the lease declarations is described in dhclient.conf(5).

FILES
       DBDIR/dhclient.leases
