       &#8220;___&#8221;, and an extension of &#8220;.patch&#8221;.

       debian/
       debian/patches/
              Patches    are    extracted   to   one   of   these   directories.
              &#8220;debian/patches/&#8221; is preferred, if it exists.  If  DEB_PATCHES  is
              present  in  the  environment, it will override this behavior (see
              &#8220;ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES&#8221; section below).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

              When defined and points to  an  existing  directory,  patches  are
              extracted   in   that   directory  and  not  under  &#8220;debian/&#8221;  nor
              &#8220;debian/patches/&#8221;.
