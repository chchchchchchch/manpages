NAME
       diffindex-download - Download utility for Debian Contents files

SYNOPSIS
       diffindex-download [ options ] URL filename


DESCRIPTION
       diffindex-download is a command line tool for downloading Contents files.
       It uses APT&apos;s diff/Index format patches when available to avoid download&#8208;
       ing the full file.  diffindex-download is used by apt-file.

OPTIONS
          -n number
              If more than number patches would be necessary, download the whole
              file. Specifying 0 to always download the whole file is possible.

          -k  Don&apos;t verify the peer certificate when using https.

          -c cacert
              If cacert is a directory: Use cacert as CA certificate path.  Oth&#8208;
              erwise  use  cacert as CA certificate bundle. See the --capath and
              --cacert options in the curl(1) man page.

          -i  Don&apos;t exit with errror if the URL does not exist. This  is  useful
              as some archives don&apos;t provide Contents files.

          -q  Be  quiet  (opposite of -v). The default if stdout is not a termi&#8208;
              nal.
