DIFFINDEX-RRED(1)                                              DIFFINDEX-RRED(1)



NAME
       diffindex-rred - Restricted restricted ed

SYNOPSIS
       diffindex-rred diff1 ...


DESCRIPTION
       diffindex-rred  is  a  command  line  tool  for  applying diff --ed style
       patches, as used in APT&apos;s diff/Index format.  It  can  efficiently  apply
       several  patches  in  one  run and does not need to read the whole source
       file into memory.

       The source file is taken from stdin. The patched file is written to  std&#8208;
       out.  Compressed  patch files are decompressed automatically if they have
       the proper .gz, .bz2, or .lzo extension.

       diffindex-rred is used by diffindex-download.

SEE ALSO
       apt-file(1), diffindex-download(1)
