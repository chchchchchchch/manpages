DIFFSTAT(1)                                                          DIFFSTAT(1)



NAME
       diffstat - make histogram from diff-output

SYNOPSIS
       diffstat [options] [file-specifications]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  reads  the  output of diff and displays a histogram of the
       insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file.  Diffstat is a program
       that  is  useful for reviewing large, complex patch files.  It reads from
       one or more input files which contain output from diff, producing a  his&#8208;
       togram of the total lines changed for each file referenced.

       If the input filename ends with .bz2, .gz, .lzma, .z or .Z, diffstat will
       read the uncompressed data via a pipe from the corresponding program.  It
       also  can  infer  the  compression type from files piped via the standard
       input.

       Diffstat recognizes the most popular types of output from diff:

              unified
                     preferred by the patch utility.

              context
                     best for readability, but not very compact.

              default
                     not good for much, but simple to generate.

       Diffstat detects the lines that are output by diff to  tell  which  files
       are compared, and then counts the markers in the first column that denote
       the type of change (insertion,  deletion  or  modification).   These  are
       shown in the histogram as &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot; and &quot;!&quot; characters.

       If  no  filename is given on the command line, diffstat reads the differ&#8208;
       ences from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -b     ignore lines matching &quot;Binary files XXX and  YYY  differ&quot;  in  the
              diff

       -c     prefix  each line of output with &quot;#&quot;, making it a comment-line for
              shell scripts.

       -C     add SGR color escape sequences to highlight the histogram.

       -D destination
              specify a directory containing files which can be referred  to  as
              the  result  of applying the differences.  diffstat will count the
              lines in the corresponding files (after adjusting the names by the
              -p option) to obtain the total number of lines in each file.

              The  remainder,  after  subtracting modified and deleted lines, is
              shown as &quot;unchanged lines&quot;.

       -e file
              redirect standard error to file.

       -f format
              specify the format of the histogram.

              0  for concise, which shows only the value and a single  histogram
                 code for each of insert (+), delete (-) or modify (!)

              1  for normal output,

              2  to fill in the histogram with dots,

              4  to print each value with the histogram.

              Any nonzero value gives a histogram.  The dots and individual val&#8208;
              ues can be combined, e.g., -f6 gives both.

       -h     prints the usage message and exits.

       -k     suppress the merging of filenames in the report.

       -l     lists only the filenames.  No histogram is generated.

       -m     merge insert/delete counts from each &quot;chunk&quot; of the patch file  to
              approximate a count of the modified lines.

       -n number
              specify the minimum width used for filenames.  If you do not spec&#8208;
              ify this, diffstat uses the length of the longest filename,  after
              stripping common prefixes.

       -N number
              specify  the  maximum width used for filenames.  Names longer than
              this limit are truncated on the left.  If you do not specify this,
              diffstat next checks the -n option.

       -o file
              redirect standard output to file.

       -p number
              override  the  logic  that strips common pathnames, simulating the
              patch &quot;-p&quot; option.

       -q     suppress the &quot;0 files changed&quot; message for empty diffs.

       -r  code
              provides optional rounding of the data shown in histogram,  rather
              than truncating with error adjustments.

              0  is  the  default.   No  rounding  is performed, but accumulated
                 errors are added to following columns.

              1  rounds the data

              2  rounds the data and adjusts the histogram  to  ensure  that  it
                 displays  something  if there are any differences even if those
                 would normally be rounded to zero.

       -R     Assume patch was created with old and new files swapped.

       -s     show only the summary line, e.g., number of insertions  and  dele&#8208;
              tions.

       -S source
              this  is  like  the  -D option, but specifies a location where the
              original files (before applying differences) can be found.

       -t     overrides the histogram, generates output of comma separated  val&#8208;
              ues.

       -u     suppress the sorting of filenames in the report.

       -v     show  progress, e.g., if the output is redirected to a file, write
              progress messages to the standard error.

       -V     prints the current version number and exits.

       -w number
              specify the maximum width of the histogram.   The  histogram  will
              never  be  shorter than 10 columns, just in case the filenames get
              too large.

ENVIRONMENT
       Diffstat runs in a portable UNIX&#174; environment.

       You can override the compiled-in paths of programs used for decompressing
       input files by setting environment variables corresponding to their name:

              DIFFSTAT_BZCAT_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_BZIP2_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_COMPRESS_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_GZIP_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_LZCAT_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_PCAT_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_UNCOMPRESS_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_XZ_PATH
              DIFFSTAT_ZCAT_PATH

       However,  diffstat  assumes that the resulting program uses the same com&#8208;
       mand-line options, e.g., &quot;-c&quot; to decompress to the standard output.

FILES
       Diffstat is a single binary module, which uses no auxiliary files.

BUGS
       Diffstat makes a lot of assumptions about the format of a diff file.

       There is no way to obtain a filename from the standard diff  between  two
       files with no options.  Context diffs work, as well as unified diffs.

       There&apos;s  no  easy  way  to  determine  the  degree of overlap between the
       &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; displays of modified lines.  diffstat simply  counts
       the  number  of  inserted and deleted lines to approximate modified lines
       for the -m option.
