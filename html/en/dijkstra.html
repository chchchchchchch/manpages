DIJKSTRA(1)                                                          DIJKSTRA(1)



NAME
       dijkstra - single-source distance filter

SYNOPSIS
       dijkstra [ -ap?  ] [ sourcenode file ]

DESCRIPTION
       dijkstra  reads  a stream of graphs and for each computes the distance of
       every node from sourcenode.  Edge length is given in the  len  attribute,
       and  the  default  is  1.  The dist attribute of every node is set to its
       distance from sourcenode.  If the -p flag is used, the prev attribute  of
       each  node  reachable  from sourcenode is set to the name of the previous
       node on a shortest path.  The graph attribute maxdist is set to the maxi&#8208;
       mum dist of all nodes in the graph.

       By  default,  if  the  graph is disconnected, the dist attribute of nodes
       unreachable from sourcenode are left untouched, and maxdist is set to the
       maximum  of  any previous value and the largest distance recorded in this
       run. On the other hand, if the -a flag is used, the dist attribute of  an
       unreachable  node is assigned a very large value, and maxdist records the
       maximum distance found in the component containing sourcenode.

       Any number of sourcenode file pairs may be given.  If the  last  file  is
       missing, stdin is used.  All output is written to stdout.

       In  a typical application, dist and maxdist can drive a downstream calcu&#8208;
       lation of color or some other attribute.
