NAME
       directfb-csource - C code generation utility for DirectFB surfaces


SYNOPSIS
       directfb-csource [options] &lt;imagefiles&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       directfb-csource  is  a  small  utility  that reads PNG (Portable Network
       Graphics) image files and generates C code that can be used to compile an
       image  into  a DirectFB application.  Below is a simple example to illus&#8208;
       trate this.

       If multiple PNG image files are passed to directfb-csource, they are com&#8208;
       bined  into  a  single  surface. The different images can then be blitted
       from this surface using the array of rectangles that is also dumped. This
       can be useful for example for icons or sprites.



OPTIONS
       --name=identifier
              Specifies  the  identifier  name  (prefix) for the generated vari&#8208;
              ables.  If this option is not used, the  identifier  is  generated
              from the filename. You have to specify an identifer name when pro&#8208;
              cessing multiple images.


       --format=pixelformat
              Specifies the pixel-format of the generated inline surface. Possi&#8208;
              ble  values  are  ARGB, RGB32, RGB24, RGB16, RGB15, RGB332, A8 and
              LUT8.  By default the format is ARGB if the PNG image has an alpha
              channel or RGB32 otherwise.


       --version
              Output version information.


       --help Print brief help and exit.



EXAMPLE
       Generate a header file from a PNG image file:

            directfb-csource --name=foo foo.png &gt; foo.h

       Include  the  generated  header  in your application and create a surface
       using the surface description from the header file:

         #include &lt;directfb.h&gt;
         #include &quot;foo.h&quot;

         IDirectFB        *dfb;
         IDirectFBSurface *surface;

         ...

         dfb-&gt;CreateSurface( dfb, &amp;foo_desc, &amp;surface );



OTHER INFO
       directfb-csource was inspired by and uses code from gdk-pixbuf-csource, a
       similar program written by Tim Janik.
