DIRSPLIT(1)                       User Commands                      DIRSPLIT(1)



NAME
       dirsplit - splits directory into multiple with equal size

SYNOPSIS
       dirsplit [options] &lt; directory | content-list-file &gt;

DESCRIPTION
       displit  is  designed  to  for a simple purpose: convert a directory with
       many multiple files (which are all smaller than  a  certain  medium,  eg.
       DVD) and &quot;splits&quot; it into &quot;volumes&quot;, looking for the optimal order to get
       the best space/medium-number efficiency.

       The actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs or  real
       moving  of  files into new directories (or creating links/symlinks).  The
       method is not limited to files, whole directories  can  also  be  handled
       this way (see various filesystem exploration modes).
