Description
       discover-modprobe.conf  is  the configuration file for discover-modprobe,
       which is responsible for retrieving and loading kernel modules.

              Warning:

              This file is a shell script, and as such is subject  to  a  string
              variable  assignment syntax. No space is allowed between the vari&#8208;
              able name, the equal (=) sign, and the value(s) assigned. If  mul&#8208;
              tiple  values are to be assigned, the list must be space-delimited
              with surrounding quotes.

       Two directives can be used in this file: types  and  skip.  Both  can  be
       defined multiple times.

       types     This  describes  the classes of hardware that should be scanned
                 and queried.

       skip      These modules should never be loaded. See the ``Files&apos;&apos; section
                 for details on the mechanism for generating these entries auto&#8208;
                 matically.

Files
       /var/lib/discover/crash
                 A crash file written and  erased  each  time  discover-modprobe
                 attempts to load a module. If the file lingers, the computer is
                 assumed to have crashed while loading that module, and the mod&#8208;
                 ule name is added to discover-modprobe.conf as a module to skip
                 in the future.
