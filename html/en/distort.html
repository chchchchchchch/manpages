NAME
       distort - distort the content of the screen in interesting ways

SYNOPSIS
       distort  [-root]  [-window] [-mono] [-install] [-noinstall] [-visual vis&#8208;
       ual] [-window-id window-id] [-delay usecs] [-duration secs] [-radius pix&#8208;
       els]  [-speed  int] [-number int] [-swamp] [-bounce] [-reflect] [-vortex]
       [-magnify] [-blackhole] [-slow] [-shm] [-no-shm] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The distort program takes an image and lets circular zones of  distortion
       wander  randomly  around  it, distorting what is under them.  The mode of
       distortion and the overall behaviour of the zones can  be  influenced  in
       various ways.

       The  image  that  it  manipulates will be grabbed from the portion of the
       screen underlying the window, or from the system&apos;s video input, or from a
       random  file  on  disk,  as indicated by the grabDesktopImages, grabVide&#8208;
       oFrames, and chooseRandomImages options in the ~/.xscreensaver file;  see
       xscreensaver-demo(1) for more details.

OPTIONS
       distort accepts the following options:

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window. This is the default.

       -mono   If on a color display, pretend we&apos;re on a monochrome display.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -noinstall
               Don&apos;t install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify  which visual to use. Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       -window-id window-id
               Specify which window id to use.

       -delay usecs
               Specify  the  delay  between  subsequent  animation   frames   in
               microseconds.

       -duration seconds
               How long to run before loading a new image.  Default 120 seconds.

       -radius pixels
               Specify the radius of the distortion zone in pixels.

       -speed int
               Specify  the speed at which the distortion zone moves, where 0 is
               slow, higher numbers are faster (10 is pretty fast.)

       -number int
               Specify the number of distortion zones.

       -swamp  Instead of letting zones wander around, let small  zones  pop  up
               like bubbles in a swamp and leave permanent distortion.  WARNING:
               this option uses a colossal amount of memory:  keep  the  -radius
               small when using -swamp.

       -bounce Let zones wander around and bounce off the window border. This is
               the default.

       -reflect
               Mode of distortion that resembles  reflection  by  a  cylindrical
               mirror.

       -vortex Whirlpool-shaped distortion. Way cool.

       -magnify
               This mode of distortion looks like a magnifying glass.

       -blackhole
               Suck  your  pixels beyond the event horizon. Favourite mode of Dr
               Stephen Hawking.

       -slow   Make the zone wander slower.

       -shm    Use shared memory extension.

       -no-shm Don&apos;t use shared memory extension.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
