DITROFF(7)                                                            DITROFF(7)



NAME
       ditroff - classical device independent roff

DESCRIPTION
       The  name  ditroff once marked a development level of the troff text pro&#8208;
       cessing system.  In actual roff(7) systems, the name troff is used  as  a
       synonym for ditroff.

       The  first  roff  system was written by Joe Ossanna around 1973.  It sup&#8208;
       ported only two output devices, the nroff program produced text  oriented
       tty  output,  while  the  troff  program  generated  graphical output for
       exactly one output device, the Wang Graphic Systems CAT typesetter.

       In 1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote troff to support more devices by  creat&#8208;
       ing an intermediate output format for troff that can be fed into postpro&#8208;
       cessor  programs  which  actually  do  the  printout   on   the   device.
       Kernighan&apos;s  version  marks  what  is known as classical troff today.  In
       order to distinguish it from Ossanna&apos;s original mono-device  version,  it
       was  called  ditroff  (device  independent troff) on some systems, though
       this naming isn&apos;t mentioned in the classical documentation.

       Today, any existing roff system  is  based  on  Kernighan&apos;s  multi-device
       troff.   The  distinction  between  troff and ditroff isn&apos;t necessary any
       longer, for each modern troff provides already the complete functionality
       of ditroff.  On most systems, the name troff is used to denote ditroff.

       The  easiest  way  to  use  ditroff  is  the GNU roff system, groff.  The
       groff(1) program is a wrapper around (di)troff that automatically handles
       postprocessing.
