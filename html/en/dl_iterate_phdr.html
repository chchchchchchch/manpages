DL_ITERATE_PHDR(3)          Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual         DL_ITERATE_PHDR(3)



NAME
       dl_iterate_phdr - walk through list of shared objects

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;link.h&gt;

       int dl_iterate_phdr(
                 int (*callback) (struct dl_phdr_info *info,
                                  size_t size, void *data),
                 void *data);

DESCRIPTION
       The  dl_iterate_phdr()  function  allows an application to inquire at run
       time to find out which shared objects it has loaded.

       The dl_iterate_phdr() function walks through the list of an application&apos;s
       shared  objects  and  calls  the  function callback once for each object,
       until either all shared objects have been processed or callback returns a
       nonzero value.

       Each  call to callback receives three arguments: info, which is a pointer
       to a structure containing information  about  the  shared  object;  size,
       which is the size of the structure pointed to by info; and data, which is
       a copy of whatever value was passed by the calling program as the  second
       argument (also named data) in the call to dl_iterate_phdr().

       The info argument is a structure of the following type:

           struct dl_phdr_info {
               ElfW(Addr)        dlpi_addr;  /* Base address of object */
               const char       *dlpi_name;  /* (Null-terminated) name of
                                                object */
               const ElfW(Phdr) *dlpi_phdr;  /* Pointer to array of
                                                ELF program headers
                                                for this object */
               ElfW(Half)        dlpi_phnum; /* # of items in dlpi_phdr */
           };

       (The  ElfW()  macro definition turns its argument into the name of an ELF
       data type suitable for the hardware  architecture.   For  example,  on  a
       32-bit  platform,  ElfW(Addr) yields the data type name Elf32_Addr.  Fur&#8208;
       ther information on these types can be found in the &lt;elf.h&gt; and  &lt;link.h&gt;
       header files.)

       The  dlpi_addr  field  indicates  the  base  address of the shared object
       (i.e., the difference between the virtual memory address  of  the  shared
       object  and  the  offset  of  that  object  in the file from which it was
       loaded).  The dlpi_name field is  a  null-terminated  string  giving  the
       pathname from which the shared object was loaded.

       To understand the meaning of the dlpi_phdr and dlpi_phnum fields, we need
       to be aware that an ELF shared object consists of a number  of  segments,
       each  of which has a corresponding program header describing the segment.
       The dlpi_phdr field is a pointer to an array of the program  headers  for
       this  shared  object.   The  dlpi_phnum  field indicates the size of this
       array.

       These program headers are structures of the following form:

           typedef struct {
               Elf32_Word  p_type;    /* Segment type */
               Elf32_Off   p_offset;  /* Segment file offset */
               Elf32_Addr  p_vaddr;   /* Segment virtual address */
               Elf32_Addr  p_paddr;   /* Segment physical address */
               Elf32_Word  p_filesz;  /* Segment size in file */
               Elf32_Word  p_memsz;   /* Segment size in memory */
               Elf32_Word  p_flags;   /* Segment flags */
               Elf32_Word  p_align;   /* Segment alignment */
           } Elf32_Phdr;

       Note that we can calculate the location of a particular  program  header,
       x, in virtual memory using the formula:

         addr == info-&gt;dlpi_addr + info-&gt;dlpi_phdr[x].p_vaddr;

RETURN VALUE
       The dl_iterate_phdr() function returns whatever value was returned by the
       last call to callback.

VERSIONS
       dl_iterate_phdr() has been supported in glibc since version 2.2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       The dl_iterate_phdr() function is Linux-specific and should be avoided in
       portable applications.

EXAMPLE
       The  following program displays a list of pathnames of the shared objects
       it has loaded.  For each shared object, the  program  lists  the  virtual
       addresses at which the object&apos;s ELF segments are loaded.

       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include &lt;link.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       static int
       callback(struct dl_phdr_info *info, size_t size, void *data)
       {
           int j;

           printf(&quot;name=%s (%d segments)\n&quot;, info-&gt;dlpi_name,
               info-&gt;dlpi_phnum);

           for (j = 0; j &lt; info-&gt;dlpi_phnum; j++)
                printf(&quot;\t\t header %2d: address=%10p\n&quot;, j,
                    (void *) (info-&gt;dlpi_addr + info-&gt;dlpi_phdr[j].p_vaddr));
           return 0;
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           dl_iterate_phdr(callback, NULL);

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
