DESCRIPTION
       dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for dwm(1).   It  man&#8208;
       ages huge numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.

       dmenu  reads  a  list  of newline-separated items from standard input and
       creates a menu.  When the user selects an item or  enters  any  text  and
       presses Return, their choice is printed to standard output and dmenu ter&#8208;
       minates.

       dmenu_run is a dmenu script used by  dwm  which  lists  programs  in  the
       user&apos;s PATH and executes the selected item.

       dmenu_path  is  a  program  used by dmenu_run to find and cache a list of
       executables.

              defines the prompt to be displayed to the left of the input field.

       -fn font
              defines the font or font set used.
