DESCRIPTION
       dmsetup manages  logical  devices  that  use  the  device-mapper  driver.
       Devices  are  created by loading a table that specifies a target for each
       sector (512 bytes) in the logical device.

       The first argument to dmsetup is a command.  The second argument  is  the
       logical device name or uuid.

       Invoking the command as devmap_name is equivalent to
       dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j major -m minor.

OPTIONS
       --addnodeoncreate
              Ensure /dev/mapper node exists after dmsetup create.

       --addnodeonresume
              Ensure  /dev/mapper node exists after dmsetup resume (default with
              udev).

       --checks
              Perform additional checks on the operations requested  and  report
              potential problems.  Useful when debugging scripts.  In some cases
              these checks may slow down operations noticeably.

       -c|-C|--columns
              Display output in columns rather than as Field: Value lines.

       -h|--help
              Outputs a summary of the commands available, optionally  including
              the list of report fields (synonym with help command).

       --inactive
              When returning any table information from the kernel report on the
              inactive table instead of the live table.  Requires kernel  driver
              version 4.16.0 or above.

       --manglename &lt;mangling_mode&gt;
              Mangle  any  character not on a whitelist using mangling_mode when
              processing device-mapper device names. The names  are  mangled  on
              input  and  unmangled on output where the mangling_mode is one of:
              none (no mangling), hex (always do the mangling) and auto (only do
              the  mangling  if  not mangled yet, do nothing if already mangled,
              error on mixed; this is used by  default).   Character  whitelist:
              0-9, A-Z, a-z, #+-.:=@_. This whitelist is also supported by udev.
              Any character not on a whitelist is replaced with  its  hex  value
              (two digits) prefixed by \x.

       -j|--major major
              Specify the major number.

       -m|--minor minor
              Specify the minor number.

       -n|--noheadings
              Suppress the headings line when using columnar output.

       --noopencount
              Tell  the  kernel  not  to supply the open reference count for the
              device.

       --notable
              When creating a device, don&apos;t load any table.

       --noudevrules
              Do not allow udev to manage nodes  for  devices  in  device-mapper
              directory.

       --noudevsync
              Do  not  synchronise with udev when creating, renaming or removing
              devices.

       -o|--options
              Specify which fields to display.

       --readahead [+]&lt;sectors&gt;|auto|none
              Specify read ahead size in units of sectors.  The default value is
              auto  which allows the kernel to choose a suitable value automati&#8208;
              cally.  The + prefix lets you specify a minimum value  which  will
              not  be used if it is smaller than the value chosen by the kernel.
              The value none is equivalent to specifying zero.

       -r|--readonly
              Set the table being loaded read-only.
&#12;       --table &lt;table&gt;
              Specify a one-line table directly on the command line.

       --udevcookie cookie
              Use cookie for udev synchronisation.

       -u|--uuid
              Specify the uuid.

       -y|--yes
              Answer yes to all prompts automatically.

       -v|--verbose [-v|--verbose]
              Produce additional output.

       --verifyudev
              If udev synchronisation is enabled, verify  that  udev  operations
              get  performed correctly and try to fix up the device nodes after&#8208;
              wards if not.

       --version
              Display the library and kernel driver version.

COMMANDS
       clear  device_name
              Destroys the table in the inactive table slot for device_name.

       create device_name  [-u  uuid]   [--notable|--table   &lt;table&gt;|table_file]
              [{--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume}]    [--readahead   [+]&lt;sec&#8208;
              tors&gt;|auto|none]
              Creates a device with the given name.  If table_file or &lt;table&gt; is
              supplied, the table is loaded and made live.  Otherwise a table is
              read from standard input unless --notable is used.   The  optional
              uuid  can  be  used  in place of device_name in subsequent dmsetup
              commands.   If  successful  a  device  will  appear  as  /dev/map&#8208;
              per/&lt;device-name&gt;.  See below for information on the table format.

       deps   [-o options] [device_name]
              Outputs  a  list  of  devices referenced by the live table for the
              specified device. Device names on output can be customised by fol&#8208;
              lowing  options:  devno  (major  and minor pair, used by default),
              blkdevname (block device name), devname (map name for  device-map&#8208;
              per devices, equal to blkdevname otherwise).

       help   [-c|-C|--columns]
              Outputs  a summary of the commands available, optionally including
              the list of report fields.

       info   [device_name]
              Outputs some brief information about the device in the form:
                      State: SUSPENDED|ACTIVE, READ-ONLY
                      Tables present: LIVE and/or INACTIVE
                      Open reference count
                      Last event sequence number (used by wait)
                      Major and minor device number
                      Number of targets in the live table
                      UUID

       info   -c|-C|--columns [--noheadings] [--separator separator] [-o fields]
              [-O|--sort sort_fields] [device_name]
              Output  you  can customise.  Fields are comma-separated and chosen
              from the following list: name, major, minor, attr, open, segments,
              events,  uuid.   Attributes  are: (L)ive, (I)nactive, (s)uspended,
              (r)ead-only, read-(w)rite.  Precede the list with &apos;+&apos; to append to
              the default selection of columns instead of replacing it.  Precede
              any sort_field with - for a reverse sort on that column.

       ls     [--target target_type] [--exec command] [--tree] [-o options]
              List device names.  Optionally only  list  devices  that  have  at
              least one target of the specified type.  Optionally execute a com&#8208;
              mand for each device.  The device name is appended to the supplied
              command.   Device  names  on output can be customised by following
              options: devno (major and minor pair, used by default), blkdevname
              (block  device name), devname (map name for device-mapper devices,
              equal to  blkdevname  otherwise).   --tree  displays  dependencies
              between  devices  as  a tree.  It accepts a comma-separate list of
              options.  Some specify  the  information  displayed  against  each
              node: device/nodevice; blkdevname; active, open, rw, uuid.  Others
              specify how the tree is displayed:  ascii,  utf,  vt100;  compact,
              inverted, notrunc.

       load|reload device_name [--table &lt;table&gt;|table_file]
              Loads  &lt;table&gt;  or  table_file  into  the  inactive table slot for
              device_name.  If neither is supplied, reads a table from  standard
              input.

       wipe_table device_name
              Wait  for  any  I/O in-flight through the device to complete, then
              replace the table with a new table that fails any new I/O sent  to
              the  device.   If successful, this should release any devices held
              open by the device&apos;s table(s).

       message device_name sector message
              Send message to target. If sector not needed use 0.

       mknodes [device_name]
              Ensure that the node in /dev/mapper for  device_name  is  correct.
              If  no device_name is supplied, ensure that all nodes in /dev/map&#8208;
              per correspond to mapped devices currently loaded by  the  device-
              mapper kernel driver, adding, changing or removing nodes as neces&#8208;
              sary.

       mangle [device_name]
              Ensure existing device-mapper device name is in the  correct  man&#8208;
              gled  form  containing  only  whitelisted characters (supported by
              udev) and do a rename if  necessary.  Any  character  not  on  the
              whitelist will be mangled based on the --manglename settting.

       remove [-f|--force] [--retry] device_name
              Removes  a device.  It will no longer be visible to dmsetup.  Open
              devices cannot be removed except with older kernels that contain a
              version  of device-mapper prior to 4.8.0.  In this case the device
              will be deleted when its open_count drops to zero.   From  version
              4.8.0  onwards,  if  a device can&apos;t be removed because an uninter&#8208;
              ruptible process is waiting for I/O  to  return  from  it,  adding
              --force  will replace the table with one that fails all I/O, which
              might allow the process to be killed. If an attempt  to  remove  a
              device fails, perhaps because a process run from a quick udev rule
              temporarily opened the device, the --retry option will  cause  the
              operation to be retried for a few seconds before failing.

       remove_all [-f|--force]
              Attempts  to  remove all device definitions i.e. reset the driver.
              Use with care!  From version 4.8.0 onwards, if  devices  can&apos;t  be
              removed  because  uninterruptible processes are waiting for I/O to
              return from them, adding --force will replace the table  with  one
              that  fails  all  I/O, which might allow the process to be killed.
              This also runs mknodes afterwards.

       rename device_name new_name
              Renames a device.
&#12;       rename device_name --setuuid uuid
              Sets the uuid of a device that was created without a uuid.   After
              a uuid has been set it cannot be changed.

       resume device_name  [{--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume}]  [--readahead
              [+]&lt;sectors&gt;|auto|none]
              Un-suspends a device.  If an inactive table has  been  loaded,  it
              becomes live.  Postponed I/O then gets re-queued for processing.

       setgeometry device_name cyl head sect start
              Sets the device geometry to C/H/S.

       splitname device_name [subsystem]
              Splits  given  device  name  into subsystem constituents.  Default
              subsystem is LVM.

       status [--target target_type] [device_name]
              Outputs status information for each of the device&apos;s targets.  With
              --target,  only  information relating to the specified target type
              is displayed.

       suspend [--nolockfs] [--noflush] device_name
              Suspends a device.  Any I/O that has already been  mapped  by  the
              device but has not yet completed will be flushed.  Any further I/O
              to that device will be postponed for as long as the device is sus&#8208;
              pended.   If there&apos;s a filesystem on the device which supports the
              operation, an attempt  will  be  made  to  sync  it  first  unless
              --nolockfs  is  specified.   Some  targets such as recent (October
              2006) versions of multipath  may  support  the  --noflush  option.
              This  lets  outstanding I/O that has not yet reached the device to
              remain unflushed.

       table  [--target target_type] [--showkeys] [device_name]
              Outputs the current table for the device in a format that  can  be
              fed  back  in  using  the create or load commands.  With --target,
              only information relating to the specified  target  type  is  dis&#8208;
              played.   Encryption  keys  are suppressed in the table output for
              the crypt target unless the --showkeys parameter is supplied.

       targets
              Displays the names and versions of the currently-loaded targets.

       udevcomplete cookie
              Wake any processes that are waiting for udev to complete  process&#8208;
              ing the specified cookie.

       udevcomplete_all [age_in_minutes]
              Remove  all  cookies  older  than the specified number of minutes.
              Any process waiting on a cookie will be resumed immediately.

       udevcookies
              List all existing cookies. Cookies are system-wide semaphores with
              keys prefixed by two predefined bytes (0x0D4D).

       udevcreatecookie
              Creates  a new cookie to synchronize actions with udev processing.
              The output is a cookie value. Normally we  don&apos;t  need  to  create
              cookies  since  dmsetup  creates and destroys them for each action
              automatically. However, we can generate one  explicitly  to  group
              several  actions  together and use only one cookie instead. We can
              define a cookie to use for each relevant command by  using  --ude&#8208;
              vcookie  option.  Alternatively, we can export this value into the
              environment of the dmsetup process as DM_UDEV_COOKIE variable  and
              it  will  be used automatically with all subsequent commands until
              it is unset.  Invoking this command will create system-wide  sema&#8208;
              phore  that  needs  to be cleaned up explicitly by calling udevre&#8208;
              leasecookie command.

       udevflags cookie
              Parses given cookie value and  extracts  any  udev  control  flags
              encoded.  The output is in environment key format that is suitable
              for use in udev rules. If the flag has its symbolic name  assigned
              then      the      output     is     DM_UDEV_FLAG_&lt;flag_name&gt;=&apos;1&apos;,
              DM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=&apos;1&apos; otherwise.  Subsystem  udev  flags
              don&apos;t  have  symbolic  names  assigned  and  these ones are always
              reported as DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=&apos;1&apos;.  There  are
              16 udev flags altogether.

       udevreleasecookie [cookie]
              Waits  for all pending udev processing bound to given cookie value
              and clean up the cookie with underlying semaphore. If  the  cookie
              is not given directly, the command will try to use a value defined
              by DM_UDEV_COOKIE environment variable.

       version
              Outputs version information.


       wait   device_name [event_nr]
              Sleeps until the event counter for device_name  exceeds  event_nr.
              Use  -v  to see the event number returned.  To wait until the next
              event is triggered, use info to find the last event number.

TABLE FORMAT
       Each line of the table specifies a single target and is of the form:

       logical_start_sector num_sectors target_type &lt;target_args&gt;

       Simple target types and &lt;target_args&gt; include:

       linear destination_device start_sector
              The traditional linear mapping.

       striped num_stripes chunk_size [destination start_sector]+
              Creates a striped area.
              e.g. striped 2 32 /dev/hda1 0 /dev/hdb1 0 will map the first chunk
              (16k) as follows:
                      LV chunk 1 -&gt; hda1, chunk 1
                      LV chunk 2 -&gt; hdb1, chunk 1
                      LV chunk 3 -&gt; hda1, chunk 2
                      LV chunk 4 -&gt; hdb1, chunk 2
                      etc.

       error
              Errors  any I/O that goes to this area.  Useful for testing or for
              creating devices with holes in them.

       zero
              Returns blocks of zeroes on reads.  Any data written is  discarded
              silently.   This  is  a  block-device  equivalent of the /dev/zero
              character-device data sink described in null(4).

       More complex targets include:

       crypt
              Transparent encryption of block devices using  the  kernel  crypto
              API.

       delay
              Delays reads and/or writes to different devices.  Useful for test&#8208;
              ing.
&#12;       flakey
              Creates a similar mapping to the linear target but exhibits  unre&#8208;
              liable  behaviour  periodically.   Useful  for  simulating failing
              devices when testing.

       mirror
              Mirrors data across two or more devices.

       multipath
              Mediates access through multiple paths to the same device.

       raid
              Offers an interface to the kernel&apos;s software raid driver, md.

       snapshot
              Supports snapshots of devices.

       To find out more about the various targets and their  table  formats  and
       status  lines,  please  read the files in the Documentation/device-mapper
       directory in the kernel source tree.  (Your distribution might include  a
       copy  of  this information in the documentation directory for the device-
       mapper package.)


EXAMPLES
       # A table to join two disks together
       0 1028160 linear /dev/hda 0
       1028160 3903762 linear /dev/hdb 0


       # A table to stripe across the two disks,
       # and add the spare space from
       # hdb to the back of the volume

       0 2056320 striped 2 32 /dev/hda 0 /dev/hdb 0
       2056320 2875602 linear /dev/hdb 1028160


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DM_DEV_DIR
              The device directory name.  Defaults to  &quot;/dev&quot;  and  must  be  an
              absolute path.

       DM_UDEV_COOKIE
              A cookie to use for all relevant commands to synchronize with udev
              processing.  It is an alternative to using --udevcookie option.
