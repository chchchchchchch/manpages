DOCBOOK2MAN-SPEC.PL(1)                                    DOCBOOK2MAN-SPEC.PL(1)



NAME
       docbook2man-spec.pl - convert DocBook RefEntries to man pages

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlspl docbook2man-spec.pl


       nsgmls [ sgml document ]| sgmlspl docbook2man-spec.pl


DESCRIPTION
       docbook2man  is  a  sgmlspl  spec file that produced man pages (using the
       -man macros) from DocBook RefEntry markup.

       The program reads ESIS produced by nsgmls (or other  SGML  parsers)  from
       standard input.  Markup not found in RefEntry is discarded.

       Its  output,  the  converted man pages, are written to the current direc&#8208;
       tory.  If RefMeta information is not specified in a  RefEntry,  then  the
       man page will be written to standard output.

       The  file  manpage.links will also be created, which contains any aliases
       of the manpages generated.  This file is in the format:

       &lt;man page&gt; &lt;alias
       manpage&gt;

       The manpage.refs file keeps track of XRef references.  Note that  if  the
       input  document  has any forward references, then docbook2man may have to
       be invoked twice (the first time updating manpage.refs) to resolve them.

REQUIREMENTS
       The SGMLSpm package from CPAN.  This package includes the sgmlspl  script
       that is also needed.

LIMITATIONS
       Trying docbook2man on non-DocBook or non-conformant SGML results in unde&#8208;
       fined behavior. :-)

       This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.

       This program does not come close to supporting all the possible markup in
       DocBook,  and  may  produce  wrong  output  in  some cases with supported
       markup.

TO DO
       Obvious stuff:

       &#183; Fix docbook2man breakages  found  in  the  test  documents,  especially
         weird.sgml.

       &#183; Add new element handling and fix existing handling.  Be robust.

       &#183; Produce  cleanest,  readable  man output as possible (unlike some other
         converters).  Follow Linux man(7) convention.   As  conversion  to  man
         pages  is  usually  not done very often, it is better to be slower/more
         complicated than to produce wrong output.  Also  if  someone  wants  to
         give up using DocBook for whatever reason, the last-converted man pages
         can then be maintained manually.

       &#183; Make it faster. I think most of the speed problems so far is with pars&#8208;
         ing ESIS.  Rewrite SGMLS.pm with C and/or get input directly from SP.

       &#183; Support  other  (human)  languages.   But  what  to  do  with non-ASCII
         charsets?  SGMLSpm doesn&apos;t report them and roff  does  not  grok  them.
         [Comment:  text  after  enclosed  lists (and SS blocks) will break doc&#8208;
         book2man] If we do this, more people can use DocBook.
