DESCRIPTION
       The jw shell script allows to convert a DocBook file (or some other SGML-
       based format) to other formats (including HTML, RTF, PS and PDF) with  an
       easy-to-understand syntax. It hides most of Jade&apos;s or OpenJade complexity
       and adds comfortable features.

       Other scripts like docbook2html, docbook2rtf or docbook2ps  provide  dif&#8208;
       ferent ways of calling jw that might be easier to remember.

       For the moment, jw does not handle XML, but only SGML.

       This  utility  assumes  that  several other components are installed. The
       list includes:

       &#183; the ISO character entities for SGML

       &#183; James Clark&apos;s DSSSL engine, jade, or an equivalent parser like OpenJade

       &#183; the DocBook DTD from the OASIS consortium

       &#183; Norman Walsh&apos;s DocBook modular style sheets (or some other set of DSSSL
         style sheets)

       &#183; Sebastian  Rahtz&apos;s  jadetex  set  of  TeX macros for jade (for backends
         intended to &quot;printing&quot; formats like PDF, RTF or PostScript)

       &#183; A perl interpreter (for backends that use perl)

       &#183; SGMLSpm from CPAN (for backends that use sgmls)

       &#183; Lynx HTML browser (for the txt backend)

       The jw script is basically called like this:

       jw mydoc.sgml

       where mydoc.sgml is a SGML file.

       The command line above uses default options:  it  converts  from  DocBook
       (the  default  frontend)  to HTML (the default backend), does not put the
       result in  a  subdirectory  (unless  specified  otherwise  in  the  style
       sheets), etc.

       In  this  example, the &quot;mydoc&quot; file name as well as the &quot;.sgml&quot; extension
       can be replaced by anything else. Current  extensions  for  SGML  DocBook
       files  include &quot;.sgml&quot;, &quot;.sgm&quot;, &quot;.docbook&quot;, and &quot;.db&quot;. The processed file
       mydoc.sgml can be in any other directory than the current one.

       Here we have chosen to generate HTML output. In fact we can  use  any  of
       the  backends  stored  in the backends/ subdirectory of the DocBook-utils
       distribution directory  (usually  /usr/share/docbook-utils).   Similarly,
       you  can  use any frontend defined in the frontends/ subdirectory to con&#8208;
       vert from another input format.

       This sample command creates one or many HTML files  with  arbitrary  file
       names  in  the  current  directory.  This default behavior can be changed
       through command line options and/or customization style sheets.

OPTIONS
       The following options apply to the conversion script:

          -f frontend | --frontend frontend
              Allows to specify another frontend than default docbook.  The list
              of currently available frontends is:

              docbook
                     Converts  docbook  with  Norman  Walsh&apos;s style sheets. This
                     frontend searches in the subdirectories of  the  base  SGML
                     directory  for  a file named html/docbook.dsl or print/doc&#8208;
                     book.dsl (depending on the backend&apos;s type: html or print).

          -b backend | --backend backend
              Allows to specify another backend than default HTML. The  list  of
              currently available backends is:

              dvi    Converts  to DVI (DeVice Independant files) by calling Jade
                     or OpenJade.
&#12;              html   Converts to HTML (HyperText  Markup  Language)  by  calling
                     Jade or OpenJade.

              man    Converts  a  refentry to a Unix manual page by calling doc&#8208;
                     book2man. Does not work with other SGML document types than
                     DocBook.

              pdf    Converts  to PDF (Portable Document Format) by calling Jade
                     or OpenJade.

              ps     Converts to PostScript by calling Jade or OpenJade.

              rtf    Converts to RTF (Rich Text Format) by calling Jade or Open&#8208;
                     Jade.  The resulting file can then be inported into MS Word
                     or one of its Linux replacement programs.

              tex    Converts to TeX by calling Jade or OpenJade.

              texi   Converts to GNU TeXinfo pages by calling docbook2texi. Does
                     not work with other SGML document types than DocBook.

              txt    Converts  to  a bare text file by calling Jade or OpenJade,
                     then Lynx.

          -c file | --cat file
              Allows to use an extra SGML Open  Catalog  that  will  list  other
              files  like customization style sheets, adaptations to the DocBook
              Document Type Definition, special character  entities,  etc.  This
              catalog  is added to the list of catalogs determined by the script
              (see option --nostd below)

          -n | --nostd
              Do not use the standard SGML Open Catalogs. Normally, the standard
              catalogs list is determined like this:

              &#183; if  the centralized catalog exists, then use it. The centralized
                catalog is a list of all catalogs that might be  necessary  that
                usually  resides in /etc/sgml. Its name is provided by the fron&#8208;
                tend, for example the docbook frontend  returns  /etc/sgml/sgml-
                docbook.cat.

              &#183; Otherwise, take all the files named catalog from the subdirecto&#8208;
                ries of the SGML base directory (usually /usr/share/sgml).
       This option is useful in conjunction with the --cat option  to  use  only
       the catalogs that are specified on the command line.

          -d file|default|none | --dsl file|default|none
              Allows to use a customized style sheet instead of the default one.

              A  &quot;target&quot;  starting  with a hash mark &quot;#&quot; can be appended to the
              file name. As a result, only the corresponding part of  the  style
              sheet is executed (the &quot;style specification&quot; whose &quot;identificator&quot;
              is equal to the target&apos;s name). A common use of this mechanism  is
              to  define &quot;#html&quot; and &quot;#print&quot; targets to trigger the correspond&#8208;
              ing part  of a replacement style sheet which is  common  for  both
              HTML and printout conversion.

              By replacing the file name with &quot;default&quot;, the default style sheet
              provided with the frontend is used. For example, the docbook fron&#8208;
              tend  returns  ./docbook.dsl#html  (or ./docbook.dsl#print) in the
              SGML base directory.

              By replacing the file name with &quot;none&quot;, no replacement style sheet
              is  used,  not even the default style sheet. The style sheet which
              is used is also determined by the frontend. For example, the  doc&#8208;
              book   frontend   returns   Norman  Walsh&apos;s  html/docbook.dsl  (or
              print/docbook.dsl) found somewhere below the SGML base directory.

              If no --dsl option is specified, then &quot;--dsl default&quot; is used.

          -l file | --dcl file
              Allows to use a customized SGML declaration instead of the default
              one.  The file name of the default SGML declaration is not set for
              SGML files, and is set to xml.dcl in the SGML base  directory  for
              XML files.

          -s path | --sgmlbase path
              Allows  to  use another location for the SGML base directory. This
              is the directory below which all SGML DTDs,  style  sheets,  enti&#8208;
              ties, etc are installed. The default value is /usr/share/sgml.

          -p program | --parser program
              Specify  the  parser  to  use  (Jade  or  OpenJade) if several are
              installed. If this option is not specified, the script first tries
              to use Jade, then it tries OpenJade.

          -o directory | --output directory
              Set output directory where all the resulting files will be stored.
              If the style sheets define  a  subdirectory  where  to  store  the
              resulting  files too, the subdirectory defined by the style sheets
              will be placed below the subdirectory defined by this option.

          -V variable=[value]
              Set a variable (to a value, if one is specified).

          -u | --nochunks
              Output only one big file. This option is useful only when generat&#8208;
              ing HTML, because the output can be split into several files. This
              option overrides the setting that may be done in the style sheets.

          -i section | --include section
              Declare a SGML marked section as &quot;include&quot;. A SGML marked  section
              is  a  kind  of  conditional part of a document. If it is declared
              &quot;ignore&quot;, it will be left ignored, otherwise it will be processed.
              An example of such a marked section would be:

                   &lt;DOCTYPE mydoc [
                     &lt;!ENTITY % confidential &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
                   ]&gt;
                   &lt;mydoc&gt;
                     ...
                     &lt;![ %confidential [ Some confidential text... ]]&gt;
                     ...
                   &lt;/mydoc&gt;


          -w type|list | --warning type|list
              Enables  or disables the display of given types of warnings.  Sev&#8208;
              eral -w options might be entered on  the  command  line.   Warning
              types  that  start  with &quot;no-&quot; disable the corresponding warnings,
              the other types enable them.

              If the warning type is  replaced  with  &quot;list&quot;,  then  a  list  of
              allowed warning types is displayed.

          -e type|list | --error type|list
              Disables  given  types  of  errors.   Several  -e options might be
              entered on the command line.  All error types start with &quot;no-&quot;.

              If the error type is replaced with &quot;list&quot;, then a list of  allowed
              error types is displayed.
&#12;          -h | --help
              Print a short help message and exit

          -v | --version
              Print the version identifier and exit
