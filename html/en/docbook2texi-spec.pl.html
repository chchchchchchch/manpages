DOCBOOK2TEXI-SPEC.PL(1)                                  DOCBOOK2TEXI-SPEC.PL(1)



NAME
       docbook2texi-spec.pl - convert DocBook Booksto Texinfo documents

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlspl docbook2man-spec.pl


       nsgmls [ sgml document ]| sgmlspl docbook2texi-spec.pl [ basename ]


DESCRIPTION
       docbook2texi  is  a sgmlspl spec file that produces GNU Texinfo documents
       from DocBook documents.

       The program reads ESIS produced by nsgmls (or other  SGML  parsers)  from
       standard  input.   Currently the document element must be Book, otherwise
       the results are undefined.

       Its output, the converted Texinfo document, is written to  standard  out&#8208;
       put.

       The file basename.refs will also be created, which contains all the nodes
       in the document and their immediate &apos;child&apos; nodes.   As  node  processing
       always  require  forward  references,  docbook2texi must be run twice for
       each document: the first time to build the references, and the second  to
       actually generate a valid document.

REQUIREMENTS
       The  SGMLSpm package from CPAN.  This package includes the sgmlspl script
       that is also needed.

LIMITATIONS
       Trying docbook2man on non-DocBook or non-conformant SGML results in unde&#8208;
       fined behavior. :-)

       This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.

       This program does not come close to supporting all the possible markup in
       DocBook, and may produce  wrong  output  in  some  cases  with  supported
       markup.

TO DO
       &#183; How  the  hell  do  you  represent a backslash (\) in Texinfo!!@?  I&apos;ve
         tried \\ but TeX complains about it.

       &#183; Fix breakages found in the test documents.

       &#183; Add new element handling and fix existing handling.  Be robust.

       &#183; Make it faster. I think most of the speed problems so far is with pars&#8208;
         ing ESIS.  Rewrite SGMLS.pm with C and/or get input directly from SP.

       &#183; There  are  some dependencies on elements occurring when they are actu&#8208;
         ally optional (according to the DTD).  We need to fix that (preferably)
         or prominently state the requirements.

       &#183; Allow other more common document elements.

       &#183; Separate  out node referencing to a separate script.  Not only would it
         make it faster/easier to maintain because it&apos;s separate from  the  main
         code,  but also I would like it to evolve into an automatic DocBook ToC
         generator.
