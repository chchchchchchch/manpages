NAME
       docidx_lang_faq - docidx language faq

DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
   WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?
       This  document  is currently mainly a placeholder, to be filled with com&#8208;
       monly asked questions about the docidx markup  language  and  companions,
       and their answers.

       Please  report  any  questions (and, if possible, answers) we should con&#8208;
       sider for this document in the category doctools of the Tcllib SF  Track&#8208;
       ers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].

EXAMPLES
   WHERE DO I FIND DOCIDX EXAMPLES?
       We have no direct examples of documents written using docidx markup. How&#8208;
       ever the doctools processor dtplite does generate  keyword  indices  when
       processing  a set of documents written in doctools markup. The intermedi&#8208;
       ate files use docidx markup and are  not  deleted  when  generation  com&#8208;
       pletes. These files can therefore serve as examples.

       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of

       [1]    A  CVS snapshot of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and the
              tools  required  for  this   are   described   at   http://source&#8208;
              forge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883

       [2]    A  Tcllib  release  archive.  They are available at http://source&#8208;
              forge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
