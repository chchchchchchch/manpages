NAME
       doctoc_lang_faq - doctoc language faq

DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
   WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?
       This  document  is currently mainly a placeholder, to be filled with com&#8208;
       monly asked questions about the doctoc markup  language  and  companions,
       and their answers.

       Please  report  any  questions (and, if possible, answers) we should con&#8208;
       sider for this document in the category doctools of the Tcllib SF  Track&#8208;
       ers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].

EXAMPLES
   WHERE DO I FIND DOCTOC EXAMPLES?
       We have no direct examples of documents written using doctoc markup. How&#8208;
       ever the doctools processor dtplite does generate  a  table  of  contents
       when processing a set of documents written in doctools markup. The inter&#8208;
       mediate file for it uses doctoc markup and is not deleted when generation
       completes. Such files can therefore serve as examples.

       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of

       [1]    A  CVS snapshot of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and the
              tools  required  for  this   are   described   at   http://source&#8208;
              forge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883

       [2]    A  Tcllib  release  archive.  They are available at http://source&#8208;
              forge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
