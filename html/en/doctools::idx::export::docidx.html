NAME
       doctools::idx::export::docidx - docidx export plugin

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.4

       package require doctools::idx::export::docidx  ?0.1?

       export serial configuration

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package implements the doctools keyword index export plugin for the
       generation of docidx markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level man&#8208;
       agement    packages    handling    keyword   indices,   especially   doc&#8208;
       tools::idx::export, the export manager.

       Using it from a regular interpreter is possible, however only  with  con&#8208;
       tortions, and is not recommended.  The proper way to use this functional&#8208;
       ity is through the package doctools::idx::export and the  export  manager
       objects it provides.

API
       The  API  provided  by  this  package  satisfies the specification of the
       docidx export plugin API version 2.

       export serial configuration
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a keyword index,
              as  specified  in  section Keyword index serialization format, and
              contained in serial, the configuration, a dictionary,  and  gener&#8208;
              ates docidx markup encoding the index.  The created string is then
              returned as the result of the command.

[DOCIDX] NOTATION OF KEYWORD INDICES
       The docidx format for keyword indices, also called the docidx markup lan&#8208;
       guage,  is  too  large  to  be covered in single section.  The interested
       reader should start with the document

       [1]    docidx language introduction

       and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the  docu&#8208;
       ments

       [1]    docidx language syntax and

       [2]    docidx language command reference.

       to get a thorough understanding of the language.

CONFIGURATION
       The docidx export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables
       and changes its behaviour as they specify.

       string user
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the user
              running  the  process which invoked the export plugin.  The plugin
              puts this information into the provenance comment at the beginning
              of the generated document.

       string file
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the file
              the index came from. This variable may not be set or  contain  the
              empty  string.  The plugin puts this information, if defined, i.e.
              set and not the empty string, into the provenance comment  at  the
              beginning of the generated document.

       boolean newlines
              If  this  flag  is  set the plugin will break the generated docidx
              code across lines, with each markup command on a separate line.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the whole document will  be
              written  on  a  single line, with minimum spacing between all ele&#8208;
              ments.

       boolean indented
              If this flag is set the plugin will  indent  the  markup  commands
              according to the structure of indices. To make this work this also
              implies that newlines is set. This effect is  independent  of  the
              value for aligned however.

              If  this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as
              per the values of newlines and aligned, and no indenting is done.

       boolean aligned
              If this flag is set the generator ensures that the  arguments  for
              the manpage and url commands in a keyword section are aligned ver&#8208;
              tically for a nice table effect.  To  make  this  work  this  also
              implies  that  newlines  is set. This effect is independent of the
              value for indented however.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted  as
              per the values of newlines and indented, and no alignment is done.

       Note  that  this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables for&#8208;
       mat, and map, and their values.

KEYWORD INDEX SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to  serialize
       keyword indices as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations. While a key&#8208;
       word index may have more than one regular serialization only exactly  one
       of them will be canonical.

       regular serialization

              [1]    An index serialization is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary holds a single key, doctools::idx, and its
                     value. This value holds the contents of the index.

              [3]    The contents of the index are a Tcl dictionary holding  the
                     title  of  the  index, a label, and the keywords and refer&#8208;
                     ences. The relevant keys and their values are

                     title  The value is a string containing the  title  of  the
                            index.

                     label  The  value  is  a  string containing a label for the
                            index.

                     keywords
                            The value is a Tcl dictionary,  using  the  keywords
                            known  to  the  index as keys. The associated values
                            are lists containing the identifiers of  the  refer&#8208;
                            ences associated with that particular keyword.

                            Any  reference identifier used in these lists has to
                            exist as a key in the references dictionary, see the
                            next item for its definition.

                     references
                            The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the identifiers
                            for the references known to the index as  keys.  The
                            associated values are 2-element lists containing the
                            type and label of the reference, in this order.

                            Any key here has to be associated with at least  one
                            keyword, i.e. occur in at least one of the reference
                            lists which are the values in the  keywords  dictio&#8208;
                            nary, see previous item for its definition.

              [4]    The type of a reference can be one of two values,

                     manpage
                            The  identifier  of  the reference is interpreted as
                            symbolic file name, refering to one of the documents
                            the index was made for.

                     url    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as an
                            url, refering to some external location, like a web&#8208;
                            site, etc.

       canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization of a keyword index has the format as
              specified in the previous item, and  then  additionally  satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of the keyword index.

              [1]    The keys found in  all  the  nested  Tcl  dictionaries  are
                     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl&apos;s
                     builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.

              [2]    The references listed for each keyword  of  the  index,  if
                     any,  are  listed  in  ascending  dictionary order of their
                     labels,  as  generated  by  Tcl&apos;s  builtin  command   lsort
                     -increasing -dict.
