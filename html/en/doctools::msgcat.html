NAME
       doctools::msgcat  -  Message  catalog management for the various document
       parsers

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.4

       package require msgcat

       package require doctools::msgcat  ?0.1?

       ::doctools::msgcat::init prefix

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The package doctools::msgcat is a support module handling  the  selection
       of  message  catalogs for the various document processing packages in the
       doctools system version 2. As such it is an internal  package  a  regular
       user (developer) should not be in direct contact with.

       If you are such please go the documentation of either

       [1]    doctools::doc,

       [2]    doctools::toc, or

       [3]    doctools::idx

       Within  the  system  architecture  this package resides under the various
       parser packages, and is shared by them. Underneath it, but  not  explicit
       dependencies,  are  the  packages  providing the message catalogs for the
       various languages.

API
       ::doctools::msgcat::init prefix
              The command locates and loads the message  catalogs  for  all  the
              languages  returned  by  msgcat::mcpreferences, provided that they
              could be found. It returns an integer number describing  how  many
              packages were found and loaded.

              The  names of the packages the command will look for have the form
              &quot;doctools::msgcat::prefix::langcode&quot;, with prefix the argument  to
              the  command,  and  the  langcode  supplied  by the result of msg&#8208;
              cat::mcpreferences.
