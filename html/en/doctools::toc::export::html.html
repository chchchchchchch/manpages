_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package implements the doctools table of contents export plugin for
       the generation of HTML markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level man&#8208;
       agement   packages   handling   tables   of   contents,  especially  doc&#8208;
       tools::toc::export, the export manager.

       Using it from a regular interpreter is possible, however only  with  con&#8208;
       tortions, and is not recommended.  The proper way to use this functional&#8208;
       ity is through the package doctools::toc::export and the  export  manager
       objects it provides.

API
       The  API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the doc&#8208;
       toc export plugin API version 2.

       export serial configuration
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a table of  con&#8208;
              tents,  as specified in section ToC serialization format, and con&#8208;
              tained in serial, the configuration, a dictionary,  and  generates
              HTML  markup  encoding  the  table.   The  created  string is then
              returned as the result of the command.

CONFIGURATION
       The html export plugin recognizes the following  configuration  variables
       and changes its behaviour as they specify.

       string user
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the user
              running the process which invoked the export plugin.   The  plugin
              puts this information into the provenance comment at the beginning
              of the generated document.

       string file
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the file
              the  table  of contents came from. This variable may not be set or
              contain the empty string.  The plugin puts  this  information,  if
              defined,  i.e.  set  and not the empty string, into the provenance
              comment at the beginning of the generated document.

       dictionary map
              This standard configuration variable contains a dictionary mapping
              from  the  (symbolic)  document  ids  in  reference entries to the
              actual filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

              Document ids without a mapping are used unchanged.

       boolean newlines
              If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated html  code
              across lines, with each markup command on a separate line.

              If  this flag is not set (the default), the whole document will be
              written on a single line, with minimum spacing  between  all  ele&#8208;
              ments.

       boolean indented
              If  this  flag  is  set the plugin will indent the markup commands
              according to the structure of indices. To make this work this also
              implies that newlines is set.

              If  this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as
              per the value of newlines, and no indenting is done.

       string meta
              This variable is meant  to  hold  a  fragment  of  HTML  (default:
              empty).  The fragment it contains will be inserted into the gener&#8208;
              ated output in the &lt;head&gt; section of the document, just after  the
              &lt;title&gt; tag.

       string header
              This  variable  is  meant  to  hold  a  fragment of HTML (default:
              empty).  The fragment it contains will be inserted into the gener&#8208;
              ated output just after the &lt;h1&gt; title tag in the body of the docu&#8208;
              ment, in the class.header &lt;div&gt;&apos;ision.

       string footer
              This variable is meant  to  hold  a  fragment  of  HTML  (default:
              empty).  The fragment it contains will be inserted into the gener&#8208;
              ated output just before  the  &lt;/body&gt;  tag,  in  the  class.footer
              &lt;div&gt;&apos;ision.

       dictionary rid
              The value of this variable (default: empty) maps references to the
              identifiers to use as their anchor names. Each reference  FOO  not
              found  in  the dictionary uses REF-FOO as anchor, i.e. itself pre&#8208;
              fixed with the string REF-.

       string sepline
              The value of this variable is the string to use for the  separator
              comments  inserted  into  the  output  when  the outpout is broken
              across lines and/or indented. The default string  consists  of  60
              dashes.

       string class.main
              This  variable  contains the class name for the main &lt;div&gt;&apos;ivision
              of the generated document. The default is doctools.

       string class.header
              This variable contains the class name for the  header  &lt;div&gt;&apos;ision
              of  the generated document. The default is toc-header.  This divi&#8208;
              sion contains the document title, the user  specified  header,  if
              any, and a visible separator line.

       string class.title
              This  variable  contains the class name for the &lt;h1&gt; tag enclosing
              the document title. The default is toc-title.

       string class.navsep
              This variable contains the class name for the &lt;hr&gt;  separators  in
              the  header  and  footer  sections  of the generated document. The
              default is toc-navsep.

       string class.contents
              This variable contains the class name for the  XXXXX  holding  the
              keywords  and  their  references  in  the  generated document. The
              default is toc-contents.

       string class.ref
              This variable contains the class name for the table elements which
              are references to other documents. The default is toc-ref.

       string class.div
              This variable contains the class name for the table elements which
              are divisions. The default is toc-div.

       string class.footer
              This variable contains the class name for the  footer  &lt;div&gt;&apos;ision
              of  the  generated document. The default is toc-footer. This divi&#8208;
              sion contains a browser-visible separator line and the user speci&#8208;
              fied footer, if any.

       Note that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variable format,
       and its value.

TOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to  serialize
       tables of contents as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a ta&#8208;
       ble of contents may have more than one regular serialization only exactly
       one of them will be canonical.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The  serialization of any table of contents is a nested Tcl
                     dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, doctools::toc, and  its
                     value.  This  value holds the contents of the table of con&#8208;
                     tents.

              [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl  dictionary
                     holding  the  title  of the table of contents, a label, and
                     its elements. The relevant keys and their values are

                     title  The value is a string containing the  title  of  the
                            table of contents.

                     label  The value is a string containing a label for the ta&#8208;
                            ble of contents.

                     items  The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of  the
                            table, in the order they are to be shown.

                            Each  element  is a Tcl list holding the type of the
                            item, and its description, in this order. An  alter&#8208;
                            native description would be that it is a Tcl dictio&#8208;
                            nary holding a single key, the item type, mapped  to
                            the item description.

                            The two legal item types and their descriptions are

                            reference
                                   This item describes a single entry in the ta&#8208;
                                   ble of contents, referencing a  single  docu&#8208;
                                   ment.  To this end its value is a Tcl dictio&#8208;
                                   nary containing an id for the referenced doc&#8208;
                                   ument, a label, and a longer textual descrip&#8208;
                                   tion which can be associated with the  entry.
                                   The relevant keys and their values are

                                   id     The  value  is a string containing the
                                          id of the document associated with the
                                          entry.

                                   label  The  value  is  a  string containing a
                                          label for this entry. This string also
                                          identifies   the  entry,  and  no  two
                                          entries (references and divisions)  in
                                          the  containing  list  are  allowed to
                                          have the same label.

                                   desc   The value is  a  string  containing  a
                                          longer description for this entry.

                            division
                                   This item describes a group of entries in the
                                   table of contents, inducing  a  hierarchy  of
                                   entries.  To this end its value is a Tcl dic&#8208;
                                   tionary containing a label for the group,  an
                                   optional  id  to  a  document  for  the whole
                                   group, and the list of entries in the  group.
                                   The relevant keys and their values are

                                   id     The  value  is a string containing the
                                          id of the document associated with the
                                          whole group. This key is optional.

                                   label  The  value  is  a  string containing a
                                          label for the group. This string  also
                                          identifies   the  entry,  and  no  two
                                          entries (references and divisions)  in
                                          the  containing  list  are  allowed to
                                          have the same label.

                                   items  The value is a Tcl  list  holding  the
                                          elements  of  the  group, in the order
                                          they are to be shown.  This  list  has
                                          the  same  structure  as the value for
                                          the keyword items used to describe the
                                          whole  table  of  contents, see above.
                                          This closes the  recusrive  definition
                                          of the structure, with divisions hold&#8208;
                                          ing the same type of elements  as  the
                                          whole  table  of  contents,  including
                                          other divisions.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the  format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this table of contents.

              [1]    The  keys  found  in  all  the  nested Tcl dictionaries are
                     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl&apos;s
                     builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.
