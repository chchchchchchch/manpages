DOTLOCKFILE(1)                  Cistron Utilities                 DOTLOCKFILE(1)



NAME
       dotlockfile - Utility to manage lockfiles

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/dotlockfile [-l [-r retries] |-u|-t|-c] [-p] [-m|lockfile]

DESCRIPTION
       dotlockfile is a command line utility to reliably create, test and remove
       lockfiles.  It creates lockfiles reliably on local and  NFS  filesystems,
       because  the crucial steps of testing for a preexisting lockfile and cre&#8208;
       ating it are performed atomically by a single call to  link(2).   Manpage
       lockfile_create(3) describes the used algorithm.

       dotlockfile  is installed with attribute SETGID mail and thus can also be
       used to lock and unlock mailboxes even if the mailspool directory is only
       writable by group mail.

       The  name dotlockfile comes from the way mailboxes are locked for updates
       on a lot of UNIX systems.  A lockfile is created with the  same  filename
       as the mailbox but with the string &quot;.lock&quot; appended.

       The  names  dotlock and lockfile were already taken - hence the name dot&#8208;
       lockfile :).

OPTIONS
       -l     Create a lockfile if no preexisting valid lockfile is found,  else
              wait  and  retry  according  to  option  -r.   This  option is the
              default.

              A lockfile is treated as valid,
              &#183;  if it holds the process-id of a running process,
              &#183;  or if it does not hold any process-id and has been touched less
              than 5 minutes ago (timestamp is younger than 5 minutes).

       -r retries
              The  number of times dotlockfile retries to acquire the lock if it
              failed the first time before giving up.  The initial  sleep  after
              failing  to  acquire  the lock is 5 seconds.  After each retry the
              sleep intervall is increased incrementally by 5 seconds  up  to  a
              maximum  sleep of 60 seconds between tries.  The default number of
              retries is 5.  To try only once, use &quot;-r 0&quot;.  To try indefinitely,
              use &quot;-r -1&quot;.

       -u     Remove a lockfile.

       -t     Touch  an  existing  lockfile  (update the timestamp).  Useful for
              lockfiles on NFS filesystems.  For lockfiles on local  filesystems
              the -p option is preferable.

       -c     For debugging only:  Check for the existence of a valid lockfile.

              Note:  Testing for a preexisting lockfile and writing of the lock&#8208;
              file must be done by the same &quot;dotlockfile -l&quot; or &quot;dotlockfile -m&quot;
              command, else the lockfile creation cannot be reliable.

       -p     Write  the  process-id  of  the calling process into the lockfile.
              Also when testing for an existing lockfile, check the contents for
              the  process-id  of a running process to verify if the lockfile is
              still  valid.   Obviously  useful  only  for  lockfiles  on  local
              filesystems.

       -m     Lock or unlock the current users mailbox.  The path to the mailbox
              is the default system mailspool directory (usually /var/mail) with
              the  username as gotten from getpwuid() appended.  If the environ&#8208;
              ment variable $MAIL is set, that is used instead.  Then the string
              &quot;.lock&quot; is appended to get the name of the actual lockfile.

       lockfile
              The  lockfile to be created or removed.  Must not be specified, if
              the -m option is in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       Zero on success, and non-zero on failure.   For  the  -c  option,  sucess
       means  that  a  valid  lockfile  is  already  present.  When locking (the
       default, or with the -l option) dotlockfile returns the  same  values  as
       the  library function lockfile_create(3).  Unlocking a non-existant lock&#8208;
       file is not an error.

NOTES
       The lockfile is created exactly as named on the command line.  The exten&#8208;
       sion &quot;.lock&quot; is not automatically appended.

       This  utility  is  a lot like the lockfile(1) utility included with proc&#8208;
       mail, and the mutt_dotlock(1) utility included with  mutt.   However  the
       command-line  arguments  differ,  and  so  does the return status.  It is
       believed, that dotlockfile is the most flexible implementation, since  it
       automatically  detects when it needs to use priviliges to lock a mailbox,
       and does it safely.

       The above mentioned lockfile_create(3) manpage is present in the liblock&#8208;
       file-dev package.

BUGS
       None known.
