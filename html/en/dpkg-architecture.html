NAME
       dpkg-architecture - set and determine the architecture for package build&#8208;
       ing

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-architecture [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-architecture does provide a facility to determine and set the  build
       and host architecture for package building.

       The  build  architecture  is  always  determined  by  an external call to
       dpkg(1), and can not be set at the command line.

       You can specify the host architecture by providing one  or  both  of  the
       options  -a  and  -t.  The  default  is determined by an external call to
       gcc(1), or the same as the build architecture if CC or gcc are  both  not
       available.  One  out  of  -a and -t is sufficient, the value of the other
       will be set to a usable default. Indeed, it is often better to only spec&#8208;
       ify  one, because dpkg-architecture will warn you if your choice does not
       match the default.

COMMANDS
       -l     Print the environment variables, one  each  line,  in  the  format
              VARIABLE=value. This is the default action.

       -edebian-architecture
              Check for equality of architecture. By default debian-architecture
              is compared against the current  Debian  architecture,  being  the
              host.   This  action  will  not expand the architecture wildcards.
              Command finishes with an exit status of 0 if  matched,  1  if  not
              matched.

       -iarchitecture-wildcard
              Check for identity of architecture by expanding architecture-wild&#8208;
              card as an architecture wildcard and comparing against the current
              Debian  architecture. Command finishes with an exit status of 0 if
              matched, 1 if not matched.

       -qvariable-name
              Print the value of a single variable.

       -s     Print an export command. This can be used to set  the  environment
              variables using eval.

       -u     Print a similar command to -s but to unset all variables.

       -c command
              Execute a command in an environment which has all variables set to
              the determined value.

       -L     Print a list of valid architecture names.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       -adebian-architecture
              Set the Debian architecture.
&#12;       -tgnu-system-type
              Set the GNU system type.

       -f     Values set by existing environment variables with the same name as
              used  by the scripts are honored (i.e. used by dpkg-architecture),
              except if this force flag is present.  This  allows  the  user  to
              override a value even when the call to dpkg-architecture is buried
              in some other script (for example dpkg-buildpackage(1)).

TERMS
       build machine
           The machine the package is built on.

       host machine
           The machine the package is built for.

       Debian architecture
           The Debian architecture string, which specifies the  binary  tree  in
           the FTP archive. Examples: i386, sparc, hurd-i386.

       architecture wildcard
           An  architecture  wildcard is a special architecture string that will
           match any real architecture being part of it.  The  general  form  is
           &lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;cpu&gt;.  Examples: linux-any, any-i386, hurd-any.

       GNU system type
           An  architecture  specification  string consisting of two parts sepa&#8208;
           rated  by  a  dash:  cpu  and   system.   Examples:   i386-linux-gnu,
           sparc-linux-gnu, i386-gnu, x86_64-netbsd.

           tem paths.

       DEB_HOST_ARCH
           The Debian architecture of the host machine.

       DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS
           The Debian system name of the host machine.
&#12;       DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU

       DEB_HOST_ARCH_BITS
           The pointer size of the host machine (in bits).

       DEB_HOST_ARCH_ENDIAN
           The endianness of the host machine (little / big).

           The CPU part of DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE.

       DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM
           The System part of DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE.

       DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE
           The GNU system type of the host machine.

       DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
           The clarified GNU system type of the host machine, used for  filesys&#8208;
           tem paths.

DEBIAN/RULES
       The   environment  variables  set  by  dpkg-architecture  are  passed  to
       debian/rules as make variables (see  make  documentation).  However,  you
       should  not rely on them, as this breaks manual invocation of the script.
       Instead, you should always initialize them using  dpkg-architecture  with
       the  -q  option.  Here  are  some  examples,  which also show how you can
       improve the cross compilation support in your package:

       Retrieving the GNU system type and forwarding it to ./configure:

              DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE := $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE)
              DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE := $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
              [...]
              configure --build=$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) --host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)

       Doing something only for a specific architecture:

              DEB_HOST_ARCH := $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)

              ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
                [...]
              endif

       or  if  you  only  need  to  check  the  CPU  or   OS   type,   use   the
       DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU or DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS variables.

       Note  that  you can also rely on an external Makefile snippet to properly
       set all the variables that dpkg-architecture can provide:

              include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk

              ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
                [...]
              endif

       In any case, you should never use dpkg --print-architecture to get archi&#8208;
       tecture information during a package build.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       The  /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk  Makefile  snippet  is  provided  by
       dpkg-dev since version 1.16.1.

       The DEB_*_ARCH_BITS and DEB_*_ARCH_ENDIAN variables  were  introduced  in
       dpkg-dev  1.15.4. Using them in debian/rules thus requires a build-depen&#8208;
       dency on dpkg-dev (&gt;= 1.15.4).

       The DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU and DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS variables were  introduced  in
       dpkg-dev 1.13.2.

       The  -e and -i options were only introduced in relatively recent versions
       of dpkg-architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).

EXAMPLES
       dpkg-buildpackage accepts the -a option and passes it  to  dpkg-architec&#8208;
       ture. Other examples:

              CC=i386-gnu-gcc dpkg-architecture -c debian/rules build

              eval `dpkg-architecture -u`

       Check  if an architecture is equal to the current architecture or a given
       one:

              dpkg-architecture -elinux-alpha

              dpkg-architecture -amips -elinux-mips

       Check if the current architecture or an architecture provided with -a are
       Linux systems:

              dpkg-architecture -ilinux-any

              dpkg-architecture -ai386 -ilinux-any

FILES
       All  these  files have to be present for dpkg-architecture to work. Their
       location can be overridden  at  runtime  with  the  environment  variable
       DPKG_DATADIR.

       /usr/share/dpkg/cputable
              Table of known CPU names and mapping to their GNU name.

       /usr/share/dpkg/ostable
              Table  of  known  operating  system names and mapping to their GNU
              name.

       /usr/share/dpkg/triplettable
              Mapping between Debian architecture triplets and Debian  architec&#8208;
              ture names.
