NAME
       dpkg-buildflags - returns build flags to use during package build

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildflags [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildflags  is  a  tool  to retrieve compilation flags to use during
       build of Debian packages.  The default flags are defined  by  the  vendor
       but they can be extended/overriden in several ways:

       1.     system-wide with /etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf;

       2.     for  the  current  user with $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf
              where $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config;

       3.     temporarily by the user with environment  variables  (see  section
              ENVIRONMENT);

       4.     dynamically  by  the package maintainer with environment variables
              set via debian/rules (see section ENVIRONMENT).

       The configuration files can contain two types of directives:

       SET flag value
              Override the flag named flag to have the value value.

       STRIP flag value
              Strip from the flag named flag  all  the  build  flags  listed  in
              value.

       APPEND flag value
              Extend  the  flag  named  flag  by  appending the options given in
              value.  A space is prepended to the appended value if  the  flag&apos;s
              current value is non-empty.

       PREPEND flag value
              Extend  the  flag  named  flag  by prepending the options given in
              value.  A space is appended to the prepended value if  the  flag&apos;s
              current value is non-empty.

       The  configuration  files  can  contain comments on lines starting with a
       hash (#). Empty lines are also ignored.

COMMANDS
       --dump Print to standard output all compilation flags and  their  values.
              It  prints  one flag per line separated from its value by an equal
              sign (&quot;flag=value&quot;). This is the default action.

       --list Print the list of flags supported by the current vendor  (one  per
              line).  See the SUPPORTED FLAGS section for more information about
              them.

       --status
              Display any information that can be useful to explain  the  behav&#8208;
              iour  of  dpkg-buildflags: relevant environment variables, current
              vendor, state of all feature flags. Also print the resulting  com&#8208;
              piler flags with their origin.

              This  is  intended  to be run from debian/rules, so that the build
              log keeps a clear trace of the build flags used. This can be  use&#8208;
              ful to diagnose problems related to them.

       --export=format
              Print  to standard output shell (if format is sh) or make (if for&#8208;
              mat is make) commands that can be used to export all the  compila&#8208;
              tion  flags  in  the  environment. If format is configure then the
              output can be used on a ./configure command-line.  If  the  format
              value is not given, sh is assumed. Only compilation flags starting
              with an upper case character are included, others are  assumed  to
              not be suitable for the environment.

       --get flag
              Print  the  value  of the flag on standard output. Exits with 0 if
              the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.

       --origin flag
              Print the origin of the value that is  returned  by  --get.  Exits
              with 0 if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1. The origin can
              be one of the following values:

              vendor the original flag set by the vendor is returned;

              system the flag is set/modified by a system-wide configuration;

              user   the flag is set/modified by a user-specific configuration;

              env    the flag is set/modified by an environment-specific config&#8208;
                     uration.

       --query-features area
              Print  the  features  enabled for a given area. The only currently
              recognized area is hardening. Exits with 0 if the  area  is  known
              otherwise exits with 1.

              The  output  format  is  RFC822 header-style, with one section per
              feature.  For example:

                Feature: pie
                Enabled: no

                Feature: stackprotector
                Enabled: yes

       --help Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

SUPPORTED FLAGS
       CFLAGS Options for the C compiler. The default value set  by  the  vendor
              includes  -g  and  the default optimization level (-O2 usually, or
              -O0 if the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable defines noopt).

       CPPFLAGS
              Options for the C preprocessor. Default value: empty.

       CXXFLAGS
              Options for the C++ compiler. Same as CFLAGS.

       FFLAGS Options for the Fortran compiler. Same as CFLAGS.

       LDFLAGS
              Options passed to the compiler when linking executables or  shared
              objects  (if the linker is called directly, then -Wl and , have to
              be stripped from these options). Default value: empty.

FILES
       /etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf
              System wide configuration file.
&#12;       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf    or     $HOME/.config/dpkg/build&#8208;
       flags.conf
              User configuration file.

ENVIRONMENT
       There  are 2 sets of environment variables doing the same operations, the
       first one (DEB_flag_op) should never be used  within  debian/rules.  It&apos;s
       meant  for any user that wants to rebuild the source package with differ&#8208;
       ent build flags. The second set (DEB_flag_MAINT_op) should only  be  used
       in  debian/rules  by  package  maintainers  to change the resulting build
       flags.

       DEB_flag_SET
       DEB_flag_MAINT_SET
              This variable can be used to force  the  value  returned  for  the
              given flag.

       DEB_flag_STRIP
       DEB_flag_MAINT_STRIP
              This  variable  can  be  used to provide a space separated list of
              options that will be stripped from the set of flags  returned  for
              the given flag.

       DEB_flag_APPEND
       DEB_flag_MAINT_APPEND
              This  variable  can be used to append supplementary options to the
              value returned for the given flag.

       DEB_flag_PREPEND
       DEB_flag_MAINT_PREPEND
              This variable can be used to prepend supplementary options to  the
              value returned for the given flag.

       DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS
              This  variable  can  be  used  to disable/enable various hardening
              build flags through the hardening option. See the  HARDENING  sec&#8208;
              tion for details.

HARDENING
       Several  compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help harden
       a resulting binary against memory corruption attacks,  or  provide  addi&#8208;
       tional  warning messages during compilation. Except as noted below, these
       are enabled by default for architectures that support them.

       Each  hardening  feature   can   be   enabled   and   disabled   in   the
       DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS  environment  variable&apos;s hardening value with the
       &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; modifier. For example, to enable the &quot;pie&quot; feature  and  dis&#8208;
       able the &quot;fortify&quot; feature you can do this in debian/rules:

         export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=+pie,-fortify

       The  special  feature  all can be used to enable or disable all hardening
       features at the same time. Thus disabling everything  and  enabling  only
       &quot;format&quot; and &quot;fortify&quot; can be achieved with:

         export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=-all,+format,+fortify

       format This  setting  (enabled  by  default)  adds  -Wformat -Werror=for&#8208;
              mat-security to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. This will warn about improper
              format  string  uses, and will fail when format functions are used
              in a way that represent possible security  problems.  At  present,
              this  warns  about  calls  to printf and scanf functions where the
              format string is not a string literal  and  there  are  no  format
              arguments,  as  in printf(foo); instead of printf(&quot;%s&quot;, foo); This
              may be a security hole if the format string  came  from  untrusted
              input and contains &quot;%n&quot;.

       fortify
              This  setting  (enabled  by  default)  adds -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to
              CPPFLAGS. During code generation the compiler knows a  great  deal
              of  information  about buffer sizes (where possible), and attempts
              to replace insecure unlimited length buffer  function  calls  with
              length-limited  ones.  This  is  especially useful for old, crufty
              code.  Additionally, format strings in writable memory  that  con&#8208;
              tain  &apos;%n&apos; are blocked. If an application depends on such a format
              string, it will need to be worked around.

              Note that for this option to have any effect, the source must also
              be compiled with -O1 or higher.

       stackprotector
              This   setting   (enabled   by   default)  adds  -fstack-protector
              --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. This adds safety
              checks  against stack overwrites. This renders many potential code
              injection attacks into aborting situations. In the best case  this
              turns  code  injection  vulnerabilities  into denial of service or
              into non-issues (depending on the application).

              This feature requires linking against glibc (or  another  provider
              of  __stack_chk_fail),  so needs to be disabled when building with
              -nostdlib or -ffreestanding or similar.

       relro  This setting (enabled by default) adds  -Wl,-z,relro  to  LDFLAGS.
              During  program load, several ELF memory sections need to be writ&#8208;
              ten to by the linker. This flags the loader to turn these sections
              read-only before turning over control to the program. Most notably
              this prevents GOT overwrite attacks. If this option  is  disabled,
              bindnow will become disabled as well.

       bindnow
              This  setting  (disabled  by  default) adds -Wl,-z,now to LDFLAGS.
              During program load, all dynamic symbols  are  resolved,  allowing
              for  the  entire  PLT to be marked read-only (due to relro above).
              The option cannot become enabled if relro is not enabled.

       pie    This setting (disabled  by  default)  adds  -fPIE  to  CFLAGS  and
              CXXFLAGS,  and  -fPIE  -pie  to LDFLAGS. Position Independent Exe&#8208;
              cutable are needed to take advantage of Address Space Layout  Ran&#8208;
              domization,  supported  by  some  kernel  versions. While ASLR can
              already be enforced for data areas in the stack and heap (brk  and
              mmap),  the  code  areas must be compiled as position-independent.
              Shared libraries already do this (-fPIC), so they gain ASLR  auto&#8208;
              matically,  but  binary .text regions need to be build PIE to gain
              ASLR. When this happens, ROP (Return Oriented Programming) attacks
              are  much harder since there are no static locations to bounce off
              of during a memory corruption attack.

              This is not compatible with -fPIC  so  care  must  be  taken  when
              building shared objects.

              Additionally,  since  PIE  is  implemented via a general register,
              some architectures (most notably i386) can see performance  losses
              of  up  to  15%  in very text-segment-heavy application workloads;
              most workloads see less than 1%. Architectures with  more  general
              registers (e.g. amd64) do not see as high a worst-case penalty.
