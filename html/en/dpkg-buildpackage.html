NAME
       dpkg-buildpackage - build binary or source packages from sources

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildpackage [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildpackage  is  a program that automates the process of building a
       Debian package. It consists of the following steps:

       1. It prepares the build environment by setting various environment vari&#8208;
          ables  (see  ENVIRONMENT) and calls dpkg-source --before-build (unless
          -T or --target has been used).

       2. It checks that the build-dependencies and build-conflicts  are  satis&#8208;
          fied (unless -d is specified).

       3. If a specific target has been selected with the -T or --target option,
          it calls that target and  stops  here.  Otherwise  it  calls  fakeroot
          debian/rules clean to clean the build-tree (unless -nc is specified).

       4. It  calls  dpkg-source  -b  to  generate  the source package (unless a
          binary-only build has been requested with -b, -B or -A).

       5. It calls debian/rules build-target followed by  fakeroot  debian/rules
          binary-target (unless a source-only build has been requested with -S).
          Note that build-target and binary-target are either build  and  binary
          (default  case,  or if -b is specified), or build-arch and binary-arch
          (if -B is specified), or build-indep and binary-indep (if -A is speci&#8208;
          fied).

       6. It calls gpg to sign the .dsc file (if any, unless -us is specified).

       7. It   calls   dpkg-genchanges   to  generate  a  .changes  file.   Many
          dpkg-buildpackage options are forwarded to dpkg-genchanges.

       8. It calls gpg to sign the .changes file (unless -uc is specified).

       9. If -tc is specified, it will call fakeroot debian/rules  clean  again.
          Finally it calls dpkg-source --after-build.

OPTIONS
       -b     Specifies  a  binary-only  build,  no source files are to be built
              and/or distributed. Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -B     Specifies a binary-only build, limited to  architecture  dependent
              packages.  Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -A     Specifies a binary-only build, limited to architecture independent
              packages. Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -S     Specifies a source-only build, no binary packages need to be made.
              Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -F     Specifies  a normal full build, binary and source packages will be
              built.  This is the same as the default case when no build  option
              is specified.

       --target=target
       --target target
       -Ttarget
              Calls debian/rules target after having setup the build environment
              and stops the package build process here.  If  --as-root  is  also
              given,  then  the  command is executed as root (see -r). Note that
              official targets that are required to be run as root by the Debian
              policy do not need this option.

       --as-root
              Only  meaningful  together with --target. Requires that the target
              be run with root rights.

       -si
       -sa
       -sd
       -vversion
       -Cchanges-description
       -mmaintainer-address
       -emaintainer-address
              Passed unchanged to dpkg-genchanges. See its manual page.

       -aarchitecture
              Specify the Debian architecture we build for. The architecture  of
              the  machine  we build on is determined automatically, and is also
              the default for the host machine.

       -tgnu-system-type
              Specify the GNU system type we build for. It can be used in  place
              of  -a  or as a complement to override the default GNU system type
              of the target Debian architecture.

       -jjobs Number of jobs allowed to be run simultaneously, equivalent to the
              make(1)  option of the same name. Will add itself to the MAKEFLAGS
              environment variable, which should cause all subsequent make invo&#8208;
              cations  to  inherit  the  option.  Also adds parallel=jobs to the
              DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable which  allows  debian/rules
              files  to use this information for their own purposes.  The paral&#8208;
              lel=jobs in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable  will  override
              the -j value if this option is given.

       -D     Check build dependencies and conflicts; abort if unsatisfied. This
              is the default behavior.

       -d     Do not check build dependencies and conflicts.

       -nc    Do not clean the source tree (implies -b if nothing else has  been
              selected among -B, -A or -S).

       -tc    Clean the source tree (using gain-root-command debian/rules clean)
              after the package has been built.

       -rgain-root-command
              When dpkg-buildpackage needs to execute part of the build  process
              as  root,  it prefixes the command it executes with gain-root-com&#8208;
              mand if one has been specified. Otherwise, if none has been speci&#8208;
              fied, fakeroot will be used by default, if the command is present.
              gain-root-command should start with the name of a program  on  the
              PATH and will get as arguments the name of the real command to run
              and the arguments it should take.  gain-root-command  can  include
              parameters (they must be space-separated) but no shell metacharac&#8208;
              ters.  gain-root-command might typically be fakeroot, sudo,  super
              or  really.   su  is  not  suitable,  since it can only invoke the
              user&apos;s shell with -c instead of passing arguments individually  to
              the command to be run.

       -Rrules-file
              Building  a  Debian package usually involves invoking debian/rules
              as a command with several standard parameters.  With  this  option
              it&apos;s possible to use another program invocation to build the pack&#8208;
              age (it can include space separated parameters).  Alternatively it
              can  be  used to execute the standard rules file with another make
              program (for example by using /usr/local/bin/make -f  debian/rules
              as rules-file).

       -psign-command
              When  dpkg-buildpackage needs to execute GPG to sign a source con&#8208;
              trol (.dsc) file or a  .changes  file  it  will  run  sign-command
              (searching  the  PATH  if  necessary) instead of gpg. sign-command
              will get all the arguments that gpg would have  gotten.  sign-com&#8208;
              mand should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.

       -kkey-id
              Specify a key-ID to use when signing packages.

       -us    Do not sign the source package.

       -uc    Do not sign the .changes file.

       -i[regexp]
       -I[pattern]
       -s[nsAkurKUR]
       -z, -Z
              Passed unchanged to dpkg-source. See its manual page.

       --source-option=opt
              Pass option opt to dpkg-source.

       --changes-option=opt
              Pass option opt to dpkg-genchanges.

       --admindir=dir
       --admindir dir
              Change  the location of the dpkg database. The default location is
              /var/lib/dpkg.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       Even if dpkg-buildpackage exports some variables, debian/rules should not
       rely on their presence and should instead use the respective interface to
       retrieve the needed values.

   Variables set by dpkg-architecture
       dpkg-architecture is called with the -a and -t parameters forwarded.  Any
       variable that is output by its -s option is integrated in the build envi&#8208;
       ronment.

   Compiler flags are no longer exported
       Between versions 1.14.17 and 1.16.1, dpkg-buildpackage exported  compiler
       flags  (CFLAGS,  CXXFLAGS,  FFLAGS,  CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS) with values as
       returned by dpkg-buildflags. This is no longer the case.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       dpkg-buildpackage is using the build-arch and build-indep  targets  since
       version  1.16.2. Those targets are thus mandatory. But to avoid breakages
       of existing packages, and ease the transition, it will fallback to  using
       the  build  target  if make -f debian/rules -qn build-target returns 2 as
       exit code.

BUGS
       It should be possible to specify spaces and shell metacharacters  in  and
       initial arguments for gain-root-command and sign-command.
