NAME
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps - check build dependencies and conflicts

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps [option...]  [control-file]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  checks  the  installed  packages in the system against the
       build dependencies and build conflicts listed in the control file. If any
       are not met, it displays them and exits with a nonzero return code.

       By default, debian/control is read, but an alternate control filename may
       be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       --admindir=dir
              Change the location of the dpkg database. The default location  is
              /var/lib/dpkg.

       -A     Ignore Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Arch lines. Use when
              only arch-indep packages will be built, or combine  with  -B  when
              only a source package is to be built.

       -B     Ignore  Build-Depends-Indep  and  Build-Conflicts-Indep lines. Use
              when only arch-dep packages will be built, or combine with -A when
              only a source package is to be built.

       -d build-depends-string

       -c build-conflicts-string
              Use  the  given build dependencies/conflicts instead of those con&#8208;
              tained in the debian/control file.

       -a arch
              Check  build  dependencies/conflicts  assuming  that  the  package
              described  in  the  control file is to be built for the given host
              architecture instead of the architecture of the current system.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.
