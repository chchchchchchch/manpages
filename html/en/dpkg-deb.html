NAME
       dpkg-deb - Debian package archive (.deb) manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-deb [option...] command

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-deb packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian archives.

       Use dpkg to install and remove packages from your system.

       You  can  also  invoke dpkg-deb by calling dpkg with whatever options you
       want to pass to dpkg-deb. dpkg will spot that you wanted dpkg-deb and run
       it for you.

COMMANDS
       -b, --build directory [archive|directory]
              Creates a debian archive from the filesystem tree stored in direc&#8208;
              tory. directory must have a DEBIAN  subdirectory,  which  contains
              the  control  information  files  such as the control file itself.
              This directory will not appear in the binary package&apos;s  filesystem
              archive,  but  instead  the  files in it will be put in the binary
              package&apos;s control information area.

              Unless you specify --nocheck, dpkg-deb  will  read  DEBIAN/control
              and  parse  it. It will check it for syntax errors and other prob&#8208;
              lems, and display the name of  the  binary  package  being  built.
              dpkg-deb will also check the permissions of the maintainer scripts
              and other files found in the DEBIAN control information directory.

              If no archive is specified then dpkg-deb will  write  the  package
              into the file directory.deb.

              If  the  archive to be created already exists it will be overwrit&#8208;
              ten.

              If the second argument is a directory then dpkg-deb will write  to
              the  file  package_version_arch.deb,  or package_version.deb if no
              Architecture field is present in the package control file. When  a
              target  directory  is specified, rather than a file, the --nocheck
              option may not be used (since dpkg-deb needs to read and parse the
              package control file to determine which filename to use).

       -I, --info archive [control-file-name...]
              Provides information about a binary package archive.

              If  no  control-file-names are specified then it will print a sum&#8208;
              mary of the contents of the package as well as its control file.

              If any control-file-names are specified then dpkg-deb  will  print
              them  in  the  order they were specified; if any of the components
              weren&apos;t present it will print an error  message  to  stderr  about
              each one and exit with status 2.

       -W, --show archive
              Provides  information about a binary package archive in the format
              specified by the --showformat argument. The  default  format  dis&#8208;
              plays  the  package&apos;s name and version on one line, separated by a
              tabulator.

       -f, --field archive [control-field-name...]
              Extracts control file information from a binary package archive.
&#12;              If no control-file-fields are specified then  it  will  print  the
              whole control file.

              If  any  are specified then dpkg-deb will print their contents, in
              the order in which they appear in the control file. If  more  than
              one  control-file-field  is  specified  then dpkg-deb will precede
              each with its field name (and a colon and space).

              No errors are reported for fields requested but not found.

       -c, --contents archive
              Lists the contents of the filesystem tree archive portion  of  the
              package  archive. It is currently produced in the format generated
              by tar&apos;s verbose listing.

       -x, --extract archive directory
              Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into the spec&#8208;
              ified directory.

              Note  that  extracting  a  package  to the root directory will not
              result in a correct installation! Use dpkg to install packages.

              directory (but not its parents) will be created if necessary,  and
              its permissions modified to match the contents of the package.

       -X, --vextract archive directory
              Is  like --extract (-x) with --verbose (-v) which prints a listing
              of the files extracted as it goes.

       -R, --raw-extract archive directory
              Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into a  speci&#8208;
              fied  directory,  and  the control information files into a DEBIAN
              subdirectory of the specified directory.

              The target directory (but not its parents) will be created if nec&#8208;
              essary.

       --fsys-tarfile archive
              Extracts  the filesystem tree data from a binary package and sends
              it to standard output in tar format. Together with tar(1) this can
              be  used to extract a particular file from a package archive.  The
              input archive will always be processed sequentially.

       -e, --control archive [directory]
              Extracts the control information files from a package archive into
              the specified directory.

              If  no  directory  is  specified then a subdirectory DEBIAN in the
              current directory is used.

              The target directory (but not its parents) will be created if nec&#8208;
              essary.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       --showformat=format
              This  option  is  used  to specify the format of the output --show
              will produce. The format is a string that will be output for  each
              package listed.

              The  string  may  reference  any  status field using the &quot;${field-
              name}&quot; form, a list of the valid fields  can  be  easily  produced
              using  -I  on the same package. A complete explanation of the for&#8208;
              matting options (including escape sequences and field tabbing) can
              be  found  in  the  explanation  of  the  --showformat  option  in
              dpkg-query(1).

              The default for this field is &quot;${Package}\t${Version}\n&quot;.

       -zcompress-level
              Specify which compression level to use on the compressor  backend,
              when building a package (default is 9 for gzip and bzip2, 6 for xz
              and lzma).  The accepted values are 0-9 with: 0  being  mapped  to
              compressor  none for gzip and 0 mapped to 1 for bzip2. Before dpkg
              1.16.2 level 0 was equivalent to compressor none for all  compres&#8208;
              sors.

       -Scompress-strategy
              Specify  which compression strategy to use on the compressor back&#8208;
              end, when building a package (since dpkg 1.16.2).  Allowed  values
              are none (since dpkg 1.16.4) and extreme for xz.

       -Zcompress-type
              Specify  which  compression  type  to use when building a package.
              Allowed values are gzip, xz, bzip2, lzma,  and  none  (default  is
              gzip).

       --new  Ensures  that  dpkg-deb builds a `new&apos; format archive. This is the
              default.

       --old  Forces dpkg-deb to build an `old&apos; format archive. This old archive
              format  is less easily parsed by non-Debian tools and is now obso&#8208;
              lete; its only use is when building packages to be parsed by  ver&#8208;
              sions  of  dpkg  older  than  0.93.76  (September 1995), which was
              released as i386 a.out only.

       --nocheck
              Inhibits dpkg-deb --build&apos;s usual checks on the proposed  contents
              of  an  archive. You can build any archive you want, no matter how
              broken, this way.

       -v, --verbose
              Enables verbose output. This currently only affects --extract mak&#8208;
              ing it behave like --vextract.

       -D, --debug
              Enables debugging output. This is not very interesting.

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR If  set,  dpkg-deb will use it as the directory in which to create
              temporary files and directories.

BUGS
       dpkg-deb -I package1.deb package2.deb does the wrong thing.

       There is no authentication on .deb files; in fact,  there  isn&apos;t  even  a
       straightforward checksum.  (Higher level tools like APT support authenti&#8208;
       cating .deb packages retrieved from a given repository, and most packages
       nowadays provide an md5sum control file generated by debian/rules. Though
       this is not directly supported by the lower level tools.)

       Do not attempt to use just dpkg-deb to install  software!  You  must  use
       dpkg  proper  to  ensure  that all the files are correctly placed and the
       package&apos;s scripts run and its status and contents recorded.
