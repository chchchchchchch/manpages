dpkg-divert(8)                   dpkg utilities                   dpkg-divert(8)



NAME
       dpkg-divert - override a package&apos;s version of a file

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-divert [option...]  command

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-divert  is  the utility used to set up and update the list of diver&#8208;
       sions.

       File diversions are a way of forcing dpkg(1) not to install a  file  into
       its  location, but to a diverted location. Diversions can be used through
       the Debian package scripts to move a file away when it causes a conflict.
       System administrators can also use it to override some package&apos;s configu&#8208;
       ration file, or whenever some files (which aren&apos;t marked as  &apos;conffiles&apos;)
       need  to be preserved by dpkg, when installing a newer version of a pack&#8208;
       age which contains those files.


COMMANDS
       [--add] file
              Add a diversion for file.

       --remove file
              Remove a diversion for file.

       --list glob-pattern
              List diversions matching glob-pattern.

       --listpackage file
              Print the name of the package that diverts file.  Prints LOCAL  if
              file is locally diverted and nothing if file is not diverted.

       --truename file
              Print the real name for a diverted file.

OPTIONS
       --admindir directory
              Set the dpkg data directory to directory (default: /var/lib/dpkg).

       --divert divert-to
              divert-to  is the location where the versions of file, as provided
              by other packages, will be diverted.

       --local
              Specifies that all packages&apos; versions of this file  are  diverted.
              This  means, that there are no exceptions, and whatever package is
              installed, the file is diverted. This can be used by an  admin  to
              install a locally modified version.

       --package package
              package  is  the  name of a package whose copy of file will not be
              diverted. i.e. file will be diverted for all packages except pack&#8208;
              age.

       --quiet
              Quiet mode, i.e. no verbose output.

       --rename
              Actually  move  the  file  aside (or back). dpkg-divert will abort
              operation in case the destination file already exists.
&#12;       --test Test mode, i.e. don&apos;t actually perform any  changes,  just  demon&#8208;
              strate.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

NOTES
       When  adding,  default  is  --local  and  --divert original.distrib. When
       removing, --package or --local and --divert must match if specified.

       Directories can&apos;t be diverted with dpkg-divert.

       Care should be taken when diverting shared libraries, ldconfig(8) creates
       a  symbolic  link  based  on the DT_SONAME field embedded in the library.
       Because ldconfig doesn&apos;t honour diverts (only dpkg does), the symlink may
       end  up  pointing  at the diverted library, if a diverted library has the
       same SONAME as the undiverted one.

EXAMPLES
       To divert all copies of a /usr/bin/example to /usr/bin/example.foo,  i.e.
       directs   all  packages  providing  /usr/bin/example  to  install  it  as
       /usr/bin/example.foo, performing the rename if required:

       dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/example.foo --rename /usr/bin/example

       To remove that diversion:

       dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/bin/example


       To  divert  any   package   trying   to   install   /usr/bin/example   to
       /usr/bin/example.foo, except your own wibble package:

       dpkg-divert   --package  wibble  --divert  /usr/bin/example.foo  --rename
              /usr/bin/example

       To remove that diversion:

       dpkg-divert --package wibble --rename --remove /usr/bin/example

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ADMINDIR
              If set and the --admindir option has not been specified,  it  will
              be used as the dpkg data directory.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE
              If  set and the --local and --package options have not been speci&#8208;
              fied, dpkg-divert will use it as the package name.

FILES
       /var/lib/dpkg/diversions
              File which contains the current list of diversions of the  system.
              It  is  located  in  the dpkg administration directory, along with
              other files important to dpkg, such as status or available.
              Note: dpkg-divert preserves the old copy of this file, with exten&#8208;
              sion -old, before replacing it with the new one.
