DPKG-GENBUILDDEPS(1)                                        DPKG-GENBUILDDEPS(1)



NAME
       dpkg-genbuilddeps  - generate a list of packages used to build this pack&#8208;
       age

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-genbuilddeps [arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a wrapper around dpkg-depcheck(1).  It should be run from
       the  top  of  a  Debian  build tree.  It calls dpkg-buildpackage with any
       arguments given on the command line, and  by  tracing  the  execution  of
       this,  it  determines  which  non-essential packages were used during the
       package building.  This can be useful  in  determining  what  the  Build-
       Depends control fields should contain.  It does not determine which pack&#8208;
       ages were used for the arch independent parts of the build and which  for
       the arch dependent parts, not does it attempt to determine which versions
       of packages are required.  It should be able to run under fakeroot rather
       than  being run as root, as fakeroot dpkg-genbuilddeps, or dpkg-genbuild&#8208;
       deps -rfakeroot.

       This program requires the build-essential package to be installed.  If it
       is not, please use dpkg-depcheck directly, with a command such as
         dpkg-depcheck --all dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot ...
       All this program itself does is essentially to run the command:
         dpkg-depcheck -b dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot [arg ...]
