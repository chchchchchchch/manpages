NAME
       dpkg-maintscript-helper  -  works  around known dpkg limitations in main&#8208;
       tainer scripts

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-maintscript-helper command  [parameter...]  --  maint-script-parame&#8208;
       ter...

COMMANDS AND PARAMETERS
       rm_conffile conffile [prior-version [package]]

       mv_conffile old-conffile new-conffile [prior-version [package]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is designed to be run within maintainer scripts to achieve
       some tasks that dpkg can&apos;t (yet) handle natively either because of design
       decisions or due to current limitations.

       Many  of  those tasks require coordinated actions from several maintainer
       scripts (preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm). To avoid  mistakes  the  same
       call simply needs to be put in all scripts and the program will automati&#8208;
       cally  adapt  its   behaviour   based   on   the   environment   variable
       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME  and  on  the maintainer scripts arguments that you
       have to forward after a double dash.

CONFFILE RELATED TASKS
       When upgrading a package, dpkg will not automatically remove  a  conffile
       (a  configuration file for which dpkg should preserve user changes) if it
       is not present in the newer version. There are two principal reasons  for
       this;  the  first  is that the conffile could&apos;ve been dropped by accident
       and the next version could restore it, users wouldn&apos;t want their  changes
       thrown  away.  The second is to allow packages to transition files from a
       dpkg-maintained conffile to a file maintained by the package&apos;s maintainer
       scripts, usually with a tool like debconf or ucf.

       This  means that if a package is intended to rename or remove a conffile,
       it must explicitly do so  and  dpkg-maintscript-helper  can  be  used  to
       implement  graceful  deletion  and  moving of conffiles within maintainer
       scripts.

   REMOVING A CONFFILE
       If a conffile is completely removed, it  should  be  removed  from  disk,
       unless  the  user has modified it. If there are local modifications, they
       should be preserved. If the package upgrades aborts, the  newly  obsolete
       conffile should not disappear.

       All  of this is implemented by putting the following shell snippet in the
       preinst, postinst and postrm maintainer scripts:

           dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile \
               conffile prior-version package -- &quot;$@&quot;

       conffile is the filename of the conffile to remove.

       prior-version defines the latest version of  the  package  whose  upgrade
       should  trigger  the  removal. It is important to calculate prior-version
       correctly so that conffiles  are  correctly  removed  even  if  the  user
       rebuilt  the  package  with  a local version. For example, for a conffile
       removed in version 2.0-1 of a package, prior-version  should  be  set  to
       2.0-1~.  This  will  cause  the  conffile  to be removed even if the user
       rebuilt the previous version 1.0-1 as 1.0-1local1.
&#12;       If the conffile has not been shipped for several versions,  and  you  are
       now  modifying  the  maintainer  scripts  to  clean up the obsolete file,
       prior-version should be based on the version of the package that you  are
       now preparing, not the first version of the package that lacked the conf&#8208;
       file.

       package   is   the   package   name.   If   empty   or    omitted,    the
       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE  environment  variable  (as set by dpkg) will be
       used.

       All the parameters of the maintainer scripts have to be forwarded to  the
       program after &quot;--&quot;.

       Current  implementation:  in  the  preinst, it checks if the conffile was
       modified and renames it either to conffile.dpkg-remove (if not  modified)
       or  to  conffile.dpkg-backup  (if  modified). In the postinst, the latter
       file is renamed to conffile.dpkg-bak and kept for reference  as  it  con&#8208;
       tains  user  modifications but the former will be removed. If the package
       upgrade aborts, the  postrm  reinstalls  the  original  conffile.  During
       purge, the postrm will also delete the .dpkg-bak file kept up to now.

   RENAMING A CONFFILE
       If  a  conffile  is  moved from one location to another, you need to make
       sure you move across any changes the user has made. This may seem a  sim&#8208;
       ple  change  to  the preinst script at first, however that will result in
       the user being prompted by dpkg to approve the conffile edits even though
       they are not responsible of them.

       Graceful renaming can be implemented by putting the following shell snip&#8208;
       pet in the preinst, postinst and postrm maintainer scripts:

           dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile \
               old-conffile new-conffile prior-version package -- &quot;$@&quot;

       old-conffile and new-conffile are the old and new name of the conffile to
       rename.

       prior-version  defines  the  latest  version of the package whose upgrade
       should trigger the rename of the conffile (see the notes for  rm_conffile
       above  concerning  the correct value). If prior-version is empty or omit&#8208;
       ted, then the operation is tried on every upgrade (note:  it&apos;s  safer  to
       give the version and have the operation tried only once).

       package    is    the   package   name.   If   empty   or   omitted,   the
       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE environment variable (as set by  dpkg)  will  be
       used.

       All  the parameters of the maintainer scripts have to be forwarded to the
       program after &quot;--&quot;.

       Current implementation: the preinst checks if the conffile has been modi&#8208;
       fied,  if  yes  it&apos;s  left  on  place otherwise it&apos;s renamed to old-conf&#8208;
       file.dpkg-remove.  On  configuration,  the  postinst  removes   old-conf&#8208;
       file.dpkg-remove and renames old-conffile to new-conffile if old-conffile
       is still available. On abort-upgrade/abort-install,  the  postrm  renames
       old-conffile.dpkg-remove back to old-conffile if required.

INTEGRATION IN PACKAGES
       Given  that  dpkg-maintscript-helper  is  used  in  the preinst, using it
       unconditionally requires a pre-dependency to  ensure  that  the  required
       version of dpkg has been unpacked before. The required version depends on
       the command used, for rm_conffile and mv_conffile it is 1.15.7.2:

           Pre-Depends: dpkg (&gt;= 1.15.7.2)

       But in many cases the operation done by the program is not  critical  for
       the  package,  and instead of using a pre-dependency we can call the pro&#8208;
       gram only if we know that the required command is supported by  the  cur&#8208;
       rently installed dpkg:

           if dpkg-maintscript-helper supports command; then
               dpkg-maintscript-helper command ...
           fi
