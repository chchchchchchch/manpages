NAME
       dpkg-name - rename Debian packages to full package names

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-name [option...]  [--] file...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the dpkg-name program which provides an easy
       way to rename Debian packages into their full package names. A full pack&#8208;
       age  name consists of package_version_architecture.package-type as speci&#8208;
       fied in the control file of the package. The version part of the filename
       consists  of  the  upstream  version information optionally followed by a
       hyphen and the revision information. The  package-type  part  comes  from
       that field if present or fallbacks to deb.

OPTIONS
       -a, --no-architecture
              The  destination  filename will not have the architecture informa&#8208;
              tion.

       -k, --symlink
              Create a symlink, instead of moving.

       -o, --overwrite
              Existing files will be overwritten if they have the same  name  as
              the destination filename.

       -s, --subdir [dir]
              Files will be moved into a subdirectory. If the directory given as
              argument exists the files will be moved into that directory other&#8208;
              wise  the  name of the target directory is extracted from the sec&#8208;
              tion field in the control part of the package. The  target  direc&#8208;
              tory  will  be `unstable/binary-architecture/section&apos;. If the sec&#8208;
              tion is not found in the control, then  `no-section&apos;  is  assumed,
              and in this case, as well as for sections `non-free&apos; and `contrib&apos;
              the target directory is `section/binary-architecture&apos;. The section
              field  isn&apos;t  required so a lot of packages will find their way to
              the `no-section&apos; area. Use this option with care, it&apos;s messy.

       -c, --create-dir
              This option can used together with the  -s  option.  If  a  target
              directory  isn&apos;t found it will be created automatically.  Use this
              option with care.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       -v, --version
              Show the version and exit.

EXAMPLES
       dpkg-name bar-foo.deb
              The file `bar-foo.deb&apos; will be renamed  to  bar-foo_1.0-2_i386.deb
              or  something similar (depending on whatever information is in the
              control part of `bar-foo.deb&apos;).

       find /root/debian/ -name &apos;*.deb&apos; | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a
              All files with the extension `deb&apos; in the  directory  /root/debian
              and  its  subdirectory&apos;s  will be renamed by dpkg-name if required
              into names with no architecture information.

       find -name &apos;*.deb&apos; | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a -o -s -c
              Don&apos;t do this.  Your archive will be messed up completely  because
              a  lot  of packages don&apos;t come with section information.  Don&apos;t do
              this.

       dpkg-deb --build debian-tmp &amp;&amp; dpkg-name -o -s .. debian-tmp.deb
              This can be used when building new packages.

BUGS
       Some packages don&apos;t follow the name  structure  package_version_architec&#8208;
       ture.deb.  Packages renamed by dpkg-name will follow this structure. Gen&#8208;
       erally this will have no impact on how packages  are  installed  by  dse&#8208;
       lect(1)/dpkg(1), but other installation tools might depend on this naming
       structure.
