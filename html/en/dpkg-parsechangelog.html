dpkg-parsechangelog(1)           dpkg utilities           dpkg-parsechangelog(1)



NAME
       dpkg-parsechangelog - parse Debian changelog files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-parsechangelog [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-parsechangelog  reads and parses the changelog of an unpacked Debian
       source tree and outputs the information in it to  standard  output  in  a
       machine-readable form.

OPTIONS
       -lchangelog-file
              Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The default
              is debian/changelog.

       -Fchangelog-format
              Specifies the format of the changelog. By default  the  format  is
              read from a special line near the bottom of the changelog or fail&#8208;
              ing  that  defaults  to  the  debian  standard  format.  See  also
              CHANGELOG FORMATS.

       -Llibdir
              Specify  an  additional  directory  to  search for parser scripts.
              This directory is searched before the  default  directories  which
              are      currently      /usr/local/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog     and
              /usr/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

   Parser Options
       The following options  can  be  used  to  influence  the  output  of  the
       changelog  parser, e.g. the range of entries or the format of the output.
       They need to be supported by the parser  script  in  question.  See  also
       CAVEATS.

       --format output-format
              Set  the  output  format.  Currently supported values are dpkg and
              rfc822.  dpkg is the  classic  output  format  (from  before  this
              option  existed)  and the default. It consists of one paragraph in
              Debian control format (see deb-control(5)). If more than one entry
              is  requested,  then  most  fields  are taken from the most recent
              entry, except otherwise stated:

              Source: pkg-name

              Version: version

              Distribution: target-distribution

              Urgency: urgency
                     The highest urgency of all included entries is  used,  fol&#8208;
                     lowed  by  the concatenated (space-separated) comments from
                     all the versions requested.

              Maintainer: author

              Date: date

              Closes: bug-number
                     The Closes fields of all included entries are merged.
&#12;              Changes: changelog-entries
                     The text of all changelog entries is concatenated. To  make
                     this  field  a  valid Debian control format multiline field
                     empty lines are replaced with a single full  stop  and  all
                     lines is intended by one space character. The exact content
                     depends on the changelog format.

              The Version, Distribution, Urgency, Maintainer and Changes  fields
              are mandatory.

              There might be additional user-defined fields present.

              The  rfc822  format  uses  the  same fields but outputs a separate
              paragraph for each changelog entry so that all metadata  for  each
              entry is preserved.

       --since version, -sversion, -vversion
              include all changes later than version.

       --until version, -uversion
              include all changes earlier than version.

       --from version, -fversion
              include all changes equal or later than version.

       --to version, -tversion
              include all changes up to or equal than version.

       --count number, -cnumber, -nnumber
              include  number  entries  from  the  top (or the tail if number is
              lower than 0).

       --offset number, -onumber
              change the starting point for --count, counted from  the  top  (or
              the tail if number is lower than 0).

       --all  include  all changes. Note: other options have no effect when this
              is in use.

CHANGELOG FORMATS
       It is possible to use a different format to the standard one, by  provid&#8208;
       ing a parser for that alternative format.

       In  order  to have dpkg-parsechangelog run the new parser, a line must be
       included within the last 40 lines of the  changelog  file,  matching  the
       Perl regular expression: &#8220;\schangelog-format:\s+([0-9a-z]+)\W&#8221;.  The part
       in parentheses should be the name of the format. For example:

              @@@ changelog-format: otherformat @@@

       Changelog format names are non-empty strings of alphanumerics.

       If such a line exists then dpkg-parsechangelog will look for  the  parser
       as  /usr/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog/otherformat  or /usr/local/lib/dpkg/par&#8208;
       sechangelog/otherformat; it is an error for it not being present  or  not
       being an executable program.  The default changelog format is debian, and
       a parser for it is provided by default.

       The parser will be invoked with the changelog open on standard  input  at
       the start of the file. It should read the file (it may seek if it wishes)
       to determine the information required and return the  parsed  information
       to  standard  output  in the format specified by the --format option.  It
       should accept all Parser Options.

       If the changelog format which is being parsed  always  or  almost  always
       leaves  a  blank  line between individual change notes, these blank lines
       should be stripped out, so as to make the resulting output compact.

       If the changelog format does not contain date or package name information
       this information should be omitted from the output. The parser should not
       attempt to synthesize it or find it from other sources.

       If the changelog does not have the expected format the parser should exit
       with a nonzero exit status, rather than trying to muddle through and pos&#8208;
       sibly generating incorrect output.

       A changelog parser may not interact with the user at all.

CAVEATS
       All Parser Options except for -v are  only  supported  in  dpkg,  version
       1.14.16  and  later. Third party parsers for changelog formats other than
       debian might not support all options.

FILES
       debian/changelog
              The changelog file, used to obtain  version-dependent  information
              about  the source package, such as the urgency and distribution of
              an upload, the changes made since a particular  release,  and  the
              source version number itself.
