NAME
       dpkg-query - a tool to query the dpkg database

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-query [option...] command

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-query  is  a  tool  to show information about packages listed in the
       dpkg database.

COMMANDS
       -l, --list [package-name-pattern...]
              List packages matching given pattern. If  no  package-name-pattern
              is given, list all packages in /var/lib/dpkg/status, excluding the
              ones marked as not-installed (i.e. those which  have  been  previ&#8208;
              ously purged). Normal shell wildchars are allowed in package-name-
              pattern. Please note you will probably have to quote package-name-
              pattern  to  prevent the shell from performing filename expansion.
              For example  this  will  list  all  package  names  starting  with
              &#8220;libc6&#8221;:

                dpkg-query -l &apos;libc6*&apos;

              The first three columns of the output show the desired action, the
              package status, and errors, in that order.

              Desired action:
                u = Unknown
                i = Install
                h = Hold
                r = Remove
                p = Purge

              Package status:
                n = Not-installed
                c = Config-files
                H = Half-installed
                U = Unpacked
                F = Half-configured
                W = Triggers-awaiting
                t = Triggers-pending
                i = Installed

              Error flags:
                &lt;empty&gt; = (none)
                R = Reinst-required

              An uppercase status or  error  letter  indicates  the  package  is
              likely  to  cause  severe  problems.  Please  refer to dpkg(1) for
              information about the above states and flags.

              The output format of this option is not configurable,  but  varies
              automatically  to fit the terminal width. It is intended for human
              readers, and is not easily machine-readable. See -W  (--show)  and
              --showformat for a way to configure the output format.

       -W, --show [package-name-pattern...]
              Just  like  the --list option this will list all packages matching
              the given pattern. However the output can be customized using  the
              --showformat option.  The default output format gives one line per
              matching package, each line having the  name  (extended  with  the
              architecture qualifier for Multi-Arch same packages) and installed
              version of the package, separated by a tab.

       -s, --status package-name...
              Report status of specified package. This just displays  the  entry
              in  the  installed package status database. When multiple package-
              name are listed, the requested status entries are separated by  an
              empty line, with the same order as specified on the argument list.

       -L, --listfiles package-name...
              List files installed to your system from package-name. When multi&#8208;
              ple package-name are listed, the requested lists of files are sep&#8208;
              arated  by  an empty line, with the same order as specified on the
              argument list.  However, note that files created  by  package-spe&#8208;
              cific installation-scripts are not listed.

       --control-list package-name
              List  control  files  installed  to your system from package-name.
              These can be used as input arguments to --control-show.

       --control-show package-name control-file
              Print the control-file installed to your system from  package-name
              to the standard output.

       -c, --control-path package-name [control-file]
              List  paths  for control files installed to your system from pack&#8208;
              age-name.  If control-file is specified then only  list  the  path
              for  that  control file if it is present. Warning: this command is
              deprecated, please switch to use --control-list and --control-show
              instead.

       -S, --search filename-search-pattern...
              Search for packages that own files corresponding to the given pat&#8208;
              tern.  Standard shell wildchars can be used in the pattern.   This
              command  will  not list extra files created by maintainer scripts,
              nor will it list alternatives.

       -p, --print-avail package-name...
              Display    details    about    package-name,    as    found     in
              /var/lib/dpkg/available.  When  multiple  package-name are listed,
              the requested available entries are separated by  an  empty  line,
              with the same order as specified on the argument list.

              Users  of  APT-based  frontends should use apt-cache show package-
              name instead as the available file is only  kept  up-to-date  when
              using dselect.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       --admindir=dir
              Change  the location of the dpkg database. The default location is
              /var/lib/dpkg.

       --load-avail
              Also load the available file when using the --show and --list com&#8208;
              mands, which now default to only querying the status file.

       -f, --showformat=format
              This  option  is  used  to specify the format of the output --show
              will produce. The format is a string that will be output for  each
              package listed.
&#12;              In the format string, &#8220;\&#8221; introduces escapes:

                  \n  newline
                  \r  carriage return
                  \t  tab

              &#8220;\&#8221;  before  any other character suppresses any special meaning of
              the following character, which is useful for &#8220;\&#8221; and &#8220;$&#8221;.

              Package information can be included by inserting  variable  refer&#8208;
              ences  to  package  fields  using  the  syntax &#8220;${field[;width]}&#8221;.
              Fields are printed right-aligned unless the width is  negative  in
              which  case  left alignment will be used. The following fields are
              recognized but they are not necessarily available  in  the  status
              file  (only internal fields or fields stored in the binary package
              end up in it):

                  Section
                  Size (internal, front-end related)
                  Source
                  Status (internal)
                  Suggests
                  Tag (usually not in .deb but in repository Packages files)
                  Triggers-Awaited (internal)
                  Triggers-Pending (internal)
                  Version

              The following are virtual fields,  generated  by  dpkg-query  from
              values  from  other fields (note that these do not use valid names
              for fields in control files):

                  binary:Package
                  binary:Summary
                  db:Status-Abbrev
                  source:Package
                  source:Version

              The default format  string  is  &#8220;${binary:Package}\t${Version}\n&#8221;.
              Actually,  all  other  fields  found in the status file (i.e. user
              defined fields) can be requested, too. They will be printed as-is,
              though,  no  conversion  nor  error  checking  is  done  on  them.
              binary:Package is a special field that will print the package name
              with an architecture qualifier (like &quot;libc6:amd64&quot;) if the package
              has a Multi-Arch field with a value of same, and as such its  name
              could  be  ambiguous.   To get the name of the dpkg maintainer and
              the installed version, you could run:

                dpkg-query -W -f=&apos;${binary:Package} ${Version}\t${Maintainer}\n&apos; dpkg

EXIT STATUS
       0      The requested query was successfully performed.

       1      Problems were encountered while parsing the command line  or  per&#8208;
              forming  the  query,  including  no  file  or  package being found
              (except for --control-path).

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ADMINDIR
              If set and the --admindir option has not been specified,  it  will
              be used as the dpkg data directory.

       COLUMNS
              This  setting influences the output of the --list option by chang&#8208;
              ing the width of its output.
