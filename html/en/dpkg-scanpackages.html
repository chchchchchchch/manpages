NAME
       dpkg-scanpackages - create Packages index files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-scanpackages  [option...] binary-dir [override-file [path-prefix]] &gt;
       Packages

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-scanpackages sorts through a tree of Debian binary packages and cre&#8208;
       ates  a  Packages file, used by apt(8), dselect(1), etc, to tell the user
       what packages are available for installation. These  Packages  files  are
       the  same  as  those found on Debian archive sites and CD-ROMs. You might
       use dpkg-scanpackages yourself if making a directory of local packages to
       install on a cluster of machines.

       Note: If you want to access the generated Packages file with apt you will
       probably need to compress the file  with  bzip2(1)  (generating  a  Pack&#8208;
       ages.bz2  file)  or  gzip(1) (generating a Packages.gz file). apt ignores
       uncompressed  Packages  files  except  on  local  access  (i.e.   file://
       sources).

       binary-dir is the name of the tree of the binary packages to process (for
       example, contrib/binary-i386).  It is best to make this relative  to  the
       root of the Debian archive, because every Filename field in the new Pack&#8208;
       ages file will start with this string.

       override-file is the name of a file to read  which  contains  information
       about  how the package fits into the distribution (it can be a compressed
       file); see deb-override(5).

       path-prefix is an optional string to be prepended to the Filename fields.

       If more than one version of a package is found only  the  newest  one  is
       included  in the output. If they have the same version and only differ in
       architecture only the first one found is used.

OPTIONS
       -t, --type type
              Scan for *.type packages, instead of *.deb.

       -e, --extra-override file
              Scan file to find supplementary overrides (the file  can  be  com&#8208;
              pressed).  See  deb-extra-override(5)  for more information on its
              format.

       -a, --arch arch
              Use a pattern consisting of *_all.deb and  *_arch.deb  instead  of
              scanning for all debs.

       -m, --multiversion
              Include all found packages in the output.

       -M, --medium id-string
              Add  an  X-Medium field containing the value id-string. This field
              is required if you want to generate Packages.cd files for  use  by
              the multicd access method of dselect.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.
&#12;DIAGNOSTICS
       dpkg-scanpackages  outputs  the  usual  self-explanatory  errors. It also
       warns about packages that are in the wrong subdirectory, are  duplicated,
       have  a  Filename field in their control file, are missing from the over&#8208;
       ride file, or have maintainer substitutions which do not take effect.
