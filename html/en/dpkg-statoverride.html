dpkg-statoverride(8)             dpkg utilities             dpkg-statoverride(8)



NAME
       dpkg-statoverride - override ownership and mode of files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-statoverride [option...] command

DESCRIPTION
       `stat  overrides&apos;  are  a way to tell dpkg(1) to use a different owner or
       mode for a file when a package is installed. (note: I use the word `file&apos;
       here, but in reality this can be any filesystem object that dpkg handles,
       including directories, devices, etc.). This can be used to force programs
       that  are  normally  setuid  to be install without a setuid flag, or only
       executable by a certain group.

       dpkg-statoverride is a utility to manage the list of stat  overrides.  It
       has three basic functions: adding, removing and listing overrides.

COMMANDS
       --add user group mode file
              Add  an  override  for file. file does not need to exist when this
              command is used; the override  will  be  stored  and  used  later.
              Users  and groups can be specified by their name (for example root
              or nobody), or by their number by prepending the number with a `#&apos;
              (for  example  #0  or  #65534).  The mode needs to be specified in
              octal.

              If --update is specified and file exists, it is immediately set to
              the new owner and mode.

       --remove file
              Remove  an override for file, the status of file is left unchanged
              by this command.

       --list [glob-pattern]
              List all overrides. If a glob pattern is  specified  restrict  the
              output  to  overrides  which match the glob. If there are no over&#8208;
              rides or none match the glob dpkg-statoverride will exit  with  an
              exitcode of 1.

       --help Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       --admindir directory
              Change  the  directory of the dpkg database where the statoverride
              file is also stored. Defaults to /var/lib/dpkg.

       --force
              Force an action, even if a sanity check would  otherwise  prohibit
              it.  This is necessary to override an existing override.

       --update
              Immediately try to change the file to the new owner and mode if it
              exists.

       --quiet
              Be less verbose about what we do.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ADMINDIR
              If set and the --admindir option has not been specified,  it  will
              be used as the dpkg data directory.

FILES
       /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride
              File which contains the current list of stat overrides of the sys&#8208;
              tem. It is located in the  dpkg  administration  directory,  along
              with  other  files  important to dpkg, such as `status&apos; or `avail&#8208;
              able&apos;.
              Note: dpkg-statoverride preserves the old copy of this file,  with
              extension &quot;-old&quot;, before replacing it with the new one.

SEE ALSO
       dpkg(1).
