NAME
       dput.cf - Debian package upload tool configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       This  manpage gives a brief overview of dput&apos;s configuration file and the
       available options in it.  dput is a tool to upload Debian packages to the
       archive.

FORMAT
       dput.cf  consists  of  different groups of configuration options, one for
       each host where you want to be able to upload packages. Hosts are defined
       using  an  identifier  header with a short name for the host, enclosed in
       square brackets.  Note that only if multiple such headers are encountered
       in the configuration, only the group following the last header is consid&#8208;
       ered. This is done to avoid confusion when overriding a global configura&#8208;
       tion  file  with  a  user-specific  one.   There&apos;s  a special identifier,
       [DEFAULT], which holds default parameters for all the hosts. The defaults
       can  be  overridden  by  redefining  them again in each host section. The
       available parameters are listed below:

       fqdn   This is the fully qualified domain name that will be used (can  be
              specified as host:port for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP).

       login  Your  login  on the machine named before. A single asterisk * will
              cause the scp and rsync uploaders to not use supply a  login  name
              when calling to ssh, scp, and rsync.

       incoming
              The directory that you should upload the files to.

       method The  method  that  you  want to use for uploading the files.  Cur&#8208;
              rently, dput accepts the following values for method:

              ftp    the package will be uploaded via ftp, either anonymously or
                     using a login/password. Note that ftp is unencrypted so you
                     should not use password authentication with this.

              http and https
                     the package will be uploaded via http or  https  using  the
                     PUT  method  as specified in WebDAV. The upload method will
                     prompt for a password if necessary.

              scp    the package will be uploaded using ssh&apos;s scp.  This  trans&#8208;
                     fers  files using a secure ssh tunnel, and needs an account
                     on the upload machine.

              rsync  the package will be uploaded using rsync over ssh. This  is
                     similar to scp, but can save some bandwidth if the destina&#8208;
                     tion file already exists on  the  upload  server.  It  also
                     needs a login on the remote machine as it uses ssh.

              local  the    package    will    be   &quot;uploaded&quot;   locally   using
                     /usr/bin/install.  This transfers files to a local incoming
                     directory,  and  needs  appropriate permissions set on that
                     directory.

       hash   The hash algorithm that should be used in calculating the checksum
              of  the  files  before uploading them. Currently, dput accepts the
              following values for hash:

              md5    use the md5 algorithm for calculation
&#12;              sha    use the sha algorithm for calculation

       allow_unsigned_uploads
              This defines if you are allowed to upload files  without  a  GnuPG
              signature to this host or not.

       allow_dcut
              This  defines  if you are allowed to upload a dcut changes file to
              the queue to remove or move files.

       distributions
              This defines a comma-separated list  of  distributions  that  this
              host  accepts, used to guess the host to use when none is given on
              the command line.

       allowed_distributions
              A regular expression (of Python re module syntax) that the distri&#8208;
              bution field must match or dput will refuse the upload.

       delayed
              Set  a numeric default parameter for delayed uploads (i.e. uploads
              to this queue will  be  delayed  the  specified  number  of  days.
              Defaults  to  the  empty string, meaning no delay. This only works
              with upload queues that support delayed uploads.

       run_lintian
              This option defines if lintian should be run  before  the  package
              will  be uploaded or not. If the package is not lintian clean, the
              upload will not happen.

       run_dinstall
              This options defines if dinstall -n should be run after the  pack&#8208;
              age  has been uploaded or not. This is an easy way to test if your
              package would be installed into the archive or not.

       check_version
              This option defines if dput should check if the user has installed
              the  package  in  his system for testing it before putting it into
              the archive. If the user has not installed  and  tested  it,  dput
              will reject the upload.

       passive_ftp
              This  option  defines if dput should use passive ftp or active ftp
              for uploading a package to one of the upload queues.  By  default,
              dput  uses  passive ftp connections. If you need to use active ftp
              connections, set passive_ftp to 0.

       progress_indicator
              This integer option defines if  dput  should  display  a  progress
              indicator for the upload. (Currently implemented in ftp only.)
              Supported values: 0 (default) - no progress, 1 - rotating progress
              indicator, and 2 - kilobyte counter.

       scp_compress
              This option defines if the scp upload to the  host  will  be  com&#8208;
              pressed,  or  not.   This option is only used for the &apos;scp&apos; upload
              method, and has been found to decrease upload time for slow links,
              and increase upload times for faster links.

       ssh_config_options
              The  arguments  of  this  config options should be ssh config file
              options in the style documented in  ssh_config(5).  They  will  be
              passed  to  all automatic invocations of ssh and scp by dput. Note
              that you can define  multiline  (dput)  configuration  options  by
              indenting  the second line with whitespace (i.e. similar to RFC822
              header continuations).
&#12;       post_upload_command
              This option defines a command to be run by dput after a successful
              upload.

       pre_upload_command
              This  option  defines  a command to be run by dput before a upload
              happens.

       default_host_main
              This defines the default host for packages that are allowed to  be
              uploaded  to the main archive. This variable is used when guessing
              the host to upload to.
