drmModeGetResources(libdrm 2.4.40)            drmModeGetResources(libdrm 2.4.40)



NAME
       drmModeGetResources - retrieve current display configuration information

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;xf86drmMode.h&gt;

       typedef struct _drmModeRes {

            int count_fbs;
            uint32_t *fbs;

            int count_crtcs;
            uint32_t *crtcs;

            int count_connectors;
            uint32_t *connectors;

            int count_encoders;
            uint32_t *encoders;

            uint32_t min_width, max_width;
            uint32_t min_height, max_height;
       } drmModeRes, *drmModeResPtr;

       drmModeResPtr drmModeGetResources(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will allocate, populate, and return a drmModeRes structure
       containing information about the current display configuration.

       The count_fbs and fbs fields indicate the number of  currently  allocated
       framebuffer  objects  (i.e.  objects that can be attached to a given CRTC
       or sprite for display).

       The count_crtcs and crtcs fields list the available CRTCs in the configu&#8208;
       ration.   A CRTC is simply an object that can scan out a framebuffer to a
       display sink, and contains mode timing and relative position information.
       CRTCs  drive  encoders,  which  are  responsible for converting the pixel
       stream into a specific display protocol (e.g. MIPI or HDMI).

       The count_connectors and connectors fields list  the  available  physical
       connectors  on  the  system.   Note that some of these may not be exposed
       from the chassis (e.g. LVDS or eDP).  Connectors are attached to encoders
       and  contain  information about the attached display sink (e.g. width and
       height in mm, subpixel ordering, and various other properties).

       The count_encoders and encoders fields list the available encoders on the
       device.   Each  encoder may be associated with a CRTC, and may be used to
       drive a particular encoder.

       The min and max height fields indicate the maximum size of a  framebuffer
       for this device (i.e. the scanout size limit).


RETURN VALUE
       Returns a drmModeRes structure pointer on success, 0 on failure.
