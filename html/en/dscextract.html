DSCEXTRACT(1)                                                      DSCEXTRACT(1)



NAME
       dscextract - extract a single file from a Debian source package

SYNOPSIS
       dscextract [options] dscfile file

DESCRIPTION
       dscextract reads a single file from a Debian source package.  The idea is
       to   only   look   into   .diff.gz   files   (source   format   1.0)   or
       .debian.tar.gz/bz2 files (source format 3.0) where possible, hence avoid&#8208;
       ing to unpack large tarballs.  It is most useful for files in the debian/
       subdirectory.

       file  is  relative to the first level directory contained in the package,
       i.e. with the first component stripped.

OPTIONS
       -f     &quot;Fast&quot; mode. For source format 1.0, avoid to  fall  back  scanning
              the .orig.tar.gz file if file was not found in the .diff.gz.  (For
              3.0 packages, it is assumed that debian/* are exactly the contents
              of debian.tar.gz/bz2.)

EXIT STATUS
       0      file was extracted.

       1      file was not found in the source package.

       2      An error occurred, like dscfile was not found.

EXAMPLE
       dscextract dds_2.1.1+ddd105-2.dsc debian/watch || test $? = 1
