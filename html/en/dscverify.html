DSCVERIFY(1)                                                        DSCVERIFY(1)



NAME
       dscverify - verify the validity of a Debian package

SYNOPSIS
       dscverify [--keyring keyring] ... changes_or_dsc_filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       dscverify  checks  that  the GPG signatures on the given .changes or .dsc
       files are good signatures made by keys in the  current  Debian  keyrings,
       found in the debian-keyring and debian-maintainers packages.  (Additional
       keyrings can be specified  using  the  --keyring  option  any  number  of
       times.)   It  then  checks that the other files listed in the .changes or
       .dsc files have the correct sizes and checksums (MD5 plus SHA1 and SHA256
       if  the  latter are present).  The exit status is 0 if there are no prob&#8208;
       lems and non-zero otherwise.

OPTIONS
       --keyring keyring
              Add keyring to the list of keyrings to be used.

       --no-default-keyrings
              Do not use the default set of keyrings.

       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
              first option given on the command-line.

       --nosigcheck, --no-sig-check, -u
              Skip  the  signature  verification  step. That is, only verify the
              sizes and checksums of the files listed in the  .changes  or  .dsc
              files.

       --verbose
              Do not suppress GPG output.


       --help, -h
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information and exit success&#8208;
              fully.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts
       are  sourced  by  a shell in that order to set configuration vari&#8208;
       ables.  Environment variable settings are ignored  for  this  pur&#8208;
       pose.  If the first command line option given is --noconf or --no-
       conf, then these files will not be read.  The currently recognised
       variable is:

       DSCVERIFY_KEYRINGS
              This  is a colon-separated list of extra keyrings to use in
              addition to any specified on the command line.

KEYRING
       Please note that the keyring provided by the debian-keyring  pack&#8208;
       age  can  be  slightly  out  of  date.  The  latest version can be
       obtained with rsync, as documented in the README that  comes  with
       debian-keyring.   If  you sync the keyring to a non-standard loca&#8208;
       tion (see below), you can use the possibilities to  specify  extra
       keyrings, by either using the above mentioned configuration option
       or the --keyring option.

       Below is an example for an alias:

       alias dscverify=&apos;dscverify --keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg&apos;

STANDARD KEYRING LOCATIONS
       By default dscverify searches for the debian-keyring in  the  fol&#8208;
       lowing locations:

       - /org/keyring.debian.org/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg

       - /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg

       - /usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg

SEE ALSO
       gpg(1) and devscripts.conf(5).
