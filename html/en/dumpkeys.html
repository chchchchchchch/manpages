DUMPKEYS(1)                                                          DUMPKEYS(1)



NAME
       dumpkeys - dump keyboard translation tables

SYNOPSIS
       dumpkeys  [  -hilfn  -ccharset  --help --short-info --long-info --numeric
       --full-table --funcs-only --keys-only --compose-only --charset=charset ]

DESCRIPTION
       dumpkeys writes, to the standard output, the current contents of the key&#8208;
       board driver&apos;s translation tables, in the format specified by keymaps(5).

       Using the various options, the format of the output can be controlled and
       also other information from the kernel and the programs  dumpkeys(1)  and
       loadkeys(1) can be obtained.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Prints  the  program&apos;s version number and a short usage message to
              the program&apos;s standard error output and exits.

       -i --short-info
              Prints some characteristics of the kernel&apos;s keyboard  driver.  The
              items shown are:

              Keycode range supported by the kernel

                     This  tells  what values can be used after the keycode key&#8208;
                     word in keytable files. See keymaps(5) for more information
                     and the syntax of these files.

              Number of actions bindable to a key

                     This tells how many different actions a single key can out&#8208;
                     put using various modifier keys. If the  value  is  16  for
                     example, you can define up to 16 different actions to a key
                     combined with modifiers. When the value is 16,  the  kernel
                     probably  knows  about  four  modifier  keys, which you can
                     press in different combinations with the key to access  all
                     the bound actions.

              Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel

                     This item contains a list of action code ranges in hexadec&#8208;
                     imal notation.  These are the values that can  be  used  in
                     the  right hand side of a key definition, ie. the vv&apos;s in a
                     line

                            keycode xx = vv vv vv vv

                     (see keymaps(5) for more information about  the  format  of
                     key definition lines).  dumpkeys(1) and loadkeys(1) support
                     a symbolic notation, which is  preferable  to  the  numeric
                     one,  as  the  action  codes may vary from kernel to kernel
                     while the symbolic names usually remain the same.  However,
                     the list of action code ranges can be used to determine, if
                     the kernel actually supports all  the  symbols  loadkeys(1)
                     knows,  or  are  there  maybe some actions supported by the
                     kernel that have no symbolic name in your loadkeys(1)  pro&#8208;
                     gram.  To  see  this,  you  compare the range list with the
                     action symbol list, see option --long-info below.

              Number of function keys supported by kernel

                     This tells the number of action codes that can be  used  to
                     output strings of characters. These action codes are tradi&#8208;
                     tionally bound to the various function and editing keys  of
                     the  keyboard  and  are  defined  to  send  standard escape
                     sequences. However, you can redefine these to  send  common
                     command lines, email addresses or whatever you like.  Espe&#8208;
                     cially if the number of this item is greater than the  num&#8208;
                     ber  of function and editing keys in your keyboard, you may
                     have some &quot;spare&quot; action codes that you can bind to  AltGr-
                     letter  combinations,  for  example,  to  send  some useful
                     strings. See loadkeys(1) for more details.

              Function strings

                     You can see you current function key definitions  with  the
                     command

                            dumpkeys --funcs-only

       -l --long-info
              This  option  instructs dumpkeys to print a long information list&#8208;
              ing. The output is the same as with the --short-info appended with
              the  list  of  action  symbols  supported by loadkeys(1) and dump&#8208;
              keys(1), along with the symbols&apos; numeric values.

       -n --numeric
              This option causes dumpkeys to by-pass the  conversion  of  action
              code  values  to symbolic notation and to print the in hexadecimal
              format instead.

       -f --full-table
              This makes  dumpkeys  skip  all  the  short-hand  heuristics  (see
              keymaps(5))  and  output  the  key bindings in the canonical form.
              First a keymaps line describing  the  currently  defined  modifier
              combinations is printed. Then for each key a row with a column for
              each modifier combination is printed. For example, if the  current
              keymap  in  use  uses  seven  modifiers, every row will have seven
              action code columns. This format can be useful for example to pro&#8208;
              grams that post-process the output of dumpkeys.

       --funcs-only
              When  this  option is given, dumpkeys prints only the function key
              string definitions. Normally dumpkeys prints both the key bindings
              and the string definitions.

       --keys-only
              When  this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the key bindings.
              Normally dumpkeys prints both the key bindings and the string def&#8208;
              initions.

       --compose-only
              When  this  option  is given, dumpkeys prints only the compose key
              combinations.  This option is available only if  your  kernel  has
              compose key support.

       -ccharset  --charset=charset
              This instructs dumpkeys to interpret character code values accord&#8208;
              ing to the specified character set. This affects only the transla&#8208;
              tion  of character code values to symbolic names. Valid values for
              charset currently are iso-8859-X, Where X is a digit in  1-9.   If
              no  charset  is  specified, iso-8859-1 is used as a default.  This
              option produces an output  line  `charset  &quot;iso-8859-X&quot;&apos;,  telling
              loadkeys  how to interpret the keymap. (For example, &quot;division&quot; is
              0xf7 in iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)
