       dvd+rw-format - format DVD+-RW/-RAM disk

       dvd+rw-format  [-force[=full]]  [-lead-out | -blank[=full]] [-ssa[=none |

DESCRIPTION
       The dvd+rw-format command formats dvd disk in  the  specified  dvd  drive
       (e.g. /dev/dvd).


OPTIONS
       -force[=full]
              This forces to format dvd as new while wiping any existing data.

       -blank[=full]
              This blanks dvd while changing to sequential mode.

       -lead-out
              This  relocates  the  lead-out next to outermost written sector as
              well as makes sure there is no virgin surface  before  it.  Previ&#8208;
              ously  written  data is not affected by this operation. Useful for
              addressing  DVD-ROM  compatibility,  or  playability  of   already
              recorded media in legacy units.
