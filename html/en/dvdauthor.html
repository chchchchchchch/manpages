NAME
       dvdauthor  -  assembles multiple mpeg program streams into a suitable DVD
       filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       dvdauthor [ -o output-dir ] -x xml-control-file


       dvdauthor [ -o output-dir ] [ -j | --jumppad | -g | --allgprm ]  [  -T  |
       --toc ] [ menu or title options ]


DVD BACKGROUND
       At  a  high  level, a DVD is a collection of menus and titles.  Conceptu&#8208;
       ally, a menu contains buttons which can be assigned actions and  provides
       a  list  of choices to the end user, while a title contains the main con&#8208;
       tent of the DVD.  However, in reality many of the features  available  in
       menus  (including  buttons,  pausing,  and looping) are also available in
       titles.

       The menus and titles are divided into titlesets and the VMGM menu set.  A
       titleset  can contain a number of menus and titles which are meant to act
       together.  The &quot;menu&quot;, &quot;audio&quot;, &quot;subtitle&quot;, and &quot;angle&quot;  buttons  on  the
       DVD player&apos;s remote control will all access menus in the same titleset as
       the title which is being played.  All the titles and  menus  of  a  given
       titleset  have  the same video, audio, and subtitle settings (the defini&#8208;
       tions for the menus are independent from the definitions for the titles),
       so  if  you  want  to  have different settings (for example widescreen vs
       standard aspect ratios), then you need separate titlesets.  Titlesets are
       not meant to jump to one another, so the VMGM menu domain is used.  It is
       a collection of menus (no titles) that can access the menus and titles of
       all the titlesets.

       One  of  the most frustrating things when deciding how to author a DVD is
       that there are often many ways to accomplish the same task.  For example,
       you must decide whether to locate menus at the VMGM level or the titleset
       level.  A typical setup is to locate the high level  menus  at  the  VMGM
       level,  and  the  low level configuration menus (scene / audio / subtitle
       selection) at the titleset.  If there are  DVD  extras,  perhaps  with  a
       lower quality audio track and a 4:3 aspect ratio, then they would be in a
       separate titleset with a menu to select among the extras located  at  the
       titleset level.

DVDAUTHOR DESCRIPTION
       dvdauthor  works in discrete operations.  It authors each titleset one at
       a time, and then finally authors the VMGM to complete the disc.  At  that
       point  the  contents can be written out to a DVD.  If you are controlling
       dvdauthor with command line arguments, then each step will occur indepen&#8208;
       dently;  however if you are using the XML control file, then you have the
       option of combining some or all the steps into one.

       The VOBs passed to dvdauthor must have DVD NAV (VOBU) packets multiplexed
       in  at  the  correct  locations.  Many tools can do this, including mplex
       from mjpegtools 1.6.0 or later.  dvdauthor will then fill  these  packets
       in  with  the correct data.  Special care has been taken to ensure dvdau&#8208;
       thor is fifo compliant; that is every source VOB can  be  the  output  of
       another  program (such as mplex).  This can make execution faster on many
       systems by avoiding extra filesystem accesses.

COMMAND LINE DESCRIPTION
       -o output-dir

       -O output-dir
              The destination directory to store the  DVD-Video  file  structure
              in.  If -O is specified, then any existing directory is deleted.

       -j

       --jumppad
              Enables  the creation of jumppads, which allow greater flexibility
              in choosing jump/call desinations.

       -g

       --allgprm
              Enable the use of all 16 general purpose registers.  Prohibits the
              use of jumppad and some complex expressions that require temporary
              registers.

       -T     Creates the table of contents file instead of a titleset. If  this
              option is used, it should be listed first, and you may not specify
              any titles.

       -m     Creates a menu.

       -t     Creates a title.

       -v video-opts

       --video=video-opts
              A plus (+) separated list of video options.  Dvdauthor will try to
              infer  any  unspecified  options.  pal, ntsc, 4:3, 16:9, 720xfull,
              720x576, 720x480, 704xfull, 704x576, 704x480,  352xfull,  352x576,
              352x480, 352xhalf, 352x288, 352x240, nopanscan, noletterbox, crop.
              Default is 4:3, 720xfull

       -a audio-opts

       --audio=audio-opts
              A plus (+) separated list of options for an audio track, with each
              track  separated  by  a  comma  (,).  For example -a ac3+en,mp2+de
              specifies two audio tracks: the first is an English track  encoded
              in  AC3, the second is a German track encoded using MPEG-1 layer 2
              compression.  ac3, mp2, pcm, dts, 16bps, 20bps, 24bps,  drc,  sur&#8208;
              round, nolang, 1ch, 2ch, 3ch, 4ch, 5ch, 6ch, 7ch, 8ch, and any two
              letter ISO 639 language abbreviation.  Default is  1  track,  mp2,
              20bps, nolang, 2ch.  &apos;ac3&apos; implies drc, 6ch.

       -s subpicture-opts

       --subpictures=subpicture-opts
              A  plus (+) separated list of options for a subpicture track, with
              each track separated by a comma (,). nolang  and  any  two  letter
              language abbreviation (see -a) Default is no subpicture tracks.

       -e entry(s)

       --entry=entry(s)
              Makes  the  current menu the default for certain circumstances. It
              is a comma separated list of any of:

              for TOC menus: title

              for VTS menus: root, ptt, audio, subtitle, angle

       -p palette-file

       --palette=palette-file
              Specifies where to get the subpicture palette. Settable per  title
              and per menu. If the filename ends in .rgb (case insensitive) then
              it is assumed to be RGB, otherwise it is YUV. Entries should be  6
              hexadecimal digits. FILE defaults to xste-palette.dat

       -c chapterpts

       --chapters=chapterpts
              Specifies  a  comma  (,)  separated  list of chapter markers. Each
              marker is of the form [[h:]mm:]ss[.frac] and is  relative  to  the
              SCR  of  the next file listed (independent of any timestamp trans&#8208;
              posing that occurs within dvdauthor).  The  chapter  markers  ONLY
              apply to the next file listed. Defaults to 0.

       -f mpeg-file

       --file=mpeg-file

       mpeg-file
              Specifies  either  a  file, a pipe, or a shell command ending in |
              which supplies an MPEG-2 system stream with VOB  sectors  inserted
              in the appropriate places (using mplex -f 8 to generate)

       -b buttondef

       --button=X1xY1-X2xY2,commandlist
              creates  a  button of the specified size. See LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION
              for a description of commandlist.

       -i [pre|post]=commandlist

       --instructions=[pre|post]=commandlist
              Executes the commandlist instructions either before or at the  end
              of  the  menu/title.   See  LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION for the format of
              commandlist.

          &lt;/titleset&gt;
          [&lt;titleset ... /&gt;]
       &lt;/dvdauthor&gt;

       A breakdown of the control file:

       &lt;dvdauthor [dest=&quot;output-dir&quot;] [jumppad=&quot;1|on|yes&quot; | allgprm=&quot;1|on|yes&quot;]&gt;
              Initiates dvdauthor.  dest denotes the directory  where  dvdauthor
              will  write  the  files. This is overridden by the -o option. Con&#8208;
              tains up to one &lt;vmgm&gt; tag and any number of &lt;titleset&gt;&apos;s.

       &lt;vmgm&gt;

       &lt;titleset&gt;
              Constructs of a VMGM level menu set or a title set.  Contains zero
              or more &lt;menus&gt; tags and if a titleset, up to one &lt;titles&gt; tag.

       &lt;menus [lang=&quot;language-code&quot;]&gt;
              Marks  a  list  of menus with a common language for this VMGM menu
              set or titleset, called in  dvdauthor  terminology  a  &quot;pgcgroup.&quot;
              Contains  up  to one &lt;video&gt; tag, up to one &lt;audio&gt; tag, up to one
              &lt;subpicture&gt; tag, and any number of &lt;pgc&gt; tags.

       &lt;titles&gt;
              Marks the list of titles for this  titleset, called  in  dvdauthor
              terminology  a  &quot;pgcgroup.&quot;  Contains up to one &lt;video&gt; tag, up to
              eight &lt;audio&gt; tags, up to 32 &lt;subpicture&gt; tags, and any number  of
              &lt;pgc&gt; tags.

       &lt;video  [format=&quot;ntsc|pal&quot;]  [aspect=&quot;4:3|16:9&quot;] [resolution=&quot;XxY&quot;] [cap&#8208;
       tion=&quot;field1|field2&quot;] [widescreen=&quot;nopanscan|noletterbox|crop&quot;] /&gt;
              Manually configures the video parameters for  this  pgcgroup.   If
              any  of  these  are  not  set, then they will be inferred from the
              source stream.  Note that the DVD format  only  specifically  sup&#8208;
              ports 720x480, 704x480, 352x480, and 352x240 resolutions for NTSC,
              and 720x576, 704x576, 352x576, and 352x288  resolutions  for  PAL,
              but DVD author will accept a wider range of inputs and round up to
              the nearest size.

       &lt;audio [format=&quot;mp2|ac3|dts|pcm&quot;]  [channels=&quot;numchannels&quot;]  [dolby=&quot;sur&#8208;
       round&quot;]     [quant=&quot;16bps|20bps|24bps|drc&quot;]    [samplerate=&quot;48khz|96khz&quot;]
       [lang=&quot;language&quot;] [content=&quot;normal|impaired|comments1|comments2&quot;] /&gt;
              Manually configures an audio stream for this pgcgroup.  List  once
              for  each stream.  Most parameters are inferred automatically from
              the source VOBs except for PCM parameters.  However, language  and
              content  must  be manually specified.  Note that it is possible to
              just list the language and content attributes  and  let  dvdauthor
              fill in the rest.

       &lt;subpicture  [lang=&quot;language&quot;] [content=&quot;normal | large | children | nor&#8208;
       mal_cc | large_cc | children_cc | forced | director  |  large_director  |
       children_director&quot;] /&gt;
              Manually  configures  a  subpicture/subtitle  for this pgcgroup or
              PGC.  At the pgcgroup level, list once for each  language.  Occur&#8208;
              rences  at  the  PGC  level don&apos;t have lang or content attributes;
              they inherit those from the corresponding &lt;subpicture&gt; tag at  the
              pgcgroup level.

       &lt;stream mode=&quot;normal|widescreen|letterbox|panscan&quot; id=&quot;streamid&quot; /&gt;
              Specifies  the  ID  of a stream that is the representation of this
              subpicture in a particular display mode.  This  can  be  specified
              per-PGC, or pgcgroup-wide.

       &lt;pgc [entry=&quot;entries&quot;] [palette=&quot;yuvfile|rgbfile&quot;] [pause=&quot;seconds|inf&quot;]&gt;
              A PGC is just a fancy term for either a menu or a title.  It has a
              special meaning in the DVD spec so I have retained its  use  here.
              PGC&apos;s  can have commands that get executed before they start play&#8208;
              ing or after they finish; see &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;post&gt; tags below.

              If the PGC is a menu, you can specify one or more entries for  it.
              This  means that if you press the corresponding button on your DVD
              remote, then it will go to this menu.  For a VMGM level menu,  the
              only  choice  is  title, which on my remote corresponds to the top
              menu button.  For a titleset level menu, you can use root,  subti&#8208;
              tle,  audio,  angle, and ptt.  If you want more than one, separate
              them by a space or a comma.  Note that root  entry  is  meant  for
              commands that jump from a VMGM level menu to a titleset menu.

              If  the  PGC  is  in  a titleset, then it is assumed to be a title
              unless entry=&quot;notitle&quot; is specified.

              All button and menu masks and all  subtitles  within  a  PGC  must
              share  the  same  16 color palette.  If you use spumux to generate
              the subtitle/subpicture packets, then the color  information  will
              be  automatically passed to dvdauthor; however, if you use another
              subtitler or want to have more control over the palette,  you  can
              manually  specify  it  with  the  palette attribute.  The first 16
              entries of the file should be the 16 colors of the palette, listed
              as  6 digit hexadecimal numbers representing either the RGB break&#8208;
              down (if the filename ends in .rgb or the YUV  breakdown  (if  the
              filename  does  not  end  in  .rgb.   After that, the button group
              information can be listed as pairs of 8 digit hexadecimal numbers;
              up to three button groups may be specified.

              If you have a short video sequence or just want the video to pause
              at the end, you can use the pause attribute to set the  number  of
              seconds  (as  an integer) from 1 to 254.  If you want the video to
              pause indefinitely, use inf.

       &lt;pre&gt; commands; &lt;/pre&gt;

       &lt;post&gt; commands; &lt;/post&gt;
              Sets the commands to execute before or after a PGC plays.  It  can
              be  used  to  loop  the current video (by having a &lt;post&gt; jump ...
              &lt;/post&gt; sequence), or to conditionally skip certain chapters if  a
              flag has been set.

       &lt;fpc&gt; commands; &lt;/fpc&gt;
              Sets  the  commands  to  execute when the disk is first put in the
              player (FPC = First Program Chain).  It can be used to jump  to  a
              particular menu or initialize registers on startup.  If not speci&#8208;
              fied, an implicit one will be created that jumps to the first menu
              found, or if there is no menu it will jump to the first title..

       &lt;vob file=&quot;file.mpg&quot; [chapters=&quot;chapter-list&quot;] [pause=&quot;seconds|inf&quot;] /&gt;
              Specifies  an  input video file for a menu or title, with optional
              chapter points and pause at the end.

       &lt;cell [start=&quot;timestamp&quot;] [end=&quot;timestamp&quot;]  [chapter=&quot;1|on|yes&quot;  |  pro&#8208;
       gram=&quot;1|on|yes&quot;] [pause=&quot;seconds|inf&quot;]&gt; commands; &lt;/cell&gt;
              A  more  detailed  way  of specifying marker points in a title. If
              present, then the  containing  &lt;vob&gt;  must  not  have  a  chapters
              attribute.   A  cell  can  have a VM command attached to it, to be
              executed when it plays. If the program attribute is set, then this
              cell will be a point that the user can skip to using the prev/next
              buttons on their DVD player remote. If the  chapter  attribute  is
              set  (implies  program  is  set as well), then this cell is also a
              chapter point.

       &lt;button [name=&quot;buttonname&quot;]&gt; commands; &lt;/button&gt;
              Specifies the commands to be executed when the  user  selects  the
              button  with  the  specified  name.   You  define button names and
              placements with spumux.

LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION
       The language is quite simple and roughly looks like C.

       &#183; Statements are terminated with a semicolon.

       &#183; Statements can span multiple lines.

       &#183; Multiple statements can appear on one line.

       &#183; Whitespace (space, tab, newlines) are not important, except to separate
         keywords and identifiers.

       &#183; C-style  /*  ...  */  comments are allowed. Or you can use XML comments
         &lt;!-- like this --&gt;

   VARIABLES
       The DVD virtual machine processes 16 bit values.  It supports  up  to  16
       general purpose registers; however dvdauthor reserves 3 for internal use.
       Thus register 0-12 are avaialable for use  and  are  referred  to  as  g0
       through g12.

       There  are  also  24  system  registers,  which  can be referred to as s0
       through s23.  Not all of these can be set.  Many of these  have  mnemonic
       synonyms.

       audio (s1, rw)
              Denotes the audio stream, ranging from 0-7.

       subtitle (s2, rw)
              The  subtitle  track, ranging from 0-31.  If you want the subtitle
              to always be displayed,  then  you  should  add  64  (i.e.  choose
              64-95).   Simply  selecting  the  track (0-31) means that only the
              forced subtitles will be displayed,  whereas  enabling  the  track
              (64-95)  means  that  all  the  subtitles will be displayed.  This
              allows you to have forced subtitles only  for  the  parts  of  the
              movie where the actors are speaking a foreign (to the viewer) lan&#8208;
              guage, but still have normal subtitles for the  hearing  impaired.
              The  hearing impaired viewers would enable the track (64-95) while
              the other viewers would just select the track (0-31) they would be
              able to share the track.

       angle (s3, rw)
              Selects the angle (currently untested).

       button (s8, rw)
              Denotes  the currently highlighted button.  Note that the value is
              multiplied by 1024, so the first button is  1024,  the  second  is
              2048, etc.

   EXPRESSIONS
       Expressions follow typical C syntax except that booleans are not convert&#8208;
       ible to integers and vice versa.  Operators and comparisons are:

       ==, !=, &gt;=, &gt;, &lt;=, &lt;, &amp;&amp;, ||, !, eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt,  and,  or,  xor,
       not, +, -, *, /, %, &amp;, |, ^

       Since  the  code  is  encapsulated  in  XML,  the  parser  will catch any
       unescaped &lt; characters (i.e. not  written  as  &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;),  thus  alphabetic
       mnemonics  have  been  provided  for all comparison operators for consis&#8208;
       tency. Or you can put the code in a &lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt; section.

       There is also a numerical function:

       random(EXPRESSION)
              Computes a psuedo-random number, between 1 and the  supplied  num&#8208;
              ber, inclusively.

   BLOCKS
       Blocks  are  either  a single statement (terminated by a semicolon), or a
       group of statements wrapped in curly braces.  For example:

       &#183;
         g3=s7;

       &#183;
         {
           audio=1;
           subtitle=65;
           jump vmgm menu 3;
         }

   STATEMENTS
       The statements supported are fairly simple at the moment.

       VARIABLE=EXPRESSION;
              Sets a variable equal to the result of an equation.

       if (EXPRESSION) BLOCK;

       if (EXPRESSION) BLOCK; else BLOCK;
              Calculates the expression; if true, then it executes the block  of
              code.

       jump TARGET;

       call TARGET [resume CELL];

       resume;
              Jumps  to  a particular title or menu, or calls a particular menu,
              or returns to the calling title.  You can only execute a call from
              a  title  to  a menu; all other forms are illegal.  The purpose of
              using call instead of jump (besides the fact that they  support  a
              mutually exclusive list of targets) is to allow the menu to return
              to the point in the title where the call originated using  resume.
              You  can manually specify the return cell by using the resume key&#8208;
              word, however if you do not specify one and you use the command in
              a post instruction block, then it will presume cell 1.

   TARGETS
       The  following  are  possible  targets (note that menus do not have chap&#8208;
       ters):

       [vmgm | titleset X] menu

       [vmgm | titleset X] menu Y

       [vmgm | titleset X] menu entry Z
              Targets either the default menu, a menu  number  Y,  or  the  menu
              denoted  as  the  entry  for Z.  The menu is in either the VMGM or
              titleset domain.  If you wish to target  a  menu  in  the  current
              domain then you can omit the domain moniker.

       [titleset X] title Y [chapter Z]
              Targets  a title, or a chapter in a title.  Numbering starts at 1.
              All of the titles on the disc are accessible in the  VMGM  domain,
              or you can access them by titleset instead.

       chapter Z
              Targets a chapter in the current title.

       program Z

       cell Z Targets a program or cell in the current PGC.  You can use this to
              create looping menus: jump cell 1;

       cell top

       next cell

       prev cell

       program top

       next program

       prev program

       pgc top

       next pgc

       prev pgc

       up pgc
&#12;       pgc tail
              (Jump only) performs relative transfers of control within the cur&#8208;
              rent menu/title.  &quot;cell/program/pgc top&quot; goes back to the start of
              the current cell/program/PGC; &quot;next/prev cell/program/pgc&quot; goes to
              the  next  or previous cell/program/PGC; &quot;up pgc&quot; goes to the &quot;up&quot;
              PGC (not currently settable in dvdauthor); and &quot;pgc tail&quot; goes  to
              the &lt;post&gt; sequence in the current PGC.

       Chapters  are  numbered from 1 in each title, while programs are numbered
       from 1 in each PGC. Thus, the latter can reset independently of the  for&#8208;
       mer when there is more than one PGC in a title.

LIMITATIONS
       The following limits are imposed by the DVD-Video spec.

       There  can be no more than 99 titlesets, no more than 99 menus in the VMG
       or a titleset, and no more than 99 titles in a titleset.

       Each title may be made up of up to 999 PGCs. Each PGC may consist  of  up
       to 255 programs.  The &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;post&gt; sections of a PGC put together can
       contain no more than 128 VM instructions.

       Since there is only one VOB file (VIDEO_TS.VOB) in  the  VMG,  the  total
       amount  of  video in the VMG menus must fit into 1073709056 bytes (524272
       sectors of 2kiB each). In each titleset, all the menu video must  fit  in
       the  first  VOB  (VTS_nn_0.VOB),  so  is  limited  to  the  same  amount.
