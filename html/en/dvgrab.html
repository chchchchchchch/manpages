NAME
       dvgrab &#8212; Capture DV or MPEG-2 Transport Stream (HDV) video and audio data
       from FireWire


SYNOPSIS
       dvgrab [options] [base] [-]


DESCRIPTION
       dvgrab is a program that captures DV or HDV (MPEG2-TS)  video  and  audio
       data  from  digital  camcorders  via  FireWire  (IEEE 1394).  The data is
       stored in one or several files and can later be processed by video  edit&#8208;
       ing  software.   dvgrab  can remote control the camcorder but it does not
       show the video&apos;s content on screen.

       dvgrab also supports UVC (USB Video Class)  compliant  DV  devices  using
       Linux kernel module uvcvideo, which is a V4L2 driver. In this mode, there
       is no AV/C VTR control and therefore interactive mode is almost  useless.
       interactive feature is

       The  base argument is used to construct the filename to store video data:
       base-num.ext.  num is a running number starting from 001, and ext is  the
       file name extension specifying the file format used, e.g. avi.  A differ&#8208;
       ent naming scheme is used whenever the -timestamp, -timecode, or -timesys
       is  given  (see  below).  If base is a full filename including extension,
       then dvgrab attempts to determine the output file format from the  exten&#8208;
       sion, but it still inserts num.  The default value for base is &quot;dvgrab-&quot;.

       If  you specify a trailing &apos;-&apos; then the format is forced to raw DV or HDV
       and sent to stdout. dvgrab will also output raw DV or HDV to stdout while
       capturing to a file if stdout is piped or redirected.

       You  can  use dvgrab&apos;s powerful file writing capabilities with other pro&#8208;
       grams that produce raw DV or HDV. Using the -stdin option and  if  dvgrab
       detects that it is on the receiving end of a pipe and it is not in inter&#8208;
       active mode, then it will try to read raw DV or HDV on stdin.


OPTIONS
       Options longer than a single character can be specified with  either  one
       or two leading hyphens. Also, you can use a space character or equal sign
       to separate the option name and its argument value.


       -a[num], -autosplit[=num]
                 Try to detect whenever a new recording  starts,  and  store  it
                 into a separate file. This can be combined with the -frames and
                 -size options, and a split occurs whenever  a  specified  event
                 arises.  Autosplit is off by default.

                 num  is  optional.  Without it, dvgrab determines when to split
                 using a flag in the stream or a discontinuity in the  timecode,
                 where  timecode  discontinuity is anything backwards or greater
                 than one second.  If you set the optional argument num you  can
                 set  the  time  sensitivity  in seconds and ignore the stream&apos;s
                 new-recording flag. This basically lets  you  split  on  larger
                 time   increments  such  as  minutes  or  hours.  For  example,
                 -autosplit=3600 splits the recording whenever there is a gap in
                 the recording that is an hour or longer.
&#12;       -buffers num
                 The  number  of  frames to use for buffering device I/O delays.
                 Defaults to 100.


       -card num Tells dvgrab to  receive  data  from  FireWire  card  num.  The
                 default  behaviour  is  to  automatically select the first card
                 containing the first discovered camera If used  in  conjunction
                 with  -noavc,  then no bus probing is performed If used in con&#8208;
                 junction with -guid hex, then only the specified bus is  probed
                 for node with guid hex.


       -channel num
                 Isochronous channel to receive data from. Defaults to 63, which
                 is pretty much standard among DV camcorders these days. If  you
                 specify  anything different, no attempt is made at this time to
                 tell the device which channel to use. You must have some manual
                 way to tell the transmitting device which channel to use.


       -cmincutsize num
                 This option is used to start the collection if a cut occurs num
                 megabytes (actually, mebibytes) prior to the end of the collec&#8208;
                 tion.  This option reduces small files being created when using
                 the -csize option. When a new collection  is  started  in  this
                 manner,  the amount of free space in the previous collection is
                 stored, and while the following clips fit within  the  previous
                 collection, the new collection starting point is reset.


       -csize num
                 This option tells dvgrab to split the files when the collection
                 of files exceeds num . This option is used  to  create  collec&#8208;
                 tions of files that fit perfectly into num megabytes (actually,
                 mebibytes) (i.e. for archiving onto DVD). When this  occurs,  a
                 new collection is started (See also the -cmincutsize option)


       -debug type
                 Display   HDV   debug   info,   type   is   one   or  more  of:
                 all,pat,pmt,pids,pid=N,pes,packet,video,sonya1


       -d, -duration time
                 Set the maximum capture duration across all file splits  for  a
                 single  capture  session  (multiple  sessions  are  possible in
                 interactive mode).  The time value is expressed in SMIL2 Media&#8208;
                 Clipping  Time  format.   See http://w3.org/AudioVideo/ for the
                 specification.

                 Briefly, the formats are:

                 XXX[.Y]h, XXX[.Y]min, XXX[.Y][s], XXXms,

                 [[HH:]MM:]SS[.ms], or smpte=[[[HH:]MM:]SS:]FF.


       -every n  This option  tells  dvgrab  to  write  every  n&apos;th  frame  only
                 (default all frames).


       -f, -format dv1 | dv2 | avi | raw | dif | qt | mov | jpeg | jpg | mpeg2 |
       hdv
                 Specifies the format of the output  file(s).  File  format  can
                 also  be  determined  if  you  include an extension on the base
                 name. The following extensions are recognizable: avi, dv,  dif,
                 mov, jpg, jpeg, and m2t (HDV).


                 dv1 and dv2 both are AVI files with slightly different formats.
                 dv2 stores a separate audio track in addition to the  DV  video
                 track,  which  is more compatible with other applications.  dv1
                 only stores a single, integrated DV track since the  DV  format
                 natively  interleaves  audio  with  video. Therefore, while dv1
                 produces smaller output, some applications won&apos;t  grok  it  and
                 require  dv2  instead.  dvgrab is capable of creating extremely
                 large AVI files&#8212;well over 2 or 4 GB&#8212;however, compatibility with
                 other tools starts to decrease over the 1 GB size.


                 raw  stores  the  data  unmodified  and have the .dv extension.
                 These files are read by a number of GNU/Linux tools as well  as
                 Apple Quicktime.


                 dif  is  a  variation  of  raw  DV that names files with a .dif
                 extension so they can be more immediately loaded into  MainCon&#8208;
                 cept MainActor5.


                 qt  is  Quicktime,  but  requires  that dvgrab be compiled with
                 libquicktime.


                 jpg or jpeg is for a sequence of JPEG image files if dvgrab was
                 compiled  with  libdv and jpeglib. This option can only be used
                 with a DV input, not HDV (MPEG2-TS).


                 mpeg2 or hdv is for a MPEG-2 transport stream when  using,  for
                 example, a HDV camcorder or digital TV settop box.


                 Defaults to raw


       -F, -frames num
                 This  option  tells dvgrab to store at most num frames per file
                 before splitting to a new file, where num = 0  means  ulimited.
                 The  corresponding  time depends on the video system used.  PAL
                 shows 25, NTSC about 30 frames per second.


       -guid hex If you have more than one DV device, then select one using  the
                 node&apos;s  GUID specified in hex (hexadecimal) format. This is the
                 format as displayed in /proc/bus/ieee1394/devices  or  the  new
                 kernel  2.6  /sys  filesystem.  When you specify a GUID, dvgrab
                 will establish (or overlay) a peer-to-peer connection with  the
                 device  instead of listening to the device&apos;s broadcast.  If you
                 supply a hex value of 1, then dvgrab attempts to  discover  the
                 device  as  well  as  setup  a peer-to-peer connection. This is
                 especially handy with MPEG2-TS settop  boxes,  which  typically
                 require  a  connection  management procedure to start transmit&#8208;
                 ting.


       -h, -help Show summary of options.


       -I, -input file
                 Read from file instead of FireWire. You can use &apos;-&apos;  for  stdin
                 instead of using -stdin.


       -i, -interactive
                 Make  dvgrab  interactive where single keypresses on stdin con&#8208;
                 trol the camera VTR  or  start  and  stop  capture.  Otherwise,
                 dvgrab  runs  in session mode, where it immediately starts cap&#8208;
                 ture and stops as directed or interrupted (ctrl-c).


       -jpeg-deinterlace
                 If using -format jpeg, deinterlace the output by  doubling  the
                 lines  of  the upper field. This is a cheap form of deinterlace
                 that results in an effective 50% loss in resolution.


       -jpeg-height num
                 If using -format jpeg, scale the output of the height to num (1
                 - 2048).


       -jpeg-overwrite name
                 Write  to same image file for each frame, instead of creating a
                 sequence of image files.


       -jpeg-quality num
                 If using -format jpeg,  set  the  JPEG  quality  level  from  0
                 (worst) to 100 (best).


       -jpeg-temp name 10
                 Use a temporary file to create the jpeg, rename the file to the
                 target file name when  done.  Useful  when  using  dvgrab  with
                 -jpeg-overwrite for generating a webcam image.


       -jpeg-width num
                 If  using -format jpeg, scale the output of the width to num (1
                 - 2048).


                 The JPEG scaling width and height must be both either less than
                 or  greater than the normal frame size. For example, the scaled
                 size of 700 wide by 525 high yields a  nice  4:3  aspect  image
                 with  square  pixels, but it is illegal for NTSC because 700 is
                 less than the normal width of 720 while the height  is  greater
                 than the normal height of 480.


                 Since DV uses non-square pixels, it is nice to be able to scale
                 to an image based upon a 4:3 aspect ratio using square  pixels.
                 For  NTSC, example sizes are 800x600, 640x480, and 320x240. For
                 PAL, example square pixel sizes are 384x270 and 768x540.


       -jvc-p25  Remove repeat_first_field flag and set frames per second to  25
                 to correct a stream recorded in JVC&apos;s HDV P25 mode.


       -lockstep Align capture to a multiple of -frames based on timecode.  This
                 is useful for redundancy, when more than one machine is captur&#8208;
                 ing  from the same FireWire device, and you want to ensure each
                 file contains the same footage. To ensure the files  from  each
                 machine  have  the  same  name use the -timecode option and the
                 same base name.
&#12;       -lockstep_maxdrops num
                 If num frames are dropped consecutively, then  close  the  file
                 and resume capture on the next lockstop interval. If num is -1,
                 then  permit  an  unlimited  number  of  consecutively  dropped
                 frames; this is the default.


       -lockstep_totaldrops num
                 If  num  frames are dropped in the current file, then close the
                 file and resume capture on the next lockstep interval.  If  num
                 is -1, then permit an unlimited number of total dropped frames;
                 this is the default.


       -noavc    Disable use of AV/C VTR control. This is useful if you are cap&#8208;
                 turing live video from a camera because in camera mode, an AV/C
                 play command tells the camera to start recording, perhaps  over
                 material  on the current tape.  This applies to either interac&#8208;
                 tive more or  non-interactive  because  non-interactive  stills
                 sends a play and stop to the VTR upon capture start and stop.


       -nostop   Disables sending the AV/C VTR stop command when exiting dvgrab.


       -opendml  If  using  -format  dv2,  create an OpenDML-compliant type 2 DV
                 AVI. This is required to support dv2  files  &gt;1GB.  dv1  always
                 supports files &gt;1GB.


       -r, -recordonly
                 When the camcorder is in record mode, this option causes dvgrab
                 to only capture when the camcorder is recording and not paused.
                 Normally,  when  in  record mode, dvgrab always captures to let
                 you use the camcorder purely as a  camera  where  the  computer
                 operator  is  in control. This option makes dvgrab act like the
                 VCR where the  camera  operator  controls  when  capture  takes
                 place.  This is very handy when used with the -autosplit option
                 to automatically create a new file for each shot.  This  option
                 requires AV/C and will not work with the -noavc option.


       -rewind   Rewind  the  tape completely to the beginning prior to starting
                 capture.  Naturally, this requires AV/C; however,  perhaps  not
                 so obvious is that this does not apply to interactive mode.


       -showstatus
                 Normally,  the  capture  status  information is displayed after
                 finished writing to each file. This option makes  it  show  the
                 capture status during capture, updated for each frame.


       -s, -size num
                 This  option tells dvgrab to store at most num megabytes (actu&#8208;
                 ally, mebibytes) per file, where num = 0 means  unlimited  file
                 size for large files. The default size limit is 1024 MB.


       -srt      Generate  subtitle files containing the recording date and time
                 in SRT format. For each video file that is  created  two  addi&#8208;
                 tional  files  with  the extension .srt0 and .srt1 are created.
                 They contain the recording date and time as  subtitles  in  the
                 SRT  format.  The .srt0 file contains the subtitles with timing
                 based on the running time from the start of the  current  file.
                 Use  this file if you transcode to a format like AVI. The .srt1
                 file contains the subtitles with timing based on the time  code
                 as  delivered  by  the camera.  The mplayer program understands
                 this type of subtitles.


       -stdin    Read the DV stream from a pipe on stdin instead of FireWire.


       -timecode Put the timecode of the first frame of each file into the  file
                 name.


       -t, -timestamp
                 Put information on date and time of recording into file name.


       -timesys  Put  system rather than recording date and time into file name.
                 This is useful when using converter devices that do not  change
                 the recording date time in the DV stream.


       -V, -v4l2 Capture  from  a USB Video Class (UVC) device that supports DV.
                 This uses the uvcvideo kernel module  via  V4L2.   The  default
                 device  file is /dev/video. Use the -input option to set a dif&#8208;
                 ferent device file.


       -v, -version
                 Show version of program.


       -24p      For Quicktime DV, set the frame rate as 24 fps in the Quicktime
                 file.  This only works as expected when the video has been shot
                 in 24p mode.


       -24pa     For Quicktime, DV, in addition to setting the frame rate to  24
                 in  the  Quicktime  file,  also  reverse  the  2:3:3:2 pulldown
                 process by removing the interlaced &quot;C&quot; frame. This  only  works
                 as  expected when the video has been shot in 24p Advanced mode.

EXAMPLES
       dvgrab foo-
                 Captures video data from the default FireWire source and stores
                 it to files foo-001.avi, foo-002.avi, etc.


       dvgrab -frames 25 foo-
                 Assuming  a PAL video source, this command records one second&apos;s
                 worth of video data per file.


       dvgrab -autosplit -frames 750 -timestamp foo-
                 Records video data from the default FireWire  source,  cuts  it
                 into  chunks of 30 seconds (assuming PAL) or when a new record&#8208;
                 ing starts and names the resulting files according to date  and
                 time info in the videostream.


       dvgrab -autosplit -size 1998 -csize 4400 -cmincutsize 10  foo-
                 Records  video  data  from the default FireWire source, cuts it
                 into chunks when a new recording starts  or  when  the  current
                 file  exceeds 1998 megabytes (actually, mebibytes), or the cur&#8208;
                 rent collection  of  files  exceeds  4400  megabytes.  It  also
                 reduces  the size of the smallest file made due to a collection
                 size cut to 10 megabytes.


                 This option is perfect for backing up DV to DVD&apos;s as  2  Gb  is
                 around the maximum file size that (the current) linux implemen&#8208;
                 tation of the ISO9660 filesystem can handle!


                 Warning: It is possible to make ISO9660 filesystems with  files
                 greater  than  2 Gb, but the current linux IS09660 driver can&apos;t
                 read them! Newer linux kernels may be able  to  handle  ISO9660
                 filesystems with filesizes greater than 2 Gb.


       dvgrab -format hdv -autosplit
                 Capture from a HDV camcorder.


       dvgrab -format mpeg2 -guid 1
                 Record from a digital TV settop box.


       dvgrab -jpeg-over -jpeg-w=320 -jpeg-h=240 -d smpte=1 webcam.jpeg
                 Capture  a single frame, save it as a JPEG named webcam.jpg and
                 exit.  This example also demonstrates option handling. You only
                 need  to specify enough of a long option name to uniquely iden&#8208;
                 tify it. You can use space or equal  sign  to  separate  option
                 name  and  argument. The file format is inferred from the file&#8208;
                 name extension. Also, since -jpeg-overwrite is used, the  file&#8208;
                 name will be exactly &quot;webcam.jpeg&quot; and not include any numbers.


       dvgrab -V Capture over USB from a UVC compliant DV device.


       dvgrab -v4l -input /dev/video1
                 Capture  over  USB  from a UVC compliant DV device using device
                 file /dev/video1.


       dvgrab -format=hdv -autosplit=28800 -srt foo-
                 Capture from a HDV camcorder, splitting whenever there is a gap
                 in  the  recording  that  lasts  longer than 8 hours. This will
                 likely generate a separate file for each day (useful for  holi&#8208;
                 day  videos).  It  will  also generate subtitle files. Assuming
                 that the files foo-001.m2t and foo-002.m2t are  generated,  the
                 corresponding subtitle files will be foo-001.srt0, foo-001.srt1
                 and foo-002.srt0, foo-002.srt1.  You can use the subtitle files
                 to show the recording date and time while viewing the video.
