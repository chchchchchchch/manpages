NAME
       dvibook - rearrange pages in DVI file into signatures

SYNOPSIS
       dvibook  [  -q ] [ -s&lt;num&gt; ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile [ out&#8208;
       file ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dvibook rearranges pages from a DVI file produced by  TeX  into  ``signa&#8208;
       tures&apos;&apos; for printing books or booklets, creating a new DVI file usable by
       any of the TeX conversion programs.

       The -s option selects the size of signature which will be used. The  sig&#8208;
       nature  size  is  the  number  of  sides  which  will be folded and bound
       together; the number given should be a multiple of four. The  default  is
       to  use one signature for the whole file. Extra blank sides will be added
       if the file does not contain a multiple of four pages.

       Dvibook normally prints the page numbers of the pages rearranged; the  -q
       option suppresses this.

BUGS
       Dvibook  does  not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since
       these values are normally used only to size  certain  structures  in  the
       output  conversion programs, and the parameters never need to be adjusted
       upward, this has not proven to be a problem.
