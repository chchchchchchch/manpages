DVISELECT(1)                                                        DVISELECT(1)



NAME
       dviselect - extract pages from DVI files

SYNOPSIS
       dviselect  [  -s  ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] list of pages [ infile [
       outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dviselect selects pages from a DVI file produced by TeX, creating  a  new
       DVI  file usable by any of the TeX conversion programs, or even by dvise&#8208;
       lect itself.

       A range is a string of the form even, odd, or first:last where both first
       and last are optional numeric strings, with negative numbers indicated by
       a leading underscore character ``_&apos;&apos;.  If both first and last  are  omit&#8208;
       ted,  the  colon may also be omitted, or may be replaced with an asterisk
       ``*&apos;&apos;.  A page range is a list of ranges separated by periods.  A list of
       pages  is  described  by  a set of page ranges separated by commas and/or
       white space.

       Dviselect actually looks at the ten count variables that TeX writes;  the
       first of these (\count0) is the page number, with \count1 through \count9
       having varied uses depending on which macro packages are in use.   (Typi&#8208;
       cally  \count1 might be a chapter or section number.)  A page is included
       in dviselect&apos;s output if all its \count  values  match  any  one  of  the
       ranges  listed on the command line.  For example, the command ``dviselect
       *.1,35:&apos;&apos; might select everything in chapter 1, as well as pages  35  and
       up.   ``dviselect  10:30&apos;&apos;  would select pages 10 through 30 (inclusive).
       ``:43&apos;&apos; means everything up to and including page 43 (including negative-
       numbered  pages).   To  get all even-numbered pages, use ``even&apos;&apos;; to get
       all odd-numbered pages, use ``odd&apos;&apos;.  If a Table of Contents has negative
       page  numbers,  ``:_1&apos;&apos;  will  select it.  Note that ``*&apos;&apos; must be quoted
       from the shell; the empty string is more convenient to use, if harder  to
       read.

       Instead  of  \count  values, dviselect can also select by ``absolute page
       number&apos;&apos;, where the first page is page 1,  the  second  page  2,  and  so
       forth.   Absolute  page  numbers  are  indicated  by a leading equal sign
       ``=&apos;&apos;.  Ranges of absolute pages are  also  allowed:  ``dviselect  =3:7&apos;&apos;
       will  extract  the  third  through seventh pages.  Dot separators are not
       legal in absolute ranges, and there are no negative  absolute  page  num&#8208;
       bers.   Even/odd  specifiers,  however,  are  legal;  ``dviselect =even&apos;&apos;
       selects every other page, starting with the second.

       More precisely, an asterisk or an empty string implies no limit; an equal
       sign  means  absolute  page  number  rather than \counts; a leading colon
       means everything up to and including the given  page;  a  trailing  colon
       means  everything  from  the  given page on; the word ``even&apos;&apos; means only
       even values shall be accepted; the word ``odd&apos;&apos;  means  only  odd  values
       shall  be accepted; and a period indicates that the next \count should be
       examined.  If fewer than 10 ranges are specified, the  remaining  \counts
       are left unrestricted (that is, ``1:5&apos;&apos; and ``1:5.*&apos;&apos; are equivalent).  A
       single number n is treated as if it were the  range  n:n.   An  arbitrary
       number of page selectors may be given, separated by commas or whitespace;
       a page is selected if any of the selectors matches its \counts  or  abso&#8208;
       lute page number.

       Dviselect  normally prints the page numbers of the pages selected; the -s
       option suppresses this.

BUGS
       A leading ``-&apos;&apos; ought to be allowed for negative numbers, but it is  cur&#8208;
       rently used as a synonym for ``:&apos;&apos;, for backwards compatibility.

       Section  or  subsection  selection  will sometimes fail, for the DVI file
       lists only the \count values  that  were  active  when  the  page  ended.
       Clever  macro packages can alleviate this by making use of other ``free&apos;&apos;
       \count registers.  Chapters normally begin on new pages, and do not  suf&#8208;
       fer from this particular problem.

       The  heuristic  that decides which arguments are page selectors and which
       are file names is often wrong.  Using shell redirection or the -i and  -o
       options is safest.

       Dviselect does not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since
       these values are normally used only to size  certain  structures  in  the
       output  conversion programs, and the parameters never need to be adjusted
       upward, this has not proven to be a problem.
