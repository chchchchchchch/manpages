DVITYPE(1)                                                            DVITYPE(1)



NAME
       dvitype, odvitype - translate a dvi file for humans

SYNOPSIS
       dvitype dvi_name[.dvi]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documenta&#8208;
       tion for this version of TeX can be found in  the  info  file  or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The  dvitype program translates a DVI (DeVice Independent) file output by
       (for example) tex(1) or gftodvi(1), to a file that humans  can  read.  It
       also  serves  as a DVI file-validating program (i.e., if dvitype can read
       it, it&apos;s correct) and as an example of a DVI-reading program  for  future
       device drivers.

       The  output  file  can  include all commands, just the important ones, or
       none at all (in which case only errors are reported).  A  subinterval  of
       pages  may be selected for transliteration; the magnification and resolu&#8208;
       tion of the ``output device&apos;&apos; may be changed; and so on. All options  are
       specified with an on-line dialog.

       The .dvi extension is supplied if omitted from dvi_name.  The output goes
       to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -dpi=REAL
              Set resolution to REAL pixels per inch; default 300.0.

       -magnification=NUMBER
              Override existing magnification with NUMBER.

       -max-pages=NUMBER
              Process NUMBER pages; default one million.

       -output-level=NUMBER
              Verbosity level, from 0 to 4; default 4.

       -page-start=PAGE-SPEC
              Start at PAGE-SPEC, for example `2&apos; or `5.*.-2&apos;.

       -show-opcodes
              Show numeric opcodes (in decimal).

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable TEXFONTS is used to search  for  the  TFM  files
       used  in  the DVI file.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.  If
       TEXFONTS is not set, it uses the system default.
