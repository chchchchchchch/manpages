NAME
       dwm - dynamic window manager

SYNOPSIS
       dwm [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, mono&#8208;
       cle and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, opti&#8208;
       mising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

       In  tiled  layouts windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The
       master area contains the window which  currently  needs  most  attention,
       whereas  the  stacking area contains all other windows. In monocle layout
       all windows are maximised to the screen size. In floating layout  windows
       can be resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed float&#8208;
       ing, regardless of the layout applied.

       Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multi&#8208;
       ple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.

       Each  screen  contains  a  small  status bar which displays all available
       tags, the layout, the title of the focused window, and the text read from
       the  root window name property, if the screen is focused. A floating win&#8208;
       dow is indicated with an empty square and a maximised floating window  is
       indicated  with  a  filled square before the windows title.  The selected
       tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of the focused window
       are  indicated  with  a  filled  square in the top left corner.  The tags
       which are applied to one or more windows  are  indicated  with  an  empty
       square in the top left corner.

       dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

       source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

BUGS
       Java  applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey win&#8208;
       dows only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks  ICCCM-compliance  in  recent
       JDK 1.5 and early JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting win&#8208;
       dow manager. Possible workarounds are using JDK 1.4 (which  doesn&apos;t  con&#8208;
       tain  the  XToolkit/XAWT  backend)  or  setting  the environment variable
       AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit (to use the older Motif backend instead) or  running
       xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D or wmname LG3D (to
       pretend that  a  non-reparenting  window  manager  is  running  that  the
       XToolkit/XAWT  backend  can  recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the
       environment variable _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1.

       GTK 2.10.9+ versions contain a broken Save-As file dialog implementation,
       which  requests  to  reconfigure its window size in an endless loop. How&#8208;
       ever, its window is still respondable during this state, so you can  sim&#8208;
       ply  ignore  the  flicker until a new GTK version appears, which will fix
       this bug, approximately GTK 2.10.12+ versions.
