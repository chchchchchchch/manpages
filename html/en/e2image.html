NAME
       e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem metadata to a file

SYNOPSIS
       e2image [ -rsI ] device image-file

DESCRIPTION
       The  e2image  program  will  save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem
       metadata located on device to a file specified by image-file.  The  image
       file  may  be examined by dumpe2fs and debugfs, by using the -i option to
       those programs.  This can assist an expert in recovering catastrophically
       corrupted filesystems.  In the future, e2fsck will be enhanced to be able
       to use the image file to help recover a badly damaged filesystem.

       If image-file is -, then the output of e2image will be sent  to  standard
       output,  so  that  the  output  can  be piped to another program, such as
       gzip(1).  (Note that this is currently only supported when creating a raw
       image  file  using  the -r option, since the process of creating a normal
       image file, or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the  file,
       which  cannot  be  done using a pipe.  This restriction will hopefully be
       lifted in a future version of e2image.)

       It is a very good idea to create image files for all of filesystems on  a
       system  and  save  the partition layout (which can be generated using the
       fdisk -l command) at regular intervals --- at  boot  time,  and/or  every
       week  or  so.   The  image file should be stored on some filesystem other
       than the filesystem whose data it contains, to ensure that this  data  is
       accessible in the case where the filesystem has been badly damaged.

       To  save  disk space, e2image creates the image file as a sparse file, or
       in QCOW2 format.  Hence, if the sparse image file needs to be  copied  to
       another  location,  it  should either be compressed first or copied using
       the --sparse=always option to the GNU version of cp.  This does not apply
       to the QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.

       The  size  of  an  ext2  image  file depends primarily on the size of the
       filesystems and how many inodes are in use.  For a  typical  10  gigabyte
       filesystem,  with  200,000  inodes  in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the
       image file will be approximately 35 megabytes; a  4  gigabyte  filesystem
       with  15,000  inodes  in  use  out  of  550,000 inodes will result in a 3
       megabyte image file.  Image files tend to be quite compressible; an image
       file taking up 32 megabytes of space on disk will generally compress down
       to 3 or 4 megabytes.

RESTORING FILESYSTEM METADATA USING AN IMAGE FILE
       The -I option will cause e2image to install the metadata  stored  in  the
       image  file back to the device.  It can be used to restore the filesystem
       metadata back to the device in emergency situations.

       WARNING!!!!  The -I option should only be used as a  desperation  measure
       when other alternatives have failed.  If the filesystem has changed since
       the image file was created, data will be lost.  In  general,  you  should
       make a full image backup of the filesystem first, in case you wish to try
       other recovery strategies afterwards.

RAW IMAGE FILES
       The -r option will create a raw image file  instead  of  a  normal  image
       file.   A  raw  image  file differs from a normal image file in two ways.
       First, the filesystem metadata is placed in the proper position  so  that
       e2fsck,  dumpe2fs,  debugfs,  etc.  can  be run directly on the raw image
       file.  In order to minimize the amount of disk space consumed  by  a  raw
       image  file, the file is created as a sparse file.  (Beware of copying or
       compressing/decompressing this file with utilities that don&apos;t  understand
       how to create sparse files; the file will become as large as the filesys&#8208;
       tem itself!)  Secondly, the raw image file also includes indirect  blocks
       and  directory  blocks,  which  the  standard  image  file does not have,
       although this may change in the future.

       Raw image files are sometimes used when sending filesystems to the  main&#8208;
       tainer  as part of bug reports to e2fsprogs.  When used in this capacity,
       the recommended command is as follows (replace hda1 with the  appropriate
       device):

            e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2

       This  will  only  send the metadata information, without any data blocks.
       However, the filenames in the directory blocks can still reveal  informa&#8208;
       tion  about the contents of the filesystem that the bug reporter may wish
       to keep confidential.  To address this concern,  the  -s  option  can  be
       specified.   This  will  cause  e2image to scramble directory entries and
       zero out any unused portions of the directory blocks before  writing  the
       image  file.   However,  the  -s option will prevent analysis of problems
       related to hash-tree indexed directories.

       Note that this will work even if you substitute &quot;/dev/hda1&quot;  for  another
       raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by e2image.

QCOW2 IMAGE FILES
       The  -Q option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a normal, or raw
       image file.  A QCOW2 image contains all the  information  the  raw  image
       does, however unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image min&#8208;
       imize the amount of disk space by storing data  in  special  format  with
       pack  data  closely together, hence avoiding holes while still minimizing
       size.

       In order to send filesystem to the maintainer as a part of bug report  to
       e2fsprogs,  use  following  commands  (replace  hda1 with the appropriate
       device):

            e2image -Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2
            bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2

       This will only send the metadata information, without  any  data  blocks.
       However,  the filenames in the directory blocks can still reveal informa&#8208;
       tion about the contents of the filesystem that the bug reporter may  wish
       to  keep  confidential.   To  address  this concern, the -s option can be
       specified.  This will cause e2image to  scramble  directory  entries  and
       zero  out  any unused portions of the directory blocks before writing the
       image file.  However, the -s option will  prevent  analysis  of  problems
       related to hash-tree indexed directories.

       Note  that  QCOW2 image created by e2image is regular QCOW2 image and can
       be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format such as for example qemu-img.
