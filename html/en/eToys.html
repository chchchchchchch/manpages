NAME
       eToys  -  a  media-rich  model, simulation construction kit and authoring
       tool

SYNOPSIS
       etoys
       etoys [ option... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and  starL&#8208;
       OGO.  It  is  a  media-rich  authoring environment with a simple powerful
       scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end-users that
       runs  on many platforms, and is free and open source.  It includes 2D and
       3D graphics, images, text, particles, pres-entations, web-pages,  videos,
       sound  and  MIDI,  etc.   It  includes the ability to share desktops with
       other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of immersive  mentoring  and
       play can be done over the Internet.

       The  development  of  Squeak  has been done inside the ViewPoint Research
       Institute for several years. Since last years it&apos;s being done in collabo&#8208;
       ration with the OLPC project.
