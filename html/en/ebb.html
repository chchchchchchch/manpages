EXTRACTBB(1)                        DVIPDFMx                        EXTRACTBB(1)



NAME
       extractbb, ebb - extract bounding box information from graphics files

SYNOPSIS
       extractbb [-v|-q] [-O] [-m|-x] file...

DESCRIPTION
       For  each  JPEG,  PNG,  or  PDF file given on the command line, extractbb
       extracts the bounding box information and writes  it  into  a  file  with
       extension  .xbb,  together  with some header information. These files can
       then be used by dvipdfmx or other programs. For PDF files, the number  of
       pages  and  the PDF version number are reported as well.  The input file&#8208;
       name extension may be in upper or lower case.

       If called as ebb, the output is written in the ``bb&apos;&apos;  format  (and  with
       extension  .bb)  as used by dvipdfm.  Xbb may be defined as a synomym for
       extractbb on your system.

OPTIONS
       -v        Be verbose.
       -q        Be quiet.
       -O        Write output to standard output.
       -m        Write output in dvipdfm&apos;s ``bb&apos;&apos; format.
       -x        Write output in dvipdfmx&apos;s ``xbb&apos;&apos; format (default),  which  is
                 the same as that used by pdfTeX.

OUTPUT FORMATS
       Here are more details about the bb and xbb formats:

       The  original  ebb  (from  dvipdfm) ignored density information in bitmap
       images, and generated bounding boxes with 100px = 72bp =  1in.   Unfortu&#8208;
       nately, screenshots (especially) tend to look bad with this approach.

       So,  extractbb (from dvipdfmx) uses density information if present.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise, it generates bounding box with 100px = 100bp.  This is what  pdf&#8208;
       TeX does.

BUGS
       There  is currently no way to specify which bounding box is taken for PDF
       files. It will always be the first one from the following  list:  ArtBox,
       TrimBox,  BleedBox, MediaBox. (Often only MediaBox is defined.) Moreover,
       the reported bounding box always refers to the first page in a PDF file.

AUTHOR
       extractbb was written by the DVIPDFMx project team &lt;dvipdfmx@ktug.or.kr&gt;,
       based on the program ebb by Mark A. Wicks.

       This  manual page was also written by the DVIPDFMx project team, based on
       a manual page Frank K&#252;ster  &lt;frank@kuesterei.ch&gt;  wrote  for  the  Debian
       GNU/Linux system.  It may be used, modified, and/or redistributed by oth&#8208;
       ers without contacting the authors.
