EBOOK-CONVERT(1)                     calibre                    EBOOK-CONVERT(1)



NAME
       ebook-convert - part of calibre

SYNOPSIS
       ebook-convert  input_file output_file [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Convert an ebook from one format to another.

       input_file is the input and output_file is the output. Both must be spec&#8208;
       ified as the first two arguments to the command.

       The output ebook format is  guessed  from  the  file  extension  of  out&#8208;
       put_file. output_file can also be of the special format .EXT where EXT is
       the output file extension. In this case, the name of the output  file  is
       derived  the  name  of  the  input file. Note that the filenames must not
       start with a hyphen. Finally, if output_file has no extension, then it is
       treated as a directory and an &quot;open ebook&quot; (OEB) consisting of HTML files
       is written to that directory. These files are the files that  would  nor&#8208;
       mally have been passed to the output plugin.

       After  specifying the input and output file you can customize the conver&#8208;
       sion by specifying various options. The available options depend  on  the
       input  and  output  file types. To get help on them specify the input and
       output file and then use the -h option.
