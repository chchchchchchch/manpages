NAME
       ecasound-iam - ecasound interactive mode

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       Ecasound library contains an interpreter module that understands a set of
       commands aimed at controlling various library services.  This  is  called
       the  ecasound  interactive  mode  (EIAM). All programs linked to ecasound
       library can use this facility.

ECI API and return types
       A special case of interactive mode use is  ecasound&#8217;s  control  interface
       (ECI),  which is a small library providing easy access to the interactive
       mode commands from outside of libecasound. When  issuing  inter  commands
       using  the  control  interface,  it&#8217;s  possible that commands also return
       information.  Currently supported return value  types  are:  string  [s],
       list of strings [S] (elements separated by commas; escaped if necessary),
       integer [i], long integer [li] and floating-point number [f]. These defi&#8208;
       nitions  are  used throughout this document. Commands that return nothing
       (void) are marked with [-]. Additionally, return type [e] marks an  error
       condition.   When  an  interactive  mode  command results in an error, an
       error string explaining the condition is returned.

Limitations related to real-time control and modifications
       It&#8217;s not possible to use all interactive mode commands to modify and con&#8208;
       trol  objects  that belong to a connected chainsetup. Ecasound will auto&#8208;
       matically disconnect (and later try to reconnect) the chainsetup in  case
       these commands are received while connected. Commands that have this lim&#8208;
       itation are:

              cs-remove, cs-set-length,  cs-set-length-samples,  cs-toggle-loop,
              cs-set-param,   cs-option,  c-add,   c-remove,  c-rename, c-clear,
              ai-add,    ai-remove,    ai-attach,     ai-forward,     ai-rewind,
              ai-set-position,  ai-set-position-samples, ao-add, ao-add-default,
              ao-remove,  ao-attach,   ao-forward,  ao-rewind,  ao-set-position,
              ao-set-position-samples.


       The  following  commands  may be used on with a connected chainsetup, but
       they require pausing the engine temporarily (if  running)  and  this  can
       cause  audible  gaps to playback and recording. In practise this means it
       is currently not possible to add or remove  chain  operators  in  a  gap&#8208;
       less/seamless fashion. The affected commands:

              cop-add, ctrl-add,


       The following commands can be used on a connected chainsetup and when the
       engine is running (not a complete list but at least  these  commands  are
       supported):

              cop-set,   copp-set,   ctrlp-set,   c-bypass,   c-muting,  setpos,
              cs-set-position, *-describe *-deselect, *-get, *-list,  *-register
              *-select, *-selected, *-status, dump-*, int-*, jack-*, map-*


GENERAL
       quit, q
              Quit  ecasound session. What this means in practice depends on the
              client implementation. In ecasound interactive mode, &#8217;quit&#8217; termi&#8208;
              nates the ecasound process. When sent over ecasound server connec&#8208;
              tion (aka NetECI), &#8217;quit&#8217; terminates the  active  network  connec&#8208;
              tion, but does not terminate the ecasound server process. [-]

       start, t
              Processing is started (play). Error string is return if any errors
              upon startup are encountered. [e]

       stop, s
              Stop processing. [-]

       stop-sync, s
              Stop processing with a blocking call (do not return  until  engine
              has actually stopped). [-]

       run    Like &#8217;start&#8217; but blocks until processing is finished. Error string
              is return if any errors  upon  startup,  or  during  process,  are
              encountered. [e]

       debug &#8217;debug-level&#8217;
              Set  debug level to &#8217;debug-level&#8217;. Notice that client programs can
              reimplement the debug routines. [-]


       resource-file &#8217;path-to-file&#8217;
              Overrides the global and user  resource  files.  Does  not  affect
              already  created  objects. This command is equivalent to &#8217;-R&#8217; eca&#8208;
              sound option (see ecasound (1) man page).

       -prefix:arg1,...,argN
              Equivalent to issuing &#8217;cs-option -prefix:arg1,...,argN). See docu&#8208;
              mentation for &#8217;cs-option&#8217;.

       help&#8217;, &#8217;h&#8217;
              Help! [-]

GLOBAL
       engine-status
              Returns  a  string describing the engine status (running, stopped,
              finished, error, not ready). See also cs-status. [s]

       engine-launch
              Starts the real-time engine. Engine  will  execute  the  currently
              connected  chainsetup  (see &#8217;cs-connect). This action does not yet
              start actual processing (see start and  stop).  When  ecasound  is
              used  as  a  JACK  client, issuing engine-launch makes ecasound an
              active JACK client (i.e. ecasound&#8217;s  ports  can  be  connected  to
              other JACK clients). [-]

       engine-halt
              Stops the engine. Does not disconnect the chainsetup that was run&#8208;
              ning. See also cs-disconnet and stop. When ecasound is used  as  a
              JACK  client,  engine-halt will cause ecasound to become a deacti&#8208;
              vated client (all JACK connections are torn down). [-]

CHAINSETUPS
       Chainsetup is the central data object. All other  objects  (inputs,  out&#8208;
       puts,  chains,  etc)  are connected to some chainsetup. There can be many
       chainsetups but only one can be connected. Similarly only one  chainsetup
       can  be  selected.  If not otherwise specified operations are done on the
       selected chainsetup. Some operations also require  that  selected  chain&#8208;
       setup is not connected.

       cs-add &#8217;name&#8217;
              Adds a new chainsetup with name &#8217;name&#8217;. &#8217;name&#8217; is now the selected
              chainsetup. [-]

       cs-remove
              Removes currently selected chainsetup. [-]
&#12;       cs-list
              Returns a list of all chainsetups. [S]

       cs-select &#8217;name&#8217;
              Selects chainsetup &#8217;name&#8217;. [-]

       cs-selected
              Returns the name of currently selected chainsetup. [s]

       cs-index-select &#8217;cs_index&#8217;, cs-iselect &#8217;cs_index&#8217;
              Selects a chainsetup based on a  short  index  string.  Chainsetup
              names can be rather long. This command can be used to avoid typing
              these long names. &#8217;cs_index&#8217; is an integer value, where &#8217;1&#8217; refers
              to  the  first  audio  input/output.  You  can  use  &#8217;cs-list&#8217; and
              &#8217;cs-status&#8217; to get a full list of currently available chainsetups.
              [-]

       cs-load &#8217;filename&#8217;
              Adds  a new chainsetup by loading it from file &#8217;filename&#8217;.  &#8217;file&#8208;
              name&#8217; is now the selected chainsetup. [-]

       cs-save
              Saves the currently selected chainsetup to file. If chainsetup was
              loaded  from  a file, the saved version will replace the original.
              If it doesn&#8217;t have a  default  filename,  it&#8217;s  saved  to  &quot;chain&#8208;
              setup_name.ecs&quot;. [-]

       cs-save-as &#8217;filename&#8217;
              Saves currently selected chainsetup to file &#8217;filename&#8217;. [-]

       cs-edit
              Currently  selected  chainsetup is saved to a temporary file. This
              file is loaded to an external editor (see ecasoundrc  (5)).  After
              editing, the chainsetup is loaded back to ecasound. [-]

       cs-is-valid
              Whether  currently  selected  chainsetup  is  valid  (=can be con&#8208;
              nected)? [i]

       cs-connect
              Connect currently selected chainsetup to engine. When  connecting,
              all  resources  (e.g. files, soundcard devices, external programs)
              needed to execute the chainsetup are reserved. Only one chainsetup
              can be connected at a time. Error string is returned if connection
              fails (for instance due to error in allocating the resources). [e]

       cs-disconnect
              Disconnect currently connected chainsetup. This action  will  free
              all external resources needed by the chainsetup. [-]

       cs-connected
              Returns the name of currently connected chainsetup. [s]

       cs-rewind  &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;,  rewind &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;, rw &#8217;time-in-sec&#8208;
       onds&#8217;
              Rewinds the current chainsetup position by &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;  sec&#8208;
              onds.  Position of all inputs and outputs attached to the selected
              chainsetup is also affected. [-]

       cs-forward    &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;,    forward     &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;,     fw
       &#8217;ttime-in-seconds&#8217;
              The  current chainsetup position is forwarded by &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;
              seconds. Position of  all  inputs  and  outputs  attached  to  the
              selected chainsetup is also affected. [-]

       cs-set-position  &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;,  cs-setpos  &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;, setpos
       &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;, set-position &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217;
              Sets the chainsetup position to &#8217;time-in-seconds&#8217; seconds from the
              beginning.  Position  of  all  inputs  and outputs attached to the
              selected chainsetup is also affected. [-]

       cs-set-position-samples &#8217;time-in-samples&#8217;
              Sets the chainsetup position to &#8217;time-in-samples&#8217; samples from the
              beginning.  Position  of  all  inputs  and outputs attached to the
              selected chainsetup is also affected. [-]

       cs-get-position, cs-getpos, getpos, get-position
              Returns the current chainsetup position in seconds. [f]

       cs-get-position-samples
              Returns the current chainsetup position in samples. [li]

       cs-get-length, get-length
              Returns the chainsetup length in seconds (if known). [f]

       cs-get-length-samples, get-length-samples
              Returns the chainsetup length in samples (if known). [li]

       cs-set-length &#8217;seconds&#8217;
              Sets processing time in seconds (doesn&#8217;t have  to  be  an  integer
              value).   A  special-case  value  of  &#8217;-1&#8217; will set the chainsetup
              length according to the longest input object. [-]

       cs-set-length-samples &#8217;samples&#8217;
              Sets processing time in samples. [-]

       cs-toggle-loop
              Toggle looping. When processing is  finished,  engine  will  start
              again  from  the  initial  position.  It&#8217;s  not always possible to
              enable looping (for instance all inputs and outputs have  infinite
              length   and   chainsetup   length  is  not  explicitly  set  with
              &#8217;cs-set-length&#8217;). [-]

       cs-set-param
              Interpret general chainsetup  parameters  like  for  example  &quot;-b&quot;
              (buffersize),  &quot;-n&quot;  (name),  etc. See ecasound (1) for more info.
              [-]

       cs-set-audio-format &#8217;bits,channels,sample_rate&#8217;
              Set the default sample parameters for  currently  selected  chain&#8208;
              setup.   For  example cd-quality audio would be &quot;16,2,44100&quot;. This
              does the same as command-line argument &quot;-f&quot;  (see  ecasound  (1)).
              [-]

       cs-status, status, st
              Prints   out   status   information  about  available  chainsetup.
              Detailed information is printed out for connected (=available  for
              running)  nd selected (=available for editing) chainsetups.  Other
              chainsetups are listed, but further details are suppressed. To get
              full  details of a specific chainsetup, select it with &#8217;cs-select&#8217;
              or &#8217;cs-iselect&#8217;, and then issue &#8217;cs-select&#8217;. [s]

       cs-option &#8217;-prefix:arg1,...,argN&#8217;
              One powerful feature of the interactive-mode is that  it  provides
              full access to ecasound&#8217;s command-line syntax.  For instance, com&#8208;
              mand &quot;cs-option -efb:400,200&quot; means  that  a  bandpass  filter  is
              added to the currently selected chain, with initial parameters 400
              (center frequency) and 200 (width in Hz).

       Note that session level options (such as setting debug level) can not  be
       used with &#8217;cs-option&#8217; (i.e. only options that modify chainsetups).

       Note!  Ecasound interactive mode implicitly interprets all strings begin&#8208;
       ning with a &#8217;-&#8217; as &quot;cs-option string&quot;.
&#12;CHAINS
       Chain is a simple signal flow abstraction. Every chain has one input  and
       one  output.  All  chain  operators and their controllers are attached to
       chains. Chains can be muted, unmuted and be bypassed.  If  not  otherwise
       stated, all operations are done to currently selected chainsetup.

       c-add &#8217;cname1,...,cnameN&#8217;
              Adds  a  set  of  chains. Added chains are automatically selected.
              Note that commas in chain names are not allowed. [-]

       c-remove
              Removes selected chains. [-]

       c-list Returns a list of all chains. [S]

       c-select &#8217;cname1,...,cnameN&#8217;
              Selects chains. Other chains are automatically deselected. [-]

       c-index-select &#8217;index1,...,indexN&#8217;, c-iselect &#8217;index1,...,indexN&#8217;
              Selects a set of chains based on the list of indixes.  Each  index
              is  an integer value, where &#8217;1&#8217; refers to the first chain. You can
              use &#8217;c-list&#8217; and &#8217;c-status&#8217; to get a full list of currently avail&#8208;
              able chains. [-]

       c-select-all
              Selects all chains. [-]

       c-select-add &#8217;cname1,...,cnameN&#8217;
              Selects more chains. [-]

       c-deselect &#8217;cname1,...,cnameN&#8217;
              Deselects chains. [-]

       c-selected
              Returns a list of selected chains. [S]

       c-clear
              Clear  selected  chains  by  removing all chain operators and con&#8208;
              trollers.  Doesn&#8217;t change how chains are connected to  inputs  and
              outputs. [-]

       c-rename &#8217;new_name&#8217;
              Renames  the  selected chain. When using this command, exactly one
              chain must be selected. [-]

       c-mute &lt;on|off|toggle&gt;
              Set the mute state of the currently selected chain. When chain  is
              muted, it will only output silence.

       The  command  takes  a single parameter: &quot;on&quot; -&gt; chain is muted, &quot;off&quot; -&gt;
       not muted, and &quot;toggle&quot; -&gt; change the  muting  state.   If  parameter  is
       omitted,  &quot;toggle&quot;  is  assumed  (muting  is  either enabled or disabled,
       depending on previous state).

       Control of chain and chain operator muting  states  is  independent.   If
       &quot;c-mute  off&quot;  is  executed, the states of individual cop-bypass commands
       will take effect. If chain is muted, the chain will output silence  irre&#8208;
       spective of the individual chain operator muting state. [-]

       c-bypass &lt;on|off|toggle&gt;
              Set  the  bypass state of the currently selected chain. When chain
              is bypassed, sample data is passed through unprocessed (all  chain
              operators are disabled for the given chain).

       The command takes a single parameter: &quot;on&quot; -&gt; chain is bypassed, &quot;off&quot; -&gt;
       no bypass, and &quot;toggle&quot; -&gt; change the  bypass  state.   If  parameter  is
       omitted,  &quot;toggle&quot;  is  assumed  (bypass  is  either enabled or disabled,
       depending on previous state).

       Control of chain and chain operator bypass  states  is  independent.   If
       chain  bypass  is  disabled, the states of individual cop-bypass commands
       will take effect. If chain is bypassed, all operators are bypassed  inde&#8208;
       pendetly of their cop-bypass state. [-]

       c-status, cs
              Print status info about all chains. [s]

       c-is-bypassed
              Returns  true if selected chain is currently bypassed (none of the
              chain operators are run). See &#8217;c-bypass&#8217;. [i]

       c-is-mute
              Returns true if selected chain is currently muted (outputs silence
              as its output). See &#8217;c-mute&#8217;. [i]

AUDIO INPUT/OUTPUT OBJECTS
       If  not  otherwise  stated, all operations are done to currently selected
       object. All commands with ai- prefix operate on audio inputs, while  com&#8208;
       mands with ao- operate on outputs.

       ai-add &#8217;input_format_string&#8217;
              Adds  a  new input object. See ecasound (1) man page for more info
              about the argument format (&#8217;-i&#8217; option). Note on syntax: if any of
              the parameters (such as a filename) contains commas, the parameter
              should be enclosed in double-quotes. [-]

       ao-add &#8217;output_format_string&#8217;
              Adds a new output object. See ecasound (1) man page for more  info
              about the argument format (&#8217;-o&#8217; option). If argument is omitted, a
              default output device is added (see ecasoundrc (5)). Note on  syn&#8208;
              tax:  if  any of the parameters (such as a filename) contains com&#8208;
              mas, the parameter should be enclosed in double-quotes. [-]

       ao-add-default

       ai-select &#8217;aobject_name&#8217;, ao-select &#8217;aobject_name&#8217;
              Selects an audio object. &#8217;aobject_name&#8217; refers to the string  used
              when   creating   the   object   (the   first  argument  given  to
              ai-add/ao-add).   Note  that  as   a   important   difference   to
              ai-add/ao-add,  one  should  not enclose the object name in double
              quotes for ai-select/ao-select. In the case a chainsetup  contains
              multiple  inputs, or outputs, with identical name, &#8217;ai-select&#8217; and
              &#8217;ao-select&#8217; will select the first matching instance. In  order  to
              select a specific instance, the &#8217;ai-iselect&#8217; and &#8217;ao-iselect&#8217; com&#8208;

              Select some audio object based on a short index string. Especially
              file names can be rather long. This command can be used  to  avoid
              typing  these  long  names  when  selecting  audio  objects. &#8217;aob&#8208;
              ject_index&#8217; is an integer value, where &#8217;1&#8217;  refers  to  the  first
              audio  input/output.  You can use &#8217;ai-list&#8217; and &#8217;ao-list&#8217; to get a
              full list of currently available inputs/outputs. [-]

CHAIN OPERATORS
       Chain operators are used to process and analyze sample  data.   They  are
       attached  to  chains.  If not otherwise stated, currently selected chain&#8208;
       setup and chain are used. Also, &#8217;chainop_id&#8217; and &#8217;param_id&#8217; are  used  to
       select  chain operators and their parameters. First valid value for these
       parameters is 1.

       cop-add &#8217;cop_format_string&#8217;
              Adds a new chain operator. In addition to normal chain  operators,
              this  commmand  can also be used to add effect presets and various
              plugins. Note; it is not possible to  add  operators  to  multiple
              chains  at  once. In other words only one chain should be selected
              when issuing &#8217;cop-add&#8217;.  See ecasound (1) man page for more  info.
              [-]

       cop-bypass &lt;on|off|toggle&gt;

              bypassed,  &quot;off&quot;  -&gt;  no bypass, and &quot;toggle&quot; -&gt; change the bypass
              state.  If parameter is omitted, &quot;toggle&quot; is  assumed  (bypass  is
              either enabled or disabled, depending on previous state). [-]

       cop-is-bypassed
              Returns  true  if  selected  chain  operator is currently bypassed
              (temporarily not part of the processing chain). [i]
