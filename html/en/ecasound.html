ecasound(1)                    Multimedia software                   ecasound(1)



NAME
       ecasound - sample editor, multitrack recorder, fx-processor, etc.

SYNOPSIS
       ecasound  [  general_options  ]  {  [  chain_setup  ]  [ effect_setup ] [
       input_setup ] [ output_setup ] }

DESCRIPTION
       Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio  processing.
       It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording and format
       conversions, as well as for multitrack effect processing, mixing, record&#8208;
       ing and signal recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs,
       outputs and effect algorithms.  Effects and audio objects can be combined
       in  various  ways,  and  their  parameters  can be controlled by operator
       objects  like  oscillators  and  MIDI-CCs.  A  versatile   console   mode
       user-interface is included in the package.

OPTIONS
       Note!  All  options except those mentioned in ecasound options and Global
       options, can be used in ecasound chainsetup files (.ecs).

       ECASOUND OPTIONS

              These options are parsed and  handled  by  the  ecasound  frontend
              binary  and  are  not  passed  to backend library. This means that
              these options may not work in other applications that use ecasound
              libraries for their functionality.

       -c     Starts  ecasound  in interactive mode. In interactive mode you can
              control ecasound with simple commands (&quot;start&quot;,  &quot;stop&quot;,  &quot;pause&quot;,
              etc.). See ecasound-iam .

       -C     Disables ecasound&#8217;s interactive mode (see &#8217;-c&#8217; and &#8217;-K&#8217;).


       -D     Print  all  debug  information to stderr (unbuffered, plain output
              without ncurses).

       -s[:]chainsetup-file
              Create a new chainsetup from file &#8217;chainsetup-file&#8217; and add it  to
              the  current  session.  Chainsetup  files commonly have a filename
              ending to the &#8217;.ecs&#8217; extension. A chainsetup can  contain  inputs,
              outputs,  chains,  effects,  controllers  -- i.e.  objects one one
              specific configuration of audio processing elements. A session, on
              the  other  hand, is a collection of one or more chainsetups. Only
              one of the chainsetups may be connected (i.e. it can  be  run/pro&#8208;
              cessed).  But  it  is  possible  to have another chainsetup select
              (i.e. can be configured) while  other  one  is  current  connteced
              (i.e. running).

       -E &quot;cmd1 [[args] ; cmd2 args ; ... ; cmdN]&quot;
              Execute  a  set  of  Ecasound  Interactive mode (EIAM) commands at
              launch. These commands are executed immediately after ecasound  is
              started. If the command line contains sufficient options to create
              a valid chainsetup that will be executed, the launch commands  are
              executed  after  the  other  command  line options are parsed, but
              before the processing engine is started. Note that this command is
              a feature of the ecasound frontend binary and not supported by the
              library backend. This means that other clients may not support the
              &#8217;-E&#8217;  option,  and  also that the launch commands are not saved as
              part of chainsetup or session state.
&#12;       --server
              Enables the so called NetECI mode, in which ecasound can  be  con&#8208;
              trolled remotely over a socket connection. When activated, clients
              can connect to the running ecasound session, and  use  interactive
              mode commands to control and observe ecasound processing.

              The NetECI protocol is defined in Ecasound&#8217;s Programmer Guide

              One example client using this feature is ecamonitor(1). This util&#8208;
              ity is included in the Ecasound distribution package  (requires  a
              working Python environment).

              Warning! If the machine running ecasound, is connected to a public
              network, be sure to block ecasound&#8217;s port  in  your  firewall!  As
              there  is  no access control implemented for incoming connections,
              anyone can otherwise connect, control and  observe  your  ecasound
              sessions.  This option replaces &#8217;--daemon&#8217; (deprecated in 2.6.0).

       --server-tcp-port=NNN
              Set the TCP port used by the daemon mode. By default ecasound will
              use port number 2868.  This option replaces &#8217;--daemon-port&#8217;  (dep&#8208;
              recated in 2.6.0).

       --no-server
              Disable  ecasound&#8217;s daemon mode. This is the default.  This option
              replaces &#8217;--nodaemon&#8217; (deprecated in 2.6.0).

       --osc-udp-port=NNN
              Enables support for Open Source Control (OSC). Ecasound will  lis&#8208;
              ten  for  incoming  OSC  messages  on UDP port NNN. Ecasound&#8217;s OSC
              interface   is   documented    at:    &lt;http://ecasound.git.source&#8208;
              forge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ecasound/ecasound;a=blob;f=Documenta&#8208;
              tion/ecasound_osc_interface.txt;hb=HEAD&gt;

              Note that OSC support is  still  experimental  and  the  interface
              might change in later versions of Ecasound.

              This option was added to ecasound 2.7.0.

       --keep-running,-K
              Do  not  exit  when  processing  is finished/stopped. Only affects
              non-interactive operating mode (see -c/-C).  Option added to  eca&#8208;
              sound 2.4.2.

       --help,-h
              Show this help.

       --version
              Print version info.

              GLOBAL OPTIONS

       -d, -dd, -ddd
              Increase  the  amount of printed debug messages. -d adds some ver&#8208;
              bosity, while -ddd results in very detailed output.

       -d:debug_level
              Set the debug level mask to &#8217;debug_level&#8217;. This a bitmasked  value
              with  the following classes: errors (1), info (2), subsystems (4),
              module_names (8), user_objects (16), system_objects 32,  functions
              (64),  continuous  (128)  and eiam_return_values (256). Default is
              271 (1+2+4+8+256). See sourcode documentation for  the  ECA_LOGGER
              class for more detailed information.

       -R[:]path-to-file
              Use   ecasound   resource   file   (see   ecasoundrc   man   page)
              &#8217;path-to-file&#8217; as the only source of setting resource value. Spec&#8208;
              ifying this option will disable the normal policy of querying both
              global and user (if exists) resource files.

       -q     Quiet mode, no output. Same as -d:0.

              GENERAL CHAINSETUP OPTIONS


       -a:chainname1, chainname2, ...
              Selects active signal chains. All  inputs  and  outputs  following
              this  &#8217;-a&#8217;  option are assigned to selected chains (until a new -a
              option is specified). When adding effects, controllers  and  other
              chain  operators,  only one chain can be selected at a time. If no
              -a option has been given, chain &#8217;default&#8217;  is  used  instead  when
              adding  objects.  Chain name &#8217;all&#8217; is also reserved. It will cause
              all existing chains to be selected. By giving multiple -a options,
              you  can  control  to which chains effects, inputs and outputs are
              assigned to. Look at the EXAMPLES section for more  detailed  info
              about the usage of this option.

       -n:name
              Sets  the name of chainsetup to &#8217;name&#8217;. If not specified, defaults
              either to &quot;command-line-setup&quot; or to  the  file  name  from  which
              chainsetup was loaded. Whitespaces are not allowed.

       -x     Truncate  outputs. All output object are opened in overwrite mode.
              Any existing files will be truncated.

       -X     Open outputs for updating. Ecasound opens all outputs - if  target
              format allows it - in readwrite mode.

       -z:feature
              Enables  &#8217;feature&#8217;.  Most  features can be disabled using notation
              -z:nofeature. &#8217;-z:db,dbsize&#8217; enables  double-buffering  for  audio
              objects  that  support  it (dbsize=0 for default, otherwise buffer
              size  in  sample  frames).  &#8217;-z:nodb&#8217;  disables  double-buffering.
              &#8217;-z:intbuf&#8217;  and  &#8217;-z:nointbuf&#8217;  control  whether  extra  internal
              buffering is allowed for  realtime  devices.  Disabling  this  can
              reduce latency times in some situations. With &#8217;-z:xruns&#8217;, process&#8208;
              ing will be halted if an under/overrun occurs. &#8217;-z:multitrack&#8217; and
              &#8217;z:nomultitrack&#8217;  can  be used to force ecasound to enable or dis&#8208;
              able multitrack-mode. In rare cases you  may  want  to  explicitly
              specify  the  recording  offset with &#8217;-z:multitrack,offset-in-sam&#8208;
              ples&#8217;. The offset is the amount of samples skipped when  recording
              from  real-time  inputs. &#8217;-z:psr&#8217; enables the precise-sample-rates
              mode for OSS-devices. &#8217;-z:mixmode,sum&#8217; enables mixing  mode  where
              channels  are  mixed  by  summing  all  channels.  The  default is
              &#8217;-z:mixmode,avg&#8217;, in which channels are mixed by  averaging.  Mix&#8208;
              mode  selection was first added to ecasound 2.4.0.  See ecasoundrc
              man page.

              CHAINSETUP BUFFERING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIONS


       -B:buffering_mode
              Selects the  default  buffering  mode.  Mode  is  one  of:  &#8217;auto&#8217;
              (default), &#8217;nonrt&#8217;, &#8217;rt&#8217;, &#8217;rtlowlatency&#8217;.

       -b:buffer size
              Sets  the  size  of  buffer in samples (must be an exponent of 2).
              This is quite an important option. For real-time  processing,  you
              should set this as low as possible to reduce the processing delay.
              Some machines can handle buffer values as low as 64  and  128.  In
              some  circumstances (for instance when using oscillator envelopes)
              small buffer sizes will make envelopes act more smoothly. When not
              processing in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal files),
              values between 512 - 4096 often give better  results.  Default  is
              1024.

       -r:sched_priority
              Use realtime scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO). This is impossible if
              ecasound doesn&#8217;t have root priviledges. Beware! This gives  better
              performance, but can cause total lock-ups if something goes wrong.
              The &#8217;sched_priority&#8217; can be omitted (0=omitted). If given, this is
              the  static  priority  to  the  highest  priority ecasound thread.
              Other ecasound threads run with  priority  &#8217;sched_priority-1...n&#8217;.
              Value &#8217;-1&#8217; can be used to disable raised-priority mode.

       -z:feature
              Relevant features are -z:db,xxx (-z:nodb) and -z:intbuf (-z:noint&#8208;
              buf).  See section General chainsetup options for details.

              PROCESSING CONTROL

       -t:seconds
              Sets processing time in seconds (doesn&#8217;t have  to  be  an  integer
              value).   If  processing  time  isn&#8217;t  set,  engine stops when all
              inputs  are  finished.  This   option   is   equivalent   to   the
              &#8217;cs-set-length&#8217;  EIAM  command.  A special-case value of &#8217;-1&#8217; will
              set the chainsetup length according to the longest input object.

       -tl    Enables looping. When processing is finished,  engine  will  start
              again  from  beginning. This option is equivalent to the &#8217;cs-loop&#8217;
              EIAM command.

              INPUT/OUTPUT SETUP

       See ecasound user&#8217;s guide for more detailed documentation.

       -G:mgrtype,optstring
              Sets options for audio object manager type &#8217;mgrtype&#8217;.  For  avail&#8208;
              able options, see &quot;OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES&quot; below.

       -f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate,interleaving
              Sets the audio stream parameters for subsequent audio objects.  To
              set different parameters for  different  audio  objects,  multiple
              &#8217;-f&#8217;  options  have  to  be specified (note the ordering, the &#8217;-f&#8217;
              options should precede the audio objects  for  them  to  have  any
              effect). See documentation for &#8217;-i&#8217; and &#8217;-o&#8217; options.

              When  an  audio  object  is opened (e.g. a file or sound device is
              opened, or connection is made to a sound server), the audio stream
              parameters  are  passed to the object. It should be noted that not
              all audio objects allow to set any or all of the parameters.   For
              instance when opening existing audio files, many file formats have
              a header describing the file audio parameters. In these cases  the
              audio  file  header  overrides  the  parameters  passed  with &#8217;-f&#8217;
              option. Similarly when creating JACK inputs and outputs, the  JACK
              server mandates the sampling rate and sample format.

              If no &#8217;-f&#8217; option is specified, or some of the argument fields are
              left empty (e.g. &#8217;-f:,2,44100&#8217;), ecasound will use default values.
              These default values are defined in ecasoundrc configuration file.
              See ecasoundrc(5) manual page.

              Note that ecasound opens out files  by  default  in  update  mode.
              Unless  option  &#8217;-x&#8217;  (overwrite  outputs)  option is given, audio
              parameters of an existing audio  file  take  preference  over  the
              params set with &#8217;-f&#8217;.

              Sample  format is given as a formatted string. The first letter is
              either &quot;u&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; (unsigned, signed,  floating  point).  The
              following  number specifies sample size in bits. If sample is lit&#8208;
              tle endian, &quot;_le&quot; is added to the end. Similarly  if  big  endian,
              &quot;_be&quot; is added. If endianness is not specified, host byte-order is
              used.   Currently  supported  formats  are  &quot;u8&quot;  (same  as  &quot;8&quot;),
              &quot;s16_le&quot;  (same  as &quot;16&quot;), &quot;s16_be&quot;, &quot;s24_le&quot;, &quot;s24_be&quot;, &quot;s32_le&quot;,
              &quot;s32_be&quot;, &quot;f32_le&quot; and &quot;f32_be&quot;. An empty string &quot;&quot; picks the sys&#8208;
              tem default sample format.

              The  4th  parameter  defines  the  channel  layout.  The available
              options are &#8217;i&#8217; (interleaved&#8217; and &#8217;n&#8217; (noninterleaved).  With  the
              noninterleaved  setting, ecasound will process samples one channel
              at a time, and the blocksize is set with &#8217;-b&#8217;.  The  default  set&#8208;
              ting is &#8217;i&#8217;.

       -y:seconds
              Sets  starting  position  for  last specified input/output. If you
              need more flexible control over audio objects, you should use  the
              .ewf format.

       -i[:]input-file-or-device[,params]
              Specifies  a  new  input  source that is connected to all selected
              chains (chains are selected with  &#8217;-a:...&#8217;).  Connecting  multiple
              inputs  to  the  same  chain is not possible, but one input can be
              connected to multiple chains. Input can be a  a  file,  device  or
              some  other  audio object (see below). If the input is a file, its
              type is determined using the file name extension.  If  the  object
              name  contains any commas, the name must be enclosed in backquotes
              to avoid confusing the parser.  Currently  supported  formats  are
              RIFF WAVE files (.wav), audio-cd tracks (.cdr), ecasound EWF files
              (.ewf), RAW audio data (.raw) and MPEG  audio  files  (.mp2,.mp3).
              More  audio  formats are supported via libaudiofile and libsndfile
              libraries (see documentation  below).  MikMod  is  also  supported
              (.xm, .mod, .s3m, .it, etc). MIDI files (.mid) are supported using
              Timidity++.  Similarly Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) can be read, and  written
              if ogg123 and vorbize tools are installed; FLAC files (.flac) with
              flac  command-line  tools  or  using  libsndfile;  and  AAC  files
              (.aac/.m4a/.mp4) with faad2/faac tools. Supported realtime devices
              are OSS audio devices (/dev/dsp*), ALSA audio and loopback devices
              and  JACK  audio  subsystem. If no inputs are specified, the first
              non-option (doesn&#8217;t start with &#8217;-&#8217;) command line argument is  con&#8208;
              sidered to be an input.

       -o[:]output-file-or-device[,params]
              Works  in  the same way as the -i option. If no outputs are speci&#8208;
              fied, the default output device is used  (see  ~/.ecasoundrc).  If
              the  object name contains any commas, the name must be enclosed in
              backquotes to avoid confusing the parser. Note, many object  types
              do not support output (e.g. MikMod, MIDI and many others).

              OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES

       ALSA devices - &#8217;alsa&#8217;
              When using ALSA drivers, instead of a device filename, you need to
              use the following option syntax: -i[:]alsa,pcm_device_name.

       ALSA direct-hw and plugin access - &#8217;alsahw&#8217;, &#8217;alsaplugin&#8217;
              It&#8217;s also possible to use a specific card and  device  combination
              using  the following notation: -i[:]alsahw,card_number,device_num&#8208;
              ber,subdevice_number.  Another  option  is  the  ALSA  PCM  plugin
              layer.  It  works  just like the normal ALSA pcm-devices, but with
              automatic channel count and sample format conversions. Option syn&#8208;
              tax is -i[:]alsaplugin,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number.

       aRts input/output - &#8217;arts&#8217;
              If enabled at compile-time, ecasound supports audio input and out&#8208;
              put using aRts audio server. Option syntax is -i:arts, -o:arts.

       Audio file sequencing - &#8217;audioloop&#8217;, &#8217;select&#8217;, &#8217;playat&#8217;
              Ecasound provides a set of special audio object types that can  be
              used  for temporal sequencing of audio files - i.e. looping, play&#8208;
              ing only a select portion of a file, playing file  at  a  spefific
              time, and other such operation.

              Looping  is  possible  with -i:audioloop,file.ext,params. The file
              name (or any object type understood by Ecasound) given as the sec&#8208;
              ond  parameter  is  played  back  continuously looping back to the
              beginning when the end of file is reached. Any additional  parame&#8208;
              ters  given  are  passed unaltered to the file object.  Parameters
              3...N are passed as is  to  the  child  object  (i.e.   &quot;-i  audi&#8208;
              oloop,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot;  will  pass parameters &quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the
              &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.

              To select and use only a specific segment of an audio object,  the
              -i:select,start-time,duration,file.ext,params  can  be  used. This
              will play &quot;duration&quot; of &quot;file.ext&quot;, starting at &quot;start-time&quot;.  The
              time  values  should be given as seconds (e.g.  &quot;2.25&quot;, or as sam&#8208;
              ples (e.g. &quot;25000sa&quot;). Parameters 4...N are passed as  is  to  the
              child object.

              To   play  an  audio  object  at  a  given  moment  in  time,  the
              -i:playat,play-at-time,file.ext,params can be used. This will play
              &quot;file.ext&quot;  after position reaches &quot;play-at-time&quot;. The time values
              should be given as seconds (e.g.   &quot;2.25&quot;,  or  as  samples  (e.g.
              &quot;25000sa&quot;). Parameters 2...N are passed as is to the child object.

       Ecasound Wave Files (EWF) - &#8217;*.ewf&#8217;
              A  special  file format that allows one to slice and loop full (or
              segments) of audio files. This format  is  specific  to  Ecasound.
              See ecasound user&#8217;s guide for more detailed information.

              See also audio object types &#8217;audioloop&#8217;, &#8217;select&#8217; and &#8217;playat&#8217;.

       JACK input/outputs - Overview
              JACK  is  a  low-latency  audio server that can be used to connect
              multiple independent audio application to each other.  It is  dif&#8208;
              ferent  from  other  audio  server  efforts  in  that  it has been
              designed from the ground up to be suitable for low-latency profes&#8208;
              sional audio work.

       JACK input/outputs - &#8217;jack&#8217;
              Ecasound  provides multiple ways to communicate with JACK servers.
              To create a JACK input or output object, one should  use  -i  jack
              and  -o  jack.  These create JACK client ports &quot;ecasound:in_N&quot; and
              &quot;ecasound:out_n&quot; respectively (&#8217;N&#8217; is replaced by the channel num&#8208;
              ber).  Ecasound automatically creates one JACK port for each chan&#8208;
              nel (number of channels is set with -f:bits,channels,rate option).

              It is important to note that by default JACK ports  are  not  con&#8208;
              nected  anywhere  (e.g.  to  soundcard  input/outputs, or to other
              apps). One thus has to connect the ports with an external  program
              (e.g. &quot;QJackCtl&quot; or &quot;jack_connect&quot;).

       JACK input/outputs - &#8217;jack,clientname,portprefix&#8217;
              &quot;jack,clientname&quot;  For  simple  use scanerios, ecasound provides a
              way to autoconnect the ecasound ports. This can be  done  with  by
              giving  the peer client name as the second parameter to the &quot;jack&quot;
              object, e.g. -o jack,clientname.  As an  example,  -o  jack,system
              will  create  an output that is automatically connected to outputs
              of the default system soundcard.   The  client  parameter  can  be
              omitted, in which case no automatic connections are made.

              If  one  needs to change the port prefix (e.g. &quot;in&quot; in client name
              &quot;ecasound:in_N&quot;), the prefix can be specified as the third parame&#8208;
              ter  to &quot;jack&quot; object, e.g. -o jack,,fxout. Also the third parame&#8208;
              ter can be omitted, in which case the default  prefixes  &quot;in&quot;  and
              &quot;out&quot; are used.

       JACK input/outputs - &#8217;jack_multi&#8217;
              A  variant  of &#8217;jack&#8217; object type is &#8217;jack_multi&#8217;. The full object
              syntax is jack_multi,destport1,...,destportN. When a  &#8217;jack_multi&#8217;
              object  is connected to a JACK server, first channel of the object
              is connected to JACK port &#8217;destport1&#8217;, second to  &#8217;destport2&#8217;  and
              so forth. For instance &quot;-f:32,2,44100 -o jack_multi,foo:in,bar:in&quot;
              creates a stereo ecasound output object, with its left  and  right
              channels  routed  to  two difference JACK clients. The destination
              ports must be active when the ecasound engine is launched, or oth&#8208;
              erwise the connections cannot be established. If destination ports
              are not specified for all channels, or  zero  length  strings  are
              given, those ports are not connected at launch by ecasound.

       JACK  input/outputs  - &#8217;jack_alsa&#8217;, &#8217;jack_auto&#8217;, &#8217;jack_generic&#8217; (**depre&#8208;
       cated since 2.6.0**)
              Ecasound 2.5 and  older  supported  &quot;jack_alsa&quot;,  &quot;jack_auto&quot;  and
              &quot;jack_generic&quot;  object types, but these are now replaced by a more
              generic &quot;jack&quot; interface, and thus are now deprecated  (they  work
              but are no longer documented).

       JACK input/outputs - client options
              Additionally    global    JACK    options   can   be   set   using
              -G:jack,client_name,operation_mode option.  &#8217;client_name&#8217;  is  the
              name used when registering ecasound to the JACK system.  If &#8217;oper&#8208;
              ation_mode&#8217; is &quot;notransport&quot;,  ecasound will ignore any  transport
              state  changes in the JACK-system; in mode &quot;send&quot; it will send all
              start, stop and position-change events to other JACK  clients;  in
              mode  &quot;recv&quot;  ecasound  will  follow  JACK  start,  stop and posi&#8208;
              tion-change events; and mode &quot;sendrecv&quot; which is a combination  of
              the two previous modes.

              If  not  explicitly  set,  in  interactive mode (&#8217;-c&#8217; option), the
              default  mode  is  &quot;sendrecv&quot;,  while  in  batchmode  default   is
              &quot;notransport&quot;.  In  both  cases  the  mode  can be changed with -G
              option as described above.

              More details about ecasound&#8217;s JACK support can be found from  Eca&#8208;
              sound User&#8217;s Guide.

       Libaudiofile - &#8217;audiofile&#8217;
              If  libaudiofile  support was enabled at compile-time, this option
              allows you to force Ecasound to use libaudiofile for reading/writ&#8208;
              ing a certain audio file. Option syntax is -i:audiofile,foobar.ext
              (same for -o).

       Libsndfile - &#8217;sndfile&#8217;
              If libsndfile support was enabled  at  compile-time,  this  option
              allows you to force Ecasound to use libsndfile for reading/writing
              a  certain  audio   file.   Option   syntax   is   -i:sndfile,foo&#8208;
              bar.ext[,.format-ext] (same for -o).  The optional third parameter
              &quot;format&quot; can be used to override the audio format (for example you
              can create an AIFF file with filename &quot;foo.wav&quot;).

       Loop device - &#8217;loop&#8217;
              Loop  devices  make  it possible to route (loop back) data between
              chains. Option syntax is -[io][:]loop,tag. If you add a loop  out&#8208;
              put with tag &#8217;1&#8217;, all data written to this output is routed to any
              loop input with tag &#8217;1&#8217;. The tag can  be  either  numerical  (e.g.
              &#8217;-i:loop,1&#8217;)  or a string (e.g. &quot;-i:loop,vocals&quot;). Like with other
              input/output objects, you can attach the same loop device to  mul&#8208;
              tiple chains and this way split/mix the signal.

              Note:  this  &#8217;loop&#8217;  device  is different from &#8217;audioloop&#8217; (latter
              added to ecasound v2.5.0).

       Mikmod - &#8217;mikmod&#8217;
              If mikmod support was enabled at compile-time, this option  allows
              you  to force Ecasound to use Mikmod for reading/writing a certain
              module file. Option syntax is -i:mikmod,foobar.ext.

       Null inputs/outputs - &#8217;null&#8217;
              If you specify &quot;null&quot; or &quot;/dev/null&quot; as the  input  or  output,  a
              null  audio  device is created. This is useful if you just want to
              analyze sample data without writing it to a file. There&#8217;s  also  a
              realtime   variant,  &quot;rtnull&quot;,  which  behaves  just  like  &quot;null&quot;
              objects, except all i/o is done at realtime speed.

       Resample - &#8217;resample&#8217;
              Object type &#8217;resample&#8217; can be  used  to  resample  audio  object&#8217;s
              audio  data  to  match the sampling rate used in the active chain&#8208;
              setup.   For   example,   ecasound   -f:16,2,44100    -i    resam&#8208;
              ple,22050,foo.wav -o /dev/dsp, will resample file from 22.05kHz to
              44.1kHz and write the result to the soundcard device.  Child  sam&#8208;
              pling  rate can be replaced with keyword &#8217;auto&#8217;. In this case eca&#8208;
              sound will try to query the child object for  its  sampling  rate.
              This works with files formats such as .wav which store meta infor&#8208;
              mation about the audio file format. To use &#8217;auto&#8217; in the  previous
              example,   ecasound   -f:16,2,44100  -i  resample,auto,foo.wav  -o
              /dev/dsp.

              Parameters 4...N are passed as is to the child object  (i.e.   &quot;-i
              resample,22050,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters &quot;bar1,bar2&quot;
              to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.

              If ecasound was compiled with support for libsamplerate,  you  can
              use  &#8217;resample-hq&#8217; to use the highest quality resampling algorithm
              available. To  force  ecasound  to  use  the  internal  resampler,
              &#8217;resampler-lq&#8217; (low-quality) can be used.

       Reverse - &#8217;reverse&#8217;
              Object  type  &#8217;reverse&#8217;  can  be used to reverse audio data coming
              from an audio object. As an example, ecasound  -i  reverse,foo.wav
              -o  /dev/dsp  will  play  &#8217;foo.wav&#8217;  backwards.  Reversing  output
              objects is not supported. Note! Trying  to  reverse  audio  object
              types  with really slow seek operation (like mp3), works extremely
              badly.  Try converting to an  uncompressed  format  (wav  or  raw)
              first, and then do reversation.

              Parameters  3...N  are passed as is to the child object (i.e.  &quot;-i
              reverse,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters &quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the
              &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.

       System standard streams and named pipes - &#8217;stdin&#8217;, &#8217;stdout&#8217;
              You can use standard streams (stdin and stdout) by giving stdin or
              stdout as the file name. Audio data is assumed to be in  raw/head&#8208;
              erless  (.raw) format. If you want to use named pipes, create them
              with the proper file name extension before use.

       Tone generator - &#8217;tone&#8217;
              To generate a test tone, input -i:tone,type,freq,duration-secs can
              be  used. Parameter &#8217;type&#8217; specifies the tone type: currently only
              &#8217;sine&#8217; is supported. The &#8217;freq&#8217; parameter sets  the  frequency  of
              the generated tone and &#8217;duration-secs&#8217; the length of the generated
              stream. Specifying zero, or a negative value, as the duration will
              produce  an  infinite stream. This feature was first added to Eca&#8208;
              sound 2.4.7.

       Typeselect - &#8217;typeselect&#8217;
              The special &#8217;typeselect&#8217; object type can be used to  override  how
              ecasound  maps  filename extensions and object types. For instance
              ecasound -i typeselect,.mp3,an_mp3_file.wav  -o  /dev/dsp.   would
              play  the  file  &#8217;an_mp3_file.wav&#8217;  as  an  mp3-file and not as an
              wav-file as would happen without typeselect.

              Parameters 4...N are passed as is to the child object  (i.e.   &quot;-i
              typeselect,.au,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters &quot;bar1,bar2&quot;
              to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.

              MIDI SETUP

       MIDI I/O devices - general
              If no MIDI-device is specified, the default  MIDI-device  is  used
              (see ecasoundrc(5)).

       -Md:rawmidi,device_name
              Add  a  rawmidi MIDI I/O device to the setup. &#8217;device_name&#8217; can be
              anything that can be accessed using the normal  UNIX  file  opera&#8208;
              tions  and  produces raw MIDI bytes. Valid devices are for example
              OSS  rawmidi   devices   (/dev/midi00),   ALSA   rawmidi   devices
              (/dev/snd/midiC2D0), named pipes (see mkfifo man page), and normal
              files.

       -Md:alsaseq,sequencer-port
              Adds a ALSA MIDI sequencer port  to  the  setup.  &#8217;sequencer-port&#8217;
              identifies a port to connect to. It can be numerical (e.g. 128:1),
              or a client name (e.g. &quot;KMidimon&quot;).

       -Mms:device_id
              Sends MMC start (&quot;Deferred Play&quot;) and stop (&quot;Stop&quot;) with device ID
              &#8217;device_id&#8217;.

              While  Ecasound  does not directly support syncing transport state
              to incoming MMC messages, this can be achieved by connecting  Eca&#8208;
              sound  to JACK input/outputs, and using a tool such as JackMMC and
              JackCtlMMC ( see &lt;http://jackctlmmc.sourceforge.net/&gt;) to  convert
              MMC messages into JACK transport change events.

       -Mss   Sends MIDI-sync (i.e. &quot;MIDI Start&quot; and &quot;MIDI Stop&quot; system realtime
              messages) .to the selected MIDI-device. Notice  that  as  Ecasound
              will not send MIDI-clock, but only the start and stop messages.

              EFFECT SETUP

       PRESETS

       Ecasound  has  a powerful effect preset system that allows you create new
       effects by combining basic effects and controllers. See  ecasound  user&#8217;s
       guide for more detailed information.

       -pf:preset_file.eep
              Uses the first preset found from file &#8217;preset_file.eep&#8217; as a chain
              operator.

       -pn:preset_name
              Find preset &#8217;preset_name&#8217; from global preset database and  use  it
              as  a  chain  operator. See ecasoundrc man page for info about the
              preset database.

              SIGNAL ANALYSIS

       -ev    Analyzes sample data to find out how much the signal can be ampli&#8208;
              fied  without clipping. The resulting percent value can be used as
              a parameter to &#8217;-ea&#8217; (amplify). A statistical summary,  containing
              info  about the stereo-image and distribution of sample values, is
              printed out at the end of processing.

       -evp   Peak amplitude watcher. Maintains peak information for  each  pro&#8208;
              cessed channels. Peak information is resetted on every read.

       -ezf   Finds  the  optimal value for DC-adjusting. You can use the result
              as a parameter to -ezx effect.

              GENERAL SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS

       -eS:stamp-id
              Audio stamp. Takes a snapshot of passing audio data and stores  it
              using  id &#8217;stamp-id&#8217; (integer number). This data can later be used
              by controllers and other operators.

       -ea:amplify%
              Adjusts the signal amplitude to &#8217;amplify%&#8217; percent (linear  scale,
              i.e.   individual  samples  are multiplied by &#8217;amplify%/100&#8217;). See
              also &#8217;-eadb&#8217;.

       -eac:amplify%,channel
              Amplifies signal of channel &#8217;channel&#8217; by amplify-% percent (linear
              scale,  i.e. individual samples are multiplied by &#8217;amplify%/100&#8217;).
              &#8217;channel&#8217; ranges from 1...n where n is the total number  of  chan&#8208;
              nels.  See also &#8217;-eadb&#8217;.

       -eadb:gain-dB[,channel]
              Adjusts  signal  level  by &#8217;gain-dB&#8217;, with a gain of 0dB having no
              effect to the signal, negative gains attenuating  the  signal  and
              positive  gain  values  amplifying  it.  The  &#8217;channel&#8217;  parameter
              (1...n) is optional.  If &#8217;channel&#8217; parameter is specified, and its
              value  is  nonzero,  gain  is  only  applied  to the given channel
              (1...n).

       -eaw:amplify%,max-clipped-samples
              Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent (linear scale, i.e. individ&#8208;
              ual  samples  are multiplied by &#8217;amplify%/100&#8217;). If number of con&#8208;
              secutive clipped samples (resulting sample value  is  outside  the
              nominal [-1,1] range), a warning will be issued.

       -eal:limit-%
              Limiter  effect.  Limits  audio  level to &#8217;limit-%&#8217; (linear scale)
              with values equal or greater than 100% resulting in no  change  to
              the signal.

       -ec:rate,threshold-%
              Compressor (a simple one). &#8217;rate&#8217; is the compression rate in deci&#8208;
              bels (&#8217;rate&#8217; dB change in input signal causes 1dB change  in  out&#8208;
              put). &#8217;threshold&#8217; varies between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (max ampli&#8208;
              tude).

       -eca:peak-level-%, release-time-sec, fast-crate, crate
              A more advanced compressor (original algorithm by John S.  Dyson).
              If  you  give  a value of 0 to any parameter, the default is used.
              &#8217;peak-level-%&#8217; essentially specifies how hard the peak limiter  is
              pushed.   The  default  of 69% is good. &#8217;release_time&#8217; is given in
              seconds. This compressor is very sophisticated, and  actually  the
              release time is complex.  This is one of the dominant release time
              controls, but the actual release time is dependent  on  a  lot  of
              factors  regarding the dynamics of the audio in. &#8217;fastrate&#8217; is the
              compression ratio for the fast compressor.  This is not really the
              compression  ratio.   Value  of  1.0 is infinity to one, while the
              default 0.50 is 2:1.  Another really good value is  special  cased
              in  the  code:  0.25  is  somewhat less than 2:1, and sounds super
              smooth.  &#8217;rate&#8217; is the compression ratio for the entire compressor
              chain.   The  default  is  1.0, and holds the volume very constant
              without many nasty side effects.  However the  dynamics  in  music
              are  severely  restricted, and a value of 0.5 might keep the music
              more intact.

       -enm:thresh&#8208;
       old-level-%,pre-hold-time-msec,attack-time-msec,post-hold-time-msec,release-time-msec
              Noise gate. Supports multichannel processing  (each  channel  pro&#8208;
              cessed  separately).  When  signal  amplitude falls below &#8217;thresh&#8208;
              old_level_%&#8217; percent (100% means maximum amplitude), gate is acti&#8208;
              vated.  If  the signal stays below the threshold for &#8217;th_time&#8217; ms,
              it&#8217;s faded out during the attack phase of &#8217;attack&#8217; ms. If the sig&#8208;
              nal raises above the &#8217;threshold_level&#8217; and stays there over &#8217;hold&#8217;
              ms the gate is released during &#8217;release&#8217; ms.

       -ei:pitch-shift-%
              Pitch shifter. Modifies audio pitch by altering its length.

       -epp:right-%
              Stereo panner. Changes the relative balance between the first  two
              channels. When &#8217;right-%&#8217; is 0, only signal on the left (1st) chan&#8208;
              nel is passed through. Similarly if it is &#8217;100&#8217;, only right  (2nd)
              channel is let through.
&#12;       -ezx:channel-count,delta-ch1,...,delta-chN
              Adjusts  the signal DC by &#8217;delta-chX&#8217;, where X is the channel num&#8208;
              ber. Use -ezf to find the optimal delta values.

              ENVELOPE MODULATION


       -eemb:bpm,on-time-%
              Pulse gate (pulse frequency given as beats-per-minute).

       -eemp:freq-Hz,on-time-%
              Pulse gate.

       -eemt:bpm,depth-%
              Tremolo effect (tremolo speed given as beats-per-minute).

              FILTER EFFECTS

       -ef1:center_freq, width
              Resonant bandpass filter. &#8217;center_freq&#8217; is the  center  frequency.
              Width is specified in Hz.

       -ef3:cutoff_freq, reso, gain
              Resonant  lowpass filter. &#8217;cutoffr_freq&#8217; is the filter cutoff fre&#8208;
              quency. &#8217;reso&#8217; means resonance. Usually the best values for  reso&#8208;
              nance are between 1.0 and 2.0, but you can use even bigger values.
              &#8217;gain&#8217; is the overall gain-factor. It&#8217;s a simple  multiplier  (1.0
              is  the normal level). With high resonance values it often is use&#8208;
              ful to reduce the gain value.

       -ef4:cutoff, resonance
              Resonant lowpass filter (3rd-order, 36dB,  original  algorithm  by
              Stefan  M.  Fendt).  Simulates an analog active RC-lowpass design.
              Cutoff is a  value  between  [0,1],  while  resonance  is  between
              [0,infinity).

       -efa:delay-samples,feedback-%
              Allpass  filter.  Passes  all frequencies with no change in ampli&#8208;
              tude.  However, at the same time it imposes a  frequency-dependent
              phase-shift.

       -efc:delay-samples,radius
              Comb filter. Allows the spikes of the comb to pass through.  Value
              of &#8217;radius&#8217; should be between [0, 1.0).

       -efb:center-freq,width
              Bandpass filter. &#8217;center_freq&#8217; is the center frequency.  Width  is
              specified in Hz.

       -efh:cutoff-freq
              Highpass  filter.  Only frequencies above &#8217;cutoff_freq&#8217; are passed
              through.

       -efi:delay-samples,radius
              Inverse comb filter. Filters out the spikes of the comb. There are
              &#8217;delay_in_samples-2&#8217;  spikes.  Value of &#8217;radius&#8217; should be between
              [0, 1.0). The closer it is to the maximum value,  the  deeper  the
              dips of the comb are.

       -efl:cutoff-freq
              Lowpass  filter.  Only  frequencies below &#8217;cutoff_freq&#8217; are passed
              through.

       -efr:center-freq,width
              Bandreject filter. &#8217;center_freq&#8217; is the center frequency. Width is
              specified in Hz.

       -efs:center-freq,width
              Resonator.  &#8217;center_freq&#8217; is the center frequency. Width is speci&#8208;
              fied in Hz. Basicly just another resonating bandpass filter.

              CHANNEL MIXING / ROUTING


       -chcopy:from-channel, to-channel
              Copy  channel  &#8217;from_channel&#8217;  to  &#8217;to_channel&#8217;.  If  &#8217;to_channel&#8217;
              doesn&#8217;t  exist,  it  is  created.  Channel indexing starts from 1.
              Option added to ecasound 2.4.5.

       -chmove:from-channel, to-channel
              Copy channel &#8217;from_channel&#8217; to &#8217;to_channel&#8217;, and mutes the  source
              channel  &#8217;from_channel&#8217;.  Channel  indexing starts from 1.  Option
              added to ecasound 2.4.5.

       -chorder:ch1,...,chN
              Reorder, omit and/r duplicate chain channels. The resulting  audio
              stream  has  total  of  &#8217;N&#8217; channels. Each parameter specifies the
              source channel to use for given output  channel.  As  an  example,
              &#8217;-chorder:2,1&#8217;  would  reverse  the  channels  of  a stereo stream
              (&#8217;out1,out2&#8217; = &#8217;in2,in1&#8217;). Specifying the same source channel mul&#8208;
              tiple  times  is  allowed. For example, &#8217;-chorder:2,2&#8217; would route
              the second channel to both  two  output  channels  (&#8217;out1,out2&#8217;  =
              &#8217;in2,in2&#8217;).  If &#8217;chX&#8217; is zero, the given channel &#8217;X&#8217; will be muted
              in the output stream. Option added to ecasound 2.7.0.

       -chmix:to-channel
              Mix all source channels to channel &#8217;to_channel&#8217;.  If  &#8217;to_channel&#8217;
              doesn&#8217;t  exist,  it  is  created.  Channel indexing starts from 1.
              Option added to ecasound 2.4.5.

       -chmute:channel
              Mutes the channel  &#8217;channel&#8217;.  Channel  indexing  starts  from  1.
              Option added to ecasound 2.4.5.

       -erc:from-channel,to-channel
              Deprecated, see -chcopy.

       -erm:to-channel
              Deprecated, see -chmix.

              TIME-BASED EFFECTS


       -etc:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq
              Chorus.

       -etd:delay-time-msec,surround-mode,number-of-delays,mix-%,feedback-%
              Delay  effect.  &#8217;delay  time&#8217;  is  the delay time in milliseconds.
              &#8217;surround-mode&#8217; is a integer with following meanings: 0 =  normal,
              1  =  surround,  2  =  stereo-spread. &#8217;number_of_delays&#8217; should be
              obvious. Beware that large number of delays and huge  delay  times
              need a lot of CPU power. &#8217;mix-%&#8217; expresses the mix balance between
              the original and delayed signal, with 0 meaning no delayed signal,
              100  meaning no original signal, and 50 (the default) achieving an
              equal balance.  &#8217;feedback-%&#8217; represents how much of the signal  is
              recycled  in  each  delay  or,  if  you  prefer,  at what rate the
              repeated snippet of delayed audio fades.  Note  that  sufficiently
              low  feedback values may result in a number of audible repetitions
              lesser than what you have specified for &#8217;number_of_delays&#8217;,  espe&#8208;
              cially  if  you  have  set a low value for &#8217;mix-%&#8217;. By default the
              value for this parameter is 100% (No signal loss.).

       -ete:room_size,feedback-%,wet-%
              A more advanced reverb effect (original  algorithm  by  Stefan  M.
              Fendt).  &#8217;room_size&#8217; is given in meters, &#8217;feedback-%&#8217; is the feed&#8208;
              back level given in percents and &#8217;wet-%&#8217; is the amount of reverbed
              signal added to the original signal.

       -etf:delay-time-msec
              Fake-stereo effect. The input signal is summed to mono. The origi&#8208;
              nal signal goes to the left channels while a delayed version (with
              delay  of  &#8217;delay time&#8217; milliseconds) is goes to the right. With a
              delay time  of  1-40  milliseconds  this  adds  a  stereo-feel  to
              mono-signals.

       -etl:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq
              Flanger.

       -etm:delay-time-msec,number-of-delays,mix-%
              Multitap  delay.  &#8217;delay  time&#8217; is the delay time in milliseconds.
              &#8217;number_of_delays&#8217; should be obvious. &#8217;mix-%&#8217; determines how  much
              effected (wet) signal is mixed to the original.

       -etp:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq
              Phaser.

       -etr:delay-time,surround-mode,feedback-%
              Reverb effect. &#8217;delay time&#8217; is the delay time in milliseconds.  If
              &#8217;surround-mode&#8217; is &#8217;surround&#8217;, reverbed signal  moves  around  the
              stereo image. &#8217;feedback-%&#8217; determines how much effected (wet) sig&#8208;
              nal is fed back to the reverb.

              LADSPA-PLUGINS

       -el:plugin_unique_name,param-1,...,param-N
              Ecasound supports LADSPA-effect plugins (Linux  Audio  Developer&#8217;s
              Simple Plugin API). Parameters 1..N are set as values of the plug&#8208;
              in&#8217;s control ports.

              If plugin has more than one audio input and/or output  port,  only
              one  plugin is instance is created, and the chain channels are fed
              to the same plugin instance. If plugin has at most one  input  and
              at  most one output audio port, a separate plugin instance is cre&#8208;
              ated for each channel of the ecasound chain  (e.g.  for  a  stereo
              audio  channel,  two LADSPA plugins of same type are created, with
              one per channel).

              Plugins are located in shared library (.so) files. Ecasound  looks
              for plugins in @prefix@/lib/ladspa (e.g. &quot;/usr/local/lib/ladspa&quot;),
              directories listed in  environment  variable  LADSPA_PATH.  Plugin
              search  path  can  be  configured  also  via  ecasoundrc, see eca&#8208;
              soundrc(5) man page. One shared library file can contain  multiple
              plugin  objects,  but  every plugin has a unique plugin name. This
              name is used for selecting plugins.

              See LAD mailing list web site for more info  about  LADSPA.  Other
              useful sites are LADSPA home page and LADSPA documentation.

       -eli:plugin_unique_number,param-1,...,param-N
              Same  as  above (-el) expect plugin&#8217;s unique id-number is used. It
              is guaranteed that these id-numbers are unique  among  all  LADSPA
              plugins.

              LV2 PLUGINS

       -elv2:plugin-id-uri,param-1,...,param-N
              Ecasound  also supports LV2 audio plugins. LV2 plugins are identi&#8208;
              fied by a globally unique, case-sensitive identifier.

              If plugin has more than one audio input and/or output  port,  only
              one  plugin is instance is created, and the chain channels are fed
              to the same plugin instance. If plugin has at most one  input  and
              at  most one output audio port, a separate plugin instance is cre&#8208;
              ated for each channel of the ecasound chain  (e.g.  for  a  stereo
              audio  channel, two LV2 plugins of same type are created, with one
              per channel).

              LV2 is a plugin standard for audio systems.


       GATE SETUP
&#12;       -gc:start-time,len
              Time crop gate. Initially gate is closed. After &#8217;start-time&#8217;  sec&#8208;
              onds  has  elapsed, gate opens and remains open for &#8217;len&#8217; seconds.
              When closed, passing audio buffers are trucated to zero length.

       -ge:open-threshold-%,close-thold-%,volume-mode,reopen-count
              Threshold gate. Initially gate is closed. It is opened when volume
              goes  over &#8217;othreshold&#8217; percent. After this, if volume drops below
              &#8217;cthold&#8217; percent, gate is closed and won&#8217;t be opened again, unless
              the  &#8217;reopen-count&#8217;  is  set  to  anything  other  than  zero.  If
              &#8217;value_mode&#8217; is &#8217;rms&#8217;, average RMS volume is used. Otherwise  peak
              average  is used.  When closed, passing audio buffers are trucated
              to zero length.  If the &#8217;reopen-count&#8217; is set to a  positive  num&#8208;
              ber,  then the gate will restart its operation that many times. So
              for example, a reopen count of 1 will cause up to  2  openings  of
              the  gate.  A negative value for &#8217;reopen-count&#8217; will result in the
              gate reopening indefinitely. The &#8217;reopen-count&#8217; is  invaluable  in
              recording  vinyl  and  tapes, where you can set things up and then
              recording starts whenever the needle is on the  vinyl,  and  stops
              when  it&#8217;s  off.  As many sides as you like can be recorded in one
              session.  You will need to  experiment  with  buffer  lengths  and
              start/stop levels to get reliable settings for your equipment.

       -gm:state
              Manual  gate.  If  &#8217;state&#8217;  is 1, gate is open and all samples are
              passed through. If &#8217;state&#8217; is zero, gate is closed an  no  samples
              are  let through. This chain operator is useful when writing to an
              output needs to be stopped dynamically (without stopping the whole
              engine).

              CONTROL ENVELOPE SETUP


              Controllers  can  be  used to dynamically change effect parameters
              during processing. All controllers are attached  to  the  selected
              (=usually  the last specified effect/controller) effect. The first
              three parameters are common for all controllers. &#8217;fx_param&#8217; speci&#8208;
              fies  the  parameter  to  be controlled. Value &#8217;1&#8217; means the first
              parameter, &#8217;2&#8217; the second and so on. &#8217;start_value&#8217; and &#8217;end_value&#8217;
              set  the  value range. For examples, look at the the EXAMPLES sec&#8208;
              tion.

       -kos:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,i-phase
              Sine oscillator with frequency of &#8217;freq&#8217; Hz and initial  phase  of
              &#8217;i_phase&#8217; times pi.

       -kog:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,mode,point-pairs,first-value,last-value,pos1,value1,...
              Generic oscillator. Frequency  &#8217;freq&#8217;  Hz,  mode  either  &#8217;0&#8217;  for
              static values or &#8217;1&#8217; for linear interpolation. &#8217;point-pairs&#8217; spec&#8208;
              ifies  the  number  of  &#8217;posN&#8217;  -  &#8217;valueN&#8217;  pairs   to   include.
              &#8217;first-value&#8217;  and  &#8217;last-value&#8217; are used as border values (values
              for position 0.0/first and position  1.0/last).   All  &#8217;posN&#8217;  and
              &#8217;valueN&#8217;  must be between 0.0 and 1.0. Also, for all &#8217;posN&#8217; values
              &#8217;pos1 &lt; pos2 &lt; ... &lt; posN&#8217; must be true.

       -kf:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,mode,genosc-number
              Generic oscillator. &#8217;genosc_number&#8217; is the number of the  oscilla&#8208;
              tor  preset  to be loaded. Mode is either &#8217;0&#8217; for static values or
              &#8217;1&#8217; for linear interpolation. The location for the preset file  is
              taken from ./ecasoundrc (see ecasoundrc man page).

       -kl:fx-param,start-value,end-value,time-seconds
              Linear  envelope  that  starts  from  &#8217;start_value&#8217;  and  linearly
              changes to &#8217;end_value&#8217; during &#8217;time_in_seconds&#8217;. Can be  used  for
              fadeins and fadeouts.

       -kl2:fx-param,start-value,end-value,1st-stage-length-sec,2nd-stage-length-sec
              Two-stage  linear  envelope,  a  more  versatile  tool  for  doing
              fade-ins    and    fade-outs.    Stays    at   &#8217;start_value&#8217;   for
              &#8217;1st_stage_length&#8217;  seconds  and  then  linearly  changes  towards
              &#8217;end_value&#8217; during &#8217;2nd_stage_length&#8217; seconds.

       -klg:fx-param,low-value,high-value,point_count,pos1,value1,...,posN,val&#8208;
       ueN
              Generic linear envelope. This controller source can be used to map
              custom  envelopes to chain operator parameters. Number of envelope
              points is specified in &#8217;point_count&#8217;. Each envelope point consists
              of  a  position  and  a matching value. Number of pairs must match
              &#8217;point_count&#8217; (i.e. &#8217;N==point_count&#8217;). The &#8217;posX&#8217;  parameters  are
              given  as  seconds (from start of the stream). The envelope points
              are specified as float values in range  &#8217;[0,1]&#8217;.  Before  envelope
              values  are  mapped to operator parameters, they are mapped to the
              target range of &#8217;[low-value,high-value]&#8217;. E.g.   a  value  of  &#8217;0&#8217;
              will set operator parameter to &#8217;low-value&#8217; and a value of &#8217;1&#8217; will
              set it to &#8217;high-value&#8217;. For the initial  segment  &#8217;[0,pos1]&#8217;,  the
              envelope will output value of &#8217;value1&#8217; (e.g. &#8217;low-value&#8217;).

       -km:fx-param,start-value,end-value,controller,channel
              MIDI continuous controller (control change messages).  Messages on
              the MIDI-channel &#8217;channel&#8217; that are coming from controller  number
              &#8217;controller&#8217;  are used as the controller source. As recommended by
              the MIDI-specification, channel numbering goes from 1 to 16.  Pos&#8208;
              sible controller numbers are values from 0 to 127. The MIDI-device
              where bytes are read from can be specified using -Md option.  Oth&#8208;
              erwise  the  default  MIDI-device  is  used  as specified in ~eca&#8208;
              sound/ecasoundrc  (see  ecasoundrc   man   page).    Defaults   to
              /dev/midi.

       -ksv:fx-param,start-value,end-value,stamp-id,rms-toggle
              Volume  analyze  controller.  Analyzes  the  audio stored in stamp
              &#8217;stamp-id&#8217; (see &#8217;-eS:id&#8217; docs), and creates control data based  on
              the  results.  If  &#8217;rms-toggle&#8217; is non-zero, RMS-volume is used to
              calculate the control value. Otherwise average  peak-amplitude  is
              used.

       -kx    This is a special switch that can be used when you need to control
              controller parameters with another controller.  When  you  specify
              -kx, the last specified controller will be set as the control tar&#8208;
              get. Then you just add another controller as usual.


       INTERACTIVE MODE

       See ecasound-iam(1) man page.

ENVIRONMENT
       ECASOUND
              If defined, some utility programs and scripts will  use  the  ECA&#8208;
              SOUND environment as the default path to ecasound executable.

       ECASOUND_LOGFILE
              Output  all debugging messages to a separate log file. If defined,
              ECASOUND_LOGFILE defines the logfile path. This is a good tool for
              debugging ECI/EIAM scripts and applications.

       ECASOUND_LOGLEVEL
              Select  which  messages are written to the logfile defined by ECA&#8208;
              SOUND_LOGFILE. The syntax for -d:level is used.  If  not  defined,
              all  messages are written. Defaults to -d:319 (everything else but
              &#8217;functions (64)&#8217; and &#8217;continuous (128)&#8217; class messages).

       COLUMNS
              Ecasound honors the COLUMNS environment variable  when  formatting
              printed  trace messages. If COLUMNS is not set, a default of 74 is
              used.

       TMPDIR Some functions of Ecasound (e.g.  &quot;cs-edit&quot;  interactive  command)
              require  creation  of temporary files. By default, these files are
              created under &quot;/tmp&quot;, but this can be overridden  by  setting  the
              TMPDIR environment variable.
&#12;RETURN VALUES
              In interactive mode, ecasound always returns zero.

              In  non-interactive (batch) mode, a non-zero value is returned for
              the following errors:

       1      Unable to create a valid chainsetup with the given parameters. Can
              be caused by invalid option syntax, etc.

       2      Unable  to  start  processing.  This can be caused by insufficient
              file permissions, inability to access some system resources, etc.

       3      Error during processing. Possible causes: output  object  has  run
              out of free disk space, etc.

       4      Error  during  process  termination and/or cleanup. See section on
              &#8217;SIGNALS&#8217; for further details.

SIGNALS
       When ecasound receives any of the POSIX signals SIGINT (ctrl-c),  SIGHUP,
       SIGTERM  or SIGQUIT, normal cleanup and exit procedure is initiated. Here
       normal exit means that e.g. file  headers  are  updated  before  closing,
       helper processes are terminated in normal way, and so forth.

       If,  while  doing  the cleanup described above, ecasound receives another
       signal (of the same set of POSIX signals), ecasound will skip the  normal
       cleanup procedure, and terminate immediately. Any remaining cleanup tasks
       will be skipped.  Depending on the runtime state and configuration,  this
       brute  force  exit  may have some side-effects. Ecasound will return exit
       code of &#8217;4&#8217; if normal cleanup was skipped.

       Special case handling is applied to the SIGINT  (ctrl-c)  signal.   If  a
       SIGINT  signal  is  received  during the cleanup procedure, ecasound will
       ignore the signal once, and emit a notice to  &#8217;stderr&#8217;  that  cleanup  is
       already  in  progress.  Any  subsequent SIGINT signals will no longer get
       special handling, and instead process  will  terminate  immediately  (and
       possibly without proper cleanup).

FILES
       ~/.ecasound  The default directory for ecasound user resource files.  See
       the ecasoundrc (5) man page man page.

       *.ecs Ecasound Chainsetup files. Syntax is more or less the same as  with
       command-line arguments.

       *.ecp  Ecasound  Chain  Preset  files.  Used for storing effect and chain
       operator presets. See ecasound user&#8217;s guide for  more  better  documenta&#8208;
       tion.

       *.ews Ecasound Wave Stats. These files are used to cache waveform data.
