ecasoundrc(5)                  Multimedia software                 ecasoundrc(5)



NAME
       ecasoundrc - ecasound rcfile

SYNOPSIS
       {prefix}/share/ecasound/ecasoundrc  (for  instance &#8217;/usr/local/share/eca&#8208;
       sound/ecasoundrc&#8217;) $HOME/.ecasound/ecasoundrc

DESCRIPTION
       ecasoundrc is the main configuration file for  ecasound.   Any  user-spe&#8208;
       cific  modification  should be done to $HOME/.ecasound/ecasoundrc, not to
       the global resource file. Ecasound also allows one to disable the  normal
       policy  and only read from a specific resource file (see ecasound (1) and
       documentation for the -R option).

       The format is quite simple. One line consists of a configuration variable
       and  its  value. Variable and value are separated with either &#8217;=&#8217; or &#8217; &#8217;.
       Lines beginning with a &quot;#&quot; are ignored (comment lines).

VARIABLES
       midi-device
              MIDI-device. If the device name  is  given  in  rawmidi,/dev/midi*
              format,   OSS/Linux   or   OSS/Lite   drivers  are  used.   Device
              rawmidi,/dev/snd/midiCxDy opens an ALSA raw-MIDI device with  card
              number  &#8217;x&#8217; and device number &#8217;y&#8217;.  See ecasound (1) man page (the
              &#8217;-Md option) for more info.  Defaults to rawmidi,/dev/midi.

       default-output
              Output device to use by default. If a chainsetup  with  zero  out&#8208;
              puts,  but with one or more inputs, is connected, a default output
              is added and all the chains are  connected  to  it.  If  the  spe&#8208;
              cial-case  value  &#8217;autodetect&#8217;  is specified, ecasound will try to
              auto-detect a suitable device (JACK -&gt; ALSA  -&gt;  OSS  -&gt;  rtnull).
              Defaults to autodetect.

       default-audio-format
              Default values for sample format, channel count, sampling rate and
              channel interleaving. Syntax is the same as used by ecasound&#8217;s  -f
              option (see ecasound (1)).  Defaults to s16_le,2,44100,i.

       default-to-precise-sample-rates
              Whether  to  ignore  sample  rate  differences (and possibly avoid
              resampling).  Currently  only  affects  OSS-devices.  Defaults  to
              false.

       default-mix-mode
              If default-mix-mode is sum, engine will mix multiple channels into
              one output channel by summing all input  channels.  In  mode  avg,
              mixing  is  done  by taking the average of all input channels. The
              avg mode is safe from clipping, while sum is  closer  to  the  way
              analog mixers work. Defaults to avg.

       bmode-defaults-nonrt
              Selects  the default parameters to use with buffering mode &#8217;nonrt&#8217;
              (other modes are &#8217;rt&#8217; and &#8217;rtlowlatency).  Parameters are given as
              a  comma-separated  tuple of values: 1) buffersize (number,-b), 2)
              raised priority (true/false,-r), 3) sched_priority  (number,-r:X),
              4)   double  buffering  (true/false,-z:db),  5)  db-bufsize  (num&#8208;
              ber,-z:db,X), and 6) max intbuf  (true/false,-z:intbuf).  Defaults
              to 1024,false,50,false,100000,true.

       bmode-defaults-rt
              See          &#8217;bmode-defaults-nonrt&#8217;.          Defaults          to
              1024,true,50,true,100000,true.

       bmode-defaults-rtlowlatency
              See          &#8217;bmode-defaults-nonrt&#8217;.          Defaults          to
              256,true,50,true,100000,false.

       resource-directory
              Directory  for  global  ecasound configuration files.  Defaults to
              {prefix-dir}/share/ecasound.  Note! User-specific  resource  files
              can be be stored to &#8217;$(HOME)/.ecasound/&#8217;. For instance you can add
              your own  presets  definitions  to  &#8217;$(HOME)/.ecasound/effect_pre&#8208;
              sets&#8217;.

       resource-file-genosc-envelopes
              Configuration  file  for  generic  oscillators.  Is located in the
              resource directory. Defaults to generic_oscillators.

       resource-file-effect-presets
              Configuration file for effect presets. Is located in the  resource
              directory. Defaults to effect_presets.

       ladspa-plugin-directory
              Directory  containing  LADSPA  effect  plugins.  Defaults to {pre&#8208;
              fix-dir}/lib/ladspa.  If environment variable LADSPA_PATH  exists,
              directories  specified  in it are automatically searched for plug&#8208;
              ins.  Note! To match the syntax  of  the  LADSPA_PATH  environment
              variable,  &#8217;ladspa-plugin-directory&#8217; can contain multiple directo&#8208;
              ries, separated by &#8217;:&#8217; characters.

       ext-cmd-text-editor
              If ext-cmd-text-editor-use-getenv is false or  &quot;EDITOR&quot;  is  null,
              value of this field is used.

       ext-cmd-text-editor-use-getenv
              Should  ecasound  try  to  query  environment  variable  &quot;EDITOR&quot;.
              Defaults to true.

       ext-cmd-mp3-input
              Command for starting mp3 input. Ecasound expects to  read  signed,
              16bit, little-endian stereo audio samples from its standard input.
              Ecsound will query other audio format parameters  by  parsing  the
              mp3 file header. Before execution, %f is replaced with path to the
              input mp3. If exists, &quot;%o&quot; is replaced with he start offset in mp3
              frames.  Double-quotes  and  backslash-espacing  can  be  used  to
              include white-space to individual parameters.  By default,  mpg123
              is launched.

       ext-cmd-mp3-output
              Command  for  starting  mp3  output.  Ecasound  will write stereo,
              signed, 16bit, little-endian samples to  standard  output.  Sample
              rate  is  configurable. Before execution, %f is replaced with path
              to the output mp3, %S with sample rate in kHz, and %B with  encod&#8208;
              ing  bitrate  in kbps. Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be
              used to include white-space to individual parameters.  By  default
              Ecasound will try to launch lame. As a special exception (added to
              Ecasound 2.7.0), if the  output  program  is  &quot;lame&quot;  and  options
              include  &quot;--big-endian&quot;,  Ecasound  will  detect  this  and output
              big-endian samples.

       ext-cmd-ogg-input
              Command for starting Ogg Vorbis input. Ecasound expects that audio
              samples  are  written  to standard output. It should be noted that
              Ecasound is not able to query the audio format parameters from ogg
              files,  so these need to be set manually by the user.  Before exe&#8208;
              cution, %f is replaced with path to the input ogg.   Double-quotes
              and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to indi&#8208;
              vidual  parameters.  By  default  Ecasound  will  try  to   launch
              (ogg123).

       ext-cmd-ogg-output
              Command  for  starting Ogg Vorbis output. Ecasound will write sam&#8208;
              ples in little-endian  format  to  standard  output.  Other  audio
              parameters are configurable. Before execution, %f is replaced with
              path to the output ogg, %c, %s and %b with matching  audio  format
              parameters,  and  %B with encoding bitrate in kbps.  Double-quotes
              and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to indi&#8208;
              vidual   parameters.  By  default  Ecasound  will  try  to  launch
              (oggenc).

       ext-cmd-mikmod
              Command for starting mikmod input. Ecasound expects  that  signed,
              16bit, stereo audio samples are written to standard output. Before
              execution, %f is replaced with file path,  and  %s  with  selected
              sample  rate.  Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be used to
              include white-space to individual parameters. By default  Ecasound
              will try to launch mikmod.

       ext-cmd-timidity
              Command  for  starting  timidity++  input.  Ecasound  expects that
              signed, 16bit, stereo audio samples are written to  standard  out&#8208;
              put.  Before execution, %f is replaced with file path, and %s with
              sample rate. Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be  used  to
              include white-space to individual parameters.  By default Ecasound
              will try to launch timidity.

       ext-cmd-flac-input
              Command for starting FLAC input. Ecasound expects that audio  sam&#8208;
              ples  are written to standard output. It should be noted that Eca&#8208;
              sound is not able to query the audio format parameters  from  FLAC
              files,  so these need to be set manually by the user.  Before exe&#8208;
              cution, %f is replaced with path to  the  input  FLAC  file.  Dou&#8208;
              ble-quotes   and   backslash-espacing   can  be  used  to  include
              white-space to individual parameters. By default Ecasound will try
              to launch (flac).

       ext-cmd-flac-output
              Command  for  starting FLAC output. Ecasound will write samples to
              standard output. All audio  parameters  are  configurable.  Before
              execution, %f is replaced with path to the output flac, %c, %b and
              %s with matching audio format parameters, %I with either  &#8217;signed&#8217;
              or &#8217;unsigned&#8217;, and %E with either &#8217;little&#8217; or &#8217;big&#8217;. Double-quotes
              and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to indi&#8208;
              vidual parameters. By default Ecasound will try to launch (flac).

       ext-cmd-aac-input
              Command  for  starting  AAC  input.  Ecasound expects that signed,
              16bit, stereo, big-endian audio  samplesare  written  to  standard
              output.  It should be noted that Ecasound is not able to query the
              input sample rate, so this needs to be set manually by  the  user.
              Before  execution, %f is replaced with path to the input AAC file.
              Note! FAAC must be compiled with MP4  support.  Double-quotes  and
              backslash-espacing  can be used to include white-space to individ&#8208;
              ual parameters. By default Ecasound will try to laucnh faad.

       ext-cmd-aac-output
              Command for starting AAC output. Ecasound  will  write  big-endian
              audio  samples  to standard output. All other audio parameters are
              configurable. Before execution, %f is replaced with  path  to  the
              output  AAC file, %c, %b and %s with matching audio format parame&#8208;
              ters. Note! FAAC must be compiled with MP4 support.  Double-quotes
              and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to indi&#8208;
              vidual parameters. By default Ecasound will try to launch faac.
