NAME
       ecryptfs-setup-swap - ensure that any swap space is encrypted


SYNOPSIS
       ecryptfs-setup-swap [-f|--force]


DESCRIPTION
       This  script  will  detect  existing  swap  partitions or swap files, and
       encrypt them, using cryptsetup.

       Encrypted swap is essential to securing any system using eCryptfs,  since
       decrypted  file  contents will exist in the system&apos;s memory, which may be
       swapped to disk at any time.  If  the  system  swap  space  is  not  also
       encrypted,  it  is possible that decrypted files could be written to disk
       in clear text.

       Note that most Linux distributions do not yet support  resuming  from  an
       encrypted  swap  space,  and  thus  hibernate/resume will not work.  Sus&#8208;
       pend/resume is unaffected.

       Upon running the utility,  the  user  will  be  informed  of  the  hiber&#8208;
       nate/resume  break,  and  asked  to confirm the behavior.  The -f|--force
       option can be used to bypass this interactive prompt.
