ELINKS(1)                    The Elinks text-browser                   ELINKS(1)



NAME
       elinks - lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser

SYNOPSIS
       elinks [OPTION]... [URL]...


DESCRIPTION
       ELinks is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors, table rendering,
       background downloading, menu driven configuration interface, tabbed
       browsing and slim code.

       Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated with
       external viewers. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external clients.

       ELinks can handle both local files and remote URLs. The main supported
       remote URL protocols are HTTP, HTTPS (with SSL support compiled in) and
       FTP. Additional protocol support exists for BitTorrent finger, Gopher,
       SMB and NNTP.

       The homepage of ELinks can be found at &lt;http://elinks.cz/&gt;, where the
       ELinks manual is also hosted.


OPTIONS
       Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so usually
       you do not need to care about them. Note that this list is roughly
       equivalent to the output of running ELinks with the option --long-help.

       -anonymous [0|1] (default: 0)
           Restricts ELinks so it can run on an anonymous account. Local file
           browsing, downloads, and modification of options will be disabled.
           Execution of viewers is allowed, but entries in the association table
           can&#180;t be added or modified.

       -auto-submit [0|1] (default: 0)
           Automatically submit the first form in the given URLs.

       -base-session &lt;num&gt; (default: 0)
           Used internally when opening ELinks instances in new windows. The ID
           maps to information that will be used when creating the new instance.
           You don&#180;t want to use it.

       -config-dir &lt;str&gt; (default: &quot;&quot;)
           Path of the directory ELinks will read and write its config and
           runtime state files to instead of ~/.elinks. If the path does not
           begin with a &#180;/&#180; it is assumed to be relative to your HOME directory.

       -config-dump
           Print a configuration file with options set to the built-in defaults
           to stdout.

       -config-file &lt;str&gt; (default: &quot;elinks.conf&quot;)
           Name of the configuration file that all configuration options will be
           read from and written to. It should be relative to config-dir.

       -config-help
           Print help for configuration options and exit.

       -default-mime-type (alias for mime.default_type)
           The default MIME type used for documents of unknown type.
&#12;       -default-keys [0|1] (default: 0)
           When set, all keybindings from configuration files will be ignored.
           It forces use of default keybindings and will reset user-defined ones
           on save.

       -dump [0|1] (default: 0)
           Print formatted plain-text versions of given URLs to stdout.

       -dump-charset (alias for document.dump.codepage)
           Codepage used when formatting dump output.

       -dump-color-mode (alias for document.dump.color_mode)
           Color mode used with -dump.

       -dump-width (alias for document.dump.width)
           Width of the dump output.

       -eval
           Specify configuration file directives on the command-line which will
           be evaluated after all configuration files has been read. Example
           usage: -eval &#180;set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1&#180;

       -force-html
           Makes ELinks assume documents of unknown types are HTML. Useful when
           using ELinks as an external viewer from MUAs. This is equivalent to
           -default-mime-type text/html.

       -?, -h, -help
           Print usage help and exit.

       -localhost [0|1] (default: 0)
           Restricts ELinks to work offline and only connect to servers with
           local addresses (ie. 127.0.0.1). No connections to remote servers
           will be permitted.

       -long-help
           Print detailed usage help and exit.

       -lookup
           Look up specified host and print all DNS resolved IP addresses.

       -no-connect [0|1] (default: 0)
           Run ELinks as a separate instance instead of connecting to an
           existing instance. Note that normally no runtime state files
           (bookmarks, history, etc.) are written to the disk when this option
           is used. See also -touch-files.

       -no-home [0|1] (default: 0)
           Disables creation and use of files in the user specific home
           configuration directory (~/.elinks). It forces default configuration
           values to be used and disables saving of runtime state files.

       -no-numbering (alias for document.dump.numbering)
           Prevents printing of link number in dump output.

           Note that this really affects only -dump, nothing else.

       -no-references (alias for document.dump.references)
           Prevents printing of references (URIs) of document links in dump
           output.

           Note that this really affects only -dump, nothing else.

       -remote
           Control a remote ELinks instance by passing commands to it. The
           option takes an additional argument containing the method which
           should be invoked and any parameters that should be passed to it. For
           ease of use, the additional method argument can be omitted in which
           case any URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in the remote
           instance.

           Following is a list of the supported methods:

           &#183;   ping(): look for a remote instance

           &#183;   openURL(): prompt URL in current tab

           &#183;   openURL(URL): open URL in current tab

           &#183;   openURL(URL, new-tab): open URL in new tab

           &#183;   openURL(URL, new-window): open URL in new window

           &#183;   addBookmark(URL): bookmark URL

           &#183;   infoBox(text): show text in a message box

           &#183;   xfeDoCommand(openBrowser): open new window

       -session-ring &lt;num&gt; (default: 0)
           ID of session ring this ELinks session should connect to.  ELinks
           works in so-called session rings, whereby all instances of ELinks are
           interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies, and so
           on). By default, all ELinks instances connect to session ring 0. You
           can change that behaviour with this switch and form as many session
           rings as you want. Obviously, if the session-ring with this number
           doesn&#180;t exist yet, it&#180;s created and this ELinks instance will become
           the master instance (that usually doesn&#180;t matter for you as a user
           much).

           Note that you usually don&#180;t want to use this unless you&#180;re a
           developer and you want to do some testing - if you want the ELinks
           instances each running standalone, rather use the -no-connect
           command-line option. Also note that normally no runtime state files
           are written to the disk when this option is used. See also
           -touch-files.

       -source [0|1] (default: 0)
           Print given URLs in source form to stdout.

       -touch-files [0|1] (default: 0)
           When enabled, runtime state files (bookmarks, history, etc.) are
           written to disk, even when -no-connect or -session-ring is used. The
           option has no effect if not used in conjunction with any of these
           options.

       -verbose &lt;num&gt; (default: 1)
           The verbose level controls what messages are shown at start up and
           while running:

           &#183;   0 means only show serious errors

           &#183;   1 means show serious errors and warnings

           &#183;   2 means show all messages

       -version
           Print ELinks version information and exit.
