ELINKSKEYS(5)                  ELinks keybindings                  ELINKSKEYS(5)



NAME
       elinkskeys - keybindings for ELinks

SYNOPSIS
       Information on how to configure keybinding and overview of the default
       keybindings.


DESCRIPTION
       Key binding for elinks should be placed in the file
       ~/.elinks/elinks.conf. Note that any information regarding their
       format/structure may not be up-to-date. If you will discover that, please
       feed us with a patch.

       Key binding statements are of the form:


           bind &lt;keymap&gt; &lt;keystroke&gt; = &lt;action&gt;
       where:

       &lt;keymap&gt;
           is main, edit, or menu. The main keymap is used for general browsing.
           The edit keymap is used for editing text fields. The menu keymap is
           used for navigating menus.

       &lt;keystroke&gt;
           is a case sensitive key, which you can prefix with Ctrl-, Alt-, or
           both.  Ctrl- must be followed by an uppercase key. See below for a
           list of valid keys.

       &lt;action&gt;
           is what the key should do. The actions available are dependent on the
           keymap, and are listed separately below.
       All words/strings may all be quoted &quot;like so&quot;. Backslashes are escape
       characters, even if not between quotes. Lines beginning with a hash
       character (#) are comments.

       Keys can be unbound just by binding them to the special none action. It
       may be of use if you accidentally type a key often.


EXAMPLE BINDINGS
       Some sample keybindings:


           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;v&quot; = &quot;view-image&quot;
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;l&quot; = &quot;jump-to-link&quot;
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;L&quot; = &quot;link-menu&quot;
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;F10&quot; = &quot;file-menu&quot;
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;F9&quot; = &quot;menu&quot;
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;Escape&quot; = &quot;menu&quot;
           bind &quot;edit&quot; &quot;Ctrl-R&quot; = &quot;auto-complete-unambiguous&quot;
           bind &quot;edit&quot; &quot;Ctrl-W&quot; = &quot;auto-complete&quot;
           bind &quot;edit&quot; &quot;Ctrl-K&quot; = &quot;kill-to-eol&quot;
           bind &quot;menu&quot; &quot;Ctrl-B&quot; = &quot;page-up&quot;
           bind &quot;menu&quot; &quot;PageUp&quot; = &quot;page-up&quot;
           bind &quot;menu&quot; &quot;Ctrl-F&quot; = &quot;page-down&quot;
           bind &quot;menu&quot; &quot;PageDown&quot; = &quot;page-down&quot;
           # ELinks with Lua support
           bind &quot;main&quot; &quot;,&quot; = &quot;lua-console&quot;

KEYS
       Valid keys are: alphanumeric characters, punctuation, Enter, Backspace,
       Tab, Escape, Left, Right, Up, Down, Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp,
       PageDown, F1 to F12.

       Some keys will need to be quoted or escaped. For example, space can be
       written as &quot; &quot; (quote space quote), and the quote itself as \&quot; (backslash
       quote). Backslash can be written as \\ (double backslash).
