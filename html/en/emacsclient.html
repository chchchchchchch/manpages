EMACSCLIENT(1)                                                    EMACSCLIENT(1)



NAME
       emacsclient - tells a running Emacs to visit a file

SYNOPSIS
       emacsclient [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the emacsclient command.  Full docu&#8208;
       mentation is available in the GNU Info format; see  below.   This  manual
       page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but is
       not specific to that system.

       emacsclient works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server.

       You can either call emacsclient directly or let other programs run it for
       you  when  necessary.   On GNU and Unix systems many programs consult the
       environment variable EDITOR (sometimes also VISUAL) to obtain the command
       used  for  editing.   Thus,  setting  this environment variable to &apos;emac&#8208;
       sclient&apos; will allow these programs to use an already  running  Emacs  for
       editing.  Other operating systems might have their own methods for defin&#8208;
       ing the default editor.

       For emacsclient to work, you need an already running Emacs with a server.
       Within  Emacs, call the functions `server-start&apos; or `server-mode&apos;.  (Your
       `.emacs&apos; file can do this  automatically  if  you  add  either  `(server-
       start)&apos; or `(server-mode 1)&apos; to it.)

       When  you&apos;ve  finished  editing the buffer, type `C-x #&apos; (`server-edit&apos;).
       This saves the file and sends a message back to the `emacsclient&apos; program
       telling it to exit.  The programs that use `EDITOR&apos; wait for the &quot;editor&quot;
       (actually, `emacsclient&apos;) to exit.  `C-x #&apos; also checks for other pending
       external requests to edit various files, and selects the next such file.

       If  you  set the variable `server-window&apos; to a window or a frame, `C-x #&apos;
       displays the server buffer in that window or in that frame.


OPTIONS
       The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long  options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;).

       -a, --alternate-editor=EDITOR
              if  the  Emacs  server  is  not  running, run the specified editor
              instead.  This can also be specified  via  the  `ALTERNATE_EDITOR&apos;
              environment variable.  If the value of EDITOR is the empty string,
              then Emacs is started in daemon mode and emacsclient will  try  to
              connect to it.

       -c, --create-frame
              create  a  new  frame  instead  of trying to use the current Emacs
              frame

       -d, --display=DISPLAY
              tell the server to display the files on the given display.

       -e, --eval
              do not visit files but instead evaluate  the  arguments  as  Emacs
              Lisp expressions.

       -f, --server-file=FILENAME
              use  TCP  configuration file FILENAME for communication.  This can
              also be specified via the  `EMACS_SERVER_FILE&apos;  environment  vari&#8208;
              able.

       -n, --no-wait
              returns immediately without waiting for you to &quot;finish&quot; the buffer
              in Emacs.

       -nw, -t, --tty
              open a new Emacs frame on the current terminal

       -s, --socket-name=FILENAME
              use socket named FILENAME for communication.

       -V, --version
              print version information and exit

       -H, --help
              print this usage information message and exit
