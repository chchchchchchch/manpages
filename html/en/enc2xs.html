ENC2XS(1)               Perl Programmers Reference Guide               ENC2XS(1)



NAME
       enc2xs -- Perl Encode Module Generator

SYNOPSIS
         enc2xs -[options]
         enc2xs -M ModName mapfiles...
         enc2xs -C

DESCRIPTION
       enc2xs builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either Unicode
       Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).  Besides
       being used internally during the build process of the Encode module, you
       can use enc2xs to add your own encoding to perl.  No knowledge of XS is
       necessary.

Quick Guide
       If you want to know as little about Perl as possible but need to add a
       new encoding, just read this chapter and forget the rest.

       0.  Have a .ucm file ready.  You can get it from somewhere or you can
           write your own from scratch or you can grab one from the Encode
           distribution and customize it.  For the UCM format, see the next
           Chapter.  In the example below, I&apos;ll call my theoretical encoding
           myascii, defined in my.ucm.  &quot;$&quot; is a shell prompt.

             $ ls -F
             my.ucm

       1.  Issue a command as follows;

             $ enc2xs -M My my.ucm
             generating Makefile.PL
             generating My.pm
             generating README
             generating Changes

           Now take a look at your current directory.  It should look like this.

             $ ls -F
             Makefile.PL   My.pm         my.ucm        t/

           The following files were created.

             Makefile.PL - MakeMaker script
             My.pm       - Encode submodule
             t/My.t      - test file

           1.1.
               If you want *.ucm installed together with the modules, do as
               follows;

                 $ mkdir Encode
                 $ mv *.ucm Encode
                 $ enc2xs -M My Encode/*ucm

       2.  Edit the files generated.  You don&apos;t have to if you have no time AND
           no intention to give it to someone else.  But it is a good idea to
           edit the pod and to add more tests.

       3.  Now issue a command all Perl Mongers love:

             $ perl Makefile.PL
             Writing Makefile for Encode::My
&#12;       4.  Now all you have to do is make.

             $ make
             cp My.pm blib/lib/Encode/My.pm
             /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/enc2xs -Q -O \
               -o encode_t.c -f encode_t.fnm
             Reading myascii (myascii)
             Writing compiled form
             128 bytes in string tables
             384 bytes (75%) saved spotting duplicates
             1 bytes (0.775%) saved using substrings
             ....
             chmod 644 blib/arch/auto/Encode/My/My.bs
             $

           The time it takes varies depending on how fast your machine is and
           how large your encoding is.  Unless you are working on something big
           like euc-tw, it won&apos;t take too long.

       5.  You can &quot;make install&quot; already but you should test first.

             $ make test
             PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib \
               -e &apos;use Test::Harness  qw(&amp;runtests $verbose); \
               $verbose=0; runtests @ARGV;&apos; t/*.t
             t/My....ok
             All tests successful.
             Files=1, Tests=2,  0 wallclock secs
              ( 0.09 cusr + 0.01 csys = 0.09 CPU)

       6.  If you are content with the test result, just &quot;make install&quot;

       7.  If you want to add your encoding to Encode&apos;s demand-loading list (so
           you don&apos;t have to &quot;use Encode::YourEncoding&quot;), run

             enc2xs -C

           to update Encode::ConfigLocal, a module that controls local settings.
           After that, &quot;use Encode;&quot; is enough to load your encodings on demand.

The Unicode Character Map
       Encode uses the Unicode Character Map (UCM) format for source character
       mappings.  This format is used by IBM&apos;s ICU package and was adopted by
       Nick Ing-Simmons for use with the Encode module.  Since UCM is more
       flexible than Tcl&apos;s Encoding Map and far more user-friendly, this is the
       recommended format for Encode now.

       A UCM file looks like this.

         #
         # Comments
         #
         &lt;code_set_name&gt; &quot;US-ascii&quot; # Required
         &lt;code_set_alias&gt; &quot;ascii&quot;   # Optional
         &lt;mb_cur_min&gt; 1             # Required; usually 1
         &lt;mb_cur_max&gt; 1             # Max. # of bytes/char
         &lt;subchar&gt; \x3F             # Substitution char
         #
         CHARMAP
         &lt;U0000&gt; \x00 |0 # &lt;control&gt;
         &lt;U0001&gt; \x01 |0 # &lt;control&gt;
         &lt;U0002&gt; \x02 |0 # &lt;control&gt;
         ....
         &lt;U007C&gt; \x7C |0 # VERTICAL LINE
         &lt;U007D&gt; \x7D |0 # RIGHT CURLY BRACKET
         &lt;U007E&gt; \x7E |0 # TILDE
         &lt;U007F&gt; \x7F |0 # &lt;control&gt;
         END CHARMAP

       &#183;   Anything that follows &quot;#&quot; is treated as a comment.

       &#183;   The header section continues until a line containing the word
           CHARMAP. This section has a form of &lt;keyword&gt; value, one pair per
           line.  Strings used as values must be quoted. Barewords are treated
           as numbers.  \xXX represents a byte.

           Most of the keywords are self-explanatory. subchar means substitution
           character, not subcharacter.  When you decode a Unicode sequence to
           this encoding but no matching character is found, the byte sequence
           defined here will be used.  For most cases, the value here is \x3F;
           in ASCII, this is a question mark.

       &#183;   CHARMAP starts the character map section.  Each line has a form as
           follows:

             &lt;UXXXX&gt; \xXX.. |0 # comment
               ^     ^      ^
               |     |      +- Fallback flag
               |     +-------- Encoded byte sequence
               +-------------- Unicode Character ID in hex

           The format is roughly the same as a header section except for the
           fallback flag: | followed by 0..3.   The meaning of the possible
           values is as follows:

           |0  Round trip safe.  A character decoded to Unicode encodes back to
               the same byte sequence.  Most characters have this flag.

           |1  Fallback for unicode -&gt; encoding.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
               character for the encode map only.

           |2  Skip sub-char mapping should there be no code point.

           |3  Fallback for encoding -&gt; unicode.  When seen, enc2xs adds this
               character for the decode map only.

       &#183;   And finally, END OF CHARMAP ends the section.

       When you are manually creating a UCM file, you should copy ascii.ucm or
       an existing encoding which is close to yours, rather than write your own
       from scratch.

       When you do so, make sure you leave at least U0000 to U0020 as is, unless
       your environment is EBCDIC.

       CAVEAT: not all features in UCM are implemented.  For example, icu:state
       is not used.  Because of that, you need to write a perl module if you
       want to support algorithmical encodings, notably the ISO-2022 series.
       Such modules include Encode::JP::2022_JP, Encode::KR::2022_KR, and
       Encode::TW::HZ.

   Coping with duplicate mappings
       When you create a map, you SHOULD make your mappings round-trip safe.
       That is, &quot;encode(&apos;your-encoding&apos;, decode(&apos;your-encoding&apos;, $data)) eq
       $data&quot; stands for all characters that are marked as &quot;|0&quot;.  Here is how to
       make sure:

       &#183;   Sort your map in Unicode order.

       &#183;   When you have a duplicate entry, mark either one with &apos;|1&apos; or &apos;|3&apos;.

       &#183;   And make sure the &apos;|1&apos; or &apos;|3&apos; entry FOLLOWS the &apos;|0&apos; entry.

       Here is an example from big5-eten.

         &lt;U2550&gt; \xF9\xF9 |0
         &lt;U2550&gt; \xA2\xA4 |3
&#12;       Internally Encoding -&gt; Unicode and Unicode -&gt; Encoding Map looks like
       this;

         E to U               U to E
         --------------------------------------
         \xF9\xF9 =&gt; U2550    U2550 =&gt; \xF9\xF9
         \xA2\xA4 =&gt; U2550

       So it is round-trip safe for \xF9\xF9.  But if the line above is upside
       down, here is what happens.

         E to U               U to E
         --------------------------------------
         \xA2\xA4 =&gt; U2550    U2550 =&gt; \xF9\xF9
         (\xF9\xF9 =&gt; U2550 is now overwritten!)

       The Encode package comes with ucmlint, a crude but sufficient utility to
       check the integrity of a UCM file.  Check under the Encode/bin directory
       for this.

       When in doubt, you can use ucmsort, yet another utility under Encode/bin
       directory.
