enca(1)                                                                  enca(1)



NAME
       enca -- detect and convert encoding of text files

SYNOPSIS
       enca [-L LANGUAGE] [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       enconv [-L LANGUAGE] [OPTION]... [FILE]...

INTRODUCTION AND EXAMPLES
       If  you  are lucky enough, the only two things you will ever need to know
       are: command

              enca FILE

       will tell you which encoding file FILE uses (without changing it), and

              enconv FILE

       will convert file FILE to your locale native encoding.   To  convert  the
       file  to  some  other encoding use the -x option (see -x entry in section
       OPTIONS and sections CONVERSION and ENCODINGS for details).

       Both work with multiple files and standard input (output) too.  E.g.

              enca -x latin2 &lt;sometext | lpr

       assures file `sometext&apos; is in ISO Latin 2 when it&apos;s sent to printer.

       The main reason why these command will fail  and  turn  your  files  into
       garbage is that Enca needs to know their language to detect the encoding.
       It tries to determine your language and  preferred  charset  from  locale
       settings, which might not be what you want.

       You  can  (or have to) use -L option to tell it the right language.  Sup&#8208;
       pose, you downloaded some Russian HTML file, `file.htm&apos;, it  claims  it&apos;s
       windows-1251 but it isn&apos;t.  So you run

              enca -L ru file.htm

       and  find  out it&apos;s KOI8-R (for example).  Be warned, currently there are
       not many supported languages (see section LANGUAGES).

       Another warning concerns the fact several  Enca&apos;s  features,  namely  its
       charset  conversion capabilities, strongly depend on what other tools are
       installed on your system (see section CONVERSION)--run

              enca --version

       to get list of features (see section FEATURES).  Also try

              enca --help

       to get description of all other Enca options (and to  find  the  rest  of
       this manual page redundant).

DESCRIPTION
       Enca  reads  given text files, or standard input when none are given, and
       uses knowledge about their language (must be supported by you) and a mix&#8208;
       ture of parsing, statistical analysis, guessing and black magic to deter&#8208;
       mine their encodings, which it then prints to standard output (or it con&#8208;
       fesses it doesn&apos;t have any idea what the encoding could be).  By default,
       Enca presents results as a multiline human-readable descriptions, several
       other formats are available--see Output type selectors below.

       Enca  can  also convert files to some other encoding ENC when you ask for
       it--either using a built-in converter, some  conversion  library,  or  by
       calling an external converter.

       Enca&apos;s  primary  goal is to be usable unattended, as an automatic conver&#8208;
       sion tool, though it perhaps have not reached this point yet (please  see
       section SECURITY).

       Please  note  except  rare  cases Enca really has to know the language of
       input files to give you a reliable answer.  On the  other  hand,  it  can
       then  cope  quite  well  with  files  that are not purely textual or even
       detect charset of text strings inside some binary  file;  of  course,  it
       depends on the character of the non-text component.

       Enca doesn&apos;t care about structure of input files, it views them as a uni&#8208;
       form piece of text/data.  In case of multipart  files  (e.g.  mailboxes),
       you have to use some tool knowing the structure to extract the individual
       parts first.  It&apos;s the cost of ability to detect encodings  of  any  dam&#8208;
       aged, incomplete or otherwise incorrect files.

OPTIONS
       There  are  several categories of options: operation mode options, output
       type  selectors,  guessing  parameters,  conversion  parameters,  general
       options and listings.

       All  long  options  can  be  abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous,
       mandatory parameters of long options are mandatory for short options too.

   Operation modes
       are following:

       -c, --auto-convert
              Equivalent to calling Enca as enconv.

              If no output type selector is specified,  detect  file  encodings,
              guess your preferred charset from locales, and convert files to it
              (only available with +target-charset-auto feature).

       -g, --guess
              Equivalent to calling Enca as enca.

              If no output type selector is specified, detect file encodings and
              report them.

   Output type selectors
       select  what  action Enca will take when it determines the encoding; most
       of them just choose between different names, formats and conventions  how
       encodings  can be printed, but one of them (-x) is special: it tells Enca
       to recode files to some other encoding ENC.  These options  are  mutually
       exclusive; if you specify more than one output type selector the last one
       takes precedence.

       Several output types represent charset name used by some  other  program,
       but  not  all these programs know all the charsets which Enca recognises.
       Be warned, Enca makes no  difference  between  unrecognised  charset  and
       charset having no name in given namespace in such situations.

       -d, --details
              It  used  to  print  a  few  pages  of  details about the guessing
              process, but since Enca is just  a  program  linked  against  Enca
              library,  this  is not possible and this option is roughly equiva&#8208;
              lent to --human-readable, except it reports  failure  reason  when
              Enca doesn&apos;t recoginize the encoding.

       -e, --enca-name
              Prints  Enca&apos;s  nice  name  of the charset, i.e., perhaps the most
              generally accepted and more or less human-readable charset identi&#8208;
              fier, with surfaces appended.

              This name is used when calling an external converter, too.

       -f, --human-readable
              Prints  verbal  description  of  the  detected  charset  and  sur&#8208;
              faces--something a human understands best.  This  is  the  default
              behaviour.

              The  precise  format is following: the first line contains charset
              name alone, and it&apos;s followed by zero or more indented lines  con&#8208;
              taining  names of detected surfaces.  This format is not, however,
              suitable or intended for further machine-processing, and the  ver&#8208;
              bal charset descriptions are like to change in the future.

       -i, --iconv-name
              Prints  how iconv(3) (and/or iconv(1)) calls the detected charset.
              More precisely, it prints one, more or  less  arbitrarily  chosen,
              alias  accepted  by  iconv.   A charset unknown to iconv counts as
              unknown.

              This output type makes sense only when Enca is compiled with iconv
              support (feature +iconv-interface).

       -r, --rfc1345-name
              Prints  RFC  1345  charset  name.   When such a name doesn&apos;t exist
              because RFC 1345 doesn&apos;t define given encoding,  some  other  name
              defined in some other RFC or just the name which author consideres
              `the most canonical&apos;, is printed.

              Since RFC  1345  doesn&apos;t  define  surfaces,  no  surface  info  is
              appended.

       -m, --mime-name
              Prints  preferred MIME name of detected charset.  This is the name
              you should normally use when fixing e-mails or web pages.

              A charset not present  in  http://www.iana.org/assignments/charac&#8208;
              ter-sets counts as unknown.

       -s, --cstocs-name
              Prints  how  cstocs(1)  calls  the  detected  charset.   A charset
              unknown to cstocs counts as unknown.

       -n, --name=WORD
              Prints charset (encoding) name selected by WORD (can  be  abbrevi&#8208;
              ated  as  long  as  is  unambiguous).   For  names  listed  above,
              --name=WORD is equivalent to --WORD.

              Using aliases as the output type causes Enca to print list of  all
              accepted aliases of detected charset.

       -x, --convert-to=[..]ENC
              Converts file to encoding ENC.

              The  optional  `..&apos;  before  encoding name has no special meaning,
              except  you  can  use  it  to  remind  yourself  that,  unlike  in
              recode(1),  you  should  specify desired encoding, instead of cur&#8208;
              rent.

              You can use recode(1) recoding chains or any other kind of  brain&#8208;
              dead  recoding  specification for ENC, provided that you tell Enca
              to use some tool understanding it for conversion (see section CON&#8208;
              VERSION).

              When Enca fails to determine the encoding, it prints a warning and
              leaves the the file as is; when it is run as a filter it tries  to
              do  its  best to copy standard input to standard output unchanged.
              Nevertheless, you should not rely on it and do backup.

   Guessing parameters
       There&apos;s only one: -L setting language of  input  files.  This  option  is
       mandatory (but see below).

       -L, --language=LANG
              Sets language of input files to LANG.

              More  precisely,  LANG can be any valid locale name (or alias with
              +locale-alias feature) of some supported language.  You  can  also
              specify  `none&apos;  as  language  name,  only multibyte encodings are
              recognised then.  Run

              enca --list languages

              to get list of supported languages.  When you  don&apos;t  specify  any
              language  Enca  tries  to guess your language from locale settings
              and assumes input files use this language.  See section  LANGUAGES
              for details.

   Conversion parameters
       give you finer control of how charset conversion will be performed.  They
       don&apos;t affect anything when -x is not specified as  output  type.   Please
       see section CONVERSION for the gory conversion details.

       -C, --try-converters=LIST
              Appends  comma  separated LIST to the list of converters that will
              be tried when you ask for conversion.  Their names can be abbrevi&#8208;
              ated as long as they are unambiguous.  Run

              enca --list converters

              to  get list of all valid converter names (and see section CONVER&#8208;
              SION for their description).

              The default list depends on how Enca has been compiled, run

              enca --help

              to find out default converter list.

              Note the default list is used only when you don&apos;t  specify  -C  at
              all.   Otherwise,  the list is built as if it were initially empty
              and every -C adds new converter(s) to  it.   Moreover,  specifying
              none as converter name causes clearing the converter list.

       -E, --external-converter-program=PATH
              Sets  external  converter  program name to PATH.  Default external
              converter depends on how enca has been complied, and the possibil&#8208;
              ity to use external converters may not be available at all.  Run

              enca --help

              to find out default converter program in your enca build.

   General options
       don&apos;t fit to other option categories...

       -p, --with-filename
              Forces  Enca  to  prefix each result with corresponding file name.
              By default, Enca prefixes results with filenames when run on  mul&#8208;
              tiple files.

              Standard  input  is printed as STDIN and standard output as STDOUT
              (the latter can be probably seen in error messages only).

       -P, --no-filename
              Forces Enca to not prefix results with file  names.   By  default,
              Enca  doesn&apos;t  prefix  result  with file name when run on a single
              file (including standard input).

       -V, --verbose
              Increases verbosity level (each use increases it by one).

              Currently this option in not very useful because  different  parts
              of  Enca  respond  differently to the same verbosity level, mostly
              not at all.

   Listings
       are all terminal, i.e. when Enca encounters some of them  it  prints  the
       required listing and terminates without processing any following options.

       -h, --help
              Prints brief usage help.

       -G, --license
              Prints full Enca license (through a pager, if possible).

       -l, --list=WORD
              Prints list specified by WORD (can be abbreviated as long as it is
              unambiguous).  Available lists include:

              built-in-charsets.  All encodings  convertible  by  built-in  con&#8208;
              verter, by group (both input and output encoding must be from this
              list and belong to the same group for internal conversion).

              built-in-encodings.  Equivalent to built-in-charsets, but  consid&#8208;
              ered obsolete; will be accepted with a warning, for a while.

              converters.  All valid converter names (to be used with -C).

              charsets.   All  encodings  (charsets).  You can select what names
              will be printed with --name or any name output type  selector  (of
              course,  only  encodings  having a name in given namespace will be
              printed then), the selector must be specified before --list.

              encodings.  Equivalent to charsets, but considered obsolete;  will
              be accepted with a warning, for a while.

              languages.  All supported languages together with charsets belong&#8208;
              ing to them.  Note output type selects language  name  style,  not
              charset name style here.

              names.  All possible values of --name option.

              lists.  All possible values of this option.  (Crazy?)

              surfaces.  All surfaces Enca recognises.

       -v, --version
              Prints  program  version  and  list  of features (see section FEA&#8208;
              TURES).

CONVERSION
       Though Enca has been originally designed as a tool for guessing  encoding
       only,  it  now  features  several methods of charset conversion.  You can
       control which of them will be used with -C.

       Enca sequentially tries converters from the list specified by -C until it
       finds  some  that  is  able  to  perform  required conversion or until it
       exhausts the list.  You should specify preferred converters  first,  less
       preferred  later.  External converter (extern) should be always specified
       last, only as last resort, since it&apos;s usually  not  possible  to  recover
       when  it  fails.   The  default  list  of  converters  always starts with
       built-in and then continues with the first one available from: librecode,
       iconv, nothing.

       It  should  be noted when Enca says it is not able to perform the conver&#8208;
       sion it only means none of the converters is able to perform it.  It  can
       be  still  possible  to perform the required conversion in several steps,
       using several converters, but to figure out how,  human  intelligence  is
       probably needed.

   Built-in converter
       is  the simplest and far the fastest of all, can perform only a few byte-
       to-byte conversions and modifies files directly in place (may be  consid&#8208;
       ered dangerous, but is pretty efficient).  You can get list of all encod&#8208;
       ings it can convert with

              enca --list built-in

       Beside speed, its main advantage  (and  also  disadvantage)  is  that  it
       doesn&apos;t  care:  it  simply converts characters having a representation in
       target encoding, doesn&apos;t touch anything else and never prints  any  error
       message.

       This converter can be specified as built-in with -C.

   Librecode converter
       is an interface to GNU recode library, that does the actual recoding job.
       It may or may not be compiled in; run

              enca --version

       to find  out  its  availability  in  your  enca  build  (feature  +libre&#8208;
       code-interface).

       You  should be familiar with recode(1) before using it, since recode is a
       quite sophisticated and powerful charset conversion tool.   You  may  run
       into  problems  using  it  together with Enca particularly because Enca&apos;s
       support for surfaces not 100% compatible, because recode tries  too  hard
       to  make  the  transformation  reversible,  because it sometimes silently
       ignores I/O errors, and because it&apos;s incredibily buggy.  Please  see  GNU
       recode info pages for details about recode library.

       This converter can be specified as librecode with -C.

   Iconv converter
       is  an interface to the UNIX98 iconv(3) conversion functions, that do the
       actual recoding job.  It may or may not be compiled in; run

              enca --version

       to find out its availability in your enca  build  (feature  +iconv-inter&#8208;
       face).

       While  iconv  is  present on most today systems it only rarely offer some
       useful set of available conversions, the  only  notable  exception  being
       iconv  from  GNU  libc.   It  is  usually quite picky about surfaces, too
       (while, at the same time, not implementing surface conversion).  It  how&#8208;
       ever  probably  represents  the  only standard(ized) tool able to perform
       conversion from/to Unicode.  Please see  iconv  documentation  about  for
       details about its capabilities on your particular system.

       This converter can be specified as iconv with -C.

   External converter
       is  an  arbitrary  external conversion tool that can be specified with -E
       option (at most one can be defined simultaneously).  There are some stan&#8208;
       dard, provided together with enca: cstocs, recode, map, umap, and piconv.
       All are wrapper scripts: for cstocs(1), recode(1), map(1),  umap(1),  and
       piconv(1).

       Please  note  enca  has little control what the external converter really
       does.  If you set it to /bin/rm you are fully responsible for the  conse&#8208;
       quences.

       If  you want to make your own converter to use with enca, you should know
       it is always called

              CONVERTER ENC_CURRENT ENC FILE [-]

       where CONVERTER is what has been  set  by  -E,  ENC_CURRENT  is  detected
       encoding, ENC is what has been specified with -x, and FILE is the file to
       convert, i.e. it is called for each file separately.  The optional fourth
       parameter, -, should cause (when present) sending result of conversion to
       standard output instead of overwriting  the  file  FILE.   The  converter
       should  also  take care of not changing file permissions, returning error
       code 1 when it fails and cleaning its temporary files.   Please  see  the
       standard external converters for examples.

       This converter can be specified as extern with -C.

   Default target charset
       The  starightforward  way  of specifying target charset is the -x option,
       which overrides any defaults.  When Enca is  called  as  enconv,  default
       target charset is selected exactly the same way as recode(1) does it.

       If the DEFAULT_CHARSET environment variable is set, it&apos;s used as the tar&#8208;
       get charset.

       Otherwise, if you system provides the  nl_langinfo(3)  function,  current
       locale&apos;s native charset is used as the target charset.

       When both methods fail, Enca complains and terminates.

   Reversibility notes
       If  reversibility is crucial for you, you shouldn&apos;t use enca as converter
       at all (or maybe you can, with very specifically designed recode(1) wrap&#8208;
       per).   Otherwise you should at least know that there four basic means of
       handling inconvertible character entities:

       fail--this is a possibility, too, and incidentally it&apos;s exactly what cur&#8208;
       rent  GNU  libc  iconv implementation does (recode can be also told to do
       it)

       don&apos;t touch them--this is what enca internal converter  always  does  and
       recode can do; though it is not reversible, a human being is usually able
       to reconstruct the original (at least in principle)

       approximate them--this is what cstocs can do, and recode too, though dif&#8208;
       ferently;  and the best choice if you just want to make the accursed text
       readable

       drop them out--this is what both recode and cstocs  can  do  (cstocs  can
       also  replace  these  characters  by some fixed character instead of mere
       ignoring); useful when the to-be-omitted characters contain only noise.

       Please consult your favourite converter manual for details of this issue.
       Generally, if you are not lucky enough to have all convertible characters
       in you file, manual intervention is needed anyway.

   Performance notes
       Poor performance of available converters has been one of main reasons for
       including  built-in  converter in enca.  Try to use it whenever possible,
       i.e. when files in consideration are  charset-clean  enough  or  charset-
       messy  enough  so that its zero built-in intelligence doesn&apos;t matter.  It
       requires no  extra  disk  space  nor  extra  memory  and  can  outperform
       recode(1)  more  than  10 times on large files and Perl version (i.e. the
       faster one) of cstocs(1) more than 400 times on small files (in fact it&apos;s
       almost as fast as mere cp(1)).

       Try to avoid external converters when it&apos;s not absolutely necessary since
       all the forking and moving stuff around is incredibily slow.

ENCODINGS
       You can get list of recognised character sets with

              enca --list charsets

       and using --name parameter you can select any name you want to be used in
       the listing.  You can also list all surfaces with

              enca --list surfaces

       Encoding  and  surface  names  are  case insensitive and non-alphanumeric
       characters are not taken into account.  However, non-alphanumeric charac&#8208;
       ters are mostly not allowed at all.  The only allowed are: `-&apos;, `_&apos;, `.&apos;,
       `:&apos;, and `/&apos; (as charset/surface separator).  So `ibm852&apos;  and  `IBM-852&apos;
       are the same, while `IBM 852&apos; is not accepted.

   Charsets
       Following  list  of recognised charsets uses Enca&apos;s names (-e) and verbal
       descriptions as reported by Enca (-f):

       where  unknown  is  not any real encoding, it&apos;s reported when Enca is not
       able to give a reliable answer.

   Surfaces
       Enca has some experimental support for so-called  surfaces  (see  below).
       It detects following surfaces (not all can be applied to all charsets):

       tab (@); l l.  /CR@CR line terminators /LF@LF line terminators /CRLF@CRLF
       line terminators N.A.@Mixed line  terminators  N.A.@Surrounded  by/inter&#8208;
       mixed  with  non-text  data /21@Byte order reversed in pairs (1,2 -&gt; 2,1)
       /4321@Byte order reversed in quadruples (1,2,3,4  -&gt;  4,3,2,1)  N.A.@Both
       little and big endian chunks, concatenated /qp@Quoted-printable encoded

       Note some surfaces have N.A. in place of identifier--they cannot be spec&#8208;
       ified on command line, they can only be reported by Enca.  This is inten&#8208;
       tional  because  they  only  inform you why the file cannot be considered
       surface-consistent instead of representing a real surface.

       Each charset has its natural surface (called `implied&apos; in  recode)  which
       is  not reported, e.g., for IBM 852 charset it&apos;s `CRLF line terminators&apos;.
       For UCS encodings, big endian is considered as natural  surface;  unusual
       byte  orders  are  constructed  from  21  and  4321 permutations: 2143 is
       reported simply as 21, while 3412 is reported as combination of 4321  and
       21.

       Doubly-encoded UTF-8 is neither charset nor surface, it&apos;s just reported.

   About charsets, encodings and surfaces
       Charset  is a set of character entities while encoding is its representa&#8208;
       tion in the terms of bytes and bits.  In Enca, the  word  encoding  means
       the  same as `representation of text&apos;, i.e. the relation between sequence
       of character entities constituting the text and sequence of bytes  (bits)
       constituting the file.

       So,  encoding  is both character set and so-called surface (line termina&#8208;
       tors, byte order, combining, Base64 transformation, etc.).  Nevertheless,
       it  proves  convenient  to work with some {charset,surface} pairs as with
       genuine charsets.  So, as in recode(1), all UCS- and  UTF-  encodings  of
       Universal  character set are called charsets.  Please see recode documen&#8208;
       tation for more details of this issue.

       The only good thing about surfaces is: when you don&apos;t start playing  with
       them,  neither Enca won&apos;t start and it will try to behave as much as pos&#8208;
       sible as a surface-unaware program, even when talking to recode.

LANGUAGES
       Enca needs to know the language of input files to work reliably, at least
       in  case  of regular 8bit encoding.  Multibyte encodings should be recog&#8208;
       nised for any Latin, Cyrillic or Greek language.

       You can (or have to) use -L option to tell Enca the language.  Since peo&#8208;
       ple  most  often work with files in the same language for which they have
       configured locales, Enca tries tries to guess the language  by  examining
       value  of LC_CTYPE and other locale categories (please see locale(7)) and
       using it for the language when you don&apos;t specify any.  Of course, it  may
       be  completely  wrong  and will give you nonsense answers and damage your
       files, so please don&apos;t forget to use the -L option.   You  can  also  use
       ENCAOPT environment variable to set a default language (see section ENVI&#8208;
       RONMENT).

       Following languages are  supported  by  Enca  (each  language  is  listed
       together with supported 8bit encodings).

       The special language none can be shortened to __,  it  contains  no  8bit
       encodings, so only multibyte encodings are detected.

FEATURES
       Several  Enca&apos;s  features  depend on what is available on your system and
       how it was compiled.  You can get their list with

              enca --version

       Plus sign before a feature name means it&apos;s available,  minus  sign  means
       this build lacks the particular feature.

       librecode-interface.   Enca  has  interface to GNU recode library charset
       conversion functions.

       iconv-interface.  Enca has interface to UNIX98 iconv  charset  conversion
       functions.

       external-converter.   Enca  can  use external conversion programs (if you
       have some suitable installed).

       language-detection.  Enca tries to guess language (-L) from locales.  You
       don&apos;t need the --language option, at least in principle.

       locale-alias.   Enca  is able to decrypt locale aliases used for language
       names.

       target-charset-auto.  Enca tries to detect your  preferred  charset  from
       locales.   Option  --auto-convert  and  calling  Enca as enconv works, at
       least in principle.

       ENCAOPT.  Enca is able  to  correctly  parse  this  environment  variable
       before  command  line parameters.  Simple stuff like ENCAOPT=&quot;-L uk&quot; will
       work even without this feature.

ENVIRONMENT
       The variable ENCAOPT can hold set of default Enca options.   Its  content
       is  interpreted  before  command  line  arguments.   Unfortunately,  this
       doesn&apos;t work everywhere (must have +ENCAOPT feature).

       LC_CTYPE, LC_COLLATE, LC_MESSAGES  (possibly  inherited  from  LC_ALL  or
       LANG)  is  used for guessing your language (must have +language-detection
       feature).

       The variable DEFAULT_CHARSET can be used by enconv as the default  target
       charset.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Enca returns exit code 0 when all input files were successfully proceeded
       (i.e. all encodings  were  detected  and  all  files  were  converted  to
       required encoding, if conversion was asked for).  Exit code 1 is returned
       when Enca wasn&apos;t able to either guess encoding or perform  conversion  on
       any  input  file because it&apos;s not clever enough.  Exit code 2 is returned
       in case of serious (e.g. I/O) troubles.

SECURITY
       It should be possible to let Enca work unattended, it&apos;s  its  goal.  How&#8208;
       ever:

       There&apos;s  no  warranty  the detection works 100%. Don&apos;t bet on it, you can
       easily lose valuable data.

       Don&apos;t use enca (the program), link to libenca instead if  you  want  any&#8208;
       thing  resembling  security.  You have to perform the eventual conversion
       yourself then.

       Don&apos;t use external converters. Ideally, disable them compile-time.

       Be aware of ENCAOPT and  all  the  built-in  automagic  guessing  various
       things from environment, namely locales.

KNOWN BUGS
       It has too many unknown bugs.

       The  idea  of using LC_* value for language is certainly braindead.  How&#8208;
       ever I like it.

       It can&apos;t backup files before mangling them.

       In certain situations, it may behave incorrectly on &gt;31bit  file  systems
       and/or over NFS (both untested but shouldn&apos;t cause problems in practice).

       Built-in  converter  does  not  convert character `ch&apos; from KOI8-CS2, and
       possibly some other characters you&apos;ve probably never heard about anyway.

       EOL type recognition works  poorly  on  Quoted-printable  encoded  files.
       This should be fixed someday.

       There  are  no  command line options to tune libenca parameters.  This is
       intentional (Enca should DWIM) but sometimes this is a nuisance.

       The manual page is too long, especially this section.  This doesn&apos;t  mat&#8208;
       ter since nobody does read it.

TRIVIA
       Enca is Extremely Naive Charset Analyser.  Nevertheless, the `enc&apos; origi&#8208;
       nally comes from `encoding&apos; so the leading  `e&apos;  should  be  read  as  in
       `encoding&apos; not as in `extreme&apos;.
