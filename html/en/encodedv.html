ENCODE(1)                                                              ENCODE(1)



NAME
       encodedv - encode a series of images to a digital video stream

SYNOPSIS
       encodedv [ options ] video_pattern [ audio_input ]

DESCRIPTION
       encodedv  takes a series of images in PPM/PGM/video format and optionally
       an audio stream and compiles them into a DV-encoded video stream. pattern
       specifies  where the input data is located and may be either - for stdin,
       or a printf-style pattern taking one numeric argument that gets  replaced
       by  the current frame number.  Like image%03d.ppm, which gets expanded to
       image000.ppm, image001.ppm, etc.

       --version
              show encodedv version number.

       -s, --start-frame=count
              start encoding at frame number count (defaults to 0).

       -e, --end-frame=count
              end encoding at frame number count (defaults to unlimited).

       -l, --wrong-interlace
              flip lines to compensate for wrong interlacing in the input  data.
              Happened with mpeg2dec generated data.

       -p, --vlc-passes
              vlc code distribution passes (1-3) greater values = better quality
              but not necessarily slower encoding! This defaults for best  qual&#8208;
              ity = 3.

       -v, --verbose
              show encoder statistics / status information

       -i, --input=filter-name
              Choose  input-filter: [&gt;ppm&lt;, pgm, video] The ppm-filter only sup&#8208;
              ports raw rgb ppm files.  The pgm file format is the one generated
              by  mpeg2dec  of the livid project. ( http://linuxvideo.org ) This
              means: Y-data appended by U and V data which are scaled down by  2
              and  placed side by side. This option defaults to PPM. Some things
              you want to keep in mind:

              1) If you want to stream video frames (using video_pattern =  &quot;-&quot;)
              you have to make sure that there is no trailing garbage at the end
              of the pictures. This is ignored by most image  manipulation  pro&#8208;
              grams!

              2) If you are one of the poor persons with a buggy PCI bus-master&#8208;
              ing board be sure to have a backup handy if you want to use  video
              support.  Some  versions  of  the  VIA  board  chipsets crash your
              machine and even your harddisk. Since encodedv uses  full  resolu&#8208;
              tion  capturing it is more likely to trigger these bugs than other
              programs. If you have a VIA board you definitely want  to  upgrade
              to Linux 2.4.3 or higher.

              3)  The encoded pictures must have the correct resolution. If they
              don&apos;t, you may want to try ppmqscale. The  used  video  format  is
              chosen  by picture resolution. Use 720x576 for PAL and 720x480 for
              NTSC.

              4) If you want to speed up things a little bit and you are  gener&#8208;
              ating  the  input pictures automatically you may want to try pgm&apos;s
              instead of ppm&apos;s since they are encoded somewhat faster. But  keep
              in  mind,  that this pgm format is only optimal for PAL since NTSC
              averages the U and V values somewhat differently.

       -a, --audio-input=filter-name
              Choose audio-input-filter: [&gt;none&lt;, wav, dsp]

       -o, --output=filter-name
              Choose output-filter: [&gt;raw&lt;]

       -q, --static-qno=table-no
              Static qno tables for quantisation on 2  VLC  passes.   For  turbo
              (but  somewhat  lossy  encoding) try -q [1,2] -p [2,3].  There are
              only two static qno tables registered right now:

              1 : for sharp DV pictures

              2 : for somewhat noisy satelite television signal

              If you want to add some more, go ahead ;-)

       -f, --fps=fps-number
              Set frames per second (default: use all frames)

       -d, --force-dct=dct-mode
              Force dct mode (88 or 248) for whole picture
