       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.  -fps Display  the  current
               frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT

               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

BUGS
       It&apos;s not unknown for this and other OpenGL hacks to fail  under  hardware
       accelaration  (UtahGLX)  and take the X server with them.  Texture images
       must be 16x16 or 32x32 or 64x64 etc.
