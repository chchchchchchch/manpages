ENVIRON(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 ENVIRON(7)



NAME
       environ - user environment

SYNOPSIS
       extern char **environ;

DESCRIPTION
       The variable environ points to an array of pointers to strings called the
       &quot;environment&quot;.  The last pointer in this array has the value NULL.  (This
       variable  must  be  declared  in the user program, but is declared in the
       header file &lt;unistd.h&gt; in case the header files came from libc4 or libc5,
       and  in  case  they  came  from glibc and _GNU_SOURCE was defined.)  This
       array of strings is made available to the process  by  the  exec(3)  call
       that started the process.

       By  convention the strings in environ have the form &quot;name=value&quot;.  Common
       examples are:

       USER   The name of the logged-in user  (used  by  some  BSD-derived  pro&#8208;
              grams).

       LOGNAME
              The name of the logged-in user (used by some System-V derived pro&#8208;
              grams).

       HOME   A user&apos;s login directory, set by login(1) from the  password  file
              passwd(5).

       LANG   The  name  of a locale to use for locale categories when not over&#8208;
              ridden by LC_ALL  or  more  specific  environment  variables  like
              LC_COLLATE,   LC_CTYPE,   LC_MESSAGES,   LC_MONETARY,  LC_NUMERIC,
              LC_TIME, cf.  locale(5).

       PATH   The sequence of directory prefixes that sh(1) and many other  pro&#8208;
              grams  apply  in searching for a file known by an incomplete path&#8208;
              name.  The prefixes are separated  by  &apos;:&apos;.   (Similarly  one  has
              CDPATH  used  by some shells to find the target of a change direc&#8208;
              tory command, MANPATH used by man(1) to find manual pages, and  so
              on)

       PWD    The current working directory.  Set by some shells.

       SHELL  The pathname of the user&apos;s login shell.

       TERM   The terminal type for which output is to be prepared.

       PAGER  The user&apos;s preferred utility to display text files.

       EDITOR/VISUAL
              The user&apos;s preferred utility to edit text files.

       Further  names may be placed in the environment by the export command and
       &quot;name=value&quot; in sh(1), or by the setenv command if you use csh(1).  Argu&#8208;
       ments  may  also be placed in the environment at the point of an exec(3).
       A C program can manipulate its environment using the functions getenv(3),
       putenv(3), setenv(3), and unsetenv(3).

       Note  that  the  behavior of many programs and library routines is influ&#8208;
       enced by the presence or value of certain environment variables.  A  ran&#8208;
       dom collection:

       The variables LANG, LANGUAGE, NLSPATH, LOCPATH, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, etc.
       influence locale handling, cf.  locale(5).

       TMPDIR influences the path prefix of names created by tmpnam(3) and other
       routines,  the  temporary  directory  used by sort(1) and other programs,
       etc.

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD and other LD_* variables influence the behav&#8208;
       ior of the dynamic loader/linker.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT  makes  certain  programs and library routines follow the
       prescriptions of POSIX.

       The behavior of malloc(3) is influenced by MALLOC_* variables.

       The variable HOSTALIASES gives the name of a file containing  aliases  to
       be used with gethostbyname(3).

       TZ  and TZDIR give timezone information used by tzset(3) and through that
       by functions like ctime(3), localtime(3),  mktime(3),  strftime(3).   See
       also tzselect(8).

       TERMCAP  gives  information  on how to address a given terminal (or gives
       the name of a file containing such information).

       COLUMNS and LINES tell applications about the window size, possibly over&#8208;
       riding the actual size.

       PRINTER or LPDEST may specify the desired printer to use.  See lpr(1).

       Etc.

BUGS
       Clearly  there  is  a security risk here.  Many a system command has been
       tricked into mischief by a user who specified unusual values for  IFS  or
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       There  is  also the risk of name space pollution.  Programs like make and
       autoconf allow overriding of default utility names from  the  environment
       with  similarly  named variables in all caps.  Thus one uses CC to select
       the desired C compiler (and similarly MAKE, AR,  AS,  FC,  LD,  LEX,  RM,
       YACC, etc.).  However, in some traditional uses such an environment vari&#8208;
       able gives options for the program instead of a pathname.  Thus, one  has
       MORE,  LESS,  and  GZIP.   Such  usage  is considered mistaken, and to be
       avoided in new programs.  The authors of gzip  should  consider  renaming
       their option to GZIP_OPT.
