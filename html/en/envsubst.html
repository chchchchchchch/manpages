ENVSUBST(1)                            GNU                           ENVSUBST(1)



NAME
       envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format strings

SYNOPSIS
       envsubst [OPTION] [SHELL-FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
       Substitutes the values of environment variables.

   Operation mode:
       -v, --variables
              output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       In  normal  operation  mode, standard input is copied to standard output,
       with references to environment variables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARI&#8208;
       ABLE} being replaced with the corresponding values.  If a SHELL-FORMAT is
       given, only those environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FOR&#8208;
       MAT  are  substituted;  otherwise  all  environment  variables references
       occurring in standard input are substituted.

       When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and the output  con&#8208;
       sists  of  the environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT,
       one per line.
