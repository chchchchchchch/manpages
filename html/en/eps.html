NAME
       eps -  Encapsulated PostScript canvas item.

SYNOPSIS
       canvas create eps x y ?option value?...
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  eps  canvas  item  lets you place encapsulated PostScript (EPS) on a
       canvas, controlling its size and placement.  The EPS  item  is  displayed
       either  as  a  solid  rectangle or a preview image.  The preview image is
       designated in one of two ways: 1) the EPS file contains an ASCII hexadec&#8208;
       imal  preview,  or  2) a Tk photo image.  When the canvas generates Post&#8208;
       Script output, the EPS will be inserted with the proper  translation  and
       scaling  to match that of the EPS item. So can use the canvas widget as a
       page layout tool.

EXAMPLE
       Let&apos;s say you have for PostScript files of four graphs which you want  to
       tile  two-by-two  on  a  single  page.   Maybe you&apos;d like to annotate the
       graphs by putting a caption at the bottom of each graph.

       Normally, you would have to resort to an external tool or write your  own
       PostScript  program.   The  eps canvas item lets you do this through Tk&apos;s
       canvas widget.  An eps item displays an image (or rectangle) representing
       the  encapsulated PostScript file.  It also scales and translates the EPS
       file when the canvas is printed.


SYNTAX
       canvas create eps x y ?option value?...  The eps item creates a new  can&#8208;
       vas item. Canvas is the name of a canvas widget.  You must supply the X-Y
       coordinate of the new eps item.  How the  coordinate  is  exactly  inter&#8208;
       preted is controlled by the -anchor option (see below).

       Additional  options  may  be  specified  on the command line to configure
       aspects of the eps item such as its color, stipple, and font.   The  fol&#8208;
       lowing option and value pairs are valid.

       -anchor anchor
              Tells how to position the EPS item relative to its X-Y coordinate.
              The default is center.

       -background color
              Sets the background color of the EPS rectangle.

       -borderwidth pixels
              Sets the width of the 3-D border around the outside  edge  of  the
              item.  The -relief option determines if the border is to be drawn.
              The default is 0.

       -file fileName
              Specifies the name of the EPS file.  The first line of an EPS file
              must  start with &quot;%!PS&quot; and contain a &quot;EPS&quot; version specification.
              The other requirement is that there be  a  &quot;%%BoundingBox:&quot;  entry
              which  contains  four  integers  representing  the  lower-left and
              upper-right coordinates of the area bounding the EPS.  The default
              is &quot;&quot;.

       -font fontName
              Specifies  the font of the title. The default is *-Helvetica-Bold-
              R-Normal-*-18-180-*.

       -foreground color
              Specifies the foreground color of the EPS rectangle.   The  option
              matters  only  when  the  -stipple  option is set.  The default is
              white.

       -height pixels
              Specifies the height EPS item.  If pixels is 0, then the height is
              determined  from  the  PostScript  &quot;BoundingBox:&quot; entry in the EPS
              file.  The default is 0.

       -image photo
              Specifies the name of a Tk photo image to be displayed as  in  the
              item as a preview image.  This option overrides any preview speci&#8208;
              fication found in the EPS file.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -justify justify
              Specifies how the title should be justified.   This  matters  only
              when  the  title contains more than one line of text. Justify must
              be left, right, or center.  The default is center.

       -relief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect for the EPS item.  Relief  specifies  how
              the  item  should  appear  relative to canvas; for example, raised
              means the item should appear to protrude.  The default is flat.

       -shadowcolor color
              Specifies the color of the drop shadow used for  the  title.   The
              option  with the -shadowoffset option control how the title&apos;s drop
              shadow appears.  The default is grey.

       -shadowoffset pixels
              Specifies the offset of the drop shadow from the title&apos;s text.  If
              pixels is 0, no shadow will be seen.  The default is 0.

       -showimage boolean
              Indicates whether to display the image preview (if one exists), or
              a simple rectangle.  The default is yes.

       -stipple bitmap
              Specifies a bitmap to used to stipple the  rectangle  representing
              the EPS item.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -title string
              Sets  the  title of the EPS item.  If string is &quot;&quot;, then the title
              specified by the PostScript &quot;Title:&quot; entry is used.  You  can  set
              the string a single space to display no title.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -titleanchor anchor
              Tells  how  to position the title within EPS item.  The default is
              n.

       -titlecolor color
              Specifies the color of the title.  The default is white.

       -titlerotate degrees
              Sets the rotation of the title.  Degrees is a real  number  repre&#8208;
              senting  the  angle  of  rotation.   The title is first rotated in
              space and then placed according to the -titleanchor position.  The
              default rotation is 0.0.

       -width pixels
              Specifies  the  width EPS item.  If pixels is 0, then the width is
              determined from the PostScript &quot;BoundingBox:&quot;  entry  in  the  EPS
              file.  The default is 0.  5i.
