PS2PS(1)                        Ghostscript Tools                       PS2PS(1)



NAME
       ps2ps, eps2eps - Ghostscript PostScript &quot;distiller&quot;

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ps [ options ] input.ps output.ps
       eps2eps [ options ] input.eps output.eps

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps  uses  gs(1)  to convert PostScript(tm) file &quot;input.ps&quot; to simpler,
       normalized and (usually) faster PostScript in &quot;output.ps&quot;.  Normally  the
       output  is  allowed  to use PostScript Level 2 or Level 3 constructs, but
       the -dLanguageLevel=1 option restricts the output to Level 1.

       eps2eps performs the equivalent optimization for Encapsulated  PostScript
       (EPS) files.

       Both  accept  any  general  Ghostscript command line options, and respec&#8208;
       tively options specific to the pswrite and epswrite devices.

FILES
       Run &quot;gs -h&quot; to find the location of  Ghostscript  documentation  on  your
       system, from which you can get more details.

BUGS
       The  pswrite  device  used  by both ps2ps and eps2eps produces much lower
       level output than is desirable. Use with caution.
