NAME
       epub-fix - part of calibre

SYNOPSIS
       epub-fix  [options] file.epub

DESCRIPTION
       Fix  common  problems in EPUB files that can cause them to be rejected by
       poorly designed publishing services.

       By default, no fixing is done and messages are printed out for each error
       detected.  Use  the  options  to  control  which errors are automatically
       fixed.

       Whenever you pass arguments to epub-fix that have spaces in them, enclose
       the arguments in quotation marks.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program&apos;s version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --unmanifested
              Fix  unmanifested files. epub-fix can either add them to the mani&#8208;
              fest or delete  them  as  specified  by  the  delete  unmanifested
              option.

       --delete-unmanifested
              Delete unmanifested files instead of adding them to the manifest

       --epubcheck
              Workarounds for bugs in the latest release of epubcheck. epubcheck
              reports many things as errors that are not actually errors.  epub-
              fix will try to detect these and replace them with constructs that
              epubcheck likes. This may cause significant changes to your  epub,
              complain to the epubcheck project.
