EQUIVS-BUILD(1)                    Debian/GNU                    EQUIVS-BUILD(1)



NAME
       equivs-build - make a Debian package to register local software

SYNOPSIS
       equivs-build [--full|-f] [--arch=foo|-a=foo] controlfile

DESCRIPTION
       equivs-build is a program that creates Debian packages which can be used
       to inform dpkg about locally installed packages and their dependencies.
       Also empty packages that just require other packages can be created with
       equivs. These can be used as &quot;profile&quot; packages which just mark other
       ones for installation.

       Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used, it might
       possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please note as well that
       using it is not the recommended way of dealing with broken dependencies.
       Better file a bug report instead.

       The control file has a structure like the control files in &quot;real&quot; Debian
       packages, but it doesn&apos;t have to define all keys, as default values will
       be used if you omit one.

       There are several additional fields that can be used:

       Changelog:
           File to be used as the changelog

       Version:
           If you don&apos;t use a local changelog, equivs will create a dummy one.
           As the version of the package is defined in the changelog, equivs
           will assume the version 1.0. With this field, you can set an explicit
           version.

       Readme:
           A file to be used as the README.Debian file. You can use the strings
           @packagename@ and @depends@ to insert the package name and the
           dependency information used.

       Copyright:
           The copyright file to by used. If omitted, the GPL 2 will be used.

       Preinst: Postinst: Prerm: Postrm:
           Maintainerscripts executed before/after installation/removal of the
           package. See the Debian developers reference for a description
           (package developers-reference).

       Extra-Files:
           A comma-separated list of files to copy to the
           /usr/share/doc/packagename directory.

       Files:
           Files to be copied into some directory of the created package.  Each
           line contains a source filename and a destination directory, space-
           separated.  As with other multi-line headers, all lines but the first
           must be indented.  Example:

             Files: foo-cron /etc/cron.d/
              foo-cron-helper /usr/local/bin/

       File:
           Files to be copied into some directory of the created package,
           specified inline in the source control file. The field syntax is the
           name of the files to be created, followed by lines indented by 1
           space denoting file content; leading space will be trimmed.  An octal
           file mode may be specified after the filename; it defaults to 644,
           and will be normalised to 644 or 755.  Example:

             File: /usr/local/bin/true 755
              #!/bin/sh
              exit 0

       See /usr/share/doc/equivs/README.Debian for more information.

OPTIONS
       --full | -f
           Do a complete build. debuild will be called, that is, a full package
           will be built and signed, suitable for upload to the Debian servers.

           The ID used to signed is taken from, in that order, the user from the
           last entry of a supplied changelog, the Maintainer: field in the
           equivs control file, or the local username.

       --arch | -a
           Build package for the specified architecture. Used e.g. for building
           packages for hurd under linux. equivs-build uses dpkg-architecture to
           provide this facility.

DISTRIBUTION
       Distribution is subject to the GNU public licence version 2.
