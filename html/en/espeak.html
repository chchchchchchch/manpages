ESPEAK(1)                                                              ESPEAK(1)



NAME
       espeak - A multi-lingual software speech synthesizer.

SYNOPSIS
       espeak [options] [&lt;words&gt;]

DESCRIPTION
       espeak  is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other lan&#8208;
       guages.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -f &lt;text file&gt;
              Text file to speak

       --stdin
              Read text input from stdin instead of a file

       If neither -f nor --stdin, &lt;words&gt; are spoken, or if none  then  text  is
       spoken from stdin, each line separately.

       -q     Quiet, don&apos;t produce any speech (may be useful with -x)

       -a &lt;integer&gt;
              Amplitude, 0 to 20, default is 10

       -l &lt;integer&gt;
              Line  length.  If  not zero (which is the default), consider lines
              less than this length as and-of-clause

       -p &lt;integer&gt;
              Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50

       -s &lt;integer&gt;
              Speed in words per minute, default is 160

       -v &lt;voice name&gt;
              Use voice file of this name from espeak-data/voices

       -b     Input text encoding, 1=UTF8, 2=8 bit, 4=16 bit

       -b     Input text encoding, 1=UTF8, 2=8 bit, 4=16 bit

       -m     Indicates that the text contains  SSML  (Speech  Synthesis  Markup
              Language)  tags  or other XML tags. Those SSML tags which are sup&#8208;
              ported are interpreted. Other tags, including HTML,  are  ignored,
              except  that  some  HTML  tags such as &lt;hr&gt; &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;li&gt; ensure a
              break in the speech.

       -w &lt;wave file name&gt;
              Write output to this WAV file, rather than speaking it directly

       -x     Write phoneme mnemonics to stdout

       -X     Write phonemes mnemonics and translation trace to stdout. If rules
              files have been built with --compile=debug, line numbers will also
              be displayed.

       --stdout
              Write speech output to stdout
&#12;       --compile=&lt;voice name&gt;
              Compile the pronunciation rules  and  dictionary  in  the  current
              directory. =&lt;voice name&gt; is optional and specifies which language

       --path=&lt;path&gt;
              Specifies the directory containing the espeak-data directory

       --phonout=&lt;filename&gt;
              Write  output  from -x -X commands and mbrola phoneme data to this
              file

       --punct=&quot;&lt;characters&gt;&quot;
              Speak the names of  punctuation  characters  during  speaking.  If
              =&lt;characters&gt; is omitted, all punctuation is spoken.

       -k &lt;integer&gt;
              Indicate  capital  letters  with:  1=sound, 2=the word &quot;capitals&quot;,
              higher values = a pitch increase (try -k20).

       --voices[=&lt;language code&gt;]
              Lists the available voices. If =&lt;language code&gt;  is  present  then
              only those voices which are suitable for that language are listed.

       --compile=voicename
              Compile  the  pronunciation  rules  and  dictionary in the current
              directory. =&lt;voice name&gt; is optional and specifies which language

       --compile=debug
              Compile the pronunciation rules  and  dictionary  in  the  current
              directory  as above, but include line numbers, that get shown when
              -X is used.
