NAME
       etext, edata, end - end of program segments

SYNOPSIS
       extern etext;
       extern edata;
       extern end;

DESCRIPTION
       The  addresses  of these symbols indicate the end of various program seg&#8208;
       ments:

       etext  This is the first address past the end of the  text  segment  (the
              program code).

       edata  This  is  the  first  address past the end of the initialized data
              segment.

       end    This is the first address past the end of the  uninitialized  data
              segment (also known as the BSS segment).

CONFORMING TO
       Although these symbols have long been provided on most UNIX systems, they
       are not standardized; use with caution.

NOTES
       The program must explicitly declare these symbols; they are  not  defined
       in any header file.

       On  some  systems the names of these symbols are preceded by underscores,
       thus: _etext, _edata, and _end.  These symbols are also defined for  pro&#8208;
       grams compiled on Linux.

       At  the  start  of program execution, the program break will be somewhere
       near &amp;end (perhaps at the start of the  following  page).   However,  the
       break  will  change  as memory is allocated via brk(2) or malloc(3).  Use
       sbrk(2) with an argument of zero to find the current value of the program
       break.

EXAMPLE
       When run, the program below produces output such as the following:

           $ ./a.out
           First address past:
               program text (etext)       0x8048568
               initialized data (edata)   0x804a01c
               uninitialized data (end)   0x804a024

   Program source

       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       extern char etext, edata, end; /* The symbols must have some type,
                                          or &quot;gcc -Wall&quot; complains */

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           printf(&quot;First address past:\n&quot;);
           printf(&quot;    program text (etext)      %10p\n&quot;, &amp;etext);
           printf(&quot;    initialized data (edata)  %10p\n&quot;, &amp;edata);
           printf(&quot;    uninitialized data (end)  %10p\n&quot;, &amp;end);

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
