NAME
       ethers - Ethernet address to IP number database

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/ethers contains 48 bit Ethernet addresses and their corresponding IP
       numbers, one line for each IP number:

              Ethernet-address  IP-number

       The two items are separated by any number of SPACE and/or TAB characters.
       A  # at the beginning of a line starts a comment which extends to the end
       of the line.  The Ethernet-address is written as x:x:x:x:x:x, where x  is
       a  hexadecimal  number  between 0 and ff which represents one byte of the
       address, which is in network byte order (big-endian).  The IP-number  may
       be a hostname which can be resolved by DNS or a dot separated number.

       08:00:20:00:61:CA  pal
