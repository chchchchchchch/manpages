DESCRIPTION
       evdev  is  an  Xorg  input  driver for Linux&#180;s generic event devices.  It
       therefore supports all input devices that the kernel knows about, includ&#8208;
       ing most mice, keyboards, tablets and touchscreens.  evdev is the default
       driver on the major Linux distributions.

       The evdev driver can serve as both a pointer and a keyboard input device.
       Multiple  input  devices  are  supported  by  multiple  instances of this
       driver, with one InputDevice section of your  xorg.conf  for  each  input
       device that will use this driver.

       It  is  recommended  that evdev devices are configured through the Input&#8208;
       Class directive (refer to xorg.conf(5)) instead of manual per-device con&#8208;
       figuration. Devices configured in the xorg.conf(5) are not hot-plug capa&#8208;
       ble.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       In general, any input device that the kernel has  a  driver  for  can  be
       accessed  through  the  evdev driver.  See the Linux kernel documentation
       for a complete list.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration  details  and  for
       options  that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only cov&#8208;
       ers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;ButtonMapping&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Sets the button mapping for this device. The mapping is  a  space-
              separated  list of button mappings that correspond in order to the
              physical buttons on the device (i.e. the first number is the  map&#8208;
              ping for button 1, etc.). The default mapping is &quot;1 2 3 ... 32&quot;. A
              mapping of 0 deactivates the button. Multiple buttons can have the
              same  mapping.   For example, a left-handed mouse with deactivated
              scroll-wheel would use a mapping of &quot;3 2 1 0 0&quot;. Invalid  mappings
              are ignored and the default mapping is used. Buttons not specified
              in the user&apos;s mapping use the default mapping.

       Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Specifies the device through which the  device  can  be  accessed.
              This will generally be of the form &quot;/dev/input/eventX&quot;, where X is
              some integer.  The mapping from device node to hardware is system-
              dependent. Property: &quot;Device Node&quot; (read-only).

       Option &quot;DragLockButtons&quot; &quot;L1 B2 L3 B4&quot;
              Sets  &quot;drag  lock buttons&quot; that simulate holding a button down, so
              that low dexterity people do not have to hold a button down at the
              same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur in pairs,
              with the lock button number occurring first, followed by the  but&#8208;
              ton number that is the target of the lock button. Property: &quot;Evdev
              Drag Lock Buttons&quot;.

       Option &quot;DragLockButtons&quot; &quot;M1&quot;
              Sets a &quot;master drag lock button&quot; that acts as a &quot;Meta  Key&quot;  indi&#8208;
              cating  that the next button pressed is to be &quot;drag locked&quot;. Prop&#8208;
              erty: &quot;Evdev Drag Lock Buttons&quot;.


       Option &quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable/disable the emulation of the  third  (middle)  mouse
              button  for mice which only have two physical buttons.  The
              third button is emulated by pressing both buttons  simulta&#8208;
              neously.  Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Middle Button Emu&#8208;
              lation&quot;.

       Option &quot;Emulate3Timeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) that  the  driver  waits
              before  deciding  if  two buttons where pressed &quot;simultane&#8208;
              ously&quot; when 3 button emulation is  enabled.   Default:  50.
              Property: &quot;Evdev Middle Button Timeout&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateWheel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable/disable  &quot;wheel&quot;  emulation.   Wheel emulation means
              emulating button press/release events  when  the  mouse  is
              moved  while a specific real button is pressed.  Wheel but&#8208;
              ton events (typically buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for
              scrolling.   Wheel  emulation  is useful for getting wheel-
              like behaviour with trackballs.  It can also be useful  for
              mice with 4 or more buttons but no wheel.  See the descrip&#8208;
              tion of the EmulateWheelButton,  EmulateWheelInertia,  Emu&#8208;
              lateWheelTimeout,  XAxisMapping,  and YAxisMapping options.
              Default: off. Property &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateWheelButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies which button must be held down  to  enable  wheel
              emulation  mode.   While  this  button  is down, X and/or Y
              pointer movement will generate button press/release  events
              as  specified  for  the  XAxisMapping and YAxisMapping set&#8208;
              tings. If the button is  0  and  EmulateWheel  is  on,  any
              motion  of  the  device  is  converted  into  wheel events.
              Default: 4.  Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Button&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateWheelInertia&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies how far (in pixels) the pointer must move to gen&#8208;
              erate  button press/release events in wheel emulation mode.
              Default: 10. Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Inertia&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateWheelTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies the time in milliseconds  the  EmulateWheelButton
              must  be  pressed before wheel emulation is started. If the
              EmulateWheelButton is released  before  this  timeout,  the
              original button press/release event is sent.  Default: 200.
              Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateThirdButton&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable third button emulation. Third button emulation emits
              a  right  button event (by default) by pressing and holding
              the first button. The first button must be  held  down  for
              the configured timeout and must not move more than the con&#8208;
              figured threshold for the emulation to activate. Otherwise,
              the  first  button event is posted as normal. Default: off.
              Property: &quot;Evdev Third Button Emulation&quot;.
&#12;       Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies the timeout in milliseconds between  the  initial
              button  press  and  the  generation  of the emulated button
              event.  Default: 1000. Property: &quot;Evdev Third Button Emula&#8208;
              tion Timeout&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonButton&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies the physical button number to be emitted if third
              button emulation  is  triggered.   Default:  3.   Property:
              &quot;Evdev Third Button Button&quot;.

       Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Specifies  the  maximum move fuzz in device coordinates for
              third button emulation. If the device moves  by  more  than
              this  threshold  before the third button emulation is trig&#8208;
              gered, the emulation is cancelled and a first button  event
              is  generated  as  normal.   Default:  20. Property: &quot;Evdev
              Third Button Emulation Threshold&quot;.

       Option &quot;GrabDevice&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force a grab on the event device. Doing so will ensure that
              no  other driver can initialise the same device and it will
              also stop the device from sending  events  to  /dev/kbd  or
              /dev/input/mice.  Events  from this device will not be sent
              to virtual devices (e.g. rfkill or the Macintosh mouse but&#8208;
              ton emulation).  Default: disabled.

       Option &quot;InvertX&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;

       Option &quot;InvertY&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;
              Invert  the given axis. Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Axis
              Inversion&quot;.

       Option &quot;IgnoreRelativeAxes&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;

       Option &quot;IgnoreAbsoluteAxes&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;
              Ignore the specified type of axis. Default:  unset.  The  X
              server cannot deal with devices that have both relative and
              absolute axes. Evdev tries to guess  wich  axes  to  ignore
              given  the  device type and disables absolute axes for mice
              and relative axes for tablets, touchscreens  and  touchpad.
              These options allow to forcibly disable an axis type. Mouse
              wheel axes are exempt and will work even if  relative  axes
              are ignored. No property, this configuration must be set in
              the configuration.
              If either option is set  to  False,  the  driver  will  not
              ignore  the  specified  axes  regardless of the presence of
              other axes. This may trigger buggy behavior and events from
              this  axis are always forwarded. Users are discouraged from
              setting this option.

       Option &quot;Calibration&quot; &quot;min-x max-x min-y max-y&quot;
              Calibrates the X and Y axes for devices that need to  scale
              to  a  different  coordinate  system than reported to the X
              server. This feature is required for devices that  need  to
              scale  to  a  different  coordinate  system than originally
              reported by the kernel (e.g. touchscreens). The scaling  to
              the  custom  coordinate  system is done in-driver and the X
              server is unaware of the transformation.  Property:  &quot;Evdev
              Axis Calibration&quot;.

       Option &quot;Mode&quot; &quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot;
              Sets  the  mode  of the device if device has absolute axes.
              The default value for  touchpads  is  relative,  for  other
              absolute.   This  option  has  no effect on devices without
              absolute axes.

       Option &quot;SwapAxes&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;
              Swap x/y axes. Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Axes Swap&quot;.

       Option &quot;XAxisMapping&quot; &quot;N1 N2&quot;
              Specifies which buttons are  mapped  to  motion  in  the  X
              direction  in  wheel  emulation  mode.  Button number N1 is
              mapped to the negative X axis motion and button  number  N2
              is  mapped to the positive X axis motion.  Default: no map&#8208;
              ping. Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes&quot;.

       Option &quot;YAxisMapping&quot; &quot;N1 N2&quot;
              Specifies which buttons are  mapped  to  motion  in  the  Y
              direction  in  wheel  emulation  mode.  Button number N1 is
              mapped to the negative Y axis motion and button  number  N2
              is  mapped  to the positive Y axis motion.  Default: &quot;4 5&quot;.
              Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes&quot;.
