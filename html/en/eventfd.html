EVENTFD(2)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 EVENTFD(2)



NAME
       eventfd - create a file descriptor for event notification

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/eventfd.h&gt;

       int eventfd(unsigned int initval, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       eventfd()  creates  an  &quot;eventfd  object&quot;  that  can  be used as an event
       wait/notify mechanism by user-space applications, and by  the  kernel  to
       notify  user-space  applications  of  events.   The  object  contains  an
       unsigned 64-bit integer (uint64_t) counter that is maintained by the ker&#8208;
       nel.   This  counter is initialized with the value specified in the argu&#8208;
       ment initval.

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the behaviour
       of eventfd():

       EFD_CLOEXEC (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set  the  close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descrip&#8208;
              tor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC  flag  in  open(2)  for
              reasons why this may be useful.

       EFD_NONBLOCK (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set  the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file descrip&#8208;
              tion.  Using this flag saves extra calls to  fcntl(2)  to  achieve
              the same result.

       EFD_SEMAPHORE (since Linux 2.6.30)
              Provide  semaphore-like  semantics  for  reads  from  the new file
              descriptor.  See below.

       In Linux up to version 2.6.26, the flags argument is unused, and must  be
       specified as zero.

       As  its return value, eventfd() returns a new file descriptor that can be
       used to refer to the eventfd object.  The  following  operations  can  be
       performed on the file descriptor:

       read(2)
              Each successful read(2) returns an 8-byte integer.  A read(2) will
              fail with the error EINVAL if the size of the supplied  buffer  is
              less than 8 bytes.

              The  value  returned  by  read(2) is in host byte order, i.e., the
              native byte order for integers on the host machine.

              The semantics of read(2) depend on  whether  the  eventfd  counter
              currently  has  a nonzero value and whether the EFD_SEMAPHORE flag
              was specified when creating the eventfd file descriptor:

              *  If EFD_SEMAPHORE was not specified and the eventfd counter  has
                 a nonzero value, then a read(2) returns 8 bytes containing that
                 value, and the counter&apos;s value is reset to zero.

              *  If EFD_SEMAPHORE was specified and the eventfd  counter  has  a
                 nonzero  value,  then  a read(2) returns 8 bytes containing the
                 value 1, and the counter&apos;s value is decremented by 1.

              *  If the eventfd counter is zero at  the  time  of  the  call  to
                 read(2),  then the call either blocks until the counter becomes
                 nonzero (at which  time,  the  read(2)  proceeds  as  described
                 above)  or  fails  with the error EAGAIN if the file descriptor
                 has been made nonblocking.

       write(2)
              A write(2) call adds the 8-byte integer value supplied in its buf&#8208;
              fer  to  the counter.  The maximum value that may be stored in the
              counter is the  largest  unsigned  64-bit  value  minus  1  (i.e.,
              0xfffffffffffffffe).   If  the  addition would cause the counter&apos;s
              value to exceed the maximum, then the write(2) either blocks until
              a  read(2)  is performed on the file descriptor, or fails with the
              error EAGAIN if the file descriptor has been made nonblocking.

              A write(2) will fail with the error EINVAL if the size of the sup&#8208;
              plied  buffer  is  less  than 8 bytes, or if an attempt is made to
              write the value 0xffffffffffffffff.

       poll(2), select(2) (and similar)
              The returned file descriptor  supports  poll(2)  (and  analogously
              epoll(7)) and select(2), as follows:

              *  The  file  descriptor  is readable (the select(2) readfds argu&#8208;
                 ment; the poll(2) POLLIN flag)  if  the  counter  has  a  value
                 greater than 0.

              *  The  file  descriptor is writable (the select(2) writefds argu&#8208;
                 ment; the poll(2) POLLOUT flag) if it is possible  to  write  a
                 value of at least &quot;1&quot; without blocking.

              *  If  an  overflow  of  the  counter  value  was  detected,  then
                 select(2) indicates the file descriptor as being both  readable
                 and  writable,  and  poll(2) returns a POLLERR event.  As noted
                 above, write(2) can never overflow  the  counter.   However  an
                 overflow  can  occur  if  2^64 eventfd &quot;signal posts&quot; were per&#8208;
                 formed by the KAIO subsystem (theoretically possible, but prac&#8208;
                 tically  unlikely).   If an overflow has occurred, then read(2)
                 will   return    that    maximum    uint64_t    value    (i.e.,
                 0xffffffffffffffff).

              The  eventfd file descriptor also supports the other file-descrip&#8208;
              tor multiplexing APIs: pselect(2), ppoll(2), and epoll(7).

       close(2)
              When the file descriptor  is  no  longer  required  it  should  be
              closed.   When  all  file  descriptors  associated  with  the same
              eventfd object have been closed,  the  resources  for  object  are
              freed by the kernel.

       A  copy  of  the file descriptor created by eventfd() is inherited by the
       child produced by fork(2).  The duplicate file descriptor  is  associated
       with  the same eventfd object.  File descriptors created by eventfd() are
       preserved across execve(2), unless the close-on-exec flag has been set.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, eventfd() returns a new eventfd file descriptor.   On  error,
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An unsupported value was specified in flags.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The  system-wide  limit on the total number of open files has been
              reached.

       ENODEV Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.
&#12;       ENOMEM There was  insufficient  memory  to  create  a  new  eventfd  file
              descriptor.

VERSIONS
       eventfd()  is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.22.  Working support is
       provided in glibc since version 2.8.  The  eventfd2()  system  call  (see
       NOTES) is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.27.  Since version 2.9, the
       glibc eventfd() wrapper will employ the eventfd2() system call, if it  is
       supported by the kernel.

CONFORMING TO
       eventfd() and eventfd2() are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Applications  can  use  an eventfd file descriptor instead of a pipe (see
       pipe(2)) in all cases where a pipe is used simply to signal events.   The
       kernel  overhead of an eventfd file descriptor is much lower than that of
       a pipe, and only one file descriptor is required (versus the two required
       for a pipe).

       When  used in the kernel, an eventfd file descriptor can provide a bridge
       from kernel to user space, allowing, for  example,  functionalities  like
       KAIO  (kernel  AIO) to signal to a file descriptor that some operation is
       complete.

       A key point about an eventfd file descriptor is that it can be  monitored
       just  like  any  other  file  descriptor  using  select(2),  poll(2),  or
       epoll(7).  This means that an application can simultaneously monitor  the
       readiness of &quot;traditional&quot; files and the readiness of other kernel mecha&#8208;
       nisms that support the eventfd interface.  (Without the eventfd()  inter&#8208;
       face,  these  mechanisms could not be multiplexed via select(2), poll(2),
       or epoll(7).)

   Underlying Linux system calls
       There are two underlying Linux  system  calls:  eventfd()  and  the  more
       recent  eventfd2().   The  former  system call does not implement a flags
       argument.  The latter system call implements the flags  values  described
       above.  The glibc wrapper function will use eventfd2() where it is avail&#8208;
       able.

   Additional glibc features
       The GNU C library defines an additional  type,  and  two  functions  that
       attempt  to  abstract  some  of  the details of reading and writing on an
       eventfd file descriptor:

           typedef uint64_t eventfd_t;

           int eventfd_read(int fd, eventfd_t *value);
           int eventfd_write(int fd, eventfd_t value);

       The functions perform the read and write operations on  an  eventfd  file
       descriptor,  returning  0 if the correct number of bytes was transferred,
       or -1 otherwise.

EXAMPLE
       The following program creates an eventfd file descriptor and  then  forks
       to  create  a  child process.  While the parent briefly sleeps, the child
       writes each of the integers supplied in the program&apos;s command-line  argu&#8208;
       ments  to  the  eventfd  file  descriptor.   When the parent has finished
       sleeping, it reads from the eventfd file descriptor.

       The following shell session shows a sample run of the program:

           $ ./a.out 1 2 4 7 14
           Child writing 1 to efd
           Child writing 2 to efd
           Child writing 4 to efd
           Child writing 7 to efd
           Child writing 14 to efd
           Child completed write loop
           Parent about to read
           Parent read 28 (0x1c) from efd
