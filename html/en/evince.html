DESCRIPTION
       evince

       Evince is a document viewer capable of  displaying  multiple  and  single
       page document formats like PDF and Postscript.  For more general informa&#8208;
       tion     about     Evince     please     visit     our     website     at
       http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/


OPTIONS
       -?, -h, --help
              Prints the command line options.

       -p, --page-label=PAGE
              Open  the  document  on the page with the specified page label (or
              page number).

       -p, --page-index=NUMBER
              Open the document on the page with the specified page index  (this
              is the exact page number, not a page label).

       -f, --fullscreen
              Run evince in fullscreen mode.

       -s, --presentation
              Run evince in presentation mode.

       -l, --find=string
              You can pass a word or phrase here. If it exists, evince will dis&#8208;
              play the document and the first match.

       filename(s)...
              Specifies the file to open when Evince  starts.  If  this  is  not
              specified,  Evince will open a blank window. Multiple files can be
              loaded if they are separated by spaces.  Evince also supports han&#8208;
              dling  of remote files.  For example, you can pass the location on
              the   web   or   load   a   file   from   a   FTP   server,   like
              &quot;ftp://adobe.com/sample.pdf&quot;.


Print preview options
       These  options are primarily intended for use with the GTK+ print preview
       function. For more information  about  these  options  see  http://devel&#8208;
       oper.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkSettings.html#GtkSettings--gtk-print-pre&#8208;
       view-command

       -w, --preview
              Run evince as a previewer.

       --unlink-temp-file
              If evince is run in preview mode, this will unlink  the  temporary
              file created by GTK+.

       --print-settings %s %f
              This  sends  the full path of the PDF file, f, and the settings of
              the print dialog, s, to evince.
