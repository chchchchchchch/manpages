NAME
       evp - high-level cryptographic functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       The EVP library provides a high-level interface to cryptographic
       functions.

       EVP_Seal... and EVP_Open... provide public key encryption and decryption
       to implement digital &quot;envelopes&quot;.

       The EVP_Sign... and EVP_Verify... functions implement digital signatures.

       Symmetric encryption is available with the EVP_Encrypt...  functions.
       The EVP_Digest... functions provide message digests.

       The EVP_PKEY... functions provide a high level interface to asymmetric
       algorithms.

       Algorithms are loaded with OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(3).

       All the symmetric algorithms (ciphers), digests and asymmetric algorithms
       (public key algorithms) can be replaced by ENGINE modules providing
       alternative implementations. If ENGINE implementations of ciphers or
       digests are registered as defaults, then the various EVP functions will
       automatically use those implementations automatically in preference to
       built in software implementations. For more information, consult the
       engine(3) man page.

       Although low level algorithm specific functions exist for many algorithms
       their use is discouraged. They cannot be used with an ENGINE and ENGINE
       versions of new algorithms cannot be accessed using the low level
       functions.  Also makes code harder to adapt to new algorithms and some
       options are not cleanly supported at the low level and some operations
       are more efficient using the high level interface.
