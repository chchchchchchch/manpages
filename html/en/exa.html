EXA(4)                                                                    EXA(4)



NAME
       exa - new 2D acceleration architecture for X.Org

DESCRIPTION
       EXA provides a simple API for video drivers to implement for 2D accelera&#8208;
       tion.  It is a module loaded by drivers, and is not intended to be loaded
       on its own.  See your driver&apos;s manual page for how to enable EXA.

       The  EXA  architecture is designed to make accelerating the Render exten&#8208;
       sion simple and efficient, and results in various  performance  tradeoffs
       compared to XAA.  Some xorg.conf options are available for debugging per&#8208;
       formance issues or driver rendering problems.  They are not intended  for
       general use.

       Option &quot;EXANoComposite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables  acceleration of the Composite operation, which is at the
              heart of the Render  extension.   Not  related  to  the  Composite
              extension.  Default: No.

       Option &quot;EXANoUploadToScreen&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables acceleration of uploading pixmap data to the framebuffer.
              Default: No.

       Option &quot;EXANoDownloadFromScreen&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables acceleration of  downloading  of  pixmap  data  from  the
              framebuffer.   NOTE:  Not  usable with drivers which rely on Down&#8208;
              loadFromScreen succeeding.  Default: No.

       Option &quot;MigrationHeuristic&quot; &quot;anystr&quot;
              Chooses an alternate pixmap  migration  heuristic,  for  debugging
              purposes.   The  default is intended to be the best performing one
              for general use, though others may help with specific  use  cases.
              Available   options   include  &quot;always&quot;,  &quot;greedy&quot;,  and  &quot;smart&quot;.
              Default: always.
