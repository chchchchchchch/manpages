EXICYCLOG(8)                                                        EXICYCLOG(8)



NAME
       exicyclog - Cycle exim&apos;s logfiles

SYNOPSIS
       eximcyclog

DESCRIPTION
       The  exicyclog script can be used to cycle (rotate) mainlog and rejectlog
       files.  This is not necessary if only syslog is being used.  Some operat&#8208;
       ing systems have their own standard mechanisms for log cycling, and these
       can be used instead of exicyclog if preferred.

       Each time exicyclog is run the file names get &#8216;shuffled down&#8217; by one.  If
       the  main  log  file name is mainlog (the default) then when exicyclog is
       run mainlog becomes mainlog.01, the  previous  mainlog.01  becomes  main&#8208;
       log.02  and  so  on,  up to a limit which is set in the script, and which
       defaults to 10.  Reject logs are handled similarly.

       If no mainlog file exists, the script does  nothing.   Files  that  &#8216;drop
       off&#8217;  the  end  are  deleted.  All files with numbers greater than 01 are
       compressed, using a compression command which is configured by  the  COM&#8208;
       PRESS_COMMAND  setting in Local/Makefile.  It is usual to run &#8220;exicyclog&#8221;
       daily from a root &#8220;crontab&#8221; entry of the form

         1 0 * * * su exim -c /usr/exim/bin/exicyclog

       assuming you have used the name &#8216;exim&#8217; for the Exim user.   You  can  run
       exicyclog as root if you wish, but there is no need.



BUGS
       This  manual  page  needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
       than us and has more experience in  writing  manual  pages,  any  patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
