DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page describes the files that are in use by the Debian exim4
       packages and which are not part of an exim installation done from source.

/etc/aliases
       is a table providing a mechanism to redirect mail for  local  recipients.
       /etc/aliases  is  a  text file which is roughly compatible with Sendmail.
       The file should contain lins of the form
       name: address, address, ...
       The name is a local address without domain part. All  local  domains  are
       handled  equally.  For  more  detailed  documentation,  please  refer  to
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz,     chapter     22,     and     to
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz.  Please  note  that it is not
       possible to use delivery to arbitrary files, directories  and  to  pipes.
       This is forbidden in Debian&apos;s exim4 default configuration.

       You  should  at  least set up an alias for postmaster in the /etc/aliases
       file.

/etc/email-addresses
       is used to rewrite the email addresses of  users.  This  is  particularly
       useful for users who use their ISP&apos;s domain for email.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       user: someone@isp.com
       otheruser: someoneelse@anotherisp.com

       This  way  emails from user will appear to be from someone@isp.com to the
       outside world. Technically, the from,  reply-to,  and  sender  addresses,
       along with the envelope sender, are rewritten for users that appear to be
       in the local domain.


/etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist
       is an optional file containing a list of IP addresses, networks and  host
       names  whose  messages  will  be  denied  with the error message &quot;locally
       blacklisted&quot;. This is a full exim 4 host list, and all available features
       can  be  used.  This  includes  negative  items, and so it is possible to
       exclude addresses from being blacklisted. For convenience,  as  an  addi&#8208;
       tional  method  to  whitelist  addresses  from being blocked, an explicit
       whitelist is read in from /etc/exim4/host_local_deny_exceptions.  Entries
       in the whitelist override corresponding blacklist entries.

       In the blacklist, the trick is to read a line break as &quot;or&quot; if it follows
       a positive item, and as &quot;and&quot; if it follows a negative item.

       For example, a /etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist

       192.168.10.0/24
       !172.16.10.128/26
       172.16.10.0/24
       10.0.0.0/8

       Exim just evaluates left to right (or up-down in the  file  listing  con&#8208;
       text),  so  you  don&apos;t get the same kind of operator binding as in a pro&#8208;
       gramming language.


/etc/exim4/host_local_deny_exceptions
       contains a list of IP addresses, networks and host names  whose  messages
       will    be   accepted   despite   the   address   is   also   listed   in
       /etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist, overriding a blacklisting.


/etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist
       is an optional files containing a list of envelope senders whose messages
       will  be  denied with the error message &quot;locally blacklisted&quot;.  This is a
       full exim 4 address list, and all available features can  be  used.  This
       includes  negative items, and so it is possible to exclude addresses from
       being blacklisted. For convenience, as an additional method to  whitelist
       addresses  from  being  blocked,  an  explicit  whitelist is read in from
       /etc/exim4/sender_local_deny_exceptions. Entries in the  whitelist  over&#8208;
       ride corresponding blacklist entries.

       In the blacklist, the trick is to read a line break as &quot;or&quot; if it follows
       a positive item, and as &quot;and&quot; if it follows a negative item.

       For example, a /etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist

       domain1.example
       !local@domain2.example
       domain2.example
       domain3.example

       Exim just evaluates left to right (or up-down in the  file  listing  con&#8208;
       text),  so  you  don&apos;t get the same kind of operator binding as in a pro&#8208;
       gramming language.


/etc/exim4/sender_local_deny_exceptions
       is an optional file containing a list of envelope senders whose  messages
       will   be   accepted   despite   the   address   being   also  listed  in
       /etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist, overriding a blacklisting.


/etc/exim4/local_sender_callout
       is an optional file containing a list of envelope senders whose  messages
       are  subject  to sender verification with a callout. This is a full exim4
       address list, and all available features can be used.


/etc/exim4/local_rcpt_callout
       is an optional file containing a list of envelope  recipients  for  which
       incoming  messages  are subject to recipient verification with a callout.
       This is a full exim4 address list, and  all  available  features  can  be
       used.
&#12;/etc/exim4/local_domain_dnsbl_whitelist
       is  an optional file containing a list of envelope senders whose messages
       are exempt from blacklisting via a domain-based DNSBL.  This  is  a  full
       exim4 address list, and all available features can be used.  This feature
       is intended to be used in case of a domain-based DNSBL  being  too  heavy
       handed,  for  example listing entire top-level domains for their registry
       policies.


/etc/exim4/hubbed_hosts
       is an optional file containing a list of route_data records which can  be
       used to override or augment MX information from the DNS. This is particu&#8208;
       larly useful for mail hubs which are highest-priority MX for a domain  in
       the DNS but are not final destination of the messages, passing them on to
       a host which is not publicly reachable, or to temporarily fix mail  rout&#8208;
       ing in case of broken DNS setups.

       The  file should contain key-value pairs of domain pattern and route data
       of the form

       domain: host-list options
       dict.ref.example:  mail-1.ref.example:mail-2.ref.example
       foo.example: internal.mail.example.com
       bar.example: 192.168.183.3

       which will cause mail for foo.example to  be  sent  to  the  host  inter&#8208;
       nal.mail.example  (IP  address  derived  from A record only), and mail to
       bar.example to be sent to 192.168.183.3.

       See spec.txt chapter 20.3 through 20.7 for a more detailed explanation of
       host list format and available options.


/etc/exim4/passwd
       contains account and password data for SMTP authentication when the local
       exim is SMTP server and clients authenticate to the local exim.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       username:crypted-password:clear-password

       crypted-password is the crypt(3)-created hash of your password. You  can,
       for  example, use the mkpasswd program from the whois package to create a
       crypted password. It is recommended to use md5 hashing, with mkpasswd  -H
       md5.

       clear-password  is only necessary if you want to offer CRAM-MD5 authenti&#8208;
       cation. If you don&apos;t plan on doing so, the third column  can  be  omitted
       completely.

       This  file  must  be  readable for the Debian-exim user and should not be
       readable for others. Recommended file mode is root:Debian-exim 640.


/etc/exim4/passwd.client
       contains account and password data for SMTP authentication when  exim  is
       authenticating as a client to some remote server.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       target.mail.server.example:login-user-name:password

       which  will  cause  exim to use login-user-name and password when sending
       messages   to   a   server   with   the   canonical   host   name    tar&#8208;
       get.mail.server.example.   Please  note  that this does not configure the
       mail server to send to (this is determined in Debconf), but only  creates
       the correlation between host name and authentication credentials to avoid
       exposing passwords to the wrong host.

       Please note that target.mail.server.example is currently the  value  that
       exim  can  read  from  reverse DNS: It first follows the host name of the
       target system until it finds an IP address, and then looks up the reverse
       DNS  for  that  IP  address  to  use the outcome of this query (or the IP
       address   itself   should    the    query    fail)    as    index    into
       /etc/exim4/passwd.client.

       This goes inevitably wrong if the host name of the mail server is a CNAME
       (a DNS alias), or the reverse lookup does not fit the forward one.

       Currently, you need to manually lookup all reverse DNS names for  all  IP
       addresses that your SMTP server host name points to, for example by using
       the host command.  If the SMTP smarthost alias expands to  multiple  IPs,
       you need to have multiple lines for all the hosts.  When your ISP changes
       the alias, you will need to manually fix that.

       You may minimize this trouble by using  a  wild  card  entry  or  regular
       expressions,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of divulging the password to the
       wrong SMTP server while reducing the number of necessary  lines.   For  a
       deeper discussion, see the Debian BTS #244724.

       password  is  your  SMTP password in clear text. If you do not know about
       your SMTP password, you can try using  your  POP3  password  as  a  first
       guess.

       This  file  must  be  readable for the Debian-exim user and should not be
       readable for others. Recommended file mode is root:Debian-exim 640.

       # example for CONFDIR/passwd.client
       # this will only match if the server&apos;s generic name matches exactly
       mail.server.example:user:password
       # this will deliver the password to any server
       *:username:password
       # this will deliver the password to servers whose generic name ends in
       # mail.server.example
       *.mail.server.example:user:password
       # this will deliver the password to servers whose generic name matches
       # the regular expression
       ^smtp[0-9]*.mail.server.example:user:password


/etc/exim4/exim.crt
       contains the certificate that exim  uses  to  initiate  TLS  connections.
       This    is    public    information    and   can   be   world   readable.
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert can be used to generate a
       private key and self-signed certificate.


/etc/exim4/exim.key
       contains  the private key belonging to the certificate in exim.crt.  This
       file&apos;s contents must be kept secret and should have mode root:Debian-exim
       640.  /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert can be used to gen&#8208;
       erate a private key and self-signed certificate.


BUGS
       Plenty. Please report them through the Debian BTS

       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
