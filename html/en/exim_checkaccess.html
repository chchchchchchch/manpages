EXIM_CHECKACCESS(8)                                          EXIM_CHECKACCESS(8)



NAME
       exim_checkaccess - Check address acceptance from given IP

SYNOPSIS
       exim_checkaccess IP-address email@address [more Exim options]


DESCRIPTION
       Exim&apos;s  -bh  command  line argument allows you to run a fake SMTP session
       with debugging output, in order to check what Exim is doing  when  it  is
       applying  policy  controls to incoming SMTP mail.  However, not everybody
       is sufficiently familiar with the SMTP protocol to be able to  make  full
       use of -bh, and sometimes you just want to answer the question &#8220;Does this
       address have access?&#8221; without bothering with any further details.

       The exim_checkaccess utility is a &#8216;packaged&#8217; version of  -bh.   It  takes
       two arguments, an IP address and an email address:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 A.User@a.domain.example

       The  utility runs a call to Exim with the -bh option, to test whether the
       given email address would be accepted in a RCPT command in a TCP/IP  con&#8208;
       nection from the host with the given IP address.  The output of the util&#8208;
       ity is either the word &#8216;accepted&#8217;, or the SMTP error response, for  exam&#8208;
       ple:

         Rejected:
           550 Relay not permitted

       When  running  this  test,  the  utility uses &#8220;&lt;&gt;&#8221; as the envelope sender
       address for the MAIL command, but you can change this by providing  addi&#8208;
       tional  options.   These  are  passed  directly to the Exim command.  For
       example, to specify that the test is to be run with  the  sender  address
       &#8220;himself@there.example&#8221; you can use:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 A.User@a.domain.example \
                          -f himself@there.example

       Note  that  these  additional Exim command line items must be given after
       the two mandatory arguments.


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
