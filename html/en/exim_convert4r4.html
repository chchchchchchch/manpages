EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8)                                            EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8)



NAME
       exim_convert4r4 - Convert Exim configuration from v3 to v4 format

SYNOPSIS
       exim_convert4r4


DESCRIPTION
       This  script  is provided to assist in updating Exim configuration files.
       It reads an Exim 3 configuration file on the standard input, and writes a
       modified file on the standard output.  It also writes comments about what
       it has done to the standard error file.  It assumes that the input  is  a
       valid Exim 3 configuration file.  A typical call to the conversion script
       might be

       exim_convert4r4 &lt; /etc/exim/exim.conf &gt; /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.new

       The output file MUST be checked and tested before trying to use it  on  a
       live  system.   The  conversion script is just an aid which does a lot of
       the &#8220;grunt work&#8221;.  It does not guarantee to produce an Exim 4  configura&#8208;
       tion that behaves exactly the same as the Exim 3 configuration it reads.

       Each option change in the new file is preceded by an identifying comment.
       In fact, the conversion script tends to make quite a mess of your config&#8208;
       uration, and you should expect to go through it afterwards and tidy it up
       by hand.

       Unless you are running a very straightforward  configuration,  the  auto&#8208;
       matic  conversion is likely to generate a non-optimal configuration.  You
       should not only check it thoroughly, but also run as many  tests  as  you
       can,  to  ensure  that  it  is working as you expect.  In particular, you
       should test address routing, using -bt and -bv, and the policy  controls,
       using  -bh.   If  possible, you should also do some live tests (i.e. send
       and receive some messages) before putting Exim 4 into service.

       If you have  a  very  complicated  configuration,  it  is  possible  that
       exim_convert4r4  will  break it in some situations, which is why thorough
       testing is strongly recommended.


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
