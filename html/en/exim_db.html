EXIM_DB(8)                                                            EXIM_DB(8)



NAME
       exim_db   -   Manage  Exim&apos;s  hint  databases  (exim_dumpdb,  exim_fixdb,
       exim_tidydb)

SYNOPSIS
       exim_dumpdb spooldir database
       exim_fixdb spooldir database
       exim_tidydb [-f] [-t time] spooldir database


DESCRIPTION
       Three utility programs are provided for maintaining the  DBM  files  that
       Exim  uses  to  contain  its  delivery  hint  information.   Each program
       requires two arguments.  The first specifies the  name  of  Exim&apos;s  spool
       directory,  and  the  second is the name of the database it is to operate
       on.  These are as follows:

       retry  the database of retry information

       wait-&lt;transport name&gt;
              databases of information about messages waiting for remote hosts

       misc   other hints data (for example, for serializing ETRN runs)

       The entire contents of a database are written to the standard  output  by
       the exim_dumpdb program, which has no options or arguments other than the
       spool and database names.  For example, to dump the retry database:

       exim_dumpdb /var/spool/exim retry

       Two lines of output are produced for each entry:
           T:mail.ref.example:192.168.242.242 146 77 Connection refused
         31-Oct-1995 12:00:12  02-Nov-1995 12:21:39  02-Nov-1995 20:21:39 *

       The first item on the first line is the key of  the  record.   It  starts
       with  one  of  the  letters  R, or T, depending on whether it refers to a
       routing or transport retry.  For a local delivery, the next part  is  the
       local  address;  for a remote delivery it is the name of the remote host,
       followed by its failing IP address (unless  &#8220;no_retry_include_ip_address&#8221;
       is  set  on  the  smtp  transport).  Then there follows an error code, an
       additional error code, and a textual description of the error.

       The three times on the second line are the time  of  first  failure,  the
       time  of  the  last  delivery attempt, and the computed time for the next
       attempt.  The line ends with an asterisk if the cutoff time for the  last
       retry rule has been exceeded.

       Each  output line from exim_dumpdb for the wait-xxx databases consists of
       a host name followed by a list of ids for messages that are or were wait&#8208;
       ing  to  be delivered to that host.  If there are a very large number for
       any one host, continuation records, with a sequence number added  to  the
       host  name, may be seen.  The data in these records is often out of date,
       because a message may be routed to several alternative  hosts,  and  Exim
       makes no effort to keep cross-references.

       The  exim_tidydb  utility  program is used to tidy up the contents of the
       hints databases.  If run with no options, it removes all records  from  a
       database  that are more than 30 days old.  The cutoff date can be altered
       by means of the -t option, which must be followed by a time.   For  exam&#8208;
       ple, to remove all records older than a week from the retry database:

       exim_tidydb -t 7d /var/spool/exim retry

       Both  the wait-xxx and retry databases contain items that involve message
       ids.  In the former these appear as data in records keyed by host -  they
       were  messages  that  were waiting for that host - and in the latter they
       are the keys for retry information for messages that have  suffered  cer&#8208;
       tain  types  of  error.   When  &#8220;exim_tidydb&#8221;  is run, a check is made to
       ensure that message ids in database records are those  of  messages  that
       are  still  on  the queue.  Message ids for messages that no longer exist
       are removed from &#8220;wait-&#8221;xxx records,  and  if  this  leaves  any  records
       empty,  they  are  deleted.  For the &#8220;retry&#8221; database, records whose keys
       are non-existent message ids are removed.  The exim_tidydb  utility  out&#8208;
       puts comments on the standard output whenever it removes information from
       the database.

       Removing records from a DBM file does not normally make the file smaller,
       but  all  the  common  DBM libraries are able to re-use the space that is
       released.  It is therefore suggested that exim_tidydb be run periodically
       on  all  the  hints  databases,  but  at  a quiet time of day, because it
       requires a database to be locked (and  therefore  inaccessible  to  Exim)
       while it does its work.

       The  exim_fixdb  program  is  a utility for interactively modifying data&#8208;
       bases.  Its main use is for testing Exim, but it might also be  occasion&#8208;
       ally  useful  for  getting  round  problems  in a live system.  It has no
       options, and its interface is somewhat crude.  On entry, it  prompts  for
       input with a right angle-bracket.  A key of a database record can then be
       entered, and the data for that record is displayed.

       If &#8216;d&#8217; is typed at the next prompt, the entire record  is  deleted.   For
       all  except  the  retry  database, that is the only operation that can be
       carried out.  For the retry database, each field is output preceded by  a
       number, and data for individual fields can be changed by typing the field
       number followed by new data, for example:

         &gt; 4 951102:1000

       resets the time of the next delivery attempt.  Time values are given as a
       sequence  of  digit pairs for year, month, day, hour, and minute.  Colons
       can be used as optional separators.


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
