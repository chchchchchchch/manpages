EXIM_DBMBUILD(8)                                                EXIM_DBMBUILD(8)



NAME
       exim_dbmbuild - Build a DBM file.

SYNOPSIS
       exim_dbmbuild [-nolc] [-nozero] [-noduperr] [-nowarn] inputfile|- output&#8208;
       file


DESCRIPTION
       The exim_dbmbuild program reads an input file containing keys and data in
       the format used by the lsearch lookup (see section 9.1).  It writes a DBM
       file using the lower-cased alias names as keys and the remainder  of  the
       information  as  data.   The lower-casing can be prevented by calling the
       program with the -nolc option.

       A terminating zero is included as  part  of  the  key  string.   This  is
       expected  by  the  dbm  lookup  type.   However, if the option -nozero is
       given, exim_dbmbuild creates files without terminating zeroes  in  either
       the  key  strings or the data strings.  The dbmnz lookup type can be used
       with such files.

       The program requires two arguments: the name of the input file (which can
       be  a  single hyphen to indicate the standard input), and the name of the
       output file.  It creates the output under  a  temporary  name,  and  then
       renames  it  if  all  went  well.   If  the native DB interface is in use
       (USE_DB is set in a compile-time configuration file - this is  common  in
       free  versions  of Unix) the two file names must be different, because in
       this mode the Berkeley DB functions create a  single  output  file  using
       exactly the name given.  For example,

         exim_dbmbuild /etc/aliases /etc/aliases.db

       reads  the  system  alias  file  and  creates  a  DBM  version  of  it in
       /etc/aliases.db.

       In systems that use the ndbm routines  (mostly  proprietary  versions  of
       Unix),  two  files  are  used,  with the suffixes .dir and .pag.  In this
       environment, the suffixes are added to the second argument  of  exim_dbm&#8208;
       build,  so  it  can be the same as the first.  This is also the case when
       the Berkeley functions are used in compatibility mode (though this is not
       recommended), because in that case it adds a .db suffix to the file name.

       If  a  duplicate  key  is encountered, the program outputs a warning, and
       when it finishes, its return code is  1  rather  than  zero,  unless  the
       -noduperr  option is used.  By default, only the first of a set of dupli&#8208;
       cates is used - this makes it compatible with lsearch lookups.  There  is
       an option -lastdup which causes it to use the data for the last duplicate
       instead.  There is also an option -nowarn, which stops it listing  dupli&#8208;
       cate  keys to &#8220;stderr&#8221;.  For other errors, where it doesn&apos;t actually make
       a new file, the return code is 2.


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
