EXIM_LOCK(8)                                                        EXIM_LOCK(8)



NAME
       exim_lock - Mailbox maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       exim_lock [options]mailbox-file


DESCRIPTION
       The  exim_lock  utility  locks a mailbox file using the same algorithm as
       Exim.  For a discussion of locking issues, see section  25.2.   exim_lock
       can  be  used  to prevent any modification of a mailbox by Exim or a user
       agent while investigating a problem.  The utility requires  the  name  of
       the file as its first argument.  If the locking is successful, the second
       argument is run as a command (using C&apos;s &#8220;system()&#8221; function); if there is
       no  second argument, the value of the SHELL environment variable is used;
       if this is unset or empty, /bin/sh is run.  When  the  command  finishes,
       the  mailbox is unlocked and the utility ends.  The following options are
       available:

       -fcntl Use &#8220;fcntl()&#8221; locking on the open mailbox.

       -interval
              This must be followed by a number, which is a number  of  seconds;
              it sets the interval to sleep between retries (default 3).

       -lockfile
              Create a lock file before opening the mailbox.

       -mbx   Lock the mailbox using MBX rules.

       -q     Suppress verification output.

       -retries
              This  must be followed by a number; it sets the number of times to
              try to get the lock (default 10).

       -timeout
              This must be followed by a number, which is a number  of  seconds;
              it  sets  a timeout to be used with a blocking &#8220;fcntl()&#8221; lock.  If
              it is not set (the default), a non-blocking call is used.

       -v     Generate verbose output.

              If none of -fcntl, -lockfile or -mbx are given, the default is  to
              create  a lock file and also use &#8220;fcntl()&#8221; locking on the mailbox,
              which is the same as Exim&apos;s default.  The use of  -fcntl  requires
              that  the file be writable; the use of -lockfile requires that the
              directory containing the file be writable.  Locking by  lock  file
              does  not  last for ever; Exim assumes that a lock file is expired
              if it is more than 30 minutes old.

              The -mbx option is mutually exclusive with -fcntl.   It  causes  a
              shared  lock to be taken out on the open mailbox, and an exclusive
              lock on the file /tmp/.n.m where n and m are the device number and
              inode  number  of the mailbox file.  When the locking is released,
              if an exclusive lock can be obtained for the mailbox, the file  in
              /tmp is deleted.

              The default output contains verification of the locking that takes
              place.  The -v option causes some  additional  information  to  be
              given.  The -q option suppresses all output except error messages.
&#12;       A command such as

         exim_lock /var/spool/mail/spqr

       runs an interactive shell while the file is locked, whereas

         exim_lock -q /var/spool/mail/spqr &lt;&lt;End
         &lt;some commands&gt;
         End

       runs  a  specific  non-interactive sequence of commands while the file is
       locked, suppressing all verification output.  A single command can be run
       by a command such as

         exim_lock    -q   /var/spool/mail/spqr       &quot;cp   /var/spool/mail/spqr
       /some/where&quot;

       Note that if a command is supplied, it must be entirely contained  within
       the second argument - hence the quotes.


BUGS
       This  manual  page  needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
       than us and has more experience in  writing  manual  pages,  any  patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
