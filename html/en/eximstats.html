           histograms. Valid values are:

           0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60.

       -ne Don&apos;t display error information.

       -nr Don&apos;t display relaying information.

       -nr/pattern/
           Don&apos;t display relaying information that matches.

       -nt Don&apos;t display transport information.

       -nt/pattern/
           Don&apos;t display transport information that matches

       -qlist
           List of times for queuing information single 0 item suppresses.

       -tnumber
           Display top &lt;number&gt; sources/destinations default is 50, 0 suppresses
           top listing.

       -tnl
           Omit local sources/destinations in top listing.

       -t_remote_users
           Include remote users in the top source/destination listings.

       -include_original_destination
           Include the original destination email addresses rather than just
           using the final ones.  Useful for finding out which of your mailing
           lists are receiving mail.

       -show_dtlist
           Show the delivery times (DT)for all the messages.

           Exim must have been configured to use the +deliver_time logging
           option for this option to work.

           list is an optional list of times. Eg -show_dt1,2,4,8 will show the
           number of messages with delivery times under 1 second, 2 seconds, 4
           seconds, 8 seconds, and over 8 seconds.

       -show_rtlist
           Show the receipt times for all the messages. The receipt time is
           defined as the Completed hh:mm:ss - queue_time_overall - the Receipt
           hh:mm:ss.  These figures will be skewed by pipelined messages so
           might not be that useful.

           Exim must have been configured to use the +queue_time_overall logging
           option for this option to work.

           list is an optional list of times. Eg -show_rt1,2,4,8 will show the
           number of messages with receipt times under 1 second, 2 seconds, 4
           seconds, 8 seconds, and over 8 seconds.

       -byhost
           Show results by sending host. This may be combined with -bydomain
           and/or -byemail and/or -byedomain. If none of these options are
           specified, then -byhost is assumed as a default.

       -bydomain
           Show results by sending domain.  May be combined with -byhost and/or
           -byemail and/or -byedomain.

       -byemail
           Show results by sender&apos;s email address.  May be combined with -byhost
           and/or -bydomain and/or -byedomain.

       -byemaildomain or -byedomain
           Show results by sender&apos;s email domain.  May be combined with -byhost
           and/or -bydomain and/or -byemail.

       -pattern Description /Pattern/
           Look for the specified pattern and count the number of lines in which
           it appears.  This option can be specified multiple times. Eg:

            -pattern &apos;Refused connections&apos; &apos;/refused connection/&apos;

       -merge
           This option allows eximstats to merge old eximstat reports together.
           Eg:

            eximstats mainlog.sun &gt; report.sun.txt
            eximstats mainlog.mon &gt; report.mon.txt
            eximstats mainlog.tue &gt; report.tue.txt
            eximstats mainlog.wed &gt; report.web.txt
            eximstats mainlog.thu &gt; report.thu.txt
            eximstats mainlog.fri &gt; report.fri.txt
            eximstats mainlog.sat &gt; report.sat.txt
            eximstats -merge       report.*.txt &gt; weekly_report.txt
            eximstats -merge -html report.*.txt &gt; weekly_report.html

           &#183;   You can merge text or html reports and output the results as text
               or html.

           &#183;   You can use all the normal eximstat output options, but only data
               included in the original reports can be shown!
&#12;           &#183;   When merging reports, some loss of accuracy may occur in the top
               n lists.  This will be towards the ends of the lists.

           &#183;   The order of items in the top n lists may vary when the data
               volumes round to the same value.

       -charts
           Create graphical charts to be displayed in HTML output.  Only valid
           in combination with -html.

           This requires the following modules which can be obtained from
           http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html

           GD
           GDTextUtil
           GDGraph

           To install these, download and unpack them, then use the normal perl
           installation procedure:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

           On Debian GNU/Linux you can use &quot;apt-get install libgd-perl
           libgd-text-perl libgd-graph-perl&quot; instead.

       -chartdirI &lt;dir&gt;
           Create the charts in the directory &lt;dir&gt;

       -chartrelI &lt;dir&gt;
           Specify the relative directory for the &quot;img src=&quot; tags from where to
           include the charts

       -emptyok
           Specify that it&apos;s OK to not find any valid log lines. Without this we
           will output an error message if we don&apos;t find any.

       -d  Debug flag. This outputs the eval()&apos;d parser onto STDOUT which makes
           it easier to trap errors in the eval section. Remember to add 1 to
           the line numbers to allow for the title!

DESCRIPTION
       Eximstats parses exim mainlog and syslog files to output a statistical
       analysis of the messages processed. By default, a text analysis is
       generated, but you can request other output formats using flags. See the
       help (-help) to learn about how to create charts from the tables.

TO DO
       This program does not perfectly handle messages whose received and
       delivered log lines are in different files, which can happen when you
       have multiple mail servers and a message cannot be immediately delivered.
       Fixing this could be tricky...

       Merging of xls files is not (yet) possible. Be free to implement :)
