EXINEXT(8)                                                            EXINEXT(8)



NAME
       exinext - Finding individual retry times

SYNOPSIS
       exinext address|message-id


DESCRIPTION
       A  utility  called exinext (mostly a Perl script) provides the ability to
       fish specific information out of the retry database.  Given a mail domain
       (or  a complete address), it looks up the hosts for that domain, and out&#8208;
       puts any retry information for the hosts or for the domain.  At  present,
       the  retry information is obtained by running exim_dumpdb (see below) and
       processing the output.  For example:

         exinext piglet@milne.fict.example
         kanga.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.1 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 15:02:34
         roo.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.3 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 20-Jan-1996 13:12:08
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 11:42:03
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 19:42:03
           past final cutoff time

       You can also give exinext a local part, without a  domain,  and  it  will
       give any retry information for that local part in your default domain.  A
       message id can be used to obtain retry information pertaining to  a  spe&#8208;
       cific  message.  This exists only when an attempt to deliver a message to
       a remote host  suffers  a  message-specific  error  (see  section  42.2).
       exinext  is  not particularly efficient, but then it isn&apos;t expected to be
       run very often.


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
