EXIQGREP(8)                                                          EXIQGREP(8)



NAME
       exiqgrep - Search in the exim queue

SYNOPSIS
       exiqgrep [-a] [-c]


DESCRIPTION
       The  exiqgrep utility is a Perl script which offers possibilities to grep
       in the exim queue output. Unlike exiqsumm, it invokes  exim  -bpu  itself
       and does not need to be invoked in a pipe.
