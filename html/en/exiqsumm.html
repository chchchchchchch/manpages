EXIQSUMM(8)                                                          EXIQSUMM(8)



NAME
       exiqsumm - Summarising the queue

SYNOPSIS
       exiqsumm [-a] [-c]


DESCRIPTION
       The  exiqsumm utility is a Perl script which reads the output of exim -bp
       and produces a summary of the messages on the queue.  Thus, you use it by
       running a command such as

         exim -bp | exiqsumm

       The output consists of one line for each domain that has messages waiting
       for it, as in the following example:

           3   2322   74m   66m  msn.com.example

       This lists the number of messages for the domain, their total volume, and
       the  length  of  time  that  the oldest and the newest messages have been
       waiting.  By default the output is sorted on the domain name,  but  exiq&#8208;
       summ  has  the  options -a and -c, which cause the output to be sorted by
       oldest message and by count of messages, respectively.

       The output of exim -bp contains the original addresses in the message, so
       this also applies to the output from exiqsumm.  No domains from addresses
       generated by aliasing or forwarding are included (unless  the  &#8220;one_time&#8221;
       option  of  the  redirect  router has been used to convert them into &#8216;top
       level&#8217; addresses).


BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
