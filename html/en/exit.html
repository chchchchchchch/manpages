_EXIT(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   _EXIT(2)



NAME
       _exit, _Exit - terminate the calling process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       void _exit(int status);

       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void _Exit(int status);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       _Exit():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  _exit() terminates the calling process &quot;immediately&quot;.  Any
       open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed;  any  children
       of the process are inherited by process 1, init, and the process&apos;s parent
       is sent a SIGCHLD signal.

       The value status is returned to the parent process as the process&apos;s  exit
       status, and can be collected using one of the wait(2) family of calls.

       The function _Exit() is equivalent to _exit().

RETURN VALUE
       These functions do not return.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.  The function _Exit() was introduced by C99.

NOTES
       For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the transmission of exit sta&#8208;
       tus, zombie processes, signals sent, and so on, see exit(3).

       The function _exit() is like exit(3), but does  not  call  any  functions
       registered with atexit(3) or on_exit(3).  Whether it flushes standard I/O
       buffers and removes temporary files created with tmpfile(3) is  implemen&#8208;
       tation-dependent.   On  the  other  hand,  _exit()  does  close open file
       descriptors, and this may cause an unknown  delay,  waiting  for  pending
       output  to  finish.   If the delay is undesired, it may be useful to call
       functions like tcflush(3) before calling _exit().   Whether  any  pending
       I/O  is  canceled, and which pending I/O may be canceled upon _exit(), is
       implementation-dependent.

       In glibc up to version 2.3, the _exit() wrapper function invoked the ker&#8208;
       nel  system call of the same name.  Since glibc 2.3, the wrapper function
       invokes exit_group(2), in order to terminate all  of  the  threads  in  a
       process.
