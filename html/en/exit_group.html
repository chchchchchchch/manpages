NAME
       exit_group - exit all threads in a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;

       void exit_group(int status);

DESCRIPTION
       This  system  call is equivalent to exit(2) except that it terminates not
       only the calling thread, but all threads in the calling process&apos;s  thread
       group.

RETURN VALUE
       This system call does not return.

VERSIONS
       This call is present since Linux 2.5.35.

CONFORMING TO
       This call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Since glibc 2.3, this is the system call invoked when the exit(2) wrapper
       function is called.

SEE ALSO
