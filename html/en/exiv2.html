NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2  is  a  program to read and write Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata
       and image comments. The following image formats are supported:

       &#183; Support for GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal:  the  image  format  is
         recognized,  a MIME type assigned to it and the height and width of the
         image are determined.

       &#183; Reading other TIFF-like RAW image formats, which are not listed in  the
         table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The  action argument is only required if it is not clear from the options
       which action is implied.

       pr | print
              Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e.,  the  com&#8208;
              mand  exiv2 image.jpg will print a summary of the image Exif meta&#8208;
              data.

       ex | extract
              Extract metadata to *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail image
              files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
              Insert  metadata from corresponding *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and
              thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix  of  the
              input  files.  Since  files of any supported format can be used as
              input files, this command can be used to copy the metadata between
              files  of  different formats. Modification commands can be applied
              on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
              Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
              Adjust Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one of
              the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
              Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif, IPTC and XMP
              metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
              Rename files and/or set file timestamps according to the Exif cre&#8208;
              ate  timestamp.  Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal
              or, if not present, Exif.Image.DateTime  to  determine  the  time&#8208;
              stamp.  The  filename  format  can  be  set with -r fmt, timestamp
              options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
              Copy the ISO setting from one of the proprietary  Nikon  or  Canon
              makernote    ISO    tags    to   the   regular   Exif   ISO   tag,
              Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an  existing  stan&#8208;
              dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
              Fix the character encoding of Exif Unicode user comments.  Decodes
              the comment using the auto-detected or specified character  encod&#8208;
              ing and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to specify the cur&#8208;
              rent encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library  during
              the  program  run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can be used
              at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to &apos;d&apos;(ebug), &apos;i&apos;(nfo),  &apos;w&apos;(arning),  &apos;e&apos;(rror)
              or  &apos;m&apos;(ute).  The  default log-level is &apos;w&apos;. -Qm is equivalent to
              -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don&apos;t have  a
              name).

       -g key Only  output  info  for this Exiv2 key (grep). Multiple -g options
              can be used to grep info for several keys.

       -n enc Charset to use to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a name
              understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., &apos;UTF-8&apos;.

       -k     Preserve  file  timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
              with all options which update files. The flag is ignored by  read-
              only options.

       -t     Set  the  file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
              addition to renaming the file (overrides -k). This option is  only
              used with the &apos;rename&apos; action.

       -T     Only  set  the  file  timestamp according to the Exif create time&#8208;
              stamp, do not rename the file (overrides -k). This option is  only
              used  with  the  &apos;rename&apos; action. Note: On Windows you may have to
              set the TZ environment variable for this option to work correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting existing files (force overwrite).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename).  Appends  &apos;_1&apos;
              (&apos;_2&apos;, ...) to the name of the new file.
&#12;       -a time
              Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]]. This option is only
              used with the &apos;adjust&apos; action. Examples: 1  adds  one  hour,  1:01
              adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30 subtracts 30 seconds.

       -Y yrs Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of years, for the
              &apos;adjust&apos; action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number  of  months,  for
              the &apos;adjust&apos; action.

       -D day Time  adjustment by a positive or negative number of days, for the
              &apos;adjust&apos; action.

       -p mode
              Print mode for the &apos;print&apos; action. Possible modes are:
              s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
              a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
              t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
              v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
              h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
              i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
              x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
              c : JPEG comment
              p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image size in
              pixels

       -P flgs
              Print  flags  for  fine  control of the tag list (&apos;print&apos; action).
              Allows control of the type of metadata as  well  as  data  columns
              included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
              E : include Exif tags in the list
              I : IPTC datasets
              X : XMP properties
              x : print a column with the tag number
              g : group name
              k : key
              l : tag label
              n : tag name
              y : type
              c : number of components (count)
              s : size in bytes
              v : plain data value
              t : interpreted (translated) data
              h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the &apos;delete&apos; action. Possible targets are:
              a : all supported metadata (the default)
              e : Exif section
              t : Exif thumbnail only
              i : IPTC data
              x : XMP packet
              c : JPEG comment

       -i tgt Insert target(s) for the &apos;insert&apos; action. Possible targets are the
              same as those for the -d option, plus a modifier:
              X : Insert metadata from  an  XMP  sidecar  file  &lt;file&gt;.xmp.  The
              remaining  insert  targets  determine what metadata to insert from
              the sidecar file. Possible are Exif, IPTC and XMP and the  default
              is  all  of  these.  Note that the inserted XMP properties include
              those converted to Exif and IPTC.
              Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF  thumbnails),  they
              need to be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract  target(s)  for the &apos;extract&apos; action. Possible targets are
              the same as those for the -d option, plus a target to extract pre&#8208;
              view images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
              p[&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;m&gt; ...]] : Extract preview images. The optional comma sep&#8208;
              arated list of preview image numbers is used  to  determine  which
              preview  images to extract. The available preview images and their
              numbers are displayed with the &apos;print&apos; option -pp.
              X : Extract metadata  to  an  XMP  sidecar  file  &lt;file&gt;.xmp.  The
              remaining  extract  targets  determine what metadata to extract to
              the sidecar file. Possible are Exif, IPTC and XMP and the  default
              is all of these.

       -r fmt Filename format for the &apos;rename&apos; action. The format string follows
              strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:
              :basename:   - original filename without extension
              :dirname:    - name of the directory holding the original file
              :parentname: - name of parent directory
              Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image  (&apos;modify&apos;  action).  This
              option can also be used with the &apos;extract&apos; and &apos;insert&apos; actions to
              modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
              Command file for the &apos;modify&apos; action. This option can also be used
              with the &apos;extract&apos; and &apos;insert&apos; actions to modify metadata on-the-
              fly.

       -M cmd Command line for the &apos;modify&apos; action. This option can also be used
              with the &apos;extract&apos; and &apos;insert&apos; actions to modify metadata on-the-
              fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that of the lines
              of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
              Use suffix .suf for source files in &apos;insert&apos; action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the &apos;modify&apos; action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

          exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

          exiv2 -M&quot;add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith&quot; image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined.

       When  writing  Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with  types  and  values
       different  from  those  specified  in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to  read  all
       metadata  that  it  can  write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key  or  add  the
              tag.

       add    Add  a  tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre&#8208;
              vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational  |  Undefined  |  SShort  |
              SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
              String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
              XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

              A default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default is
              determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It can optionally  be
              enclosed in single quotes (&apos;value&apos;) or double quotes (&quot;value&quot;).

              The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent to an
              empty value (&quot;&quot;) and is mainly useful to create an XMP array prop&#8208;
              erty, e.g., a bag.

              The  format  of  Exif  Comment values includes an optional charset
              specification at the beginning:

              [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

              Undefined is used by default if the value  doesn&apos;t  start  with  a
              charset definition.

              The  format for IPTC Date values is YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day),
              that for IPTC Time  values  is  HH:MM:SS+|-HH:MM,  where  HH:MM:SS
              refers  to  local  hour, minute and seconds and +|-HH:MM refers to
              hours and minutes ahead or behind Universal Coordinated Time  (+|-
              means either a + or a - sign is required).

              The  format  of  XMP  LangAlt values includes an optional language
              qualifier:

              [lang=language-code ]text

              x-default is used by default if the value  doesn&apos;t  start  with  a
              language qualifier.

       An additional command is available to register XMP namespaces:

       reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a command file are ignored (com&#8208;
       ments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
              Prints a summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in the
              directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
              Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
              Renames   img_1234.jpg   (taken   on  13-Nov-05  at  22:58:31)  to
              20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r&apos;:basename:_%Y%m&apos; rename img_1234.jpg
              Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
              Extracts  the  Exif   thumbnails   from   the   two   files   into
              img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
              Inserts  (copies)  metadata  from  img1.exv  to  img1.jpg and from
              img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
              Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the  files  image-pre&#8208;
              view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
              Extracts  IPTC  datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
              the process converts them to &quot;IPTC Core&quot; XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
              Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar  file  image.xmp
              into  image.jpg.   The  resulting IPTC datasets are converted from
              the &quot;IPTC Core&quot; XMP schema properties in the sidecar file  to  the
              older  IPTC IIM4 format. The inserted XMP properties include those
              in the &quot;IPTC Core&quot; XMP schema.

       exiv2 -M&quot;set Exif.Photo.UserComment charset=Ascii New Exif comment&quot; image.jpg
              Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.

       exiv2 -M&quot;set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude 4/1 15/1 33/1&quot; \
              -M&quot;set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N&quot; image.jpg
              Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33  seconds  north.
              The  Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude tag consists of
              three Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds of the
              latitude  and  GPSLatitudeRef contains either &apos;N&apos; or &apos;S&apos; for north
              or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
              Copy all metadata from CRW files in  the  /tmp  directory  to  JPG
              files  with  corresponding  basenames in the /data directory. Note
              that this copies metadata as  is,  without  any  modifications  to
              adapt  it  to  the  requirements  of  the target format. Some tags
              copied like this may not make sense in the target image.
