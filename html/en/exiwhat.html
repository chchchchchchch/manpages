EXIWHAT(8)                                                            EXIWHAT(8)



NAME
       exiwhat - Finding out what Exim processes are doing

SYNOPSIS
       exiwhat


DESCRIPTION
       On  operating  systems  that  can restart a system call after receiving a
       signal (most modern OS), an Exim process responds to the  SIGUSR1  signal
       by   writing   a   line   describing   what  it  is  doing  to  the  file
       exim-process.info in the Exim spool directory.  The exiwhat script  sends
       the  signal  to  all Exim processes it can find, having first emptied the
       file.  It then waits for one second to allow the Exim processes to  react
       before  displaying the results.  In order to run exiwhat successfully you
       have to have sufficient privilege to send the signal  to  the  Exim  pro&#8208;
       cesses, so it is normally run as root.

       Unfortunately,  the  ps command which exiwhat uses to find Exim processes
       varies in different operating systems.  Not only  are  different  options
       used,  but the format of the output is different.  For this reason, there
       are some system configuration options that configure exactly how  exiwhat
       works.   If  it  doesn&apos;t  seem to be working for you, check the following
       compile-time options:

       EXIWHAT_PS_CMD
              the command for running &#8220;ps&#8221;

       EXIWHAT_PS_ARG
              the argument for &#8220;ps&#8221;

       EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG
              the argument for &#8220;egrep&#8221; to select from &#8220;ps&#8221; output

       EXIWHAT_KILL_ARG
              the argument for the &#8220;kill&#8221; command

       An example of typical output from exiwhat is

         164 daemon: -q1h, listening on port 25
       10483 running queue: waiting for 0tAycK-0002ij-00 (10492)
       10492 delivering 0tAycK-0002ij-00 to mail.ref.example [10.19.42.42]
         (editor@ref.example)
       10592 handling incoming call from [192.168.243.242]
       10628 accepting a local non-SMTP message

       The first number in the output line is the  process  number.   The  third
       line has been split here, in order to fit it on the page.


BUGS
       This  manual  page  needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
       than us and has more experience in  writing  manual  pages,  any  patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
