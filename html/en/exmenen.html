EXMENEN(1)                                                            EXMENEN(1)



NAME
       exmenen,  exmendis  -  enable  or  disable extra menus for GNOME, KDE and
       other XDG menu-spec compliant desktops

SYNOPSIS
       exmenen (--system | --local) [ module ]

       exmendis (--system | --local) [ module ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the exmenen and exmendis commands.

       exmenen is a script that enables the specified extra applications menu on
       either  a  system,  or per-user basis.  It does this by creating symlinks
       within /etc/xdg/menus/applications-merged/ (system wide),  or  ${XDG_CON&#8208;
       FIG_HOME}/menus/applications-merged/  (per-user).  If the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
       environment variable is unset, its default is taken to be ${HOME}/.config
       .

       Likewise,  exmendis disables an extra applications menu by removing those
       symlinks.  It is not an error to enable a menu which is already  enabled,
       or to disable one which is already disabled.

EXAMPLES
              exmendis --system electronics
              exmenen --system electronics

       Disables  the system wide extra electronics menu, enables it for the cur&#8208;
       rent user.

FILES
       /usr/share/extra-xdg-menus
              Directory with .menu files defining the available extra modules.

       /etc/xdg/menus/applications-merged
              Directory with links to the files in extra-xdg-menus  for  system-
              wide enabled extra menus.

       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/menus/applications-merged
              Directory  with links to the files in extra-xdg-menus for per-user
              enabled extra menus. If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is  unset,  the  directory
              used will be ${HOME}/.config/menus/applications-merged
