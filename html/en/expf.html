EXP(3)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     EXP(3)



NAME
       exp, expf, expl - base-e exponential function

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double exp(double x);
       float expf(float x);
       long double expl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       expf(), expl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
           || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The exp() function returns the value of e  (the  base  of  natural  loga&#8208;
       rithms) raised to the power of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the exponential value of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is negative infinity, +0 is returned.

       If the result underflows, a range error occurs, and zero is returned.

       If  the  result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return
       +HUGE_VAL, +HUGE_VALF, or +HUGE_VALL, respectively.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine  whether  an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Range error, overflow
              errno  is  set  to  ERANGE.   An overflow floating-point exception
              (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

       Range error, underflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.   An  underflow  floating-point  exception
              (FE_UNDERFLOW) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99,  POSIX.1-2001.   The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
