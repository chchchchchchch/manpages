Name
       extcheck - A utility to detect jar conflicts

       extcheck  detects  version  conflicts  between a target jar file and cur&#8208;
       rently installed extension jar files.

SYNOPSIS
       extcheck [ -verbose ] targetfile.jar


DESCRIPTION
       The extcheck utility checks a specified Jar file for  title  and  version
       conflicts  with  any  extensions  installed  in  the Java(TM) SDK. Before
       installing an extension, you can use this utility to see if the same or a
       more recent version of the extension is already installed.

       The  extcheck  utility  compares  the  Specification-title and Specifica&#8208;
       tion-version headers in the manifest of the targetfile.jar  file  against
       the  corresponding  headers  in  all Jar files currently installed in the
       extension directory. (The extension directory is jre/lib/ext by default.)
       The  extcheck  utility  compares  version  numbers in the same way as the
       method java.lang.Package.isCompatibleWith.

       If no conflict is detected, the return code is 0.

       If the manifest of any jar file in the extensions directory has the  same
       Specification-title and the same or a newer Specification-version number,
       a non-zero error code is returned. A non-zero error code is also returned
       if  targetfile.jar  does  not  have the Specification-title or Specifica&#8208;
       tion-version attributes in its manifest.

OPTIONS
          -verbose
             Lists Jar files in the extension directory  as  they  are  checked.
             Additionally,  manifest  attributes  of the target jar file and any
             conflicting jar files are also reported.

          -Joption
             Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one of the
             options  described on the reference page for the java(1). For exam&#8208;
             ple, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.
