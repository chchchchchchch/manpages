FAILLOG(5)                File Formats and Conversions                FAILLOG(5)



NAME
       faillog - login failure logging file

DESCRIPTION
       /var/log/faillog maintains a count of login failures and the limits for
       each account.

       The file contains fixed length records, indexed by numerical UID. Each
       record contains the count of login failures since the last successful
       login; the maximum number of failures before the account is disabled; the
       line on which the last login failure occurred; the date of the last login
       failure; and the duration (in seconds) during which the account will be
       locked after a failure.

       The structure of the file is:

           struct    faillog {
                short   fail_cnt;
                short   fail_max;
                char    fail_line[12];
                time_t  fail_time;
                long    fail_locktime;
           };
