NAME
       faked - daemon that remembers fake ownership/permissions of files manipu&#8208;
       lated by fakeroot processes.

SYNOPSIS
       faked  [--debug]  [--foreground]  [--cleanup]  [--key  msg-key]  [--load]
       [--save-file save-file] [--port TCP-port]

DESCRIPTION
       If a fakeroot process wants to change the ownership of a file, then faked
       is the process that remembers that new owner. If later the same  fakeroot
       process  does  a  stat()  for that filename, then the libfakeroot wrapped
       stat() call will first ask faked for the fake ownership etc of that file,
       and then report it.


OPTIONS
       --debug
              Print debugging information on stderr.

       --foreground
              Don&apos;t fork into the background.

       --cleanup  number
              Cleanup the semaphores.

       --key  key-number
              Don&apos;t allocate a new communication channel, but use channel speci&#8208;
              fied by key. (If the specified channel doesn&apos;t  exist,  it&apos;s  cre&#8208;
              ated).

       --save-file  save-file
              Save the environment to save-file on exit.

       --load Load a previously saved environment from the standard input.

       --unknown-is-real
              Use  real ownership of previously-unknown files instead of setting
              them to root:root.

       --port  tcp-port
              Use TCP port tcp-port.


BUGS
       None so far. Be warned, though: although I&apos;ve written quite  a  few  much
       larger  (and  smaller)  programs, I&apos;ve never written anything that was as
       tiny as fakeroot, had as many bugs as fakeroot, and still was  as  usable
       as,  say, fakeroot version 0.0_3, the first version that could be used to
       build itself.
