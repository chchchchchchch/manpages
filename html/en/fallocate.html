FALLOCATE(1)                      User Commands                     FALLOCATE(1)



NAME
       fallocate - preallocate space to a file

SYNOPSIS
       fallocate [-n] [-o offset] -l length filename

DESCRIPTION
       fallocate is used to preallocate blocks to a file.  For filesystems which
       support the fallocate system call, this is  done  quickly  by  allocating
       blocks  and  marking  them  as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data
       blocks.  This is much faster than creating a  file  by  filling  it  with
       zeros.

       As of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call is supported by
       the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs filesystems.

       The exit code returned by fallocate is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

OPTIONS
       The length and offset arguments may be followed by binary (2^N)  suffixes
       KiB,  MiB,  GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the &quot;iB&quot; is optional, e.g. &quot;K&quot; has the
       same meaning as &quot;KiB&quot;) or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and EB.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -n, --keep-size
              Do not modify the apparent length of the  file.  This  may  effec&#8208;
              tively allocate blocks past EOF, which can be removed with a trun&#8208;
              cate.

       -o, --offset offset
              Specifies the beginning offset of the allocation, in bytes.

       -l, --length length
              Specifies the length of the allocation, in bytes.
