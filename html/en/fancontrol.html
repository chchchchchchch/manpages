FANCONTROL(8)                                                      FANCONTROL(8)



NAME
       fancontrol - automated software based fan speed regulation


SYNOPSIS
       fancontrol [configfile]


DESCRIPTION
       fancontrol  is  a shell script for use with lm_sensors. It reads its con&#8208;
       figuration from a file, then calculates fan speeds from temperatures  and
       sets the corresponding PWM outputs to the computed values.


WARNING
       Please  be careful when using the fan control features of your mainboard,
       in addition to the risk of burning your CPU, at higher temperatures there
       will  be  a  higher wearout of your other hardware components, too. So if
       you plan to use these components in 50 years,  maybe  you  shouldn&apos;t  use
       fancontrol at all.  Also please keep in mind most fans aren&apos;t designed to
       be powered by a PWMed voltage.

       In practice it doesn&apos;t seem to be  a  major  issue,  the  fans  will  get
       slightly warmer, just be sure to have a temperature alarm and/or shutdown
       call, in case some fan fails, because you probably won&apos;t hear it  anymore
       ;)


CONFIGURATION
       For  easy  configuration,  there&apos;s a script named pwmconfig(8) which lets
       you interactively write your configuration file for fancontrol.  Alterna&#8208;
       tively  you  can write this file yourself using the information from this
       manpage.

       Since most of you are going to use pwmconfig(8) script, the  config  file
       syntax  will  be  discussed last. First I&apos;m going to describe the various
       variables available for changing fancontrol&apos;s behaviour:


       INTERVAL
              This variable defines at which interval in seconds the  main  loop
              of fancontrol will be executed

       DEVPATH
              Maps hwmon class devices to physical devices. This lets fancontrol
              check that the configuration file is still up-to-date.

       DEVNAME
              Records hwmon class device names. This lets fancontrol check  that
              the configuration file is still up-to-date.

       FCTEMPS
              Maps  PWM outputs to temperature sensors so fancontrol knows which
              temperature sensors should be used for calculation of  new  values
              for the corresponding PWM outputs.

       FCFANS Records  the  association  between  a  PWM output and a fan input.
              Then fancontrol can check the fan speed and restart it if it stops
              unexpectedly.

       MINTEMP
              The  temperature  below  which  the  fan  gets switched to minimum
              speed.

       MAXTEMP
              The temperature over which the fan gets switched to maximum speed.

       MINSTART
              Sets the minimum speed at  which  the  fan  begins  spinning.  You
              should  use  a  safe  value to be sure it works, even when the fan
              gets old.

       MINSTOP
              The minimum speed at which the fan still spins. Use a  safe  value
              here, too.

       MINPWM The PWM value to use when the temperature is below MINTEMP.  Typi&#8208;
              cally, this will be either 0 if it is OK  for  the  fan  to  plain
              stop,  or  the  same value as MINSTOP if you don&apos;t want the fan to
              ever stop.  If this value isn&apos;t defined, it defaults to 0 (stopped
              fan).

       MAXPWM The  PWM  value  to  use when the temperature is over MAXTEMP.  If
              this value isn&apos;t defined, it defaults to 255 (full speed).

       The configuration file format is a bit strange:

              VARIABLE=chip/pwmdev=value chip/pwmdev2=value2
              VARIABLE2=...

       Each variable has its own line. The variable name is followed by an equal
       sign  and  the  device=value  pairs. These consist of the path to the pwm
       output for which the value is valid, equal sign followed by the value and
       are  separated  by  a  blank.  Path  can  be  absolute  or relative (from
       /sys/bus/i2c/devices or /sys/class/hwmon depending  on  the  kernel  ver&#8208;
       sion). Example:

              MINTEMP=hwmon0/device/pwm1=40 hwmon0/device/pwm2=54

       You have to play with the temperature values a bit to get happy. For ini&#8208;
       tial setup I recommend using the pwmconfig script. Small changes  can  be
       made by editing the config file directly following the rules above.

       Upon  starting,  fancontrol will make sure that all referenced devices do
       exist and match what they were at configuration time, and that all refer&#8208;
       enced  sysfs  files  do exist. If not, it will quit immediately, upon the
       assumption that the configuration file may be out-of-sync with the loaded
       kernel drivers.


THE ALGORITHM
       fancontrol  first  reads its configuration, writes it to arrays and loops
       its main function.  This function gets  the  temperatures  and  fanspeeds
       from  kernel driver files and calculates new speeds depending on tempera&#8208;
       ture changes, but only if the temp is between MINTEMP and MAXTEMP.  After
       that,  the new values are written to the PWM outputs. Currently the speed
       increases quadratically with rising temperature. This way you won&apos;t  hear
       your fans most of the time at best.
