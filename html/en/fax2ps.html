FAX2PS(1)                                                              FAX2PS(1)



NAME
       fax2ps - convert a TIFF facsimile to compressed PostScript&#8482;

SYNOPSIS
       fax2ps [ options ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fax2ps  reads  one  or  more TIFF facsimile image files and prints a com&#8208;
       pressed form of PostScript on the standard output that  is  suitable  for
       printing.

       By default, each page is scaled to reflect the image dimensions and reso&#8208;
       lutions stored in the file.  The -x and -y options can be used to specify
       the horizontal and vertical image resolutions (lines/inch), respectively.
       If the -S option is specified, each page is  scaled  to  fill  an  output
       page.   The  default  output  page  is  8.5 by 11 inches.  Alternate page
       dimensions can be specified in inches with the -W and -H options.

       By default fax2ps generates PostScript for all pages in the file.  The -p
       option  can  be  used to select one or more pages from a multi-page docu&#8208;
       ment.

       fax2ps generates a compressed form of PostScript that  is  optimized  for
       sending  pages of text to a PostScript printer attached to a host through
       a low-speed link (such as a serial line).  Each  output  page  is  filled
       with white and then only the black areas are drawn.  The PostScript spec&#8208;
       ification of the black drawing operations is optimized by using a special
       font  that  encodes  the  move-draw operations required to fill the black
       regions on the page.  This compression scheme typically results in a sub&#8208;
       stantially  reduced  PostScript description, relative to the straightfor&#8208;
       ward imaging of the page with a PostScript image  operator.   This  algo&#8208;
       rithm can, however, be ineffective for continuous-tone and white-on-black
       images.  For these images, it sometimes is more  efficient  to  send  the
       raster bitmap image directly; see tiff2ps(1).

OPTIONS
       -p number Print  only  the indicated page.  Multiple pages may be printed
                 by specifying this option more than once.

       -x resolution
                 Use resolution as the horizontal resolution, in  dots/inch,  of
                 the image data.  By default this value is taken from the file.

       -y resolution
                 Use  resolution  as  the vertical resolution, in lines/inch, of
                 the image data.  By default this value is taken from the file.

       -S        Scale each page of image data to fill the  output  page  dimen&#8208;
                 sions.  By default images are presented according to the dimen&#8208;
                 sion information recorded in the TIFF file.

       -W width  Use width as the width, in inches, of the output page.

       -H height Use height as the height, in inches, of the output page.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Some messages about malformed TIFF images come from the TIFF library.

       Various messages about badly formatted facsimile images may be  generated
       due  to  transmission  errors  in received facsimile.  fax2ps attempts to
       recover from such data errors by resynchronizing decoding at the  end  of
       the  current scanline.  This can result in long horizontal black lines in
       the resultant PostScript image.

NOTES
       If the destination printer supports PostScript Level II then it is always
       faster  to  just send the encoded bitmap generated by the tiff2ps(1) pro&#8208;
       gram.

BUGS
       fax2ps should probably figure out when it is doing a  poor  job  of  com&#8208;
       pressing  the  output  and  just  generate PostScript to image the bitmap
       raster instead.
