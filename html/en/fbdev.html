NAME
       fbdev - video driver for framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
       Section &quot;Device&quot;
         Identifier &quot;devname&quot;
         Driver &quot;fbdev&quot;
         BusID  &quot;pci:bus:dev:func&quot;
         ...
       EndSection

DESCRIPTION
       fbdev  is an Xorg driver for framebuffer devices.  This is a non-acceler&#8208;
       ated driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported: 8,  15,  16,
       24.   All visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor visual is
       supported for the other depths.  Multi-head configurations are supported.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The fbdev driver supports all hardware  where  a  framebuffer  driver  is
       available.   fbdev  uses  the os-specific submodule fbdevhw(4) to talk to
       the kernel device driver.  Currently a fbdevhw module  is  available  for
       linux.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer  to  xorg.conf(5)  for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen section
       of  the  config  file.   The  fbdev driver can pick up the currently used
       video mode from the framebuffer driver and will use it if  there  are  no
       video modes configured.

       For  PCI boards you might have to add a BusID line to the Device section.
       See above for a sample line.  You can use &quot;Xorg -scanpci&quot; to  figure  out
       the correct values.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;fbdev&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              The framebuffer device to use. Default: /dev/fb0.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              on.

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Enable rotation of the display.  The  supported  values  are  &quot;CW&quot;
              (clockwise, 90 degrees), &quot;UD&quot; (upside down, 180 degrees) and &quot;CCW&quot;
              (counter clockwise, 270 degrees). Implies use of the shadow frame&#8208;
              buffer layer.   Default: off.
