NAME
       fbxkb - a lightweight X11 keyboard switcher.

SYNOPSIS
       fbxkb

DESCRIPTION
       fbxkb  is  X11 keyboard switcher, which provides visual information about
       current keyboard. It shows a flag of current keyboard in a  systray  area
       and allows you to switch to another one.

       fbxkb  requires  NETWM  (www.freedesktop.org)  compliant  window manager.
       It&apos;s written in C and  uses  the  GTK+-2.4  library  only  (no  GNOME  is
       needed).

       Most   updated   info  about  fbxkb  can  be  found  on  its  home  page:
       http://fbxkb.sf.net/

OPTIONS
       fbxkb hasn&apos;t options. It just works.
