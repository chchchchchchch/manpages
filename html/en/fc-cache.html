FC-CACHE(1)                                                          FC-CACHE(1)



NAME
       fc-cache - build font information cache files

SYNOPSIS
       fc-cache  [  -frsvVh ] [ --force ] [ --really-force ] [ --system-only ] [
       --verbose ] [ --version ] [ --help ] [ dir ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       fc-cache scans the font directories on the system and builds font  infor&#8208;
       mation  cache files for applications using fontconfig for their font han&#8208;
       dling.

       If directory arguments are not given, fc-cache uses each directory in the
       current  font  configuration.  Each  directory  is scanned for font files
       readable by FreeType.  A cache is created which  contains  properties  of
       each  font  and  the associated filename.  This cache is used to speed up
       application startup when using the fontconfig library.

       Note that fc-cache must be executed once  per  architecture  to  generate
       font information customized for that architecture.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;).  A summary of options is included below.

       -f --force
              Force re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache files, overrid&#8208;
              ing the timestamp checking.

       -r --really-force
              Erase all existing cache files and rescan.

       -s --system-only
              Only  scan system-wide directories, omitting the places located in
              the user&apos;s home directory.

       -v --verbose
              Display status information while busy.

       -h --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V --version
              Show version of the program and exit.

       dir    Directory to scan for fonts.

FILES
       %cachdir%/*-%arch%.cache-2
              These files are generated by fc-cache and contain maps  from  file
              names  to font properties. They are read by the fontconfig library
              at application startup to locate appropriate fonts.
