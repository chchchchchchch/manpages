CHOWN(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   CHOWN(2)



NAME
       chown, fchown, lchown - change ownership of a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
       int fchown(int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
       int lchown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fchown(), lchown():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
           || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       These system calls change the owner and group of a file.  The differ only
       in how the file is specified:

       * chown()  changes  the ownership of the file specified by path, which is
         dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.

       * fchown() changes the ownership of the file referred to by the open file
         descriptor fd.

       * lchown() is like chown(), but does not dereference symbolic links.

       Only  a privileged process (Linux: one with the CAP_CHOWN capability) may
       change the owner of a file.  The owner of a file may change the group  of
       the  file  to  any  group  of which that owner is a member.  A privileged
       process (Linux: with CAP_CHOWN) may change the group arbitrarily.

       If the owner or group is specified as -1, then that ID is not changed.

       When the owner or group of an executable file are changed by an  unprivi&#8208;
       leged user the S_ISUID and S_ISGID mode bits are cleared.  POSIX does not
       specify whether this also should happen when root does the  chown();  the
       Linux  behavior  depends  on the kernel version.  In case of a non-group-
       executable file (i.e., one for which the S_IXGRP  bit  is  not  set)  the
       S_ISGID bit indicates mandatory locking, and is not cleared by a chown().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       Depending on the file system, other errors can  be  returned.   The  more
       general errors for chown() are listed below.

       EACCES Search  permission  is  denied  on a component of the path prefix.
              (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EFAULT path points outside your accessible address space.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving path.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              path is too long.

       ENOENT The file does not exist.
&#12;       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EPERM  The calling process did not have  the  required  permissions  (see
              above) to change owner and/or group.

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The general errors for fchown() are listed below:

       EBADF  The descriptor is not valid.

       EIO    A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.

       ENOENT See above.

       EPERM  See above.

       EROFS  See above.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

       The  4.4BSD  version can only be used by the superuser (that is, ordinary
       users cannot give away files).

NOTES
       The original Linux chown(), fchown(), and lchown() system calls supported
       only 16-bit user and group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added chown32(),
       fchown32(), and lchown32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.   The  glibc  chown(),
       fchown(),  and  lchown()  wrapper  functions  transparently deal with the
       variations across kernel versions.

       When a new file is created (by, for example, open(2)  or  mkdir(2)),  its
       owner  is  made  the  same  as  the  file  system user ID of the creating
       process.  The group of the file depends on a range of factors,  including
       the  type  of file system, the options used to mount the file system, and
       whether or not the set-group-ID permission bit is enabled on  the  parent
       directory.   If  the  file system supports the -o grpid (or, synonymously
       -o bsdgroups) and -o nogrpid (or,  synonymously  -o sysvgroups)  mount(8)
       options, then the rules are as follows:

       * If  the  file  system is mounted with -o grpid, then the group of a new
         file is made the same as that of the parent directory.

       * If the file system is mounted with -o nogrpid and the set-group-ID  bit
         is  disabled  on  the parent directory, then the group of a new file is
         made the same as the process&apos;s file system GID.

       * If the file system is mounted with -o nogrpid and the set-group-ID  bit
         is  enabled  on  the  parent directory, then the group of a new file is
         made the same as that of the parent directory.

       As at Linux 2.6.25, the -o grpid and -o nogrpid mount  options  are  sup&#8208;
       ported  by  ext2,  ext3,  ext4, and XFS.  File systems that don&apos;t support
       these mount options follow the -o nogrpid rules.

       The chown() semantics are deliberately violated on NFS file systems which
       have  UID  mapping  enabled.   Additionally,  the semantics of all system
       calls which access the file contents are violated,  because  chown()  may
       cause  immediate  access  revocation  on already open files.  Client side
       caching may lead to a delay between the time where  ownership  have  been
       changed  to allow access for a user and the time where the file can actu&#8208;
       ally be accessed by the user on other clients.
&#12;       In versions of Linux prior to 2.1.81 (and distinct from 2.1.46),  chown()
       did  not  follow symbolic links.  Since Linux 2.1.81, chown() does follow
       symbolic links, and there is a new system call  lchown()  that  does  not
       follow  symbolic  links.  Since Linux 2.1.86, this new call (that has the
       same semantics as the old chown()) has got the same syscall  number,  and
       chown() got the newly introduced number.

EXAMPLE
       The following program changes the ownership of the file named in its sec&#8208;
       ond command-line argument to the value specified in  its  first  command-
       line  argument.   The new owner can be specified either as a numeric user
       ID, or as a username (which is converted to a user  ID  by  using  getpw&#8208;
       nam(3) to perform a lookup in the system password file).

       #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           uid_t uid;
           struct passwd *pwd;
           char *endptr;

           if (argc != 3 || argv[1][0] == &apos;\0&apos;) {
               fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s &lt;owner&gt; &lt;file&gt;\n&quot;, argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           uid = strtol(argv[1], &amp;endptr, 10);  /* Allow a numeric string */

           if (*endptr != &apos;\0&apos;) {         /* Was not pure numeric string */
               pwd = getpwnam(argv[1]);   /* Try getting UID for username */
               if (pwd == NULL) {
                   perror(&quot;getpwnam&quot;);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               uid = pwd-&gt;pw_uid;
           }

           if (chown(argv[2], uid, -1) == -1) {
               perror(&quot;chown&quot;);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
