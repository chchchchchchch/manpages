ECVT(3)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    ECVT(3)



NAME
       ecvt, fcvt - convert a floating-point number to a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *ecvt(double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int *sign);

       char *fcvt(double number, int ndigits, int *decpt, int *sign);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ecvt(), fcvt():
           Since glibc 2.12:
               _SVID_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
                       _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &amp;&amp;
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600)
           Before glibc 2.12:
               _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The ecvt() function converts number to a null-terminated string of  ndig&#8208;
       its  digits  (where  ndigits is reduced to a system-specific limit deter&#8208;
       mined by the precision of a double), and returns a pointer to the string.
       The  high-order  digit  is nonzero, unless number is zero.  The low order
       digit is rounded.  The string itself does not contain  a  decimal  point;
       however,  the  position of the decimal point relative to the start of the
       string is stored in *decpt.  A negative value for *decpt means  that  the
       decimal  point is to the left of the start of the string.  If the sign of
       number is negative, *sign is set to a nonzero value, otherwise it is  set
       to 0.  If number is zero, it is unspecified whether *decpt is 0 or 1.

       The fcvt() function is identical to ecvt(), except that ndigits specifies
       the number of digits after the decimal point.

RETURN VALUE
       Both the ecvt() and fcvt() functions return a pointer to a static  string
       containing  the  ASCII  representation  of  number.  The static string is
       overwritten by each call to ecvt() or fcvt().

CONFORMING TO
       SVr2; marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the  speci&#8208;
       fications  of  ecvt()  and  fcvt(),  recommending  the  use of sprintf(3)
       instead (though snprintf(3) may be preferable).

NOTES
       Linux libc4 and libc5 specified the type of ndigits as size_t.   Not  all
       locales use a point as the radix character (&quot;decimal point&quot;).
