       fdisk -l [-u] [device...]

       fdisk -s partition...

       fdisk -h

DESCRIPTION
       fdisk (in the first form of invocation) is a menu-driven program for cre&#8208;
       ation and manipulation of partition tables.  It understands DOS-type par&#8208;
       tition tables and BSD- or SUN-type disklabels.

       fdisk  does  not  understand  GUID  partition tables (GPTs) and it is not
       designed for large partitions.  In these cases, use the more advanced GNU
       parted(8).

       fdisk  does not use DOS-compatible mode and cylinders as display units by
       default.  The old deprecated DOS behavior can be enabled with the &apos;-c=dos
       -u=cylinders&apos; command-line options.

       Hard  disks  can  be divided into one or more logical disks called parti&#8208;
       tions.  This division is recorded in the partition table, found in sector
       0  of  the  disk.   (In the BSD world one talks about `disk slices&apos; and a
       `disklabel&apos;.)

       Linux needs at least one partition, namely for its root file system.   It
       can  use swap files and/or swap partitions, but the latter are more effi&#8208;
       cient.  So, usually one will want a second Linux partition  dedicated  as
       swap  partition.   On  Intel-compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots the
       system can often only access the first 1024 cylinders of the  disk.   For
       this  reason people with large disks often create a third partition, just
       a few MB large, typically mounted on /boot, to store the kernel image and
       a  few  auxiliary files needed at boot time, so as to make sure that this
       stuff is accessible to the BIOS.  There may be reasons of security,  ease
       of  administration  and  backup, or testing, to use more than the minimum
       number of partitions.


DEVICES
       The device is usually /dev/sda, /dev/sdb or so.  A device name refers  to
       the  entire  disk.  Old systems without libata (a library used inside the
       Linux kernel to support ATA host controllers and devices) make a  differ&#8208;
       ence  between  IDE and SCSI disks.  In such cases the device name will be
       /dev/hd* (IDE) or /dev/sd* (SCSI).

       The partition is a device name followed by a partition number.  For exam&#8208;
       ple,  /dev/sda1 is the first partition on the first hard disk in the sys&#8208;
       tem.  See also Linux kernel documentation (the  Documentation/devices.txt
       file).


DISK LABELS
       A  BSD/SUN-type  disklabel  can describe 8 partitions, the third of which
       should be a `whole disk&apos; partition.  Do not start a partition that  actu&#8208;
       ally  uses  its first sector (like a swap partition) at cylinder 0, since
       that will destroy the disklabel.

       An IRIX/SGI-type disklabel can describe 16 partitions,  the  eleventh  of
       which  should  be an entire `volume&apos; partition, while the ninth should be
       labeled `volume header&apos;.  The volume header will also cover the partition
       table,  i.e.,  it  starts  at block zero and extends by default over five
       cylinders.  The remaining space in the  volume  header  may  be  used  by
       header  directory  entries.   No  partitions  may overlap with the volume
       header.  Also do not change its type or make some filesystem on it, since
       you  will  lose  the  partition  table.  Use this type of label only when
       working with Linux on IRIX/SGI machines or IRIX/SGI disks under Linux.

       A DOS-type partition table can describe an  unlimited  number  of  parti&#8208;
       tions.   In  sector  0  there is room for the description of 4 partitions
       (called `primary&apos;).  One of these may be an extended partition; this is a
       box  holding  logical partitions, with descriptors found in a linked list
       of sectors, each preceding the  corresponding  logical  partitions.   The
       four primary partitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4.  Logical parti&#8208;
       tions start numbering from 5.

       In a DOS-type partition table the starting offset and the  size  of  each
       partition  is stored in two ways: as an absolute number of sectors (given
       in 32 bits), and as a Cylinders/Heads/Sectors  triple  (given  in  10+8+6
       bits).   The former is OK -- with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2
       TB.  The latter has two problems.   First,  these  C/H/S  fields  can  be
       filled  only when the number of heads and the number of sectors per track
       are known.  And second, even if we know what these numbers should be, the
       24  bits that are available do not suffice.  DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows
       uses both, Linux never uses C/H/S.

       If possible, fdisk will obtain the disk geometry automatically.  This  is
       not  necessarily  the physical disk geometry (indeed, modern disks do not
       really have anything like a physical geometry,  certainly  not  something
       that can be described in simplistic Cylinders/Heads/Sectors form), but it
       is the disk geometry that MS-DOS uses for the partition table.

       Usually all goes well by default, and there are no problems if  Linux  is
       the  only system on the disk.  However, if the disk has to be shared with
       other operating systems, it is often a good idea to  let  an  fdisk  from
       another  operating  system make at least one partition.  When Linux boots
       it looks at the partition table, and tries to deduce what (fake) geometry
       is required for good cooperation with other systems.

       Whenever  a  partition  table is printed out, a consistency check is per&#8208;
       formed on the partition table entries.   This  check  verifies  that  the
       physical  and  logical  start and end points are identical, and that each
       partition starts and ends on a cylinder boundary (except  for  the  first
       partition).

       Some  versions of MS-DOS create a first partition which does not begin on
       a cylinder boundary, but on sector 2 of the first  cylinder.   Partitions
       beginning  in cylinder 1 cannot begin on a cylinder boundary, but this is
       unlikely to cause difficulty unless you have OS/2 on your machine.

       A sync() and an ioctl(BLKRRPART) (reread partition table from  disk)  are
       performed before exiting when the partition table has been updated.  Long
       ago it used to be necessary to reboot after the use of fdisk.  I  do  not
       think  this  is  the  case anymore -- indeed, rebooting too quickly might
       cause loss of not-yet-written data.  Note that both the  kernel  and  the
       disk hardware may buffer data.


DOS 6.x WARNING
       The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first sector
       of the data area of the partition, and treats this  information  as  more
       reliable than the information in the partition table.  DOS FORMAT expects
       DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes of the data area  of  a  partition
       whenever a size change occurs.  DOS FORMAT will look at this extra infor&#8208;
       mation even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this a bug in DOS FOR&#8208;
       MAT and DOS FDISK.

       The  bottom line is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to change the size of
       a DOS partition table entry, then you must also use dd to zero the  first
       512  bytes of that partition before using DOS FORMAT to format the parti&#8208;
       tion.  For example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS partition  ta&#8208;
       ble  entry for /dev/sda1, then (after exiting fdisk or cfdisk and reboot&#8208;
       ing Linux so that the partition table information is valid) you would use
       the  command  &quot;dd  if=/dev/zero  of=/dev/sda1 bs=512 count=1&quot; to zero the
       first 512 bytes of the partition.

       BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL if you use the dd command, since a  small  typo  can
       make all of the data on your disk useless.

       For  best  results,  you should always use an OS-specific partition table
       program.  For example, you should make DOS partitions with the DOS  FDISK
       program  and  Linux  partitions with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk pro&#8208;
       gram.


OPTIONS
       -b sectorsize
              Specify the sector size of the disk.  Valid values are 512,  1024,
              2048  or  4096.   (Recent  kernels know the sector size.  Use this
              only on old kernels or to override  the  kernel&apos;s  ideas.)   Since
              util-linux-2.17, fdisk differentiates between logical and physical
              sector size.  This option changes both sector sizes to sectorsize.

       -c[=mode]
              Specify the compatiblity mode, &apos;dos&apos; or &apos;nondos&apos;.  The default  is
              non-DOS  mode.   For backward compatibility, it is possible to use
              the option without the &lt;mode&gt; argument  --  then  the  default  is
              used.   Note that the optional &lt;mode&gt; argument cannot be separated
              from the -c option by a space, the correct  form  is  for  example
              &apos;-c=dos&apos;.

       -C cyls
              Specify  the  number of cylinders of the disk.  I have no idea why
              anybody would want to do so.

       -H heads
              Specify the number of heads of the disk.  (Not the  physical  num&#8208;
              ber,  of  course, but the number used for partition tables.)  Rea&#8208;
              sonable values are 255 and 16.

       -S sects
              Specify the number of sectors per track of  the  disk.   (Not  the
              physical  number,  of  course,  but  the number used for partition
              tables.)  A reasonable value is 63.

       -h     Print help and then exit.

       -l     List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit.
              If  no  devices are given, those mentioned in /proc/partitions (if
              that exists) are used.

       -s partition...
              Print the size (in blocks) of each given partition.

       -u[=unit]
              When listing partition tables,  show  sizes  in  &apos;sectors&apos;  or  in
              &apos;cylinders&apos;.   The default is to show sizes in sectors.  For back&#8208;
              ward compatibility, it is possible to use the option  without  the
              &lt;units&gt;  argument  --  then  the  default  is used.  Note that the
              optional &lt;unit&gt; argument cannot be separated from the -u option by
              a space, the correct form is for example &apos;-u=cylinders&apos;.

       -v     Print version number of fdisk program and exit.

BUGS
       There  are  several  *fdisk  programs  around.  Each has its problems and
       strengths.  Try them in the order cfdisk, fdisk, sfdisk.  (Indeed, cfdisk
       is  a  beautiful  program  that  has strict requirements on the partition
       tables it accepts, and produces high quality partition tables.  Use it if
       you  can.   fdisk  is a buggy program that does fuzzy things - usually it
       happens to produce reasonable results.  Its single advantage is  that  it
       has  some support for BSD disk labels and other non-DOS partition tables.
       Avoid it if you can.  sfdisk is for hackers only -- the user interface is
       terrible,  but  it is more correct than fdisk and more powerful than both
       fdisk and cfdisk.  Moreover, it can be used noninteractively.)

       These days there also is parted.  The  cfdisk  interface  is  nicer,  but
       parted  does  much  more:  it  not  only resizes partitions, but also the
       filesystems that live in them.

       The IRIX/SGI-type disklabel is currently not  supported  by  the  kernel.
       Moreover, IRIX/SGI header directories are not fully supported yet.

       The option `dump partition table to file&apos; is missing.
