FOPEN(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   FOPEN(3)



NAME
       fopen, fdopen, freopen - stream open functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);

       FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);

       FILE *freopen(const char *path, const char *mode, FILE *stream);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fdopen(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  fopen()  function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to
       by path and associates a stream with it.

       The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the  following
       sequences  (possibly  followed  by  additional  characters,  as described
       below):

       r      Open text file for reading.   The  stream  is  positioned  at  the
              beginning of the file.

       r+     Open  for  reading  and  writing.  The stream is positioned at the
              beginning of the file.

       w      Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.  The
              stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

       w+     Open  for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
              exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream is positioned at the
              beginning of the file.

       a      Open  for appending (writing at end of file).  The file is created
              if it does not exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of  the
              file.

       a+     Open for reading and appending (writing at end of file).  The file
              is created if it does not exist.  The initial  file  position  for
              reading  is  at  the  beginning  of the file, but output is always
              appended to the end of the file.

       The mode string can also include the letter &apos;b&apos; either as a last  charac&#8208;
       ter  or as a character between the characters in any of the two-character
       strings described above.  This is strictly for compatibility with C89 and
       has  no  effect;  the  &apos;b&apos;  is  ignored  on all POSIX conforming systems,
       including Linux.  (Other systems may treat text files  and  binary  files
       differently,  and  adding  the  &apos;b&apos; may be a good idea if you do I/O to a
       binary file and expect that your program may be ported to non-UNIX  envi&#8208;
       ronments.)

       See NOTES below for details of glibc extensions for mode.

       Any  created files will have mode S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP |
       S_IROTH | S_IWOTH (0666), as modified by the process&apos;s umask  value  (see
       umask(2)).

       Reads  and  writes  may be intermixed on read/write streams in any order.
       Note that ANSI C requires that  a  file  positioning  function  intervene
       between  output  and  input, unless an input operation encounters end-of-
       file.  (If this condition is not met, then a read is  allowed  to  return
       the  result  of writes other than the most recent.)  Therefore it is good
       practice (and indeed sometimes necessary under Linux) to put an  fseek(3)
       or  fgetpos(3)  operation  between  write  and  read operations on such a
       stream.  This operation may be an apparent no-op (as  in  fseek(...,  0L,
       SEEK_CUR) called for its synchronizing side effect.

       Opening  a  file in append mode (a as the first character of mode) causes
       all subsequent write operations to this stream to occur  at  end-of-file,
       as if preceded the call:

           fseek(stream,0,SEEK_END);

       The fdopen() function associates a stream with the existing file descrip&#8208;
       tor, fd.  The mode of the stream (one of the values &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r+&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;,
       &quot;a&quot;,  &quot;a+&quot;) must be compatible with the mode of the file descriptor.  The
       file position indicator of the new stream is set to that belonging to fd,
       and  the error and end-of-file indicators are cleared.  Modes &quot;w&quot; or &quot;w+&quot;
       do not cause truncation of the file.  The file descriptor is not  dup&apos;ed,
       and  will  be  closed when the stream created by fdopen() is closed.  The
       result of applying fdopen() to a shared memory object is undefined.

       The freopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to
       by  path  and  associates  the  stream pointed to by stream with it.  The
       original stream (if it exists) is closed.  The mode argument is used just
       as in the fopen() function.  The primary use of the freopen() function is
       to change the file associated with a standard text stream (stderr, stdin,
       or stdout).

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion fopen(), fdopen() and freopen() return a FILE
       pointer.  Otherwise, NULL is returned and errno is set  to  indicate  the
       error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The mode provided to fopen(), fdopen(), or freopen() was invalid.

       The fopen(), fdopen() and freopen() functions may also fail and set errno
       for any of the errors specified for the routine malloc(3).

       The fopen() function may also fail and set errno for any  of  the  errors
       specified for the routine open(2).

       The  fdopen()  function may also fail and set errno for any of the errors
       specified for the routine fcntl(2).

       The freopen() function may also fail and set errno for any of the  errors
       specified for the routines open(2), fclose(3) and fflush(3).

CONFORMING TO
       The  fopen()  and freopen() functions conform to C89.  The fdopen() func&#8208;
       tion conforms to POSIX.1-1990.

NOTES
   Glibc Notes
       The GNU C library allows the following extensions for the  string  speci&#8208;
       fied in mode:

       c (since glibc 2.3.3)
              Do not make the open operation, or subsequent read and write oper&#8208;
              ations, thread cancellation points.   This  flag  is  ignored  for
              fdopen().

       e (since glibc 2.7)
              Open  the  file  with  the  O_CLOEXEC  flag.  See open(2) for more
              information.  This flag is ignored for fdopen().

       m (since glibc 2.3)
              Attempt to access the file using mmap(2), rather than  I/O  system
              calls  (read(2),  write(2)).   Currently,  use  of mmap(2) is only
              attempted for a file opened for reading.

       x      Open the file exclusively (like the O_EXCL flag of  open(2)).   If
              the  file already exists, fopen() fails, and sets errno to EEXIST.
              This flag is ignored for fdopen().

       In addition to the above characters, fopen() and  freopen()  support  the
       following syntax in mode:

           ,ccs=string

       The  given  string  is taken as the name of a coded character set and the
       stream is marked as wide-oriented.  Thereafter, internal conversion func&#8208;
       tions  convert  I/O  to  and  from  the  character  set  string.   If the
       ,ccs=string syntax is not specified, then  the  wide-orientation  of  the
       stream is determined by the first file operation.  If that operation is a
       wide-character operation, the stream is marked wide-oriented,  and  func&#8208;
       tions to convert to the coded character set are loaded.

BUGS
       When parsing for individual flag characters in mode (i.e., the characters
       preceding the &quot;ccs&quot; specification), the glibc implementation  of  fopen()
       and  freopen() limits the number of characters examined in mode to 7 (or,
       in glibc versions before 2.14, to 6, which was not enough to include pos&#8208;
       sible  specifications  such as &quot;rb+cmxe&quot;).  The current implementation of
       fdopen() parses at most 5 characters in mode.
