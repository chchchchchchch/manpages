FDUPES(1)                                                              FDUPES(1)



NAME
       fdupes - finds duplicate files in a given set of directories

SYNOPSIS
       fdupes [ options ] DIRECTORY ...


DESCRIPTION
       Searches the given path for duplicate files. Such files are found by com&#8208;
       paring file sizes and MD5 signatures, followed by a byte-by-byte compari&#8208;
       son.


OPTIONS
       -r --recurse
              for every directory given follow subdirectories encountered within

       -R --recurse:
              for  each  directory given after this option follow subdirectories
              encountered within (note the &apos;:&apos; at the end  of  option;  see  the
              Examples section below for further explanation)

       -s --symlinks
              follow symlinked directories

       -H --hardlinks
              normally,  when two or more files point to the same disk area they
              are treated as non-duplicates; this option will change this behav&#8208;
              ior

       -n --noempty
              exclude zero-length files from consideration

       -f --omitfirst
              omit the first file in each set of matches

       -A --nohidden
              exclude hidden files from consideration

       -1 --sameline
              list each set of matches on a single line

       -S --size
              show size of duplicate files

       -m --summarize
              summarize duplicate files information

       -q --quiet
              hide progress indicator

       -d --delete
              prompt  user  for  files  to  preserve,  deleting  all others (see
              CAVEATS below)

       -N --noprompt
              when used together with --delete, preserve the first file in  each
              set of duplicates and delete the others without prompting the user

       -v --version
              display fdupes version
&#12;       -h --help
              displays help

SEE ALSO
       md5sum(1)

NOTES
       Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed together
       in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The  groups  are  then
       separated from each other by blank lines.

       When  -1 or --sameline is specified, spaces and backslash characters  (\)
       appearing in a filename are preceded by a backslash character.


EXAMPLES
       fdupes a --recurse: b
              will follow subdirectories under b, but not those under a.

       fdupes a --recurse b
              will follow subdirectories under both a and b.


CAVEATS
       If fdupes returns with an error message such as  fdupes:  error  invoking
       md5sum  it means the program has been compiled to use an external program
       to calculate MD5 signatures (otherwise, fdupes uses internal routines for
       this  purpose), and an error has occurred while attempting to execute it.
       If this is the case, the specified program should be  properly  installed
       prior to running fdupes.

       When  using  -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against acci&#8208;
       dental data loss.

       When used together with options -s or --symlink, a  user  could  acciden&#8208;
       tally preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to.

       Furthermore,  when  specifying a particular directory more than once, all
       files within that directory will be listed as their own duplicates, lead&#8208;
       ing  to  data  loss should a user preserve a file without its &quot;duplicate&quot;
       (the file itself!).
