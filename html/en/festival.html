FESTIVAL(1)                                                          FESTIVAL(1)



NAME
       festival - a text-to-speech system.

SYNOPSIS
       festival [options] [file0] [file1] ...



DESCRIPTION
       Festival  is  a general purpose text-to-speech system.  As well as simply
       rendering text as speech it can be used in an  interactive  command  mode
       for  testing  and developing various aspects of speech synthesis technol&#8208;
       ogy.

       Festival has two major modes, command and tts (text-to-speech).  When  in
       command  mode  input  (from  file or interactively) is interpreted by the
       command interpreter.  When in tts mode input is rendered as speech.  When
       in  command mode filenames that start with a left parenthesis are treated
       as literal commands and evaluated.

BUGS
       More than you can imagine.

       A  manual with much detail (though not complete) is available in distrib&#8208;
       uted as part of the system and is also accessible at
       http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/

       Although we cannot guarantee the time required  to  fix  bugs,  we  would
       appreciated it if they were reported to
       festival-bug@cstr.ed.ac.uk
