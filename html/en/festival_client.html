FESTIVAL(1)                                                          FESTIVAL(1)



NAME
       festival_client - client access to festiva; text-to-speech server mode

SYNOPSIS
       festival_client [options] [file0] [file1] ...



DESCRIPTION
       Allows  sending commands and/or test to a festival test-to-speech server.
       Festival may be started in server mode using the option --server

       festival-client allows waveforms to be generated faster as  not  time  is
       required  for start up.  See the festival manual for more details on rec&#8208;
       ommended use.


OPTIONS
       --server &lt;string&gt;
               hostname (or IP number) of server

       --port &lt;int&gt; {1314}
               port number of server process (1314)

       --output &lt;string&gt;
               file to save output waveform to

       --otype &lt;string&gt; {riff}
               output type for waveform

       --passwd &lt;string&gt;
               server passwd in plain text (optional)

       --prolog &lt;string&gt;
               filename containing commands to be  sent  to  the  server  before
               standard commands (useful when using --ttw)

       --async Asynchronous  mode,  server  may send back multiple waveforms per
               text file

       --ttw   Text to waveform: take text from first arg or stdin get server to
               return waveform(s) stored in output or operated on by aucommand.

       --withlisp
               Output lisp replies from server.

       --tts_mode &lt;string&gt;
               TTS mode for file (default is fundamental).

       --aucommand &lt;string&gt;
               command  to be applied to each waveform retruned from server. Use
               $FILE in string to refer to waveform file

BUGS
       This still isn&apos;t as general as it should be.  It seems to require lots of
       special little options which suggests the general options aren&apos;t right.
