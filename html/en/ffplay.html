FFPLAY(1)                                                              FFPLAY(1)



NAME
       ffplay - FFplay media player

SYNOPSIS
               ffplay [options] [F&lt;input_file&gt;]

DESCRIPTION
       FFplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg
       libraries and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a testbed for the
       various FFmpeg APIs.

OPTIONS
       All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept in input a
       string representing a number, which may contain one of the International
       System number postfixes, for example &apos;K&apos;, &apos;M&apos;, &apos;G&apos;.  If &apos;i&apos; is appended
       after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of powers of 10. The &apos;B&apos;
       postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be appended after another
       postfix or used alone. This allows using for example &apos;KB&apos;, &apos;MiB&apos;, &apos;G&apos; and
       &apos;B&apos; as postfix.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
       corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing with
       &quot;no&quot; the option name, for example using &quot;-nofoo&quot; in the command line will
       set to false the boolean option with name &quot;foo&quot;.

   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream
       specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s) does a given
       option belong to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
       separated from it by a colon. E.g. &quot;-codec:a:1 ac3&quot; option contains &quot;a:1&quot;
       stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore it
       would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, the option is then applied
       to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in &quot;-b:a 128k&quot; matches all
       audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams, for example &quot;-codec copy&quot;
       or &quot;-codec: copy&quot; would copy all the streams without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
           Matches the stream with this index. E.g. &quot;-threads:1 4&quot; would set the
           thread count for the second stream to 4.

       stream_type[:stream_index]
           stream_type is one of: &apos;v&apos; for video, &apos;a&apos; for audio, &apos;s&apos; for
           subtitle, &apos;d&apos; for data and &apos;t&apos; for attachments. If stream_index is
           given, then matches stream number stream_index of this type.
           Otherwise matches all streams of this type.

       p:program_id[:stream_index]
           If stream_index is given, then matches stream number stream_index in
           program with id program_id. Otherwise matches all streams in this
           program.

       #stream_id
           Matches the stream by format-specific ID.
&#12;   Generic options
       These options are shared amongst the av* tools.

       -L  Show license.

       -h, -?, -help, --help [arg]
           Show help. An optional parameter may be specified to print help about
           a specific item.

           Possible values of arg are:

           decoder=decoder_name
               Print detailed information about the decoder named decoder_name.
               Use the -decoders option to get a list of all decoders.

           encoder=encoder_name
               Print detailed information about the encoder named encoder_name.
               Use the -encoders option to get a list of all encoders.

           demuxer=demuxer_name
               Print detailed information about the demuxer named demuxer_name.
               Use the -formats option to get a list of all demuxers and muxers.

           muxer=muxer_name
               Print detailed information about the muxer named muxer_name. Use
               the -formats option to get a list of all muxers and demuxers.

       -version
           Show version.

       -formats
           Show available formats.

           The fields preceding the format names have the following meanings:

           D   Decoding available

           E   Encoding available

       -codecs
           Show all codecs known to libavcodec.

           Note that the term &apos;codec&apos; is used throughout this documentation as a
           shortcut for what is more correctly called a media bitstream format.

       -decoders
           Show available decoders.

       -encoders
           Show all available encoders.

       -bsfs
           Show available bitstream filters.

       -protocols
           Show available protocols.

       -filters
           Show available libavfilter filters.

       -pix_fmts
           Show available pixel formats.

       -sample_fmts
           Show available sample formats.
&#12;       -layouts
           Show channel names and standard channel layouts.

       -loglevel loglevel | -v loglevel
           Set the logging level used by the library.  loglevel is a number or a
           string containing one of the following values:

           quiet
           panic
           fatal
           error
           warning
           info
           verbose
           debug

           By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by
           the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log
           coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable
           AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR or NO_COLOR, or can be forced setting the
           environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR.  The use of the environment
           variable NO_COLOR is deprecated and will be dropped in a following
           FFmpeg version.

       -report
           Dump full command line and console output to a file named
           &quot;program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log&quot; in the current directory.  This file
           can be useful for bug reports.  It also implies &quot;-loglevel verbose&quot;.

           Note: setting the environment variable &quot;FFREPORT&quot; to any value has
           the same effect.

       -cpuflags flags (global)
           Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for
           testing. Do not use it unless you know what you&apos;re doing.

                   ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

   AVOptions
       These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
       libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
       -help option. They are separated into two categories:

       generic
           These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic
           options are listed under AVFormatContext options for
           containers/devices and under AVCodecContext options for codecs.

       private
           These options are specific to the given container, device or codec.
           Private options are listed under their corresponding
           containers/devices/codecs.

       For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to an
       MP3 file, use the id3v2_version private option of the MP3 muxer:

               ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

       All codec AVOptions are obviously per-stream, so the chapter on stream
       specifiers applies to them

       Note -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use -option
       0/-option 1.
&#12;       Note2 old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
       prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be removed
       soon.

   Codec AVOptions
       -b[:stream_specifier] integer (output,audio,video)
           set bitrate (in bits/s)

       -ab[:stream_specifier] integer (output,audio)
           set bitrate (in bits/s)

       -bt[:stream_specifier] integer (output,video)
           Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
           tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from
           the target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
           bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on
           quality.

           control audio-video synchronization. Most media players use audio as
           master clock, but in some cases (streaming or high quality broadcast)
           it is necessary to change that. This option is mainly used for

SYNTAX
       When evaluating specific formats, FFmpeg uses internal library parsing
       functions, shared by the tools. This section documents the syntax of some
       of these formats.

   Date
       The accepted syntax is:

               [(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
               now

       If the value is &quot;now&quot; it takes the current time.

       Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is interpreted
       as UTC.  If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
       year-month-day.

   Time duration
       The accepted syntax is:

               [-]HH:MM:SS[.m...]
               [-]S+[.m...]

       HH expresses the number of hours, MM the number a of minutes and SS the
       number of seconds.

   Video size
       Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the form
       widthxheight, or the name of a size abbreviation.

           1920x1080

   Video rate
       Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
       generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
       frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or a
       valid video frame rate abbreviation.

       The following abbreviations are recognized:

       ntsc
           30000/1001

       pal 25/1

       qntsc
           30000/1

       film
           24/1

       ntsc-film
           24000/1

   Ratio
       A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
       numerator:denominator.

       Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is considered
       valid, so you should check on the returned value if you want to exclude
       those values.

       The undefined value can be expressed using the &quot;0:0&quot; string.

   Color
       It can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a
       [0x|#]RRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by &quot;@&quot; and a string
       representing the alpha component.

       The alpha component may be a string composed by &quot;0x&quot; followed by an
       hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
       represents the opacity value (0x00/0.0 means completely transparent,
       0xff/1.0 completely opaque).  If the alpha component is not specified
       then 0xff is assumed.

       The string &quot;random&quot; will result in a random color.

EXPRESSION EVALUATION
       When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal formula
       evaluator, implemented through the libavutil/eval.h interface.

       An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
       functions.

       Two expressions expr1 and expr2 can be combined to form another
       expression &quot;expr1;expr2&quot;.  expr1 and expr2 are evaluated in turn, and the
       new expression evaluates to the value of expr2.

       The following binary operators are available: &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;^&quot;.

       The following unary operators are available: &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;.

       st(var, expr)
           Allow to store the value of the expression expr in an internal
           variable. var specifies the number of the variable where to store the
           value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function returns
           the value stored in the internal variable.  Note, Variables are
           currently not shared between expressions.

       ld(var)
           Allow to load the value of the internal variable with number var,
           which was previously stored with st(var, expr).  The function returns
           the loaded value.

       while(cond, expr)
           Evaluate expression expr while the expression cond is non-zero, and
           returns the value of the last expr evaluation, or NAN if cond was
           always false.

       ceil(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr upwards to the nearest integer.
           For example, &quot;ceil(1.5)&quot; is &quot;2.0&quot;.

       floor(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr downwards to the nearest integer.
           For example, &quot;floor(-1.5)&quot; is &quot;-2.0&quot;.

       trunc(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr towards zero to the nearest
           integer. For example, &quot;trunc(-1.5)&quot; is &quot;-1.0&quot;.

       sqrt(expr)
           Compute the square root of expr. This is equivalent to &quot;(expr)^.5&quot;.

       not(expr)
           Return 1.0 if expr is zero, 0.0 otherwise.

       pow(x, y)
           Compute the power of x elevated y, it is equivalent to &quot;(x)^(y)&quot;.
&#12;       random(x)
           Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. x is the index of
           the internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.

       hypot(x, y)
           This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it
           returns &quot;sqrt(x*x + y*y)&quot;, the length of the hypotenuse of a right
           triangle with sides of length x and y, or the distance of the point
           (x, y) from the origin.

       gcd(x, y)
           Return the greatest common divisor of x and y. If both x and y are 0
           or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.

       if(x, y)
           Evaluate x, and if the result is non-zero return the result of the
           evaluation of y, return 0 otherwise.

       ifnot(x, y)
           Evaluate x, and if the result is zero return the result of the
           evaluation of y, return 0 otherwise.

       taylor(expr, x) taylor(expr, x, id)
           Evaluate a taylor series at x.  expr represents the LD(id)-th
           derivates of f(x) at 0. If id is not specified then 0 is assumed.
           note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0 taylor(expr,
           x-y) can be used When the series does not converge the results are
           undefined.

       root(expr, max)
           Finds x where f(x)=0 in the interval 0..max.  f() must be continuous
           or the result is undefined.

       The following constants are available:

       PI  area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

       E   exp(1) (Euler&apos;s number), approximately 2.718

       PHI golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

       Assuming that an expression is considered &quot;true&quot; if it has a non-zero
       value, note that:

       &quot;*&quot; works like AND

       &quot;+&quot; works like OR

       and the construct:

               if A then B else C

       is equivalent to

               if(A,B) + ifnot(A,C)

       In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
       and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
       expressions.

       The evaluator also recognizes the International System number postfixes.
       If &apos;i&apos; is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of
       powers of 10. The &apos;B&apos; postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be
       appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows using for
       example &apos;KB&apos;, &apos;MiB&apos;, &apos;G&apos; and &apos;B&apos; as postfix.

       Follows the list of available International System postfixes, with
       indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

DECODERS
       Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the decoding of
       multimedia streams.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native decoders
       are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external library must be
       enabled manually via the corresponding &quot;--enable-lib&quot; option. You can
       list all available decoders using the configure option &quot;--list-decoders&quot;.

       You can disable all the decoders with the configure option
       &quot;--disable-decoders&quot; and selectively enable / disable single decoders
       with the options &quot;--enable-decoder=DECODER&quot; /
       &quot;--disable-decoder=DECODER&quot;.

       The option &quot;-codecs&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       decoders.

VIDEO DECODERS
       A description of some of the currently available video decoders follows.

   rawvideo
       Raw video decoder.

       This decoder decodes rawvideo streams.

       Options

       top top_field_first
           Specify the assumed field type of the input video.

           -1  the video is assumed to be progressive (default)

           0   bottom-field-first is assumed

           1   top-field-first is assumed

AUDIO DECODERS
   ffwavesynth
       Internal wave synthetizer.

       This decoder generates wave patterns according to predefined sequences.
       Its use is purely internal and the format of the data it accepts is not
       publicly documented.

   libcelt
       libcelt decoder wrapper

       libcelt allows libavcodec to decode the Xiph CELT ultra-low delay audio
       codec.  Requires the presence of the libcelt headers and library during
       configuration.  You need to explicitly configure the build with
       &quot;--enable-libcelt&quot;.

   libgsm
       libgsm decoder wrapper

       libgsm allows libavcodec to decode the GSM full rate audio codec.
       Requires the presence of the libgsm headers and library during
       configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       &quot;--enable-libgsm&quot;.

       This decoder supports both the ordinary GSM and the Microsoft variant.

   libilbc
       libilbc decoder wrapper

       libilbc allows libavcodec to decode the Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC)
       audio codec. Requires the presence of the libilbc headers and library
       during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       &quot;--enable-libilbc&quot;.

       Options

       The following option is supported by the libilbc wrapper.

       enhance
           Enable the enhancement of the decoded audio when set to 1. The
           default value is 0 (disabled).

   libopencore-amrnb
       libopencore-amrnb decoder wrapper

       libopencore-amrnb allows libavcodec to decode the Adaptive Multi-Rate
       Narrowband audio codec. Using it requires the presence of the
       libopencore-amrnb headers and library during configuration. You need to
       explicitly configure the build with &quot;--enable-libopencore-amrnb&quot;.

       An FFmpeg native decoder for AMR-NB exists, so users can decode AMR-NB
       without this library.

   libopencore-amrwb
       libopencore-amrwb decoder wrapper.

       libopencore-amrwb allows libavcodec to decode the Adaptive Multi-Rate
       Wideband audio codec. Using it requires the presence of the libopencore-
       amrwb headers and library during configuration. You need to explicitly
       configure the build with &quot;--enable-libopencore-amrwb&quot;.

       An FFmpeg native decoder for AMR-WB exists, so users can decode AMR-WB
       without this library.

DEMUXERS
       Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to read the
       multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers are
       enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the configure
       option &quot;--list-demuxers&quot;.

       You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
       &quot;--disable-demuxers&quot;, and selectively enable a single demuxer with the
       option &quot;--enable-demuxer=DEMUXER&quot;, or disable it with the option
       &quot;--disable-demuxer=DEMUXER&quot;.

       The option &quot;-formats&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       demuxers.

       The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.

   image2
       Image file demuxer.

       This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
       The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the option
       pattern_type.

       The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically determine
       the format of the images contained in the files.

       The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the same
       for all the files in the sequence.

       This demuxer accepts the following options:

       framerate
           Set the framerate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

       loop
           If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

       pattern_type
           Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

           pattern_type accepts one of the following values.

           sequence
               Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of
               files indexed by sequential numbers.

               A sequence pattern may contain the string &quot;%d&quot; or &quot;%0Nd&quot;, which
               specifies the position of the characters representing a
               sequential number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the
               form &quot;%d0Nd&quot; is used, the string representing the number in each
               filename is 0-padded and N is the total number of 0-padded digits
               representing the number. The literal character &apos;%&apos; can be
               specified in the pattern with the string &quot;%%&quot;.

               If the sequence pattern contains &quot;%d&quot; or &quot;%0Nd&quot;, the first
               filename of the file list specified by the pattern must contain a
               number inclusively contained between start_number and
               start_number+start_number_range-1, and all the following numbers
               must be sequential.

               For example the pattern &quot;img-%03d.bmp&quot; will match a sequence of
               filenames of the form img-001.bmp, img-002.bmp, ..., img-010.bmp,
               etc.; the pattern &quot;i%%m%%g-%d.jpg&quot; will match a sequence of
               filenames of the form i%m%g-1.jpg, i%m%g-2.jpg, ...,
               i%m%g-10.jpg, etc.

               Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain &quot;%d&quot; or
               &quot;%0Nd&quot;, for example to convert a single image file img.jpeg you
               can employ the command:

                       ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png

           glob
               Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

               The pattern is interpreted like a &quot;glob()&quot; pattern. This is only
               selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.

           glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)
               Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

               If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing
               support, and the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta
               character among &quot;%*?[]{}&quot; that is preceded by an unescaped &quot;%&quot;,
               the pattern is interpreted like a &quot;glob()&quot; pattern, otherwise it
               is interpreted like a sequence pattern.

               All glob special characters &quot;%*?[]{}&quot; must be prefixed with &quot;%&quot;.
               To escape a literal &quot;%&quot; you shall use &quot;%%&quot;.

               For example the pattern &quot;foo-%*.jpeg&quot; will match all the
               filenames prefixed by &quot;foo-&quot; and terminating with &quot;.jpeg&quot;, and
               &quot;foo-%?%?%?.jpeg&quot; will match all the filenames prefixed with
               &quot;foo-&quot;, followed by a sequence of three characters, and
               terminating with &quot;.jpeg&quot;.

               This pattern type is deprecated in favor of glob and sequence.

           Default value is glob_sequence.

       pixel_format
           Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the
           pixel format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

       start_number
           Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
           to read from. Default value is 0.

       start_number_range
           Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first
           image file in the sequence, starting from start_number. Default value
           is 5.

       video_size
           Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
           size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

       Examples

       &#183;   Use ffmpeg for creating a video from the images in the file sequence
           img-001.jpeg, img-002.jpeg, ..., assuming an input frame rate of 10
           frames per second:

                   ffmpeg -i &apos;img-%03d.jpeg&apos; -r 10 out.mkv

       &#183;   As above, but start by reading from a file with index 100 in the
           sequence:

                   ffmpeg -start_number 100 -i &apos;img-%03d.jpeg&apos; -r 10 out.mkv

       &#183;   Read images matching the &quot;*.png&quot; glob pattern , that is all the files
           terminating with the &quot;.png&quot; suffix:

                   ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i &quot;*.png&quot; -r 10 out.mkv

   applehttp
       Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

       This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.  The id
       field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting the discard
       flags on AVStreams (by pressing &apos;a&apos; or &apos;v&apos; in ffplay), the caller can
       decide which variant streams to actually receive.  The total bitrate of
       the variant that the stream belongs to is available in a metadata key
       named &quot;variant_bitrate&quot;.

   sbg
       SBaGen script demuxer.

       This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
       &lt;http://uazu.net/sbagen/&gt; to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
       script looks like that:

               -SE
               a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
               b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
               off: -
               NOW      == a
               +0:07:00 == b
               +0:14:00 == a
               +0:21:00 == b
               +0:30:00    off
&#12;       A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
       either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
       relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
       straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
       timestamps, then the NOW reference for relative timestamps will be taken
       from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
       script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that
       if the script is directly played, the actual times will match the
       absolute timestamps up to the sound controller&apos;s clock accuracy, but if
       the user somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted
       accordingly.

MUXERS
       Muxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow writing multimedia
       streams to a particular type of file.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported muxers are
       enabled by default. You can list all available muxers using the configure
       option &quot;--list-muxers&quot;.

       You can disable all the muxers with the configure option
       &quot;--disable-muxers&quot; and selectively enable / disable single muxers with
       the options &quot;--enable-muxer=MUXER&quot; / &quot;--disable-muxer=MUXER&quot;.

       The option &quot;-formats&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       muxers.

       A description of some of the currently available muxers follows.

   aiff
       Audio Interchange File Format muxer.

       It accepts the following options:

       write_id3v2
           Enable ID3v2 tags writing when set to 1. Default is 0 (disabled).

       id3v2_version
           Select ID3v2 version to write. Currently only version 3 and 4 (aka.
           ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4) are supported. The default is version 4.

   crc
       CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio
       and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit
       raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the CRC.

       The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form: CRC=0xCRC,
       where CRC is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the CRC
       for all the decoded input frames.

       For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file
       out.crc:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc

       You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -

       You can select the output format of each frame with ffmpeg by specifying
       the audio and video codec and format. For example to compute the CRC of
       the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit and the input video
       converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -

       See also the framecrc muxer.

   framecrc
       Per-packet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC for each audio and video
       packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio
       and video frames to raw video before computing the CRC.

       The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
       packet of the form:

               &lt;stream_index&gt;, &lt;packet_dts&gt;, &lt;packet_pts&gt;, &lt;packet_duration&gt;, &lt;packet_size&gt;, 0x&lt;CRC&gt;

       CRC is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the CRC of
       the packet.

       For example to compute the CRC of the audio and video frames in INPUT,
       converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
       out.crc:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc out.crc

       To print the information to stdout, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc -

       With ffmpeg, you can select the output format to which the audio and
       video frames are encoded before computing the CRC for each packet by
       specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to compute the CRC of
       each decoded input audio frame converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit and of
       each decoded input video frame converted to MPEG-2 video, use the
       command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f framecrc -

       See also the crc muxer.

   framemd5
       Per-packet MD5 testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash for each audio and video
       packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio
       and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

       The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
       packet of the form:

               &lt;stream_index&gt;, &lt;packet_dts&gt;, &lt;packet_pts&gt;, &lt;packet_duration&gt;, &lt;packet_size&gt;, &lt;MD5&gt;

       MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash for the
       packet.

       For example to compute the MD5 of the audio and video frames in INPUT,
       converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
       out.md5:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5

       To print the information to stdout, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -

       See also the md5 muxer.

   ico
       ICO file muxer.

       Microsoft&apos;s icon file format (ICO) has some strict limitations that
       should be noted:

       &#183;   Size cannot exceed 256 pixels in any dimension

       &#183;   Only BMP and PNG images can be stored

       &#183;   If a BMP image is used, it must be one of the following pixel
           formats:

                   BMP Bit Depth      FFmpeg Pixel Format
                   1bit               pal8
                   4bit               pal8
                   8bit               pal8
                   16bit              rgb555le
                   24bit              bgr24
                   32bit              bgra

       &#183;   If a BMP image is used, it must use the BITMAPINFOHEADER DIB header

       &#183;   If a PNG image is used, it must use the rgba pixel format

   image2
       Image file muxer.

       The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.

       The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
       produce sequentially numbered series of files.  The pattern may contain
       the string &quot;%d&quot; or &quot;%0Nd&quot;, this string specifies the position of the
       characters representing a numbering in the filenames. If the form &quot;%0Nd&quot;
       is used, the string representing the number in each filename is 0-padded
       to N digits. The literal character &apos;%&apos; can be specified in the pattern
       with the string &quot;%%&quot;.

       If the pattern contains &quot;%d&quot; or &quot;%0Nd&quot;, the first filename of the file
       list specified will contain the number 1, all the following numbers will
       be sequential.

       The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically determine
       the format of the image files to write.

       For example the pattern &quot;img-%03d.bmp&quot; will specify a sequence of
       filenames of the form img-001.bmp, img-002.bmp, ..., img-010.bmp, etc.
       The pattern &quot;img%%-%d.jpg&quot; will specify a sequence of filenames of the
       form img%-1.jpg, img%-2.jpg, ..., img%-10.jpg, etc.

       The following example shows how to use ffmpeg for creating a sequence of
       files img-001.jpeg, img-002.jpeg, ..., taking one image every second from
       the input video:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 -f image2 &apos;img-%03d.jpeg&apos;

       Note that with ffmpeg, if the format is not specified with the &quot;-f&quot;
       option and the output filename specifies an image file format, the image2
       muxer is automatically selected, so the previous command can be written
       as:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 &apos;img-%03d.jpeg&apos;

       Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain &quot;%d&quot; or &quot;%0Nd&quot;,
       for example to create a single image file img.jpeg from the input video
       you can employ the command:
&#12;               ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg

       The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
       special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for each
       of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
       specify the name of the &apos;.Y&apos; file. The muxer will automatically open the
       &apos;.U&apos; and &apos;.V&apos; files as required.

   md5
       MD5 testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash of all the input audio and
       video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw
       audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

       The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form: MD5=MD5,
       where MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash.

       For example to compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw audio
       and video, and store it in the file out.md5:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5

       You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -

       See also the framemd5 muxer.

   MOV/MP4/ISMV
       The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4 file
       has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location (written at
       the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for better playback
       using the qt-faststart tool). A fragmented file consists of a number of
       fragments, where packets and metadata about these packets are stored
       together. Writing a fragmented file has the advantage that the file is
       decodable even if the writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is
       undecodable if it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory
       when writing very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores
       info about every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The
       downside is that it is less compatible with other applications.

       Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define how
       to cut the file into fragments:

       -moov_size bytes
           Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead
           of placing the moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is
           insufficient, muxing will fail.

       -movflags frag_keyframe
           Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.

       -frag_duration duration
           Create fragments that are duration microseconds long.

       -frag_size size
           Create fragments that contain up to size bytes of payload data.

       -movflags frag_custom
           Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by calling
           &quot;av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)&quot; to write a fragment with the packets
           written so far. (This is only useful with other applications
           integrating libavformat, not from ffmpeg.)

       -min_frag_duration duration
           Don&apos;t create fragments that are shorter than duration microseconds
           long.

       If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when one of
       the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
       &quot;-min_frag_duration&quot;, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
       conditions to apply.

       Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted through
       a few other options:

       -movflags empty_moov
           Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
           describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
           at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file, containing only a
           short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
           mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has a zero
           duration.

           Files written with this option set do not work in QuickTime.  This
           option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

       -movflags separate_moof
           Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
           packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
           more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one
           moof/mdat pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.

           This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming)
           files.

       Smooth Streaming content can be pushed in real time to a publishing point
       on IIS with this muxer. Example:
&#12;               ffmpeg -re &lt;&lt;normal input/transcoding options&gt;&gt; -movflags isml+frag_keyframe -f ismv http://server/publishingpoint.isml/Streams(Encoder1)

   mpegts
       MPEG transport stream muxer.

       This muxer implements ISO 13818-1 and part of ETSI EN 300 468.

       The muxer options are:

       -mpegts_original_network_id number
           Set the original_network_id (default 0x0001). This is unique
           identifier of a network in DVB. Its main use is in the unique
           identification of a service through the path Original_Network_ID,
           Transport_Stream_ID.

       -mpegts_transport_stream_id number
           Set the transport_stream_id (default 0x0001). This identifies a
           transponder in DVB.

       -mpegts_service_id number
           Set the service_id (default 0x0001) also known as program in DVB.

       -mpegts_pmt_start_pid number
           Set the first PID for PMT (default 0x1000, max 0x1f00).

       -mpegts_start_pid number
           Set the first PID for data packets (default 0x0100, max 0x0f00).

       The recognized metadata settings in mpegts muxer are &quot;service_provider&quot;
       and &quot;service_name&quot;. If they are not set the default for
       &quot;service_provider&quot; is &quot;FFmpeg&quot; and the default for &quot;service_name&quot; is
       &quot;Service01&quot;.

               ffmpeg -i file.mpg -c copy \
                    -mpegts_original_network_id 0x1122 \
                    -mpegts_transport_stream_id 0x3344 \
                    -mpegts_service_id 0x5566 \
                    -mpegts_pmt_start_pid 0x1500 \
                    -mpegts_start_pid 0x150 \
                    -metadata service_provider=&quot;Some provider&quot; \
                    -metadata service_name=&quot;Some Channel&quot; \
                    -y out.ts

   null
       Null muxer.

       This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for
       testing or benchmarking purposes.

       For example to benchmark decoding with ffmpeg you can use the command:

               ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null

       Note that the above command does not read or write the out.null file, but
       specifying the output file is required by the ffmpeg syntax.

       Alternatively you can write the command as:

               ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -

   matroska
       Matroska container muxer.

       This muxer implements the matroska and webm container specs.

       The recognized metadata settings in this muxer are:

       title=title name
           Name provided to a single track

       language=language name
           Specifies the language of the track in the Matroska languages form

       stereo_mode=mode
           Stereo 3D video layout of two views in a single video track

           mono
               video is not stereo

           left_right

           checkerboard_lr
               Each view is arranged in a checkerboard interleaved pattern,
               Right-eye view being first

           row_interleaved_rl
               Each view is constituted by a row based interleaving, Right-eye
               view is first row

           row_interleaved_lr
               Each view is constituted by a row based interleaving, Left-eye

       line:

               ffmpeg -i sample_left_right_clip.mpg -an -c:v libvpx -metadata stereo_mode=left_right -y stereo_clip.webm

   segment, stream_segment, ssegment
       Basic stream segmenter.

       The segmenter muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of
       nearly fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion
       similar to image2.

       &quot;stream_segment&quot; is a variant of the muxer used to write to streaming
       output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers, and is
       recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
       &quot;ssegment&quot; is a shorter alias for &quot;stream_segment&quot;.

       Every segment starts with a video keyframe, if a video stream is present.
       Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
       make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
       expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
       segment with the key frame found next after the specified start time.

       The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

       Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting the
       option segment_list. The list type is specified by the segment_list_type
       option.

       The segment muxer supports the following options:

       segment_format format
           Override the inner container format, by default it is guessed by the
           filename extension.

       segment_list name
           Generate also a listfile named name. If not specified no listfile is
           generated.

       segment_list_flags flags
           Set flags affecting the segment list generation.

           It currently supports the following flags:

           cache
               Allow caching (only affects M3U8 list files).

           live
               Allow live-friendly file generation.

               This currently only affects M3U8 lists. In particular, write a
               fake EXT-X-TARGETDURATION duration field at the top of the file,
               based on the specified segment_time.

           Default value is &quot;cache&quot;.

       segment_list_size size
           Overwrite the listfile once it reaches size entries. If 0 the
           listfile is never overwritten. Default value is 0.

       segment_list type type
           Specify the format for the segment list file.

           The following values are recognized:

           flat
               Generate a flat list for the created segments, one segment per
               line.

           csv, ext
               Generate a list for the created segments, one segment per line,
               each line matching the format (comma-separated values):

                       &lt;segment_filename&gt;,&lt;segment_start_time&gt;,&lt;segment_end_time&gt;

               segment_filename is the name of the output file generated by the
               muxer according to the provided pattern. CSV escaping (according
               to RFC4180) is applied if required.

               segment_start_time and segment_end_time specify the segment start
               and end time expressed in seconds.

               A list file with the suffix &quot;.csv&quot; or &quot;.ext&quot; will auto-select
               this format.

               &quot;ext&quot; is deprecated in favor or &quot;csv&quot;.

           m3u8
               Generate an extended M3U8 file, version 4, compliant with
               &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-08.txt&gt;.

               A list file with the suffix &quot;.m3u8&quot; will auto-select this format.

           If not specified the type is guessed from the list file name suffix.

       segment_time time
           Set segment duration to time. Default value is &quot;2&quot;.

       segment_time_delta delta
           Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
           segment. Default value is &quot;0&quot;.

           When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
           PTS satisfies the relation:

                   PTS &gt;= start_time - time_delta

           This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
           split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
           specified split time.

           In particular may be used in combination with the ffmpeg option
           force_key_frames. The key frame times specified by force_key_frames
           may not be set accurately because of rounding issues, with the
           consequence that a key frame time may result set just before the
           specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
           1/2*frame_rate should address the worst case mismatch between the
           specified time and the time set by force_key_frames.

       segment_times times
           Specify a list of split points. times contains a list of comma
           separated duration specifications, in increasing order.

       segment_wrap limit
           Wrap around segment index once it reaches limit.

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   To remux the content of file in.mkv to a list of segments
           out-000.nut, out-001.nut, etc., and write the list of generated
           segments to out.list:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list out.list out%03d.nut

       &#183;   As the example above, but segment the input file according to the
           split points specified by the segment_times option:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list out.csv -segment_times 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 out%03d.nut

       &#183;   As the example above, but use the &quot;ffmpeg&quot; force_key_frames option to
           force key frames in the input at the specified location, together
           with the segment option segment_time_delta to account for possible
           roundings operated when setting key frame times.

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -force_key_frames 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 -vcodec mpeg4 -acodec pcm_s16le -map 0 \
                   -f segment -segment_list out.csv -segment_times 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 -segment_time_delta 0.05 out%03d.nut

           In order to force key frames on the input file, transcoding is
           required.

       &#183;   To convert the in.mkv to TS segments using the &quot;libx264&quot; and
           &quot;libfaac&quot; encoders:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map 0 -codec:v libx264 -codec:a libfaac -f ssegment -segment_list out.list out%03d.ts

       &#183;   Segment the input file, and create an M3U8 live playlist (can be used
           as live HLS source):

                   ffmpeg -re -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list playlist.m3u8 \
                   -segment_list_flags +live -segment_time 10 out%03d.mkv

   mp3
       The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with an ID3v2 header at the
       beginning and optionally an ID3v1 tag at the end. ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 are
       supported, the &quot;id3v2_version&quot; option controls which one is used. The
       legacy ID3v1 tag is not written by default, but may be enabled with the
       &quot;write_id3v1&quot; option.

       For seekable output the muxer also writes a Xing frame at the beginning,
       which contains the number of frames in the file. It is useful for
       computing duration of VBR files.

       The muxer supports writing ID3v2 attached pictures (APIC frames). The
       pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a
       single packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will
       correspond to a single APIC frame.  The stream metadata tags title and
       comment map to APIC description and picture type respectively. See
       &lt;http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames&gt; for allowed picture types.

       Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer
       will buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is
       therefore advised to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid
       excessive buffering.

       Examples:

       Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3

       To attach a picture to an mp3 file select both the audio and the picture
       stream with &quot;map&quot;:

               ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -map 0 -map 1
               -metadata:s:v title=&quot;Album cover&quot; -metadata:s:v comment=&quot;Cover (Front)&quot; out.mp3

INPUT DEVICES
       Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access the
       data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices are
       enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the configure
       option &quot;--list-indevs&quot;.

       You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
       &quot;--disable-indevs&quot;, and selectively enable an input device using the
       option &quot;--enable-indev=INDEV&quot;, or you can disable a particular input
       device using the option &quot;--disable-indev=INDEV&quot;.

       The option &quot;-formats&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of supported
       input devices (amongst the demuxers).

       A description of the currently available input devices follows.

   alsa
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
       installed on your system.

       This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the device
       to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

       An ALSA identifier has the syntax:

               hw:&lt;CARD&gt;[,&lt;DEV&gt;[,&lt;SUBDEV&gt;]]

       where the DEV and SUBDEV components are optional.

       The three arguments (in order: CARD,DEV,SUBDEV) specify card number or
       identifier, device number and subdevice number (-1 means any).

       To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
       files /proc/asound/cards and /proc/asound/devices.

       For example to capture with ffmpeg from an ALSA device with card id 0,
       you may run the command:

               ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

       For more information see:
       &lt;http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html&gt;

   bktr
       BSD video input device.

   dshow
       Windows DirectShow input device.

       DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64
       project.  Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

       Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
       opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

       The input name should be in the format:

               &lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;NAME&gt;[:&lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;NAME&gt;]

       where TYPE can be either audio or video, and NAME is the device&apos;s name.

       Options

       If no options are specified, the device&apos;s defaults are used.  If the
       device does not support the requested options, it will fail to open.

       video_size
           Set the video size in the captured video.

       framerate
           Set the framerate in the captured video.

       sample_rate
           Set the sample rate (in Hz) of the captured audio.

       sample_size
           Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio.
&#12;       channels
           Set the number of channels in the captured audio.

       list_devices
           If set to true, print a list of devices and exit.

       list_options
           If set to true, print a list of selected device&apos;s options and exit.

       video_device_number
           Set video device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
           defaults to 0).

       audio_device_number
           Set audio device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
           defaults to 0).

       pixel_format
           Select pixel format to be used by DirectShow. This may only be set
           when the video codec is not set or set to rawvideo.

       audio_buffer_size
           Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which can directly
           impact latency, depending on the device).  Defaults to using the
           audio device&apos;s default buffer size (typically some multiple of
           500ms).  Setting this value too low can degrade performance.  See

   dv1394
       Linux DV 1394 input device.

   fbdev
       Linux framebuffer input device.

       The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction layer
       to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the console. It is
       accessed through a file device node, usually /dev/fb0.

       For more detailed information read the file
       Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

       To record from the framebuffer device /dev/fb0 with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -r 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi

       You can take a single screenshot image with the command:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -frames:v 1 -r 1 -i /dev/fb0 screenshot.jpeg

       See also &lt;http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/&gt;, and fbset(1).

   iec61883
       FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

       To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
       libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
       &quot;--enable-libiec61883&quot; to compile with the device enabled.

       The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
       connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
       FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
       Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

       Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or &quot;auto&quot; to choose
       the first port connected.

       Options

       dvtype
           Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
           detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
           should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa)
           will not work and result in undefined behavior.  The values auto, dv
           and hdv are supported.

       dvbuffer
           Set maxiumum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV,
           this is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV
           does not have a fixed frame size.
&#12;       Examples

       &#183;   Grab and show the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device.

                   ffplay -f iec61883 -i auto

       &#183;   Grab and record the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device, using a packet
           buffer of 100000 packets if the source is HDV.

                   ffmpeg -f iec61883 -i auto -hdvbuffer 100000 out.mpg

   jack
       JACK input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
       installed on your system.

       A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
       each audio channel, with name client_name:input_N, where client_name is
       the name provided by the application, and N is a number which identifies
       the channel.  Each writable client will send the acquired data to the
       FFmpeg input device.

       Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
       connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

       To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the jack_connect and
       jack_disconnect programs, or do it through a graphical interface, for
       example with qjackctl.

       To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
       jack_lsp.

       Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client with
       ffmpeg.

               # Create a JACK writable client with name &quot;ffmpeg&quot;.
               $ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav

               # Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
               $ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000

               # List the current JACK clients.
               $ jack_lsp -c
               system:capture_1
               system:capture_2
               system:playback_1
               system:playback_2
               ffmpeg:input_1
               metro:120_bpm

               # Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
               $ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

   lavfi
       Libavfilter input virtual device.

       This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
       filtergraph.

       For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
       corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
       only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
       option graph.

       Options

       graph
           Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must
           be labelled by a unique string of the form &quot;outN&quot;, where N is a
           number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
           generated by the device.  The first unlabelled output is
           automatically assigned to the &quot;out0&quot; label, but all the others need
           to be specified explicitly.

           If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
           device.

       Examples

       &#183;   Create a color video stream and play it back with ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph &quot;color=pink [out0]&quot; dummy

       &#183;   As the previous example, but use filename for specifying the graph
           description, and omit the &quot;out0&quot; label:

                   ffplay -f lavfi color=pink

       &#183;   Create three different video test filtered sources and play them:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph &quot;testsrc [out0]; testsrc,hflip [out1]; testsrc,negate [out2]&quot; test3

       &#183;   Read an audio stream from a file using the amovie source and play it
           back with ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi &quot;amovie=test.wav&quot;

       &#183;   Read an audio stream and a video stream and play it back with ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi &quot;movie=test.avi[out0];amovie=test.wav[out1]&quot;
&#12;   libdc1394
       IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.

   openal
       The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
       working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

       To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL headers
       and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure FFmpeg with
       &quot;--enable-openal&quot;.

       OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
       implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on your
       installation you may need to specify additional flags via the
       &quot;--extra-cflags&quot; and &quot;--extra-ldflags&quot; for allowing the build system to
       locate the OpenAL headers and libraries.

       An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:

       Creative
           The official Windows implementation, providing hardware acceleration
           with supported devices and software fallback.  See
           &lt;http://openal.org/&gt;.

       OpenAL Soft
           Portable, open source (LGPL) software implementation. Includes
           backends for the most common sound APIs on the Windows, Linux,
           Solaris, and BSD operating systems.  See
           &lt;http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html&gt;.

       Apple
           OpenAL is part of Core Audio, the official Mac OS X Audio interface.
           See
           &lt;http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html&gt;

       This device allows to capture from an audio input device handled through
       OpenAL.

       You need to specify the name of the device to capture in the provided
       filename. If the empty string is provided, the device will automatically
       select the default device. You can get the list of the supported devices
       by using the option list_devices.

       Options

       channels
           Set the number of channels in the captured audio. Only the values 1
           (monaural) and 2 (stereo) are currently supported.  Defaults to 2.

       sample_size
           Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio. Only the values
           8 and 16 are currently supported. Defaults to 16.

       sample_rate
           Set the sample rate (in Hz) of the captured audio.  Defaults to
           44.1k.

       list_devices
           If set to true, print a list of devices and exit.  Defaults to false.

       Examples

       Print the list of OpenAL supported devices and exit:

               $ ffmpeg -list_devices true -f openal -i dummy out.ogg

       Capture from the OpenAL device DR-BT101 via PulseAudio:

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i &apos;DR-BT101 via PulseAudio&apos; out.ogg

       Capture from the default device (note the empty string &apos;&apos; as filename):

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i &apos;&apos; out.ogg

       Capture from two devices simultaneously, writing to two different files,
       within the same ffmpeg command:

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i &apos;DR-BT101 via PulseAudio&apos; out1.ogg -f openal -i &apos;ALSA Default&apos; out2.ogg

       Note: not all OpenAL implementations support multiple simultaneous
       capture - try the latest OpenAL Soft if the above does not work.

   oss
       Open Sound System input device.

       The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
       representing the OSS input device, and is usually set to /dev/dsp.

       For example to grab from /dev/dsp using ffmpeg use the command:

               ffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/dsp /tmp/oss.wav

       For more information about OSS see:
       &lt;http://manuals.opensound.com/usersguide/dsp.html&gt;

   pulse
       pulseaudio input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libpulse-simple
       installed in your system.

       The filename to provide to the input device is a source device or the
       string &quot;default&quot;
&#12;       To list the pulse source devices and their properties you can invoke the
       command pactl list sources.

               ffmpeg -f pulse -i default /tmp/pulse.wav

       server AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -server &lt;server name&gt;

       Connects to a specific server.

       name AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -name &lt;application name&gt;

       Specify the application name pulse will use when showing active clients,
       by default it is the LIBAVFORMAT_IDENT string

       stream_name AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -stream_name &lt;stream name&gt;

       Specify the stream name pulse will use when showing active streams, by
       default it is &quot;record&quot;

       sample_rate AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -sample_rate &lt;samplerate&gt;

       Specify the samplerate in Hz, by default 48kHz is used.

       channels AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -channels &lt;N&gt;

       Specify the channels in use, by default 2 (stereo) is set.

       frame_size AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -frame_size &lt;bytes&gt;

       Specify the number of byte per frame, by default it is set to 1024.

       fragment_size AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -fragment_size &lt;bytes&gt;

       Specify the minimal buffering fragment in pulseaudio, it will affect the
       audio latency. By default it is unset.

   sndio
       sndio input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libsndio
       installed on your system.

       The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
       representing the sndio input device, and is usually set to /dev/audio0.

       For example to grab from /dev/audio0 using ffmpeg use the command:

               ffmpeg -f sndio -i /dev/audio0 /tmp/oss.wav

   video4linux2
       Video4Linux2 input video device.

       The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
       systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device (e.g. an
       USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the kind
       /dev/videoN, where N is a number associated to the device.

       Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of widthxheight sizes
       and framerates. You can check which are supported using -list_formats all
       for Video4Linux2 devices.

       Some usage examples of the video4linux2 devices with ffmpeg and ffplay:

       The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the
       kernel version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the
       real time clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin
       usually at boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock).
       The -timestamps abs or -ts abs option can be used to force conversion
       into the real time clock.

       Note that if FFmpeg is build with v4l-utils support (&quot;--enable-libv4l2&quot;
       option), it will always be used.

               # Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device.
               ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0
&#12;               # Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave the
               framerate and size as previously set.
               ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg

       &quot;v4l&quot; and &quot;v4l2&quot; can be used as aliases for the respective &quot;video4linux&quot;
       and &quot;video4linux2&quot;.

   vfwcap
       VfW (Video for Windows) capture input device.

       The filename passed as input is the capture driver number, ranging from 0
       to 9. You may use &quot;list&quot; as filename to print a list of drivers. Any
       other filename will be interpreted as device number 0.

   x11grab
       X11 video input device.

       This device allows to capture a region of an X11 display.

       The filename passed as input has the syntax:

               [&lt;hostname&gt;]:&lt;display_number&gt;.&lt;screen_number&gt;[+&lt;x_offset&gt;,&lt;y_offset&gt;]

       hostname:display_number.screen_number specifies the X11 display name of
       the screen to grab from. hostname can be omitted, and defaults to
       &quot;localhost&quot;. The environment variable DISPLAY contains the default
       display name.

       x_offset and y_offset specify the offsets of the grabbed area with
       respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They default to 0.

       Check the X11 documentation (e.g. man X) for more detailed information.

       Use the dpyinfo program for getting basic information about the
       properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for &quot;name&quot; or &quot;dimensions&quot;).

       For example to grab from :0.0 using ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       Grab at position &quot;10,20&quot;:

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

       Options

       draw_mouse
           Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of 0 specify not
           to draw the pointer. Default value is 1.

       follow_mouse
           Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
           &quot;centered&quot; or a number of pixels PIXELS.

           When it is specified with &quot;centered&quot;, the grabbing region follows the
           mouse pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region;
           otherwise, the region follows only when the mouse pointer reaches
           within PIXELS (greater than zero) to the edge of region.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

           To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to
           edge:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       framerate
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is &quot;ntsc&quot;, corresponding
           to a framerate of &quot;30000/1001&quot;.

       show_region
           Show grabbed region on screen.

           If show_region is specified with 1, then the grabbing region will be
           indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to know what is
           being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

           With follow_mouse:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       video_size
           Set the video frame size. Default value is &quot;vga&quot;.

OUTPUT DEVICES
       Output devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to write
       multimedia data to an output device attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported output devices
       are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
       configure option &quot;--list-outdevs&quot;.

       You can disable all the output devices using the configure option
       &quot;--disable-outdevs&quot;, and selectively enable an output device using the
       option &quot;--enable-outdev=OUTDEV&quot;, or you can disable a particular input
       device using the option &quot;--disable-outdev=OUTDEV&quot;.

       The option &quot;-formats&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       output devices (amongst the muxers).

       A description of the currently available output devices follows.

   alsa
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) output device.

   caca
       CACA output device.

       This output devices allows to show a video stream in CACA window.  Only
       one CACA window is allowed per application, so you can have only one
       instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need to configure FFmpeg with
       &quot;--enable-libcaca&quot;.  libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text
       instead of pixels.

       For more information about libcaca, check:
       &lt;http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca&gt;

       Options

       window_title
           Set the CACA window title, if not specified default to the filename
           specified for the output device.

       window_size
           Set the CACA window size, can be a string of the form widthxheight or
           a video size abbreviation.  If not specified it defaults to the size
           of the input video.

       driver
           Set display driver.

       algorithm
           Set dithering algorithm. Dithering is necessary because the picture
           being rendered has usually far more colours than the available
           palette.  The accepted values are listed with &quot;-list_dither
           algorithms&quot;.

       antialias
           Set antialias method. Antialiasing smoothens the rendered image and
           avoids the commonly seen staircase effect.  The accepted values are
           listed with &quot;-list_dither antialiases&quot;.

       charset
           Set which characters are going to be used when rendering text.  The
           accepted values are listed with &quot;-list_dither charsets&quot;.

       color
           Set color to be used when rendering text.  The accepted values are
           listed with &quot;-list_dither colors&quot;.

       list_drivers
           If set to true, print a list of available drivers and exit.

       list_dither
           List available dither options related to the argument.  The argument
           must be one of &quot;algorithms&quot;, &quot;antialiases&quot;, &quot;charsets&quot;, &quot;colors&quot;.

       Examples

       &#183;   The following command shows the ffmpeg output is an CACA window,
           forcing its size to 80x25:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 -window_size 80x25 -f caca -

       &#183;   Show the list of available drivers and exit:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -pix_fmt rgb24 -f caca -list_drivers true -

       &#183;   Show the list of available dither colors and exit:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -pix_fmt rgb24 -f caca -list_dither colors -

   oss
       OSS (Open Sound System) output device.

   sdl
       SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) output device.

       This output devices allows to show a video stream in an SDL window. Only
       one SDL window is allowed per application, so you can have only one
       instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need libsdl installed on your system
       when configuring your build.

       For more information about SDL, check: &lt;http://www.libsdl.org/&gt;

       Options

       window_title
           Set the SDL window title, if not specified default to the filename
           specified for the output device.

       icon_title
           Set the name of the iconified SDL window, if not specified it is set
           to the same value of window_title.

       window_size
           Set the SDL window size, can be a string of the form widthxheight or
           a video size abbreviation.  If not specified it defaults to the size
           of the input video, downscaled according to the aspect ratio.

       Examples

       The following command shows the ffmpeg output is an SDL window, forcing
       its size to the qcif format:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -window_size qcif -f sdl &quot;SDL output&quot;

   sndio
       sndio audio output device.

PROTOCOLS
       Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
       resources which require the use of a particular protocol.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
       enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the configure
       option &quot;--list-protocols&quot;.

       You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
       &quot;--disable-protocols&quot;, and selectively enable a protocol using the option
       &quot;--enable-protocol=PROTOCOL&quot;, or you can disable a particular protocol
       using the option &quot;--disable-protocol=PROTOCOL&quot;.

       The option &quot;-protocols&quot; of the ff* tools will display the list of
       supported protocols.

       A description of the currently available protocols follows.

   bluray
       Read BluRay playlist.

       The accepted options are:

       angle
           BluRay angle

       chapter
           Start chapter (1...N)

       playlist
           Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)

       Examples:

       Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:

               bluray:/mnt/bluray

       Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from
       chapter 2:

               -playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray

   concat
       Physical concatenation protocol.

       Allow to read and seek from many resource in sequence as if they were a
       unique resource.

       A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

               concat:&lt;URL1&gt;|&lt;URL2&gt;|...|&lt;URLN&gt;

       where URL1, URL2, ..., URLN are the urls of the resource to be
       concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct protocol.

       For example to read a sequence of files split1.mpeg, split2.mpeg,
       split3.mpeg with ffplay use the command:

               ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg

       Note that you may need to escape the character &quot;|&quot; which is special for
       many shells.

   file
       File access protocol.

       Allow to read from or read to a file.

       For example to read from a file input.mpeg with ffmpeg use the command:

               ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg

       The ff* tools default to the file protocol, that is a resource specified
       with the name &quot;FILE.mpeg&quot; is interpreted as the URL &quot;file:FILE.mpeg&quot;.

   gopher
       Gopher protocol.

   hls
       Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as a uniform
       one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be remote HTTP
       resources or local files, accessed using the standard file protocol.  The
       nested protocol is declared by specifying &quot;+proto&quot; after the hls URI
       scheme name, where proto is either &quot;file&quot; or &quot;http&quot;.

               hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
               hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8

       Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work just as
       well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.  To use the
       hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the m3u8 files.

   http
       HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

   mmst
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.

   mmsh
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

       The required syntax is:

               mmsh://&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;app&gt;][/&lt;playpath&gt;]

   md5
       MD5 output protocol.

       Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes this
       to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can be used
       to test muxers without writing an actual file.

       Some examples follow.

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:

       Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to be
       seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.

   pipe
       UNIX pipe access protocol.

       Allow to read and write from UNIX pipes.

       The accepted syntax is:

               pipe:[&lt;number&gt;]

       number is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the pipe
       (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If number is not
       specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used for
       writing, stdin for reading.

       For example to read from stdin with ffmpeg:

               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
               # ...this is the same as...
               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:

       For writing to stdout with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat &gt; test.avi
               # ...this is the same as...
               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat &gt; test.avi

       Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to be
       seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.

   rtmp
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming multimedia
       content across a TCP/IP network.

       The required syntax is:

               rtmp://&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;app&gt;][/&lt;instance&gt;][/&lt;playpath&gt;]

       The accepted parameters are:

       server
           The address of the RTMP server.

       port
           The number of the TCP port to use (by default is 1935).

       app It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds
           to the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
           (e.g. /ondemand/, /flash/live/, etc.). You can override the value
           parsed from the URI through the &quot;rtmp_app&quot; option, too.

       playpath
           It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the
           application specified in app, may be prefixed by &quot;mp4:&quot;. You can
           override the value parsed from the URI through the &quot;rtmp_playpath&quot;
           option, too.

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       timeout
           Maximum time to wait for the incoming connection. Implies listen.

       Additionally, the following parameters can be set via command line
       options (or in code via &quot;AVOption&quot;s):

       rtmp_app
           Name of application to connect on the RTMP server. This option
           overrides the parameter specified in the URI.

       rtmp_buffer
           Set the client buffer time in milliseconds. The default is 3000.
&#12;       rtmp_conn
           Extra arbitrary AMF connection parameters, parsed from a string, e.g.
           like &quot;B:1 S:authMe O:1 NN:code:1.23 NS:flag:ok O:0&quot;.  Each value is
           prefixed by a single character denoting the type, B for Boolean, N
           for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null, followed by a
           colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or TRUE,
           respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or 1 to end or
           begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may be named,
           by prefixing the type with &apos;N&apos; and specifying the name before the
           value (i.e. &quot;NB:myFlag:1&quot;). This option may be used multiple times to
           construct arbitrary AMF sequences.

       rtmp_flashver
           Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default
           is LNX 9,0,124,2.

       rtmp_flush_interval
           Number of packets flushed in the same request (RTMPT only). The
           default is 10.

       rtmp_live
           Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
           live streams is possible. The default value is &quot;any&quot;, which means the
           subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in the
           playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the
           recorded stream. The other possible values are &quot;live&quot; and &quot;recorded&quot;.

       rtmp_pageurl
           URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
           value will be sent.

       rtmp_playpath
           Stream identifier to play or to publish. This option overrides the
           parameter specified in the URI.

       rtmp_subscribe
           Name of live stream to subscribe to. By default no value will be
           sent.  It is only sent if the option is specified or if rtmp_live is
           set to live.

       rtmp_swfhash
           SHA256 hash of the decompressed SWF file (32 bytes).

       rtmp_swfsize
           Size of the decompressed SWF file, required for SWFVerification.

       rtmp_swfurl
           URL of the SWF player for the media. By default no value will be
           sent.

       rtmp_swfverify
           URL to player swf file, compute hash/size automatically.

       rtmp_tcurl
           URL of the target stream. Defaults to proto://host[:port]/app.

       For example to read with ffplay a multimedia resource named &quot;sample&quot; from
       the application &quot;vod&quot; from an RTMP server &quot;myserver&quot;:

               ffplay rtmp://myserver/vod/sample

   rtmpe
       Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

       The Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPE) is used for streaming
       multimedia content within standard cryptographic primitives, consisting
       of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating a pair of RC4
       keys.

   rtmps
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol over a secure SSL connection.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPS) is used for streaming multimedia
       content across an encrypted connection.

   rtmpt
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP (RTMPT) is used
       for streaming multimedia content within HTTP requests to traverse
       firewalls.

   rtmpte
       Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP.

       The Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP (RTMPTE)
       is used for streaming multimedia content within HTTP requests to traverse
       firewalls.

   rtmpts
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTPS.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTPS (RTMPTS) is used
       for streaming multimedia content within HTTPS requests to traverse
       firewalls.

   rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through librtmp.

       Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
       configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       &quot;--enable-librtmp&quot;. If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
       protocol.

       This protocol provides most client functions and a few server functions
       needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT), encrypted RTMP
       (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled variants of these
       encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

       The required syntax is:

               &lt;rtmp_proto&gt;://&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;app&gt;][/&lt;playpath&gt;] &lt;options&gt;

       where rtmp_proto is one of the strings &quot;rtmp&quot;, &quot;rtmpt&quot;, &quot;rtmpe&quot;, &quot;rtmps&quot;,
       &quot;rtmpte&quot;, &quot;rtmpts&quot; corresponding to each RTMP variant, and server, port,
       app and playpath have the same meaning as specified for the RTMP native
       protocol.  options contains a list of space-separated options of the form
       key=val.

       See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

       For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
       ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream

       To play the same stream using ffplay:

               ffplay &quot;rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1&quot;

   rtp
       Real-Time Protocol.

   rtsp
       RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a
       demuxer and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data
       transferred over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-
       RTSP (with data transferred over RDT).

       The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
       supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock&apos;s
       &lt;http://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server&gt;).

       The required syntax for a RTSP url is:

               rtsp://&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;path&gt;

       The following options (set on the ffmpeg/ffplay command line, or set in
       code via &quot;AVOption&quot;s or in &quot;avformat_open_input&quot;), are supported:

       Flags for &quot;rtsp_transport&quot;:

       udp Use UDP as lower transport protocol.

       tcp Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
           transport protocol.

       udp_multicast
           Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.

       http
           Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
           passing proxies.

       Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they
       are tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is
       tried).  For the muxer, only the &quot;tcp&quot; and &quot;udp&quot; options are supported.

       Flags for &quot;rtsp_flags&quot;:

       filter_src
           Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received
       packets (since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost
       totally). This can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to
       zero (via the &quot;max_delay&quot; field of AVFormatContext).

       When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with ffplay, the streams to
       display can be chosen with &quot;-vst&quot; n and &quot;-ast&quot; n for video and audio
       respectively, and can be switched on the fly by pressing &quot;v&quot; and &quot;a&quot;.

       Example command lines:

       To watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:

               ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4

       To watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:

               ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4

       To send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp

       To receive a stream in realtime:

               ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp &lt;output&gt;

   sap
       Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
       protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.  It is used
       for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the streams
       regularly on a separate port.

       Muxer

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:

               sap://&lt;destination&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][?&lt;options&gt;]

       The RTP packets are sent to destination on port port, or to port 5004 if
       no port is specified.  options is a &quot;&amp;&quot;-separated list. The following
       options are supported:

       announce_addr=address
           Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
           If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
           announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
           ff0e::2:7ffe if destination is an IPv6 address.

       announce_port=port
           Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to 9875 if
           not specified.

       ttl=ttl
           Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
           defaults to 255.

       same_port=0|1
           If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
           default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
           port 2 numbers higher than the previous.  VLC/Live555 requires this
           to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.  The RTP stack in
           libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent on unique
           ports.

       Example command lines follow.

       To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1

       Similarly, for watching in ffplay:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://224.0.0.255

       And for watching in ffplay, over IPv6:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]

       Demuxer

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:

               sap://[&lt;address&gt;][:&lt;port&gt;]

       address is the multicast address to listen for announcements on, if
       omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. port is the
       port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

       The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
       Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular
       stream.

       Example command lines follow.

       To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast
       address:

               ffplay sap://

       To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP
       multicast address:

               ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]

   tcp
       Trasmission Control Protocol.

       The required syntax for a TCP url is:

               tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       listen
           Listen for an incoming connection

       timeout=microseconds
           In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval,
           raise error.  In write mode: if socket cannot be written in more than
           this time interval, raise error.  This also sets timeout on TCP
           connection establishing.

                   ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?listen
                   ffplay tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

   tls
       Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer

       The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:

               tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       cafile=filename
           Certificate authority file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.

       cert=filename
           Certificate file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.

       key=filename
           Private key file.
&#12;       verify=0|1
           Verify the peer&apos;s certificate.

       Example command lines:

       To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

               ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?listen&amp;cert=&lt;server.crt&gt;&amp;key=&lt;server.key&gt;

       To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using ffplay:

               ffplay tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

   udp
       User Datagram Protocol.

       The required syntax for a UDP url is:

               udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       options contains a list of &amp;-separated options of the form key=val.

       In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used to
       store the incoming data, which allows to reduce loss of data due to UDP
       socket buffer overruns. The fifo_size and overrun_nonfatal options are
       related to this buffer.

       The list of supported options follows.

       buffer_size=size
           Set the UDP socket buffer size in bytes. This is used both for the
           receiving and the sending buffer size.

       localport=port
           Override the local UDP port to bind with.

       localaddr=addr
           Choose the local IP address. This is useful e.g. if sending multicast
           and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can choose which
           interface to send on by specifying the IP address of that interface.

       pkt_size=size
           Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.

       reuse=1|0
           Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.

       ttl=ttl
           Set the time to live value (for multicast only).

       connect=1|0
           Initialize the UDP socket with &quot;connect()&quot;. In this case, the
           destination address can&apos;t be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url
           later.  If the destination address isn&apos;t known at the start, this
           option can be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.  This allows
           finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname, and
           makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if &quot;destination
           unreachable&quot; is received.  For receiving, this gives the benefit of
           only receiving packets from the specified peer address/port.

       sources=address[,address]
           Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the
           specified sender IP addresses.

       block=address[,address]
           Ignore packets sent to the multicast group from the specified sender
           IP addresses.

       fifo_size=units
           Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
           packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.

       overrun_nonfatal=1|0
           Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
           value is 0.

       timeout=microseconds
           In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval,
           raise error.

       Some usage examples of the UDP protocol with ffmpeg follow.

       To stream over UDP to a remote endpoint:

               ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

       To stream in mpegts format over UDP using 188 sized UDP packets, using a
       large input buffer:

               ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f mpegts udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?pkt_size=188&amp;buffer_size=65535

       To receive over UDP from a remote endpoint:

               ffmpeg -i udp://[&lt;multicast-address&gt;]:&lt;port&gt;

FILTERING INTRODUCTION
       Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

       Libavfilter is the filtering API of FFmpeg. It is the substitute of the
       now deprecated &apos;vhooks&apos; and started as a Google Summer of Code project.

       Audio filtering integration into the main FFmpeg repository is a work in
       progress, so audio API and ABI should not be considered stable yet.

       In libavfilter, it is possible for filters to have multiple inputs and
       multiple outputs.  To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible,
       we can use a complex filter graph. For example, the following one:

               input --&gt; split ---------------------&gt; overlay --&gt; output
                           |                             ^
                           |                             |
                           +-----&gt; crop --&gt; vflip -------+

       splits the stream in two streams, sends one stream through the crop
       filter and the vflip filter before merging it back with the other stream
       by overlaying it on top. You can use the following command to achieve
       this:

               ffmpeg -i input -vf &quot;[in] split [T1], [T2] overlay=0:H/2 [out]; [T1] crop=iw:ih/2:0:ih/2, vflip [T2]&quot; output

       The result will be that in output the top half of the video is mirrored
       onto the bottom half.

       Filters are loaded using the -vf or -af option passed to ffmpeg or to
       ffplay. Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas. In our
       example, split, overlay are in one linear chain, and crop, vflip are in
       another. The points where the linear chains join are labeled by names
       enclosed in square brackets. In our example, that is [T1] and [T2]. The
       special labels [in] and [out] are the points where video is input and
       output.

       Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified after
       the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other by a
       colon.

       There exist so-called source filters that do not have an audio/video
       input, and sink filters that will not have audio/video output.

GRAPH
       The graph2dot program included in the FFmpeg tools directory can be used
       to parse a filter graph description and issue a corresponding textual
       representation in the dot language.

       Invoke the command:

               graph2dot -h

       to see how to use graph2dot.

       You can then pass the dot description to the dot program (from the
       graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation of the
       filter graph.

       For example the sequence of commands:

               echo &lt;GRAPH_DESCRIPTION&gt; | \
               tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp &amp;&amp; \
               dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png &amp;&amp; \
               display graph.png

       can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
       described by the GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string. Note that this string must be
       a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly
       defined.  For example if your command line is of the form:

               ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

       your GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string will need to be of the form:

               nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

       you may also need to set the nullsrc parameters and add a format filter
       in order to simulate a specific input file.

FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION
       A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
       cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of filters. Each
       link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one filter from which
       it takes its input, and one output pad on the other side connecting it to
       the one filter accepting its output.

       Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class registered
       in the application, which defines the features and the number of input
       and output pads of the filter.

       A filter with no input pads is called a &quot;source&quot;, a filter with no output
       pads is called a &quot;sink&quot;.

   Filtergraph syntax
       A filtergraph can be represented using a textual representation, which is
       recognized by the -filter/-vf and -filter_complex options in ffmpeg and
       -vf in ffplay, and by the
       &quot;avfilter_graph_parse()&quot;/&quot;avfilter_graph_parse2()&quot; function defined in
       libavfilter/avfiltergraph.h.

       A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
       connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
       represented by a list of &quot;,&quot;-separated filter descriptions.

       A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
       filterchains is represented by a list of &quot;;&quot;-separated filterchain
       descriptions.

       A filter is represented by a string of the form:
       [in_link_1]...[in_link_N]filter_name=arguments[out_link_1]...[out_link_M]

       filter_name is the name of the filter class of which the described filter
       is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of the filter classes
       registered in the program.  The name of the filter class is optionally
       followed by a string &quot;=arguments&quot;.

       arguments is a string which contains the parameters used to initialize
       the filter instance, and are described in the filter descriptions below.
&#12;       The list of arguments can be quoted using the character &quot;&apos;&quot; as initial
       and ending mark, and the character &apos;\&apos; for escaping the characters within
       the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered terminated
       when the next special character (belonging to the set &quot;[]=;,&quot;) is
       encountered.

       The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and followed
       by a list of link labels.  A link label allows to name a link and
       associate it to a filter output or input pad. The preceding labels
       in_link_1 ... in_link_N, are associated to the filter input pads, the
       following labels out_link_1 ... out_link_M, are associated to the output
       pads.

       When two link labels with the same name are found in the filtergraph, a
       link between the corresponding input and output pad is created.

       If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
       unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.  For example
       in the filterchain:

               nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

       the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
       instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled &quot;L1&quot;,
       the first input pad of overlay is labelled &quot;L2&quot;, and the second output
       pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay, which are both
       unlabelled.

       In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output pads
       must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the filter
       input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

       Libavfilter will automatically insert scale filters where format
       conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags for those
       automatically inserted scalers by prepending &quot;sws_flags=flags;&quot; to the
       filtergraph description.

       Follows a BNF description for the filtergraph syntax:

               &lt;NAME&gt;             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and &apos;_&apos;
               &lt;LINKLABEL&gt;        ::= &quot;[&quot; &lt;NAME&gt; &quot;]&quot;
               &lt;LINKLABELS&gt;       ::= &lt;LINKLABEL&gt; [&lt;LINKLABELS&gt;]
               &lt;FILTER_ARGUMENTS&gt; ::= sequence of chars (eventually quoted)
               &lt;FILTER&gt;           ::= [&lt;LINKNAMES&gt;] &lt;NAME&gt; [&quot;=&quot; &lt;ARGUMENTS&gt;] [&lt;LINKNAMES&gt;]
               &lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt;      ::= &lt;FILTER&gt; [,&lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt;]
               &lt;FILTERGRAPH&gt;      ::= [sws_flags=&lt;flags&gt;;] &lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt; [;&lt;FILTERGRAPH&gt;]

AUDIO FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the existing
       filters using &quot;--disable-filters&quot;.  The configure output will show the
       audio filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.

   aconvert
       Convert the input audio format to the specified formats.

       The filter accepts a string of the form: &quot;sample_format:channel_layout&quot;.

       sample_format specifies the sample format, and can be a string or the
       corresponding numeric value defined in libavutil/samplefmt.h. Use &apos;p&apos;
       suffix for a planar sample format.

       channel_layout specifies the channel layout, and can be a string or the
       corresponding number value defined in libavutil/audioconvert.h.

       The special parameter &quot;auto&quot;, signifies that the filter will
       automatically select the output format depending on the output filter.

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   Convert input to float, planar, stereo:

                   aconvert=fltp:stereo

       &#183;   Convert input to unsigned 8-bit, automatically select out channel
           layout:

                   aconvert=u8:auto

   aformat
       Convert the input audio to one of the specified formats. The framework
       will negotiate the most appropriate format to minimize conversions.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       sample_fmts
           A comma-separated list of requested sample formats.

       sample_rates
           A comma-separated list of requested sample rates.

       channel_layouts
           A comma-separated list of requested channel layouts.

       If a parameter is omitted, all values are allowed.

       For example to force the output to either unsigned 8-bit or signed 16-bit
       stereo:

               aformat=sample_fmts\=u8\,s16:channel_layouts\=stereo

   amerge
       Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

       The filter accepts the following named options:
&#12;       inputs
           Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.

       If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore
       compatible, the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and
       the channels will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of
       the inputs are not disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the
       first input then all the channels of the second input, in that order, and
       the channel layout of the output will be the default value corresponding
       to the total number of channels.

       For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
       is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
       following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
       first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

       On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will
       be in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
       arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

       All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

       If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
       shortest.

       Example: merge two mono files into a stereo stream:

               amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge

       Example: multiple merges:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i &quot;
               amovie=input.mkv:si=0 [a0];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=1 [a1];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=2 [a2];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=3 [a3];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=4 [a4];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=5 [a5];
               [a0][a1][a2][a3][a4][a5] amerge=inputs=6&quot; -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv

   amix
       Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

       For example

               ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

       will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration
       as the first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       inputs
           Number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       duration
           How to determine the end-of-stream.

           longest
               Duration of longest input. (default)

           shortest
               Duration of shortest input.

           first
               Duration of first input.

       dropout_transition
           Transition time, in seconds, for volume renormalization when an input
           stream ends. The default value is 2 seconds.

   anull
       Pass the audio source unchanged to the output.

   aresample
       Resample the input audio to the specified sample rate.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the output sample rate. If not
       specified then the filter will automatically convert between its input
       and output sample rates.

       For example, to resample the input audio to 44100Hz:

               aresample=44100

   asetnsamples
       Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.

       The last output packet may contain a different number of samples, as the
       filter will flush all the remaining samples when the input audio signal
       its end.

       The filter accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated by
       &quot;:&quot;.

       nb_out_samples, n
           Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is
           intended as the number of samples per each channel.  Default value is
           1024.

       pad, p
           If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio frame with zeroes, so
           that the last frame will contain the same number of samples as the
           previous ones. Default value is 1.

       For example, to set the number of per-frame samples to 1234 and disable
       padding for the last frame, use:

               asetnsamples=n=1234:p=0

   ashowinfo
       Show a line containing various information for each input audio frame.
       The input audio is not modified.

       The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form
       key:value.

       A description of each shown parameter follows:

       n   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

       pts presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           time base units. The time base unit depends on the filter input pad,
           and is usually 1/sample_rate.

       pts_time
           presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           seconds

       pos position of the frame in the input stream, -1 if this information in
           unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic
           audio)

       fmt sample format name

       chlayout
           channel layout description

       nb_samples
           number of samples (per each channel) contained in the filtered frame

       rate
           sample rate for the audio frame

       checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of all the planes of the
           input frame

       plane_checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) for each input frame
           plane, expressed in the form &quot;[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7]&quot;

   asplit
       Split input audio into several identical outputs.

       The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of
       outputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       For example:

               [in] asplit [out0][out1]

       will create two separate outputs from the same input.

       To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of outputs,
       like in:

               [in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]



               ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT

       will create 5 copies of the input audio.

   astreamsync
       Forward two audio streams and control the order the buffers are
       forwarded.

       The argument to the filter is an expression deciding which stream should
       be forwarded next: if the result is negative, the first stream is
       forwarded; if the result is positive or zero, the second stream is
       forwarded. It can use the following variables:

       b1 b2
           number of buffers forwarded so far on each stream

       s1 s2
           number of samples forwarded so far on each stream

       t1 t2
           current timestamp of each stream

       The default value is &quot;t1-t2&quot;, which means to always forward the stream
       that has a smaller timestamp.

       Example: stress-test &quot;amerge&quot; by randomly sending buffers on the wrong
       input, while avoiding too much of a desynchronization:

               amovie=file.ogg [a] ; amovie=file.mp3 [b] ;
               [a] [b] astreamsync=(2*random(1))-1+tanh(5*(t1-t2)) [a2] [b2] ;
               [a2] [b2] amerge

   atempo
       Adjust audio tempo.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
       specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must be in
       the [0.5, 2.0] range.

       For example, to slow down audio to 80% tempo:

               atempo=0.8
&#12;       For example, to speed up audio to 125% tempo:

               atempo=1.25

   earwax
       Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.

       This filter adds `cues&apos; to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD format) audio so
       that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved from inside
       your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of the
       listener (standard for speakers).

       Ported from SoX.

   pan
       Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
       channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

       This filter is also designed to remap efficiently the channels of an
       audio stream.

       The filter accepts parameters of the form: &quot;l:outdef:outdef:...&quot;

       l   output channel layout or number of channels

       outdef
           output channel specification, of the form:
           &quot;out_name=[gain*]in_name[+[gain*]in_name...]&quot;

       out_name
           output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a
           channel number (c0, c1, etc.)

       gain
           multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume
           unchanged

       in_name
           input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to
           mix named and numbered input channels

       If the `=&apos; in a channel specification is replaced by `&lt;&apos;, then the gains
       for that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus
       avoiding clipping noise.

       Mixing examples

       For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a
       bigger factor for the left channel:

               pan=1:c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1

       A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5-
       and 7-channels surround:

               pan=stereo: FL &lt; FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL : FR &lt; FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR

       Note that ffmpeg integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system that
       should be preferred (see &quot;-ac&quot; option) unless you have very specific
       needs.

       Remapping examples

       The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

       *&lt;gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,&gt;
       *&lt;only one input per channel output,&gt;

       If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user
       (&quot;Pure channel mapping detected&quot;), and use an optimized and lossless
       method to do the remapping.

       For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
       dropping the extra channels:

               pan=&quot;stereo: c0=FL : c1=FR&quot;

       Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right
       channels and keep the input channel layout:

               pan=&quot;5.1: c0=c1 : c1=c0 : c2=c2 : c3=c3 : c4=c4 : c5=c5&quot;

       If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left
       channel (and still keep the stereo channel layout) with:

               pan=&quot;stereo:c1=c1&quot;

       Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in
       both front left and right:

               pan=&quot;stereo: c0=FR : c1=FR&quot;

   silencedetect
       Detect silence in an audio stream.

       This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is
       less or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal
       to the minimum detected noise duration.

       The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds.

       duration, d
           Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

       noise, n
           Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case &quot;dB&quot; is appended
           to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or
           0.001.

       Detect 5 seconds of silence with -50dB noise tolerance:

               silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=5

       Complete example with ffmpeg to detect silence with 0.0001 noise
       tolerance in silence.mp3:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i amovie=silence.mp3,silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -

   volume
       Adjust the input audio volume.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter vol, which expresses how the
       audio volume will be increased or decreased.

       Output values are clipped to the maximum value.

       If vol is expressed as a decimal number, the output audio volume is given
       by the relation:

               &lt;output_volume&gt; = &lt;vol&gt; * &lt;input_volume&gt;

       If vol is expressed as a decimal number followed by the string &quot;dB&quot;, the
       value represents the requested change in decibels of the input audio
       power, and the output audio volume is given by the relation:

               &lt;output_volume&gt; = 10^(&lt;vol&gt;/20) * &lt;input_volume&gt;

       Otherwise vol is considered an expression and its evaluated value is used
       for computing the output audio volume according to the first relation.

       Default value for vol is 1.0.

       Examples

       &#183;   Half the input audio volume:

                   volume=0.5

           The above example is equivalent to:

                   volume=1/2

       &#183;   Decrease input audio power by 12 decibels:

                   volume=-12dB

   volumedetect
       Detect the volume of the input video.

       The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics about
       the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is
       reached.

       In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
       volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of an histogram of the
       registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
       the samples).

       All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.

       Here is an excerpt of the output:

               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409

       It means that:

       &#183;   The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

       &#183;   The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and
           -5 dB.

       &#183;   There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

       In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
       raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

   asyncts
       Synchronize audio data with timestamps by squeezing/stretching it and/or
       dropping samples/adding silence when needed.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       compensate
           Enable stretching/squeezing the data to make it match the timestamps.
           Disabled by default. When disabled, time gaps are covered with
           silence.

       min_delta
           Minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in seconds) to
           trigger adding/dropping samples. Default value is 0.1. If you get
           non-perfect sync with this filter, try setting this parameter to 0.

       max_comp
           Maximum compensation in samples per second. Relevant only with
           compensate=1.  Default value 500.
&#12;       first_pts
           Assume the first pts should be this value.  This allows for
           padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is
           made about the first frame&apos;s expected pts, so no padding or trimming
           is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning
           with silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream.

   channelsplit
       Split each channel in input audio stream into a separate output stream.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the input stream. Default is &quot;stereo&quot;.

       For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file

               ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv

       will create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one
       containing only the left channel and the other the right channel.

       To split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files

               ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
               &apos;channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]&apos;
               -map &apos;[FL]&apos; front_left.wav -map &apos;[FR]&apos; front_right.wav -map &apos;[FC]&apos;
               front_center.wav -map &apos;[LFE]&apos; lfe.wav -map &apos;[SL]&apos; side_left.wav -map &apos;[SR]&apos;
               side_right.wav

   channelmap
       Remap input channels to new locations.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the output stream.

       map Map channels from input to output. The argument is a comma-separated
           list of mappings, each in the &quot;in_channel-out_channel&quot; or in_channel
           form. in_channel can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL
           for front left) or its index in the input channel layout.
           out_channel is the name of the output channel or its index in the
           output channel layout. If out_channel is not given then it is
           implicitly an index, starting with zero and increasing by one for
           each mapping.

       If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels
       to output channels preserving index.

       For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file

               ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter &apos;channelmap=map=DL-FL\,DR-FR&apos; out.wav

       will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels
       of the input.

       To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC&apos;s native channel order

               ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter &apos;channelmap=1\,2\,0\,5\,3\,4:channel_layout=5.1&apos; out.wav

   join
       Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       inputs
           Number of input streams. Defaults to 2.

       channel_layout
           Desired output channel layout. Defaults to stereo.

       map Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a comma-separated
           list of mappings, each in the &quot;input_idx.in_channel-out_channel&quot;
           form. input_idx is the 0-based index of the input stream. in_channel
           can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left)
           or its index in the specified input stream. out_channel is the name
           of the output channel.

       The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when those are not
       specified explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused
       matching input channel and if that fails it picks the first unused input
       channel.

       E.g. to join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts)

               ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT

       To build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:

               ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
               &apos;join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL\,1.0-FR\,2.0-FC\,3.0-SL\,4.0-SR\,5.0-LFE&apos;
               out

   resample
       Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. This
       filter is not meant to be used directly.

AUDIO SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.

   abuffer
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/asrc_abuffer.h.
&#12;       It accepts the following mandatory parameters:
       sample_rate:sample_fmt:channel_layout

       sample_rate
           The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

       sample_fmt
           The sample format of the incoming audio buffers.  Either a sample
           format name or its corresponging integer representation from the enum
           AVSampleFormat in libavutil/samplefmt.h

       channel_layout
           The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers.  Either a channel
           layout name from channel_layout_map in libavutil/audioconvert.c or
           its corresponding integer representation from the AV_CH_LAYOUT_*
           macros in libavutil/audioconvert.h

       For example:

               abuffer=44100:s16p:stereo

       will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz.
       Since the sample format with name &quot;s16p&quot; corresponds to the number 6 and
       the &quot;stereo&quot; channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3, this is
       equivalent to:

               abuffer=44100:6:0x3

   aevalsrc
       Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

       This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one for each
       channel), which are evaluated and used to generate a corresponding audio
       signal.

       It accepts the syntax: exprs[::options].  exprs is a list of expressions
       separated by &quot;:&quot;, one for each separate channel. In case the
       channel_layout is not specified, the selected channel layout depends on
       the number of provided expressions.

       options is an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       channel_layout, c
           Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified
           layout must be equal to the number of specified expressions.

       duration, d
           Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See the function
           &quot;av_parse_time()&quot; for the accepted format.  Note that the resulting
           duration may be greater than the specified duration, as the generated
           audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is
           supposed to be generated forever.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default
           to 1024.

       sample_rate, s
           Specify the sample rate, default to 44100.

       Each expression in exprs can contain the following constants:

       n   number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0

       t   time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds, starting from 0

       s   sample rate

       Examples

       &#183;   Generate silence:

                   aevalsrc=0

       &#183;   Generate a sin signal with frequency of 440 Hz, set sample rate to
           8000 Hz:

                   aevalsrc=&quot;sin(440*2*PI*t)::s=8000&quot;

       &#183;   Generate a two channels signal, specify the channel layout (Front
           Center + Back Center) explicitly:

                   aevalsrc=&quot;sin(420*2*PI*t):cos(430*2*PI*t)::c=FC|BC&quot;

       &#183;   Generate white noise:

                   aevalsrc=&quot;-2+random(0)&quot;

       &#183;   Generate an amplitude modulated signal:

                   aevalsrc=&quot;sin(10*2*PI*t)*sin(880*2*PI*t)&quot;

       &#183;   Generate 2.5 Hz binaural beats on a 360 Hz carrier:

                   aevalsrc=&quot;0.1*sin(2*PI*(360-2.5/2)*t) : 0.1*sin(2*PI*(360+2.5/2)*t)&quot;

   anullsrc
       Null audio source, return unprocessed audio frames. It is mainly useful
       as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the
       source for filters which ignore the input data (for example the sox synth
       filter).

       It accepts an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       sample_rate, s
           Specify the sample rate, and defaults to 44100.

       channel_layout, cl
           Specify the channel layout, and can be either an integer or a string
           representing a channel layout. The default value of channel_layout is
           &quot;stereo&quot;.

           Check the channel_layout_map definition in libavcodec/audioconvert.c
           for the mapping between strings and channel layout values.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the number of samples per requested frames.

       Follow some examples:

               #  set the sample rate to 48000 Hz and the channel layout to AV_CH_LAYOUT_MONO.
               anullsrc=r=48000:cl=4

               # same as
               anullsrc=r=48000:cl=mono

   abuffer
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is not intended to be part of user-supplied graph
       descriptions but for insertion by calling programs through the interface
       defined in libavfilter/buffersrc.h.

       It accepts the following named parameters:

       time_base
           Timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It
           must be either a floating-point number or in numerator/denominator
           form.

       sample_rate
           Audio sample rate.

       sample_fmt
           Name of the sample format, as returned by &quot;av_get_sample_fmt_name()&quot;.

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the audio data, in the form that can be accepted by
           &quot;av_get_channel_layout()&quot;.

       All the parameters need to be explicitly defined.

   flite
       Synthesize a voice utterance using the libflite library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       &quot;--enable-libflite&quot;.

       Note that the flite library is not thread-safe.

       The source accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated by
       &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       list_voices
           If set to 1, list the names of the available voices and exit
           immediately. Default value is 0.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the maximum number of samples per frame. Default value is 512.

       textfile
           Set the filename containing the text to speak.

       text
           Set the text to speak.

       voice, v
           Set the voice to use for the speech synthesis. Default value is
           &quot;kal&quot;. See also the list_voices option.

       Examples

       &#183;   Read from file speech.txt, and synthetize the text using the standard
           flite voice:

                   flite=textfile=speech.txt

       &#183;   Read the specified text selecting the &quot;slt&quot; voice:

                   flite=text=&apos;So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am&apos;:voice=slt

       &#183;   Make ffplay speech the specified text, using &quot;flite&quot; and the &quot;lavfi&quot;
           device:

                   ffplay -f lavfi flite=&apos;No more be grieved for which that thou hast done.&apos;

       For more information about libflite, check:
       &lt;http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/&gt;

AUDIO SINKS
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

   abuffersink
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.

       This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular through
       the interface defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       It requires a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which defines
       the incoming buffers&apos; formats, to be passed as the opaque parameter to
       &quot;avfilter_init_filter&quot; for initialization.

   anullsink
       Null audio sink, do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is mainly
       useful as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging tools.

   abuffersink
       This sink is intended for programmatic use. Frames that arrive on this
       sink can be retrieved by the calling program using the interface defined
       in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       This filter accepts no parameters.

VIDEO FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the existing
       filters using &quot;--disable-filters&quot;.  The configure output will show the
       video filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available video filters.

   alphaextract
       Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This is
       especially useful with the alphamerge filter.

   alphamerge
       Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
       grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
       alphaextract to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences that
       have alpha in a format that doesn&apos;t support an alpha channel.

       For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
       and a separate video created with alphaextract, you might use:

               movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]

       Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
       sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
       input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
       pipeline drops frames. If you&apos;re trying to apply an image as an overlay
       to a video stream, consider the overlay filter instead.

   ass
       Draw ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles on top of input video
       using the libass library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       &quot;--enable-libass&quot;.

       This filter accepts the syntax: ass_filename[:options], where
       ass_filename is the filename of the ASS file to read, and options is an
       optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       original_size
           Specifies the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS
           file was composed. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic,
           this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio
           has been changed.

       For example, to render the file sub.ass on top of the input video, use
       the command:

               ass=sub.ass

   bbox
       Compute the bounding box for the non-black pixels in the input frame
       luminance plane.

       This filter computes the bounding box containing all the pixels with a
       luminance value greater than the minimum allowed value.  The parameters
       describing the bounding box are printed on the filter log.

   blackdetect
       Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful
       to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid recordings. Output
       lines contains the time for the start, end and duration of the detected
       black interval expressed in seconds.

       In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
       least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

       This filter accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by &quot;:&quot;. A description of the accepted options follows.

       black_min_duration, d
           Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must
           be a non-negative floating point number.

           Default value is 2.0.

       picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th
           Set the threshold for considering a picture &quot;black&quot;.  Express the
           minimum value for the ratio:

                   &lt;nb_black_pixels&gt; / &lt;nb_pixels&gt;

           for which a picture is considered black.  Default value is 0.98.

       pixel_black_th, pix_th
           Set the threshold for considering a pixel &quot;black&quot;.

           The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
           pixel is considered &quot;black&quot;. The provided value is scaled according
           to the following equation:

                   &lt;absolute_threshold&gt; = &lt;luminance_minimum_value&gt; + &lt;pixel_black_th&gt; * &lt;luminance_range_size&gt;

           luminance_range_size and luminance_minimum_value depend on the input
           video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range formats and
           [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

           Default value is 0.10.

       The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
       value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:

               blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00

   blackframe
       Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to detect
       chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of the frame
       number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness, the position
       in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

       In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
       least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

       The filter accepts the syntax:

               blackframe[=&lt;amount&gt;:[&lt;threshold&gt;]]

       amount is the percentage of the pixels that have to be below the
       threshold, and defaults to 98.

       threshold is the threshold below which a pixel value is considered black,
       and defaults to 32.

   boxblur
       Apply boxblur algorithm to the input video.

       This filter accepts the parameters:
       luma_radius:luma_power:chroma_radius:chroma_power:alpha_radius:alpha_power

       Chroma and alpha parameters are optional, if not specified they default
       to the corresponding values set for luma_radius and luma_power.

       luma_radius, chroma_radius, and alpha_radius represent the radius in
       pixels of the box used for blurring the corresponding input plane. They
       are expressions, and can contain the following constants:

       w, h
           the input width and height in pixels

       cw, ch
           the input chroma image width and height in pixels

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
           pixel format &quot;yuv422p&quot; hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       The radius must be a non-negative number, and must not be greater than
       the value of the expression &quot;min(w,h)/2&quot; for the luma and alpha planes,
       and of &quot;min(cw,ch)/2&quot; for the chroma planes.

       luma_power, chroma_power, and alpha_power represent how many times the
       boxblur filter is applied to the corresponding plane.

       Some examples follow:

       &#183;   Apply a boxblur filter with luma, chroma, and alpha radius set to 2:

                   boxblur=2:1

       &#183;   Set luma radius to 2, alpha and chroma radius to 0

                   boxblur=2:1:0:0:0:0

       &#183;   Set luma and chroma radius to a fraction of the video dimension

                   boxblur=min(h\,w)/10:1:min(cw\,ch)/10:1

   colormatrix
       The colormatrix filter allows conversion between any of the following
       color space: BT.709 (bt709), BT.601 (bt601), SMPTE-240M (smpte240m) and
       FCC (fcc).

       The syntax of the parameters is source:destination:

               colormatrix=bt601:smpte240m

   copy
       Copy the input source unchanged to the output. Mainly useful for testing
       purposes.

   crop
       Crop the input video to out_w:out_h:x:y:keep_aspect

       The keep_aspect parameter is optional, if specified and set to a non-zero
       value will force the output display aspect ratio to be the same of the
       input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

       The out_w, out_h, x, y parameters are expressions containing the
       following constants:

       x, y
           the computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new
           frame.

       in_w, in_h
           the input width and height
&#12;       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output (cropped) width and height

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
           pixel format &quot;yuv422p&quot; hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       n   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       pos the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       The out_w and out_h parameters specify the expressions for the width and
       height of the output (cropped) video. They are evaluated just at the
       configuration of the filter.

       The default value of out_w is &quot;in_w&quot;, and the default value of out_h is
       &quot;in_h&quot;.

       The expression for out_w may depend on the value of out_h, and the
       expression for out_h may depend on out_w, but they cannot depend on x and
       y, as x and y are evaluated after out_w and out_h.

       The x and y parameters specify the expressions for the position of the
       top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated for
       each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it is approximated to
       the nearest valid value.

       The default value of x is &quot;(in_w-out_w)/2&quot;, and the default value for y
       is &quot;(in_h-out_h)/2&quot;, which set the cropped area at the center of the
       input image.

       The expression for x may depend on y, and the expression for y may depend
       on x.

       Follow some examples:

               # crop the central input area with size 100x100
               crop=100:100

               # crop the central input area with size 2/3 of the input video
               &quot;crop=2/3*in_w:2/3*in_h&quot;

               # crop the input video central square
               crop=in_h

               # delimit the rectangle with the top-left corner placed at position
               # 100:100 and the right-bottom corner corresponding to the right-bottom
               # corner of the input image.
               crop=in_w-100:in_h-100:100:100

               # crop 10 pixels from the left and right borders, and 20 pixels from
               # the top and bottom borders
               &quot;crop=in_w-2*10:in_h-2*20&quot;

               # keep only the bottom right quarter of the input image
               &quot;crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:in_w/2:in_h/2&quot;

               # crop height for getting Greek harmony
               &quot;crop=in_w:1/PHI*in_w&quot;

               # trembling effect
               &quot;crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(n/10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(n/7)&quot;

               # erratic camera effect depending on timestamp
               &quot;crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(t*10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(t*13)&quot;

               # set x depending on the value of y
               &quot;crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:y:10+10*sin(n/10)&quot;

   cropdetect
       Auto-detect crop size.

       Calculate necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended
       parameters through the logging system. The detected dimensions correspond
       to the non-black area of the input video.

       It accepts the syntax:

               cropdetect[=&lt;limit&gt;[:&lt;round&gt;[:&lt;reset&gt;]]]

       limit
           Threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to
           everything (255), defaults to 24.

       round
           Value which the width/height should be divisible by, defaults to 16.
           The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
           get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
           encoding to most video codecs.

       reset
           Counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset
           the previously detected largest video area and start over to detect
           the current optimal crop area. Defaults to 0.
&#12;           This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
           indicates never reset and return the largest area encountered during
           playback.

   decimate
       This filter drops frames that do not differ greatly from the previous
       frame in order to reduce framerate.  The main use of this filter is for
       very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming over dialup modem), but it
       could in theory be used for fixing movies that were inverse-telecined
       incorrectly.

       It accepts the following parameters: max:hi:lo:frac.

       max Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if
           positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if
           negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped unregarding the
           number of previous sequentially dropped frames.

           Default value is 0.

       hi, lo, frac
           Set the dropping threshold values.

           Values for hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual
           pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit
           of difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently over
           the block.

           A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
           than a threshold of hi, and if no more than frac blocks (1 meaning
           the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of lo.

           Default value for hi is 64*12, default value for lo is 64*5, and
           default value for frac is 0.33.

   delogo
       Suppress a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding
       pixels. Just set a rectangle covering the logo and watch it disappear
       (and sometimes something even uglier appear - your mileage may vary).

       The filter accepts parameters as a string of the form &quot;x:y:w:h:band&quot;, or
       as a list of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       x, y
           Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They must be
           specified.

       w, h
           Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They must be
           specified.

       band, t
           Specify the thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w
           and h). The default value is 4.

       show
           When set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify
           finding the right x, y, w, h parameters, and band is set to 4. The
           default value is 0.

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   Set a rectangle covering the area with top left corner coordinates
           0,0 and size 100x77, setting a band of size 10:

                   delogo=0:0:100:77:10

       &#183;   As the previous example, but use named options:

                   delogo=x=0:y=0:w=100:h=77:band=10

   deshake
       Attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical shift. This
       filter helps remove camera shake from hand-holding a camera, bumping a
       tripod, moving on a vehicle, etc.

       The filter accepts parameters as a string of the form
       &quot;x:y:w:h:rx:ry:edge:blocksize:contrast:search:filename&quot;

       A description of the accepted parameters follows.

       x, y, w, h
           Specify a rectangular area where to limit the search for motion
           vectors.  If desired the search for motion vectors can be limited to
           a rectangular area of the frame defined by its top left corner, width
           and height. These parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox
           filter which can be used to visualise the position of the bounding
           box.

           This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the
           frame might be confused for camera motion by the motion vector
           search.

           If any or all of x, y, w and h are set to -1 then the full frame is
           used. This allows later options to be set without specifying the
           bounding box for the motion vector search.

           Default - search the whole frame.

       rx, ry
           Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y directions in the
           range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

       edge
           Specify how to generate pixels to fill blanks at the edge of the
           frame. An integer from 0 to 3 as follows:
&#12;           0   Fill zeroes at blank locations

           1   Original image at blank locations

           2   Extruded edge value at blank locations

           3   Mirrored edge at blank locations

           The default setting is mirror edge at blank locations.

       blocksize
           Specify the blocksize to use for motion search. Range 4-128 pixels,
           default 8.

       contrast
           Specify the contrast threshold for blocks. Only blocks with more than
           the specified contrast (difference between darkest and lightest
           pixels) will be considered. Range 1-255, default 125.

       search
           Specify the search strategy 0 = exhaustive search, 1 = less
           exhaustive search. Default - exhaustive search.

       filename
           If set then a detailed log of the motion search is written to the
           specified file.

   drawbox
       Draw a colored box on the input image.

       It accepts the syntax:

               drawbox=&lt;x&gt;:&lt;y&gt;:&lt;width&gt;:&lt;height&gt;:&lt;color&gt;

       x, y
           Specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. Default to 0.

       width, height
           Specify the width and height of the box, if 0 they are interpreted as
           the input width and height. Default to 0.

       color
           Specify the color of the box to write, it can be the name of a color
           (case insensitive match) or a 0xRRGGBB[AA] sequence.

       Follow some examples:

               # draw a black box around the edge of the input image
               drawbox

               # draw a box with color red and an opacity of 50%
               drawbox=10:20:200:60:red@0.5&quot;

   drawtext
       Draw text string or text from specified file on top of video using the
       libfreetype library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       &quot;--enable-libfreetype&quot;.

       The filter also recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text and
       expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime().

       The filter accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated by
       &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       box Used to draw a box around text using background color.  Value should
           be either 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).  The default value of box is 0.

       boxcolor
           The color to be used for drawing box around text.  Either a string
           (e.g. &quot;yellow&quot;) or in 0xRRGGBB[AA] format (e.g. &quot;0xff00ff&quot;), possibly
           followed by an alpha specifier.  The default value of boxcolor is
           &quot;white&quot;.

       draw
           Set an expression which specifies if the text should be drawn. If the
           expression evaluates to 0, the text is not drawn. This is useful for
           specifying that the text should be drawn only when specific
           conditions are met.

           Default value is &quot;1&quot;.

           See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

       fix_bounds
           If true, check and fix text coords to avoid clipping.

       fontcolor
           The color to be used for drawing fonts.  Either a string (e.g. &quot;red&quot;)
           or in 0xRRGGBB[AA] format (e.g. &quot;0xff000033&quot;), possibly followed by
           an alpha specifier.  The default value of fontcolor is &quot;black&quot;.

       fontfile
           The font file to be used for drawing text. Path must be included.
           This parameter is mandatory.

       fontsize

           fontsize is 16.

       ft_load_flags
           Flags to be used for loading the fonts.

           The flags map the corresponding flags supported by libfreetype, and
           are a combination of the following values:
&#12;           default
           no_scale
           no_hinting
           render
           no_bitmap
           vertical_layout
           force_autohint
           crop_bitmap
           pedantic
           ignore_global_advance_width
           no_recurse
           ignore_transform
           monochrome

           libfreetype flags.

       shadowcolor
           The color to be used for drawing a shadow behind the drawn text.  It
           can be a color name (e.g. &quot;yellow&quot;) or a string in the 0xRRGGBB[AA]
           form (e.g. &quot;0xff00ff&quot;), possibly followed by an alpha specifier.  The
           default value of shadowcolor is &quot;black&quot;.

       shadowx, shadowy
           The x and y offsets for the text shadow position with respect to the
           position of the text. They can be either positive or negative values.
           Default value for both is &quot;0&quot;.

       tabsize
           The size in number of spaces to use for rendering the tab.  Default
           value is 4.

       timecode
           Set the initial timecode representation in &quot;hh:mm:ss[:;.]ff&quot; format.
           It can be used with or without text parameter. timecode_rate option
           must be specified.

       timecode_rate, rate, r
           Set the timecode frame rate (timecode only).

       text
           The text string to be drawn. The text must be a sequence of UTF-8
           encoded characters.  This parameter is mandatory if no file is
           specified with the parameter textfile.

       textfile
           A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be a sequence
           of UTF-8 encoded characters.

           This parameter is mandatory if no text string is specified with the
           parameter text.

           If both text and textfile are specified, an error is thrown.

       x, y
           The expressions which specify the offsets where text will be drawn
           within the video frame. They are relative to the top/left border of
           the output image.

           The default value of x and y is &quot;0&quot;.

           See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

       The parameters for x and y are expressions containing the following
       constants and functions:

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
           pixel format &quot;yuv422p&quot; hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       line_h, lh
           the height of each text line

       main_h, h, H
           the input height

       main_w, w, W
           the input width

       max_glyph_a, ascent
           the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
           coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered
           glyphs.  It is a positive value, due to the grid&apos;s orientation with
           the Y axis upwards.

       max_glyph_d, descent
           the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid coordinate
           used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.
           This is a negative value, due to the grid&apos;s orientation, with the Y
           axis upwards.

       max_glyph_h
           maximum glyph height, that is the maximum height for all the glyphs
           contained in the rendered text, it is equivalent to ascent - descent.

       max_glyph_w
           maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all the glyphs
           contained in the rendered text

       n   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       rand(min, max)
           return a random number included between min and max
&#12;       sar input sample aspect ratio

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       text_h, th
           the height of the rendered text

       text_w, tw
           the width of the rendered text

       x, y
           the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

           These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer each other,
           so you can for example specify &quot;y=x/dar&quot;.

       If libavfilter was built with &quot;--enable-fontconfig&quot;, then fontfile can be
       a fontconfig pattern or omitted.

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   Draw &quot;Test Text&quot; with font FreeSerif, using the default values for
           the optional parameters.

                   drawtext=&quot;fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text=&apos;Test Text&apos;&quot;

       &#183;   Draw &apos;Test Text&apos; with font FreeSerif of size 24 at position x=100 and
           y=50 (counting from the top-left corner of the screen), text is
           yellow with a red box around it. Both the text and the box have an
           opacity of 20%.

                   drawtext=&quot;fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text=&apos;Test Text&apos;:\
                             x=100: y=50: fontsize=24: fontcolor=yellow@0.2: box=1: boxcolor=red@0.2&quot;

           Note that the double quotes are not necessary if spaces are not used
           within the parameter list.

       &#183;   Show the text at the center of the video frame:

                   drawtext=&quot;fontsize=30:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=&apos;hello world&apos;:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h-line_h)/2&quot;

       &#183;   Show a text line sliding from right to left in the last row of the
           video frame. The file LONG_LINE is assumed to contain a single line
           with no newlines.

                   drawtext=&quot;fontsize=15:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=LONG_LINE:y=h-line_h:x=-50*t&quot;

       &#183;   Show the content of file CREDITS off the bottom of the frame and
           scroll up.

                   drawtext=&quot;fontsize=20:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:textfile=CREDITS:y=h-20*t&quot;

       &#183;   Draw a single green letter &quot;g&quot;, at the center of the input video.
           The glyph baseline is placed at half screen height.

                   drawtext=&quot;fontsize=60:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=green:text=g:x=(w-max_glyph_w)/2:y=h/2-ascent&quot;

       &#183;   Show text for 1 second every 3 seconds:

                   drawtext=&quot;fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=white:x=100:y=x/dar:draw=lt(mod(t\\,3)\\,1):text=&apos;blink&apos;&quot;

       &#183;   Use fontconfig to set the font. Note that the colons need to be
           escaped.

                   drawtext=&apos;fontfile=Linux Libertine O-40\\:style=Semibold:text=FFmpeg&apos;

       &lt;http://freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html&gt;.

   edgedetect
       Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge Detection
       algorithm.

       This filter accepts the following optional named parameters:

       low, high
           Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding
           algorithm.

           The high threshold selects the &quot;strong&quot; edge pixels, which are then
           connected through 8-connectivity with the &quot;weak&quot; edge pixels selected
           by the low threshold.

           low and high threshold values must be choosen in the range [0,1], and
           low should be lesser or equal to high.

           Default value for low is &quot;20/255&quot;, and default value for high is
           &quot;50/255&quot;.

       Example:

               edgedetect=low=0.1:high=0.4

   fade
       Apply fade-in/out effect to input video.

       It accepts the parameters: type:start_frame:nb_frames[:options]

       type specifies if the effect type, can be either &quot;in&quot; for fade-in, or
       &quot;out&quot; for a fade-out effect.

       start_frame specifies the number of the start frame for starting to apply
       the fade effect.

       nb_frames specifies the number of frames for which the fade effect has to
       last. At the end of the fade-in effect the output video will have the
       same intensity as the input video, at the end of the fade-out transition
       the output video will be completely black.

       options is an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;. The
       description of the accepted options follows.

       type, t
           See type.

       start_frame, s
           See start_frame.

       nb_frames, n
           See nb_frames.

       alpha
           If set to 1, fade only alpha channel, if one exists on the input.
           Default value is 0.

       A few usage examples follow, usable too as test scenarios.

               # fade in first 30 frames of video
               fade=in:0:30

               # fade out last 45 frames of a 200-frame video
               fade=out:155:45

               # fade in first 25 frames and fade out last 25 frames of a 1000-frame video
               fade=in:0:25, fade=out:975:25

               # make first 5 frames black, then fade in from frame 5-24
               fade=in:5:20

               # fade in alpha over first 25 frames of video
               fade=in:0:25:alpha=1

   fieldorder
       Transform the field order of the input video.

       It accepts one parameter which specifies the required field order that
       the input interlaced video will be transformed to. The parameter can
       assume one of the following values:

       0 or bff
           output bottom field first

       1 or tff
           output top field first

       Default value is &quot;tff&quot;.

       Transformation is achieved by shifting the picture content up or down by
       one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture
       content.  This method is consistent with most broadcast field order
       converters.

       If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
       flagged as being of the required output field order then this filter does
       not alter the incoming video.

       This filter is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
       which is bottom field first.

       For example:

               ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf &quot;fieldorder=bff&quot; out.dv

   fifo
       Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.

       This filter is mainly useful when auto-inserted by the libavfilter
       framework.

       The filter does not take parameters.

   format
       Convert the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.
       Libavfilter will try to pick one that is supported for the input to the
       next filter.

       The filter accepts a list of pixel format names, separated by &quot;:&quot;, for
       example &quot;yuv420p:monow:rgb24&quot;.

       Some examples follow:

               # convert the input video to the format &quot;yuv420p&quot;
               format=yuv420p

               # convert the input video to any of the formats in the list
               format=yuv420p:yuv444p:yuv410p

   fps
       Convert the video to specified constant framerate by duplicating or
       dropping frames as necessary.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       fps Desired output framerate.

   framestep
       Select one frame every N.

       This filter accepts in input a string representing a positive integer.
       Default argument is 1.

   frei0r
       Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
       header and configure FFmpeg with &quot;--enable-frei0r&quot;.

       The filter supports the syntax:
&#12;               &lt;filter_name&gt;[{:|=}&lt;param1&gt;:&lt;param2&gt;:...:&lt;paramN&gt;]

       filter_name is the name to the frei0r effect to load. If the environment
       variable FREI0R_PATH is defined, the frei0r effect is searched in each
       one of the directories specified by the colon separated list in
       FREIOR_PATH, otherwise in the standard frei0r paths, which are in this
       order: HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/, /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/, /usr/lib/frei0r-1/.

       param1, param2, ... , paramN specify the parameters for the frei0r
       effect.

       A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (whose values are specified
       with &quot;y&quot; and &quot;n&quot;), a double, a color (specified by the syntax R/G/B, R,
       G, and B being float numbers from 0.0 to 1.0) or by an &quot;av_parse_color()&quot;
       color description), a position (specified by the syntax X/Y, X and Y
       being float numbers) and a string.

       The number and kind of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an
       effect parameter is not specified the default value is set.

       Some examples follow:

       &#183;   Apply the distort0r effect, set the first two double parameters:

                   frei0r=distort0r:0.5:0.01

       &#183;   Apply the colordistance effect, takes a color as first parameter:

                   frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
                   frei0r=colordistance:violet
                   frei0r=colordistance:0x112233

       &#183;   Apply the perspective effect, specify the top left and top right
           image positions:

                   frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2:0.8/0.2

       For more information see: &lt;http://frei0r.dyne.org&gt;

   gradfun
       Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
       regions by truncation to 8bit color depth.  Interpolate the gradients
       that should go where the bands are, and dither them.

       This filter is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to lossy
       compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and bring back
       the bands.

       The filter takes two optional parameters, separated by &apos;:&apos;:
       strength:radius

       strength is the maximum amount by which the filter will change any one
       pixel. Also the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable
       values range from .51 to 255, default value is 1.2, out-of-range values
       will be clipped to the valid range.

       radius is the neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes
       for smoother gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the
       pixels near detailed regions. Acceptable values are 8-32, default value
       is 16, out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

               # default parameters
               gradfun=1.2:16

               # omitting radius
               gradfun=1.2

   hflip
       Flip the input video horizontally.

       For example to horizontally flip the input video with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf &quot;hflip&quot; out.avi

   hqdn3d
       High precision/quality 3d denoise filter. This filter aims to reduce
       image noise producing smooth images and making still images really still.
       It should enhance compressibility.

       It accepts the following optional parameters:
       luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp

       luma_spatial
           a non-negative float number which specifies spatial luma strength,
           defaults to 4.0

       chroma_spatial
           a non-negative float number which specifies spatial chroma strength,
           defaults to 3.0*luma_spatial/4.0

       luma_tmp
           a float number which specifies luma temporal strength, defaults to
           6.0*luma_spatial/4.0

       chroma_tmp
           a float number which specifies chroma temporal strength, defaults to
           luma_tmp*chroma_spatial/luma_spatial

   hue
       Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input.

       This filter accepts the following optional named options:

       h   Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts a float
           number or an expression, and defaults to 0.0.

       H   Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts a float
           number or an expression, and defaults to 0.0.

       s   Specify the saturation in the [-10,10] range. It accepts a float
           number and defaults to 1.0.

       The h, H and s parameters are expressions containing the following
       constants:

       n   frame count of the input frame starting from 0

       pts presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base
           units

       r   frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       tb  time base of the input video

       The options can also be set using the syntax: hue:saturation

       In this case hue is expressed in degrees.

       Some examples follow:

       &#183;   Set the hue to 90 degrees and the saturation to 1.0:

                   hue=h=90:s=1

       &#183;   Same command but expressing the hue in radians:

                   hue=H=PI/2:s=1

       &#183;   Same command without named options, hue must be expressed in degrees:

                   hue=90:1

       &#183;   Note that &quot;h:s&quot; syntax does not support expressions for the values of
           h and s, so the following example will issue an error:

                   hue=PI/2:1

       &#183;   Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0 and 2 over a
           period of 1 second:

                   hue=&quot;H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1&quot;

       &#183;   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:

                   hue=&quot;s=min(t/3\,1)&quot;

           The general fade-in expression can be written as:

                   hue=&quot;s=min(0\, max((t-START)/DURATION\, 1))&quot;

       &#183;   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:

                   hue=&quot;s=max(0\, min(1\, (8-t)/3))&quot;

           The general fade-out expression can be written as:

                   hue=&quot;s=max(0\, min(1\, (START+DURATION-t)/DURATION))&quot;

       Commands

       This filter supports the following command:

       reinit
           Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input video.  The command
           accepts the same named options and syntax than when calling the
           filter from the command-line.

           If a parameter is omitted, it is kept at its current value.

   idet
       Interlaceing detect filter. This filter tries to detect if the input is
       interlaced or progressive. Top or bottom field first.

   lut, lutrgb, lutyuv
       Compute a look-up table for binding each pixel component input value to
       an output value, and apply it to input video.

       lutyuv applies a lookup table to a YUV input video, lutrgb to an RGB
       input video.

       These filters accept in input a &quot;:&quot;-separated list of options, which
       specify the expressions used for computing the lookup table for the
       corresponding pixel component values.

       The lut filter requires either YUV or RGB pixel formats in input, and
       accepts the options:

       c0  first  pixel component

       c1  second pixel component

       c2  third  pixel component

       c3  fourth pixel component, corresponds to the alpha component

       The exact component associated to each option depends on the format in
       input.

       The lutrgb filter requires RGB pixel formats in input, and accepts the
       options:

       r   red component

       g   green component

       b   blue component

       a   alpha component

       The lutyuv filter requires YUV pixel formats in input, and accepts the
       options:

       y   Y/luminance component

       u   U/Cb component

       v   V/Cr component

       a   alpha component

       The expressions can contain the following constants and functions:

       w, h
           the input width and height

       val input value for the pixel component

       clipval
           the input value clipped in the minval-maxval range

       maxval
           maximum value for the pixel component

       minval
           minimum value for the pixel component

       negval
           the negated value for the pixel component value clipped in the
           minval-maxval range , it corresponds to the expression
           &quot;maxval-clipval+minval&quot;

       clip(val)
           the computed value in val clipped in the minval-maxval range

       gammaval(gamma)
           the computed gamma correction value of the pixel component value
           clipped in the minval-maxval range, corresponds to the expression
           &quot;pow((clipval-minval)/(maxval-minval)\,gamma)*(maxval-minval)+minval&quot;

       All expressions default to &quot;val&quot;.

       Some examples follow:

               # negate input video
               lutrgb=&quot;r=maxval+minval-val:g=maxval+minval-val:b=maxval+minval-val&quot;
               lutyuv=&quot;y=maxval+minval-val:u=maxval+minval-val:v=maxval+minval-val&quot;

               # the above is the same as
               lutrgb=&quot;r=negval:g=negval:b=negval&quot;
               lutyuv=&quot;y=negval:u=negval:v=negval&quot;

               # negate luminance
               lutyuv=y=negval

               # remove chroma components, turns the video into a graytone image
               lutyuv=&quot;u=128:v=128&quot;

               # apply a luma burning effect
               lutyuv=&quot;y=2*val&quot;

               # remove green and blue components
               lutrgb=&quot;g=0:b=0&quot;

               # set a constant alpha channel value on input
               format=rgba,lutrgb=a=&quot;maxval-minval/2&quot;

               # correct luminance gamma by a 0.5 factor
               lutyuv=y=gammaval(0.5)

   mp
       Apply an MPlayer filter to the input video.

       This filter provides a wrapper around most of the filters of
       MPlayer/MEncoder.

       This wrapper is considered experimental. Some of the wrapped filters may
       not work properly and we may drop support for them, as they will be
       implemented natively into FFmpeg. Thus you should avoid depending on them
       when writing portable scripts.

       The filters accepts the parameters: filter_name[:=]filter_params

       filter_name is the name of a supported MPlayer filter, filter_params is a
       string containing the parameters accepted by the named filter.

       The list of the currently supported filters follows:

       denoise3d
       detc
       dint
       divtc
       down3dright
       dsize

       tinterlace
       unsharp
       uspp
       yuvcsp
       yvu9

       The parameter syntax and behavior for the listed filters are the same of
       the corresponding MPlayer filters. For detailed instructions check the
       &quot;VIDEO FILTERS&quot; section in the MPlayer manual.

       Some examples follow:

       &#183;   Adjust gamma, brightness, contrast:

                   mp=eq2=1.0:2:0.5

       &#183;   Add temporal noise to input video:

                   mp=noise=20t

       See also mplayer(1), &lt;http://www.mplayerhq.hu/&gt;.

   negate
       Negate input video.

       This filter accepts an integer in input, if non-zero it negates the alpha
       component (if available). The default value in input is 0.

   noformat
       Force libavfilter not to use any of the specified pixel formats for the
       input to the next filter.

       The filter accepts a list of pixel format names, separated by &quot;:&quot;, for
       example &quot;yuv420p:monow:rgb24&quot;.

       Some examples follow:

               # force libavfilter to use a format different from &quot;yuv420p&quot; for the
               # input to the vflip filter
               noformat=yuv420p,vflip

               # convert the input video to any of the formats not contained in the list
               noformat=yuv420p:yuv444p:yuv410p

   null
       Pass the video source unchanged to the output.

   ocv
       Apply video transform using libopencv.

       To enable this filter install libopencv library and headers and configure
       FFmpeg with &quot;--enable-libopencv&quot;.

       The filter takes the parameters: filter_name{:=}filter_params.

       filter_name is the name of the libopencv filter to apply.

       filter_params specifies the parameters to pass to the libopencv filter.
       If not specified the default values are assumed.

       Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
       information:
       &lt;http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/c/image_filtering.html&gt;

       Follows the list of supported libopencv filters.

       dilate

       Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.  This filter
       corresponds to the libopencv function &quot;cvDilate&quot;.

       It accepts the parameters: struct_el:nb_iterations.

       struct_el represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
       colsxrows+anchor_xxanchor_y/shape

       cols and rows represent the number of columns and rows of the structuring
       element, anchor_x and anchor_y the anchor point, and shape the shape for
       the structuring element, and can be one of the values &quot;rect&quot;, &quot;cross&quot;,
       &quot;ellipse&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;.

       If the value for shape is &quot;custom&quot;, it must be followed by a string of
       the form &quot;=filename&quot;. The file with name filename is assumed to represent
       a binary image, with each printable character corresponding to a bright
       pixel. When a custom shape is used, cols and rows are ignored, the number
       or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

       The default value for struct_el is &quot;3x3+0x0/rect&quot;.

       nb_iterations specifies the number of times the transform is applied to
       the image, and defaults to 1.

       Follow some example:

               # use the default values
               ocv=dilate

               # dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterate two times
               ocv=dilate=5x5+2x2/cross:2

               # read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterate two times
               # the file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this:
               #   *
               #  ***
               # *****
               #  ***
               #   *
               # the specified cols and rows are ignored (but not the anchor point coordinates)
               ocv=0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape:2

       erode

       Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.  This filter
       corresponds to the libopencv function &quot;cvErode&quot;.

       The filter accepts the parameters: struct_el:nb_iterations, with the same
       syntax and semantics as the dilate filter.

       smooth

       Smooth the input video.

       The filter takes the following parameters:
       type:param1:param2:param3:param4.

       type is the type of smooth filter to apply, and can be one of the
       following values: &quot;blur&quot;, &quot;blur_no_scale&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;gaussian&quot;,
       &quot;bilateral&quot;. The default value is &quot;gaussian&quot;.

       param1, param2, param3, and param4 are parameters whose meanings depend
       on smooth type. param1 and param2 accept integer positive values or 0,
       param3 and param4 accept float values.

       The default value for param1 is 3, the default value for the other
       parameters is 0.
&#12;       These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the libopencv
       function &quot;cvSmooth&quot;.

   overlay
       Overlay one video on top of another.

       It takes two inputs and one output, the first input is the &quot;main&quot; video
       on which the second input is overlayed.

       It accepts the parameters: x:y[:options].

       x is the x coordinate of the overlayed video on the main video, y is the
       y coordinate. x and y are expressions containing the following
       parameters:

       main_w, main_h
           main input width and height

       W, H
           same as main_w and main_h

       overlay_w, overlay_h
           overlay input width and height

       w, h
           same as overlay_w and overlay_h

       options is an optional list of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       rgb If set to 1, force the filter to accept inputs in the RGB color
           space. Default value is 0.

       Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp order,
       hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a a good idea to pass
       the two inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to have them begin in
       the same zero timestamp, as it does the example for the movie filter.

       Follow some examples:

               # draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right
               # corner of the main video.
               overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10

               # insert a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input
               ffmpeg -i input -i logo -filter_complex &apos;overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10&apos; output

               # insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom
               # right corner):
               ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex
               &apos;overlay=10:H-h-10,overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10&apos; output

               # add a transparent color layer on top of the main video,
               # WxH specifies the size of the main input to the overlay filter
               color=red.3:WxH [over]; [in][over] overlay [out]

               # play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake filter)
               # side by side
               ffplay input.avi -vf &apos;split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w&apos;

               # the previous example is the same as:
               ffplay input.avi -vf &apos;split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w&apos;

       You can chain together more overlays but the efficiency of such approach
       is yet to be tested.

   pad
       Add paddings to the input image, and places the original input at the
       given coordinates x, y.

       It accepts the following parameters: width:height:x:y:color.

       The parameters width, height, x, and y are expressions containing the
       following constants:

       in_w, in_h
           the input video width and height

       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as
           specified by the width and height expressions

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       x, y
           x and y offsets as specified by the x and y expressions, or NAN if
           not yet specified

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
           pixel format &quot;yuv422p&quot; hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       Follows the description of the accepted parameters.

       width, height
           Specify the size of the output image with the paddings added. If the
           value for width or height is 0, the corresponding input size is used
           for the output.

           The width expression can reference the value set by the height
           expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of width and height is 0.

       x, y
           Specify the offsets where to place the input image in the padded area
           with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

           The x expression can reference the value set by the y expression, and
           vice versa.

           The default value of x and y is 0.

       color
           Specify the color of the padded area, it can be the name of a color
           (case insensitive match) or a 0xRRGGBB[AA] sequence.

           The default value of color is &quot;black&quot;.

   Examples
       &#183;   Add paddings with color &quot;violet&quot; to the input video. Output video
           size is 640x480, the top-left corner of the input video is placed at
           column 0, row 40:

                   pad=640:480:0:40:violet

       &#183;   Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2, and
           put the input video at the center of the padded area:

                   pad=&quot;3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2&quot;

       &#183;   Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum
           value between the input width and height, and put the input video at
           the center of the padded area:

                   pad=&quot;max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2&quot;

       &#183;   Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:

                   pad=&quot;ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2&quot;

       &#183;   In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display
           aspect correctly, it is necessary to use sar in the expression,
           according to the relation:

                   (ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
                   X = output_dar / sar

           Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:

                   pad=&quot;ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2&quot;

       &#183;   Double output size and put the input video in the bottom-right corner
           of the output padded area:

                   pad=&quot;2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih&quot;

   pixdesctest
       Pixel format descriptor test filter, mainly useful for internal testing.
       The output video should be equal to the input video.

       For example:

               format=monow, pixdesctest

       can be used to test the monowhite pixel format descriptor definition.

   removelogo
       Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which pixels
       comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that comprise the
       logo with neighboring pixels.

       This filter requires one argument which specifies the filter bitmap file,
       which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The width and
       height of the image file must match those of the video stream being
       processed.

       Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
       considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of the
       logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest, you
       will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a
       screen capture of a black frame with the logo visible, and then using a
       threshold filter followed by the erode filter once or twice.

       If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if logo
       pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much reduced. Marking
       too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much, but it will
       increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over the image and will
       destroy more information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow
       things down on a large logo.

   scale
       Scale the input video to width:height[:interl={1|-1}] and/or convert the
       image format.

       The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same of
       the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

       The parameters width and height are expressions containing the following
       constants:

       in_w, in_h
           the input width and height

       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output (cropped) width and height

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
           pixel format &quot;yuv422p&quot; hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       If the input image format is different from the format requested by the
       next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the requested
       format.

       If the value for width or height is 0, the respective input size is used
       for the output.

       If the value for width or height is -1, the scale filter will use, for
       the respective output size, a value that maintains the aspect ratio of
       the input image.

       The default value of width and height is 0.

       Valid values for the optional parameter interl are:

       1   force interlaced aware scaling

       -1  select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source
           frames are flagged as interlaced or not

       Unless interl is set to one of the above options, interlaced scaling will
       not be used.

       Some examples follow:

               # scale the input video to a size of 200x100.
               scale=200:100

               # scale the input to 2x
               scale=2*iw:2*ih
               # the above is the same as
               scale=2*in_w:2*in_h

               # scale the input to 2x with forced interlaced scaling
               scale=2*iw:2*ih:interl=1

               # scale the input to half size
               scale=iw/2:ih/2

               # increase the width, and set the height to the same size
               scale=3/2*iw:ow

               # seek for Greek harmony
               scale=iw:1/PHI*iw
               scale=ih*PHI:ih

               # increase the height, and set the width to 3/2 of the height
               scale=3/2*oh:3/5*ih

               # increase the size, but make the size a multiple of the chroma
               scale=&quot;trunc(3/2*iw/hsub)*hsub:trunc(3/2*ih/vsub)*vsub&quot;

               # increase the width to a maximum of 500 pixels, keep the same input aspect ratio
               scale=&apos;min(500\, iw*3/2):-1&apos;

   select
       Select frames to pass in output.

       It accepts in input an expression, which is evaluated for each input
       frame. If the expression is evaluated to a non-zero value, the frame is
       selected and passed to the output, otherwise it is discarded.

       The expression can contain the following constants:

       n   the sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0

       selected_n
           the sequential number of the selected frame, starting from 0

       prev_selected_n
           the sequential number of the last selected frame, NAN if undefined

       TB  timebase of the input timestamps

       pts the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame,
           expressed in TB units, NAN if undefined

       t   the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame,
           expressed in seconds, NAN if undefined

       prev_pts
           the PTS of the previously filtered video frame, NAN if undefined

       prev_selected_pts
           the PTS of the last previously filtered video frame, NAN if undefined

       prev_selected_t
           the PTS of the last previously selected video frame, NAN if undefined

       start_pts
           the PTS of the first video frame in the video, NAN if undefined

       start_t
           the time of the first video frame in the video, NAN if undefined

       pict_type
           the type of the filtered frame, can assume one of the following
           values:

           I
           P
           B
           S
           SI
           SP
           BI
       interlace_type
           the frame interlace type, can assume one of the following values:

           PROGRESSIVE
               the frame is progressive (not interlaced)

           TOPFIRST
               the frame is top-field-first

           BOTTOMFIRST
               the frame is bottom-field-first

       key 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise

       pos the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information
           is not available (e.g. for synthetic video)

       scene
           value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a
           low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while
           a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see
           the example below)

       The default value of the select expression is &quot;1&quot;.

       Some examples follow:

               # select all frames in input
               select

               # the above is the same as:
               select=1

               # skip all frames:
               select=0

               # select only I-frames
               select=&apos;eq(pict_type\,I)&apos;

               # select one frame every 100
               select=&apos;not(mod(n\,100))&apos;

               # select only frames contained in the 10-20 time interval
               select=&apos;gte(t\,10)*lte(t\,20)&apos;

               # select only I frames contained in the 10-20 time interval
               select=&apos;gte(t\,10)*lte(t\,20)*eq(pict_type\,I)&apos;

               # select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds
               select=&apos;isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t\,10)&apos;

       Complete example to create a mosaic of the first scenes:

               ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select=&apos;gt(scene\,0.4)&apos;,scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png

       Comparing scene against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane
       choice.

   setdar, setsar
       The &quot;setdar&quot; filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output
       video.

       This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio,
       according to the following equation:

               &lt;DAR&gt; = &lt;HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION&gt; / &lt;VERTICAL_RESOLUTION&gt; * &lt;SAR&gt;

       Keep in mind that the &quot;setdar&quot; filter does not modify the pixel
       dimensions of the video frame. Also the display aspect ratio set by this
       filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in case
       of scaling or if another &quot;setdar&quot; or a &quot;setsar&quot; filter is applied.

       The &quot;setsar&quot; filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the
       filter output video.

       Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the output
       display aspect ratio will change according to the equation above.

       Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the &quot;setsar&quot; filter may
       be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if another &quot;setsar&quot;
       or a &quot;setdar&quot; filter is applied.

       The &quot;setdar&quot; and &quot;setsar&quot; filters accept a parameter string which
       represents the wanted aspect ratio.  The parameter can be a floating
       point number string, an expression, or a string of the form num:den,
       where num and den are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio.
       If the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value &quot;0:1&quot;.

       For example to change the display aspect ratio to 16:9, specify:

               setdar=16:9

       The example above is equivalent to:

               setdar=1.77777

       To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:

               setsar=10:11

   setfield
       Force field for the output video frame.

       The &quot;setfield&quot; filter marks the interlace type field for the output
       frames. It does not change the input frame, but only sets the
       corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by
       following filters (e.g. &quot;fieldorder&quot; or &quot;yadif&quot;).

       It accepts a string parameter, which can assume the following values:

       auto
           Keep the same field property.

       bff Mark the frame as bottom-field-first.

       tff Mark the frame as top-field-first.

       prog
           Mark the frame as progressive.

   showinfo
       Show a line containing various information for each input video frame.
       The input video is not modified.

       The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form
       key:value.

       A description of each shown parameter follows:

       n   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

       pts Presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           time base units. The time base unit depends on the filter input pad.

       pts_time
           Presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           seconds

       pos position of the frame in the input stream, -1 if this information in
           unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic
           video)

       fmt pixel format name

       sar sample aspect ratio of the input frame, expressed in the form num/den

       s   size of the input frame, expressed in the form widthxheight

       i   interlaced mode (&quot;P&quot; for &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;T&quot; for top field first, &quot;B&quot;
           for bottom field first)

       iskey
           1 if the frame is a key frame, 0 otherwise

       type
           picture type of the input frame (&quot;I&quot; for an I-frame, &quot;P&quot; for a
           P-frame, &quot;B&quot; for a B-frame, &quot;?&quot; for unknown type).  Check also the
           documentation of the &quot;AVPictureType&quot; enum and of the
           &quot;av_get_picture_type_char&quot; function defined in libavutil/avutil.h.

       checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of all the planes of the
           input frame

       plane_checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of each plane of the input
           frame, expressed in the form &quot;[c0 c1 c2 c3]&quot;

   slicify
       Pass the images of input video on to next video filter as multiple
       slices.

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf &quot;slicify=32&quot; out.avi

       The filter accepts the slice height as parameter. If the parameter is not
       specified it will use the default value of 16.

       Adding this in the beginning of filter chains should make filtering
       faster due to better use of the memory cache.

   smartblur
       Blur the input video without impacting the outlines.

       The filter accepts the following parameters:
       luma_radius:luma_strength:luma_threshold[:chroma_radius:chroma_strength:chroma_threshold]

       Parameters prefixed by luma indicate that they work on the luminance of
       the pixels whereas parameters prefixed by chroma refer to the chrominance
       of the pixels.

       If the chroma parameters are not set, the luma parameters are used for
       either the luminance and the chrominance of the pixels.

       luma_radius or chroma_radius must be a float number in the range
       [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter used to blur
       the image (slower if larger).

       luma_strength or chroma_strength must be a float number in the range
       [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included in [0.0,1.0]
       will blur the image whereas a value included in [-1.0,0.0] will sharpen
       the image.

       luma_threshold or chroma_threshold must be an integer in the range
       [-30,30] that is used as a coefficient to determine whether a pixel
       should be blurred or not. A value of 0 will filter all the image, a value
       included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included in [-30,0]
       will filter edges.

   split
       Split input video into several identical outputs.

       The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of
       outputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       For example

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex split=5 OUTPUT

       will create 5 copies of the input video.

       For example:

               [in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
               [splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
               [splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];

       will create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and one
       padded.

   super2xsai
       Scale the input by 2x and smooth using the Super2xSaI (Scale and
       Interpolate) pixel art scaling algorithm.

       Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.

   swapuv
       Swap U &amp; V plane.

   thumbnail
       Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive
       frames.

       It accepts as argument the frames batch size to analyze (default N=100);
       in a set of N frames, the filter will pick one of them, and then handle
       the next batch of N frames until the end.

       Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger N
       value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not
       recommended.

       The following example extract one picture each 50 frames:

               thumbnail=50

       Complete example of a thumbnail creation with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png

   tile
       Tile several successive frames together.

       It accepts as argument the tile size (i.e. the number of lines and
       columns) in the form &quot;wxh&quot;.

       For example, produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (-skip_frame nokey)
       in a movie:

               ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf &apos;scale=128:72,tile=8x8&apos; -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

       The -vsync 0 is necessary to prevent ffmpeg from duplicating each output
       frame to accomodate the originally detected frame rate.

   tinterlace
       Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

       Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
       considered odd.

       This filter accepts a single parameter specifying the mode. Available
       modes are:

       merge, 0
           Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field,
           generating a double height frame at half framerate.

       drop_odd, 1
           Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped, generating a frame
           with unchanged height at half framerate.

       drop_even, 2
           Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped, generating a frame
           with unchanged height at half framerate.

       pad, 3
           Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate lines with black,
           generating a frame with double height at the same input framerate.

       interleave_top, 4
           Interleave the upper field from odd frames with the lower field from
           even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half
           framerate.

       interleave_bottom, 5
           Interleave the lower field from odd frames with the upper field from
           even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half
           framerate.

       interlacex2, 6
           Double frame rate with unchanged height. Frames are inserted each
           containing the second temporal field from the previous input frame
           and the first temporal field from the next input frame. This mode
           relies on the top_field_first flag. Useful for interlaced video
           displays with no field synchronisation.

       Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward compatibility
       reasons.

       Default mode is &quot;merge&quot;.

   transpose
       Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

       It accepts a parameter representing an integer, which can assume the
       values:

       0, 4
           Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default),
           that is:

                   L.R     L.l
                   . . -&gt;  . .
                   l.r     R.r

       1, 5
           Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is:

                   L.R     l.L
                   . . -&gt;  . .
                   l.r     r.R

       2, 6
           Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:

                   L.R     R.r
                   . . -&gt;  . .
                   l.r     L.l

       3, 7
           Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:

                   L.R     r.R
                   . . -&gt;  . .
                   l.r     l.L

       For values between 4-7 transposition is only done if the input video
       geometry is portrait and not landscape.

   unsharp
       Sharpen or blur the input video.

       It accepts the following parameters:
       luma_msize_x:luma_msize_y:luma_amount:chroma_msize_x:chroma_msize_y:chroma_amount

       Negative values for the amount will blur the input video, while positive
       values will sharpen. All parameters are optional and default to the
       equivalent of the string &apos;5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0&apos;.

       luma_msize_x
           Set the luma matrix horizontal size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       luma_msize_y
           Set the luma matrix vertical size. It can be an integer between 3 and
           13, default value is 5.

       luma_amount
           Set the luma effect strength. It can be a float number between -2.0
           and 5.0, default value is 1.0.

       chroma_msize_x
           Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       chroma_msize_y
           Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       chroma_amount
           Set the chroma effect strength. It can be a float number between -2.0
           and 5.0, default value is 0.0.

               # Strong luma sharpen effect parameters
               unsharp=7:7:2.5

               # Strong blur of both luma and chroma parameters
               unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2

               # Use the default values with B&lt;ffmpeg&gt;
               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf &quot;unsharp&quot; out.mp4

   vflip
       Flip the input video vertically.

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf &quot;vflip&quot; out.avi

   yadif
       Deinterlace the input video (&quot;yadif&quot; means &quot;yet another deinterlacing
       filter&quot;).

       It accepts the optional parameters: mode:parity:auto.

       mode specifies the interlacing mode to adopt, accepts one of the
       following values:

       0   output 1 frame for each frame

       1   output 1 frame for each field

       2   like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check

       3   like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check

       Default value is 0.

       parity specifies the picture field parity assumed for the input
       interlaced video, accepts one of the following values:

       0   assume top field first

       1   assume bottom field first

       -1  enable automatic detection

       Default value is -1.  If interlacing is unknown or decoder does not
       export this information, top field first will be assumed.

       auto specifies if deinterlacer should trust the interlaced flag and only
       deinterlace frames marked as interlaced

       0   deinterlace all frames

       1   only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced

       Default value is 0.

VIDEO SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available video sources.

   buffer
       Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h.

       It accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs separated by
       &quot;:&quot;. A descroption of the accepted options follows.

       video_size
           Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames.

       pix_fmt
           A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
           It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
           name.

       time_base
           Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered
           frames.

       time_base
           Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.

       pixel_aspect
           Specify the sample aspect ratio assumed by the video frames.

       sws_param
           Specify the optional parameters to be used for the scale filter which
           is automatically inserted when an input change is detected in the
           input size or format.

       For example:

               buffer=size=320x240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

       will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
       with format &quot;yuv410p&quot;, assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
       square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).  Since the pixel format with
       name &quot;yuv410p&quot; corresponds to the number 6 (check the enum PixelFormat
       definition in libavutil/pixfmt.h), this example corresponds to:

               buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
       syntax is deprecated:

       width:height:pix_fmt:time_base.num:time_base.den:pixel_aspect.num:pixel_aspect.den[:sws_param]

   cellauto
       Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

       The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
       filename, and pattern options. If such options are not specified an
       initial state is created randomly.

       At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of the
       cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole frame is
       filled is defined by the scroll option.

       This source accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by &quot;:&quot;. A description of the accepted options follows.

       filename, f
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row,
           from the specified file.  In the file, each non-whitespace character
           is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and
           further characters in the file will be ignored.

       pattern, p
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row,
           from the specified string.

           Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive
           cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
           string will be ignored.

       rate, r
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per
           second.  Default is 25.

       random_fill_ratio, ratio
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It
           is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to
           1/PHI.

           This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.

       random_seed, seed
           Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer
           included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
           set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
           effort basis.

       rule
           Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to
           255.  Default value is 110.

       size, s
           Set the size of the output video.

           If filename or pattern is specified, the size is set by default to
           the width of the specified initial state row, and the height is set
           to width * PHI.

           If size is set, it must contain the width of the specified pattern
           string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the larger row.

           If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value
           defaults to &quot;320x518&quot; (used for a randomly generated initial state).

       scroll
           If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output
           have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be
           written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled.
           Defaults to 1.

       start_full, full
           If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before
           outputting the first frame.  This is the default behavior, for
           disabling set the value to 0.

       stitch
           If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together.  This is
           the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

       Examples

       &#183;   Read the initial state from pattern, and specify an output of size
           200x400.

                   cellauto=f=pattern:s=200x400

       &#183;   Generate a random initial row with a width of 200 cells, with a fill
           ratio of 2/3:

                   cellauto=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       &#183;   Create a pattern generated by rule 18 starting by a single alive cell
           centered on an initial row with width 100:

                   cellauto=p=@s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

       &#183;   Specify a more elaborated initial pattern:

                   cellauto=p=&apos;@@ @ @@&apos;:s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

   mandelbrot
       Generate a Mandelbrot set fractal, and progressively zoom towards the
       point specified with start_x and start_y.

       This source accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by &quot;:&quot;. A description of the accepted options follows.

       end_pts
           Set the terminal pts value. Default value is 400.

       end_scale
           Set the terminal scale value.  Must be a floating point value.
           Default value is 0.3.

       inner
           Set the inner coloring mode, that is the algorithm used to draw the
           Mandelbrot fractal internal region.

           It shall assume one of the following values:

           -100 and 100. Default value is -0.131825904205311970493132056385139.

   mptestsrc
       Generate various test patterns, as generated by the MPlayer test filter.

       The size of the generated video is fixed, and is 256x256.  This source is
       useful in particular for testing encoding features.

       This source accepts an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by
       &quot;:&quot;. The description of the accepted options follows.

       rate, r
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
           generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
           frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or a
           valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is &quot;25&quot;.

       duration, d
           Set the video duration of the sourced video. The accepted syntax is:

                   [-]HH:MM:SS[.m...]
                   [-]S+[.m...]

           See also the function &quot;av_parse_time()&quot;.

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is
           supposed to be generated forever.

       test, t
           Set the number or the name of the test to perform. Supported tests
           are:

           dc_luma
           dc_chroma
           freq_luma
           freq_chroma
           amp_luma
           amp_chroma
           cbp
           mv
           ring1
           ring2
           all

           Default value is &quot;all&quot;, which will cycle through the list of all
           tests.

       For example the following:

               testsrc=t=dc_luma

       will generate a &quot;dc_luma&quot; test pattern.

   frei0r_src
       Provide a frei0r source.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
       header and configure FFmpeg with &quot;--enable-frei0r&quot;.

       The source supports the syntax:

               &lt;size&gt;:&lt;rate&gt;:&lt;src_name&gt;[{=|:}&lt;param1&gt;:&lt;param2&gt;:...:&lt;paramN&gt;]

       size is the size of the video to generate, may be a string of the form
       widthxheight or a frame size abbreviation.  rate is the rate of the video
       to generate, may be a string of the form num/den or a frame rate
       abbreviation.  src_name is the name to the frei0r source to load. For
       more information regarding frei0r and how to set the parameters read the
       section frei0r in the description of the video filters.

       For example, to generate a frei0r partik0l source with size 200x200 and
       frame rate 10 which is overlayed on the overlay filter main input:

               frei0r_src=200x200:10:partik0l=1234 [overlay]; [in][overlay] overlay

   life
       Generate a life pattern.

       This source is based on a generalization of John Conway&apos;s life game.

       The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
       which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
       interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
       horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

       At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule, which
       specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a cell stay
       alive or born. The rule option allows to specify the rule to adopt.

       This source accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by &quot;:&quot;. A description of the accepted options follows.

       filename, f
           Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
           each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and
           newline is used to delimit the end of each row.

           If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
           randomly.

       rate, r
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per
           second.  Default is 25.

       random_fill_ratio, ratio
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
           floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
           It is ignored when a file is specified.

       random_seed, seed
           Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
           included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
           set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
           effort basis.

       rule
           Set the life rule.

           A rule can be specified with a code of the kind &quot;SNS/BNB&quot;, where NS
           and NB are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8, NS specifies the
           number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell stay alive, and
           NB the number of alive neighbor cells which make a dead cell to
           become alive (i.e. to &quot;born&quot;).  &quot;s&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be used in place of
           &quot;S&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively.

           Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
           high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
           for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
           the rule for &quot;borning&quot; new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
           higher number of neighbor cells.  For example the number 6153 =
           &quot;(12&lt;&lt;9)+9&quot; specifies a stay alive rule of 12 and a born rule of 9,
           which corresponds to &quot;S23/B03&quot;.

           Default value is &quot;S23/B3&quot;, which is the original Conway&apos;s game of
           life rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
           cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
           a dead cell.

       size, s
           Set the size of the output video.

           If filename is specified, the size is set by default to the same size
           of the input file. If size is set, it must contain the size specified
           in the input file, and the initial grid defined in that file is
           centered in the larger resulting area.

           If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to &quot;320x240&quot;
           (used for a randomly generated initial grid).

       stitch
           If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
           top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.

       mold
           Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from death_color to
           mold_color with a step of mold. mold can have a value from 0 to 255.

       life_color
           Set the color of living (or new born) cells.

       death_color
           Set the color of dead cells. If mold is set, this is the first color
           used to represent a dead cell.

       mold_color
           Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

       Examples

       &#183;   Read a grid from pattern, and center it on a grid of size 300x300
           pixels:

                   life=f=pattern:s=300x300

       &#183;   Generate a random grid of size 200x200, with a fill ratio of 2/3:

                   life=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       &#183;   Specify a custom rule for evolving a randomly generated grid:

                   life=rule=S14/B34

       &#183;   Full example with slow death effect (mold) using ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi life=s=300x200:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=1200:800:flags=16

   color, nullsrc, rgbtestsrc, smptebars, testsrc
       The &quot;color&quot; source provides an uniformly colored input.

       The &quot;nullsrc&quot; source returns unprocessed video frames. It is mainly
       useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the source for
       filters which ignore the input data.

       The &quot;rgbtestsrc&quot; source generates an RGB test pattern useful for
       detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue stripe
       from top to bottom.

       The &quot;smptebars&quot; source generates a color bars pattern, based on the SMPTE
       Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

       The &quot;testsrc&quot; source generates a test video pattern, showing a color
       pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly intended
       for testing purposes.

       These sources accept an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated
       by &quot;:&quot;. The description of the accepted options follows.

       color, c
           Specify the color of the source, only used in the &quot;color&quot; source. It
           can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a 0xRRGGBB[AA]
           sequence, possibly followed by an alpha specifier. The default value
           is &quot;black&quot;.

       size, s
           Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the form
           widthxheight, or the name of a size abbreviation. The default value
           is &quot;320x240&quot;.

       rate, r
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
           generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
           frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or a
           valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is &quot;25&quot;.

       sar Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

       duration, d
           Set the video duration of the sourced video. The accepted syntax is:

                   [-]HH[:MM[:SS[.m...]]]
                   [-]S+[.m...]

           See also the function &quot;av_parse_time()&quot;.

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is
           supposed to be generated forever.

       decimals, n
           Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only used in the
           &quot;testsrc&quot; source.

           The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original
           timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of the specified value.
           Default value is 0.

       For example the following:

               testsrc=duration=5.3:size=qcif:rate=10

       will generate a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size 176x144
       and a frame rate of 10 frames per second.

       The following graph description will generate a red source with an
       opacity of 0.2, with size &quot;qcif&quot; and a frame rate of 10 frames per
       second.

               color=c=red@0.2:s=qcif:r=10

       If the input content is to be ignored, &quot;nullsrc&quot; can be used. The
       following command generates noise in the luminance plane by employing the
       &quot;mp=geq&quot; filter:

               nullsrc=s=256x256, mp=geq=random(1)*255:128:128

VIDEO SINKS
       Below is a description of the currently available video sinks.

   buffersink
       Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of the filter
       graph.

       This sink is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       It does not require a string parameter in input, but you need to specify
       a pointer to a list of supported pixel formats terminated by -1 in the
       opaque parameter provided to &quot;avfilter_init_filter&quot; when initializing
       this sink.

   nullsink
       Null video sink, do absolutely nothing with the input video. It is mainly
       useful as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging tools.

MULTIMEDIA FILTERS
       Below is a description of the currently available multimedia filters.

   asendcmd, sendcmd
       Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

       These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
       filtergraph.

       &quot;asendcmd&quot; must be inserted between two audio filters, &quot;sendcmd&quot; must be
       inserted between two video filters, but apart from that they act the same
       way.

       The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
       with the commands option, or in a file specified by the filename option.

       These filters accept the following options:

       commands, c
           Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

       filename, f
           Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other
           filters.

       Commands syntax

       A commands description consists of a sequence of interval specifications,
       comprising a list of commands to be executed when a particular event
       related to that interval occurs. The occurring event is typically the
       current frame time entering or leaving a given time interval.

       An interval is specified by the following syntax:

               &lt;START&gt;[-&lt;END&gt;] &lt;COMMANDS&gt;;

       The time interval is specified by the START and END times.  END is
       optional and defaults to the maximum time.

       The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if it
       is included in the interval [START, END), that is when the time is
       greater or equal to START and is lesser than END.

       COMMANDS consists of a sequence of one or more command specifications,
       separated by &quot;,&quot;, relating to that interval.  The syntax of a command
       specification is given by:

               [&lt;FLAGS&gt;] &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; &lt;ARG&gt;

       FLAGS is optional and specifies the type of events relating to the time
       interval which enable sending the specified command, and must be a non-
       null sequence of identifier flags separated by &quot;+&quot; or &quot;|&quot; and enclosed
       between &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;.

       The following flags are recognized:

       enter
           The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
           specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
           previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
           current is.

       leave
           The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
           specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
           previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the current
           is not.

       If FLAGS is not specified, a default value of &quot;[enter]&quot; is assumed.

       TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the
       filter class or a specific filter instance name.

       COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

       ARG is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for the given
       COMMAND.

       Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or sequences
       of characters starting with &quot;#&quot; until the end of line, are ignored and
       can be used to annotate comments.

       A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
       follows:

               &lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt;  ::= &quot;enter&quot; | &quot;leave&quot;
               &lt;COMMAND_FLAGS&gt; ::= &lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt; [(+|&quot;|&quot;)&lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt;]
               &lt;COMMAND&gt;       ::= [&quot;[&quot; &lt;COMMAND_FLAGS&gt; &quot;]&quot;] &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; [&lt;ARG&gt;]
               &lt;COMMANDS&gt;      ::= &lt;COMMAND&gt; [,&lt;COMMANDS&gt;]
               &lt;INTERVAL&gt;      ::= &lt;START&gt;[-&lt;END&gt;] &lt;COMMANDS&gt;
               &lt;INTERVALS&gt;     ::= &lt;INTERVAL&gt;[;&lt;INTERVALS&gt;]

       Examples

       &#183;   Specify audio tempo change at second 4:

                   asendcmd=c=&apos;4.0 atempo tempo 1.5&apos;,atempo

       &#183;   Specify a list of drawtext and hue commands in a file.

                   # show text in the interval 5-10
                   5.0-10.0 [enter] drawtext reinit &apos;fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=hello world&apos;,
                            [leave] drawtext reinit &apos;fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=&apos;;

                   # desaturate the image in the interval 15-20
                   15.0-20.0 [enter] hue reinit s=0,
                             [enter] drawtext reinit &apos;fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=nocolor&apos;,
                             [leave] hue reinit s=1,
                             [leave] drawtext reinit &apos;fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=color&apos;;

                   # apply an exponential saturation fade-out effect, starting from time 25
                   25 [enter] hue s=exp(t-25)

           A filtergraph allowing to read and process the above command list
           stored in a file test.cmd, can be specified with:

                   sendcmd=f=test.cmd,drawtext=fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=&apos;&apos;,hue

   asetpts, setpts
       Change the PTS (presentation timestamp) of the input frames.

       &quot;asetpts&quot; works on audio frames, &quot;setpts&quot; on video frames.

       Accept in input an expression evaluated through the eval API, which can
       contain the following constants:

       FRAME_RATE
           frame rate, only defined for constant frame-rate video

       PTS the presentation timestamp in input

       N   the count of the input frame, starting from 0.

       NB_CONSUMED_SAMPLES
           the number of consumed samples, not including the current frame (only
           audio)

       NB_SAMPLES
           the number of samples in the current frame (only audio)

       SAMPLE_RATE
           audio sample rate

       STARTPTS
           the PTS of the first frame
&#12;       STARTT
           the time in seconds of the first frame

       INTERLACED
           tell if the current frame is interlaced

       T   the time in seconds of the current frame

       TB  the time base

       POS original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined
           for the current frame

       PREV_INPTS
           previous input PTS

       PREV_INT
           previous input time in seconds

       PREV_OUTPTS
           previous output PTS

       PREV_OUTT
           previous output time in seconds

       Examples

       &#183;   Start counting PTS from zero

                   setpts=PTS-STARTPTS

       &#183;   Apply fast motion effect:

                   setpts=0.5*PTS

       &#183;   Apply slow motion effect:

                   setpts=2.0*PTS

       &#183;   Set fixed rate of 25 frames per second:

                   setpts=N/(25*TB)

       &#183;   Set fixed rate 25 fps with some jitter:

                   setpts=&apos;1/(25*TB) * (N + 0.05 * sin(N*2*PI/25))&apos;

       &#183;   Apply an offset of 10 seconds to the input PTS:

                   setpts=PTS+10/TB

   settb, asettb
       Set the timebase to use for the output frames timestamps.  It is mainly
       useful for testing timebase configuration.

       It accepts in input an arithmetic expression representing a rational.
       The expression can contain the constants &quot;AVTB&quot; (the default timebase),
       &quot;intb&quot; (the input timebase) and &quot;sr&quot; (the sample rate, audio only).

       The default value for the input is &quot;intb&quot;.

       Examples

       &#183;   Set the timebase to 1/25:

                   settb=1/25

       &#183;   Set the timebase to 1/10:

                   settb=0.1

       &#183;   Set the timebase to 1001/1000:

                   settb=1+0.001

       &#183;   Set the timebase to 2*intb:

                   settb=2*intb

       &#183;   Set the default timebase value:

                   settb=AVTB

   concat
       Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
       other.

       The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
       segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
       also be the number of streams at output.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       n   Set the number of segments. Default is 2.

       v   Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of
           video streams in each segment. Default is 1.

       a   Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of
           video streams in each segment. Default is 0.

       The filter has v+a outputs: first v video outputs, then a audio outputs.

       There are nx(v+a) inputs: first the inputs for the first segment, in the
       same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second segment, etc.

       Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
       reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
       related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
       concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the
       longest stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary
       pad shorter audio streams with silence.

       For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp
       0.

       All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments;
       the filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for
       video streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout
       for audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be
       converted explicitly by the user.

       Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame
       rate at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

       Examples:

       &#183;   Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual
           version (video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):

                   ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
                     &apos;[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
                      concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]&apos; \
                     -map &apos;[v]&apos; -map &apos;[a1]&apos; -map &apos;[a2]&apos; output.mkv
&#12;       &#183;   Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the
           (a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:

                   movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
                   movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
                   [v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

           Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video
           streams do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

   showspectrum
       Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio frequency
       spectrum.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       size, s
           Specify the video size for the output. Default value is &quot;640x480&quot;.

       The usage is very similar to the showwaves filter; see the examples in
       that section.

   showwaves
       Convert input audio to a video output, representing the samples waves.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       n   Set the number of samples which are printed on the same column. A
           larger value will decrease the frame rate. Must be a positive
           integer. This option can be set only if the value for rate is not
           explicitly specified.

       rate, r
           Set the (approximate) output frame rate. This is done by setting the
           option n. Default value is &quot;25&quot;.

       size, s
           Specify the video size for the output. Default value is &quot;600x240&quot;.

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   Output the input file audio and the corresponding video
           representation at the same time:

                   amovie=a.mp3,asplit[out0],showwaves[out1]

       &#183;   Create a synthetic signal and show it with showwaves, forcing a
           framerate of 30 frames per second:

                   aevalsrc=sin(1*2*PI*t)*sin(880*2*PI*t):cos(2*PI*200*t),asplit[out0],showwaves=r=30[out1]

MULTIMEDIA SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.

   amovie
       This is the same as src_movie source, except it selects an audio stream
       by default.

   movie
       Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

       It accepts the syntax: movie_name[:options] where movie_name is the name
       of the resource to read (not necessarily a file but also a device or a
       stream accessed through some protocol), and options is an optional
       sequence of key=value pairs, separated by &quot;:&quot;.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       format_name, f
           Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
           the name of a container or an input device. If not specified the
           format is guessed from movie_name or by probing.

       seek_point, sp
           Specifies the seek point in seconds, the frames will be output
           starting from this seek point, the parameter is evaluated with
           &quot;av_strtod&quot; so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS postfix.
           Default value is &quot;0&quot;.

       streams, s
           Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
           separated by &quot;+&quot;. The source will then have as many outputs, in the
           same order. The syntax is explained in the Stream specifiers chapter.
           Two special names, &quot;dv&quot; and &quot;da&quot; specify respectively the default
           (best suited) video and audio stream. Default is &quot;dv&quot;, or &quot;da&quot; if the
           filter is called as &quot;amovie&quot;.

       stream_index, si
           Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1,
           the best suited video stream will be automatically selected. Default
           value is &quot;-1&quot;. Deprecated. If the filter is called &quot;amovie&quot;, it will
           select audio instead of video.

       loop
           Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.  If the
           value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
           Default value is &quot;1&quot;.

           Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
           changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.

       This filter allows to overlay a second video on top of main input of a
       filtergraph as shown in this graph:

               input -----------&gt; deltapts0 --&gt; overlay --&gt; output
                                                   ^
                                                   |
               movie --&gt; scale--&gt; deltapts1 -------+

       Some examples follow.

       &#183;   Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the avi file in.avi, and overlay
           it on top of the input labelled as &quot;in&quot;:

                   movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [movie];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, [movie] overlay=16:16 [out]

       &#183;   Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input
           labelled as &quot;in&quot;:

                   movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [movie];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, [movie] overlay=16:16 [out]

       &#183;   Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from
           dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named &quot;video&quot; and the
           audio is connected to the pad named &quot;audio&quot;:

                   movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]
