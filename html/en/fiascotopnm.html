NAME
       fiascotopnm - Convert compressed FIASCO image to PGM, or PPM


SYNOPSIS
       fiascotopnm [option]...  [filename]...


DESCRIPTION
       fiascotopnm decompresses the named FIASCO files, or the Standard Input if
       no file is named, and writes the images as PGM, or PPM  files,  depending
       on whether the FIASCO image is black and white or color.


OPTIONS
       All option names may be abbreviated; for example, --output may be written
       --outp or --ou. For all options an one letter short option  is  provided.
       Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are mandatory or optional
       for short options, too. Both short and long options are case sensitive.


       -o[name], --output=[name]
              Write decompressed image to the file name.ppm (if PPM) or name.pgm
              (if  PGM).   If name=- then produce the image file on the standard
              output. The optional argument name can be omitted, then the  input
              filename is used as basename with the suffix .ppm or .pgm. In case
              of video streams, the frames are stored in  the  files  name.N.ppm
              where N is the frame number (of the form 00..0 - 99..9); output on
              the standard output is not possible with video streams.

              If name is a relative path and the environment variable FIASCO_IM&#8208;
              AGES  is  a (colon-separated) list of directories, then the output
              file(s) are written to the  first  (writable)  directory  of  this
              list. Otherwise, the current directory is used to store the output
              file(s).


       -z, --fast
              Decompress images in the 4:2:0 format; i.e., each  chroma  channel
              is  decompressed  to an image of halved width and height. Use this
              option on slow  machines  when  the  desired  frame  rate  is  not
              achieved; the output quality is only slightly decreased.


       -d, --double
              Double  the  size  of  the X11 window both in width and height; no
              pixel interpolation is used, each pixel is just replaced  by  four
              identical pixels.


       -p, --panel
              Show  a  panel  with play, stop, pause, record and exit buttons to
              control the display of videos. When pressing  the  record  button,
              all  frames  are decompressed and stored in memory. The other but&#8208;
              tons work in the usual way.


       -m N, --magnify=N
              Set magnification of the decompressed image. Positive  values  en&#8208;
              large  and  negative values reduce the image width and height by a
              factor of 2^|N|.
&#12;
       -s N, --smooth=N
              Smooth decompressed image(s) along the partitioning borders by the
              given  amount N. N is 1 (minimum) to 100 (maximum); default is 70.
              When N=0, then the smoothing amount specified in the  FIASCO  file
              is used (defined by the FIASCO coder).


       -F N, --fps=N
              Set  number of frames per second to N. When using this option, the
              frame rate specified in the FIASCO file is overridden.


       -v, --version
              Print fiascotopnm version number, then exit.


       -f name, --config=name
              Load parameter file name to initialize the options of fiascotopnm.
              See  file system.fiascorc for an example of the syntax. Options of
              fiascotopnm are set by any of the following methods (in the speci&#8208;
              fied order):

              1) Global ressource file /etc/system.fiascorc

              2) $HOME/.fiascorc

              3) command line

              4) --config=name


       -h, --info
              Print brief help, then exit.


       -H, --help
              Print detailed help, then exit.



EXAMPLES
       fiascotopnm foo.wfa &gt;foo.ppm
              Decompress the FIASCO file &quot;foo.wfa&quot; and store it as &quot;foo.ppm&quot;.


       fiascotopnm -o foo1.wfa foo2.wfa
              Decompress  the  FIASCO  files &quot;foo1.wfa&quot; and &quot;foo2.wfa&quot; and write
              the frames to the image files &quot;foo1.wfa.ppm&quot; and &quot;foo2.wfa.ppm&quot;.


       fiascotopnm -oimage foo1.wfa
              Decompress the FIASCO file &quot;foo1.wfa&quot; and write all 15  frames  to
              the image files &quot;image.00.ppm&quot;, ... , &quot;image.14.ppm&quot;.


       fiascotopnm --fast --magnify=-1 --double video.wfa &gt;stream.ppm
              Decompress  the  FIASCO file &quot;video.wfa&quot;.  The decompression speed
              is as fast as possible: the image is decompressed (in  4:2:0  for&#8208;
              mat) at a quarter of its original size; then the image is enlarged
              again by pixel doubling.



FILES
       /etc/system.fiascorc
              The systemwide initialization file.
       $HOME/.fiascorc
              The personal initialization file.
&#12;
ENVIRONMENT
       FIASCO_IMAGES
              Save path for image files. Default is &quot;./&quot;.
       FIASCO_DATA
              Search path for FIASCO files. Default is &quot;./&quot;.
