FIG2DEV(1)                                                            FIG2DEV(1)



NAME
       fig2dev - translates Fig code to various graphics languages


SYNOPSIS
       fig2dev -L language [ -m mag ] [ -f font ] [ -s fsize ] [ other options ]
       [ fig-file [ out-file ] ]


DESCRIPTION
       Fig2dev translates fig code in the  named  fig-file  into  the  specified
       graphics  language  and  puts them in out-file.  The default fig-file and
       out-file are standard input and standard output, respectively

       Xfig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures)  is  a  screen-ori&#8208;
       ented  tool  which runs under the X Window System, and allows the user to
       draw and manipulate objects interactively.  This version  of  fig2dev  is
       compatible with xfig versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2.

       Xfig  version  3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments
       for each Fig object.  These comments are output with several of the  out&#8208;
       put languages, such as PostScript, CGM, EMF, LaTeX, MetaFont, PicTeX, (as
       % comments), tk (as # comments), and pic (as .\&quot; comments).


GENERAL OPTIONS (all drivers)
       -L language
              Set the output graphics language.  Valid languages are  box,  cgm,
              epic,  eepic,  eepicemu,  emf, eps, gbx (Gerber beta driver), gif,
              ibmgl, jpeg, latex, map (HTML image map), mf (MetaFont), mp (Meta&#8208;
              Post), mmp (Multi-MetaPost), pcx, pdf, pdftex, pdftex_t, pdftex_p,
              pic, pictex, png, ppm, ps, pstex, pstex_t, pstex_p, pstricks,  ptk
              (Perl/tk),  shape  (LaTeX  shaped  paragraphs), sld (AutoCad slide
              format), svg (beta driver), textyl, tiff, tk (tcl/tk),  tpic,  xbm
              and xpm.

              Notes:
              dvips
               and  xdvi  must  be  compiled  with the tpic support (-DTPIC) for
              epic, eepic and tpic to work.
              You must have ghostscript and ps2pdf, which comes with the  ghost&#8208;
              script  distribution  to get the pdf output and the bitmap formats
              (png, jpeg, etc.), and the netpbm (pbmplus) package  to  get  gif,
              xbm, xpm, and sld output.


       -h     Print  help message with all options for all output languages then
              exit.


       -V     Print the program version number and exit.


       -D +/-rangelist
              With +rangelist, keep only those depths in the list.  With -range&#8208;
              list,  keep all depths except those in the list. The rangelist may
              be a list of comma-separated numbers or ranges separated by  colon
              (:).  For  example,  -D +10,40,55:70,80 means keep only layers 10,
              40, 55 through 70, and 80.


       -K     The selection of the depths with the &apos;-D +/-rangelist&apos; option does
              normally  not affect the calcualtion of the bounding box. Thus the
              generated document might have a much larger bounding box than nec&#8208;
              essary.  If  -K  is  given  then  the  bounding box is adjusted to
              include only those objects in the selected depths.


       -f font
              Set the default font used for text objects to font.   The  default
              is  Roman;  the format of this option depends on the graphics lan&#8208;
              guage in use.  In TeX-based languages, the font is the base of the
              name  given  in  lfonts.tex, for instance &quot;cmr&quot; for Roman, or &quot;tt&quot;
              for teletype.  In PostScript, it is any font  name  known  to  the
              printer or interpreter. For Gerber it has no effect.


       -G minor[:major][:unit]
              Draws  a  grid  on the page.  Specify thin, or thin and thick line
              spacing in one of several units.  For example, &quot;-G .25:1cm&quot;  draws
              a thin, gray line every .25 cm and a thicker gray line every 1 cm.
              Specifying &quot;-G 1in&quot; draws a thin line every 1 inch.  Fractions may
              be  used,  e.g.  &quot;-G  1/16:1/2in&quot; will draw a thin line every 1/16
              inch (0.0625 inch) and a thick line every 1/2 inch.
              Allowable units are: i, in, inch, f, ft, feet, c, cm, mm, and m.
              Only allowed for PostScript, EPS, PDF, and bitmap (GIF, JPEG, etc)
              drivers for now.


       -j     Enable the I18N internationalization facility.


       -m mag Set the magnification at which the figure is rendered to mag.  The
              default is 1.0.  This may not be used with the maxdimension option
              (-Z).


       -s size
              Set  the  default font size (in points) for text objects to fsize.
              The default is 11*mag, and thus is scaled by the  -m  option.   If
              there is no scaling, the default font is eleven point Roman.&quot;


       -Z maxdimension
              Scale  the  figure so that the maximum dimension (width or height)
              is maxdimension inches or cm, depending on whether the figure  was
              saved  with  imperial  or metric units.  This may not be used with
              the magnification option (-m).


       other options
              The other options are specific to the choice of graphics language,
              as described below.


CGM OPTIONS
       CGM  is  Computer  Graphics  Metafile, developed by ISO and ANSI and is a
       vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and proba&#8208;
       bly  other  products can import this format and display it on the screen,
       something that they won&apos;t do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.

       -b dummyarg
              Generate binary output (dummy argument required after the &quot;-b&quot;).


       -r     Position arrowheads for CGM viewers that  display  rounded  arrow&#8208;
              heads.   Normally,  arrowheads are pointed, so fig2dev compensates
              for this by moving the endpoint of the line back so the tip of the
              arrowhead  ends  where  the original endpoint of the line was.  If
              the -r option is used, the position of arrows  will  NOT  be  cor&#8208;
              rected  for  compensating  line width effects, because the rounded
              arrowhead doesn&apos;t extend beyond the endpoint of the line.


EMF OPTIONS
       EMF is Enhanced Metafile, developed by Microsoft and  is  a  vector-based
       plus  bitmap  language.   Microsoft  WORD,  PowerPoint and probably other
       products can import this format and display it on the  screen,  something
       that they won&apos;t do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.


EPIC OPTIONS
       EPIC  is  an  enhancement  to  LaTeX picture drawing environment.  It was
       developed by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer Science in S.U.N.Y  at
       Stony Brook.

       EEPIC is an extension to EPIC and LaTeX picture drawing environment which
       uses tpic specials as a graphics mechanism.  It  was  written  by  Conrad
       Kwok of Division of Computer Science at University of California, Davis.

       EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does not use tpic specials.


       -A factor
              Scale arrowheads by factor.  The width and height of arrowheads is
              divided by this factor.  This is because EPIC arrowheads are  nor&#8208;
              mally about double the size of TeX arrowheads.


       -E num Set  encoding  for text translation (0 = none, 1 = ISO-8859-1, 2 =
              ISO-8859-2)


       -F     Don&apos;t set the font face, series, and style; only set it&apos;s size and
              the  baselineskip.  By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters
              when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can&apos;t set the
              font  from  your  LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set
              the font from your LaTeX  document  (like  &quot;\sfshape  \input  pic&#8208;
              ture.eepic&quot;).

              If  any  of  the pictures included in your LaTeX document has been
              generated with -F, then all pictures must be generated  with  this
              option.

              This  option  can be used only when fig2dev was compiled with NFSS
              defined.


       -l width
              Use &quot;\thicklines&quot; when width of the line  is  wider  than  lwidth.
              The default is 2.


       -P     Generate  a  complete  LaTeX file. In other words, the output file
              can be formatted without requiring  any  changes.  The  additional
              text  inserted in the beginning and at the end of the file is con&#8208;
              trolled by the configuration parameter &quot;Preamble&quot; and &quot;Postamble&quot;.


       -R     Allow rotated text. Rotated text will be set using the  \rotatebox
              command.   So, you will need to include &quot;\usepackage{graphics}&quot; in
              the preamble of your LaTeX document.

              If this option is not set, then rotated text will be set  horizon&#8208;
              tally.
&#12;
       -S scale
              Set  the scale to which the figure is rendered.  This option auto&#8208;
              matically sets the magnification and size to scale / 12 and  scale
              respectively.


       -t stretch
              Set  the stretch factor of dashed lines to sretch.  The default is
              30.


       -v     Include comments in the output file.


       -W     Enable variable line width.  By default, only two line widths  are
              available:  The  normal  line  width  (hinlines),  and thick lines
              (hicklines), if a line width of more than one is selected in xfig.


       -w     Disable variable line width.  Only  &quot;\thicklines&quot;  and/or  &quot;\thin&#8208;
              lines&quot; commands will be generated in the output file.

              When  variable  line width option is enabled, &quot;\thinlines&quot; command
              is still used when line width is less than LineThick.  One  poten&#8208;
              tial  problem  is  that the width of &quot;\thinlines&quot; is 0.4pt but the
              resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx. 1pt). If LineThick is  set
              to  2, normal lines will be drawn in 0.4pt wide lines but the next
              line width is  already  2pt.  One  possible  solution  is  to  set
              LineThick to 1 and set the width of the those lines you want to be
              drawn in &quot;\thinlines&quot;  to 0.

              Due to this problem, Variable line width VarWidth is defaulted  to
              be false.



IBM-GL (HP/GL) OPTIONS
       IBM-GL  (IBM Graphics Language) is compatible with HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard
       Graphics Language).


       -a     Select ISO A4 (ANSI A) paper size if the default is  ANSI  A  (ISO
              A4) paper size.


       -c     Generate instructions for an IBM 6180 Color Plotter with (without)
              an IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge (IBM-GEC).


       -d xll,yll,xur,yur
              Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the plotter paper which
              has  a  lower left hand corner at (xll,yll) and a upper right hand
              corner at (xur,yur).  All four numbers are in inches and follow -d
              in  a  comma-sparated  list  -  xll,yll,xur,yur  -  with no spaces
              between them.


       -f file
              Load text character specifications from the  table  in  the  fonts
              file.   The  table must have 36 entries - one for each font plus a
              default.  Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify  the  1.)
              standard  character  set  (0  -  4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39), 2.) alternate
              character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39), 3.) character  slant  angle
              (degrees),  4.)  character  width  scale  factor and 5.) character
              height scale factor.
&#12;
       -k     Precede output with PCL command to use HP/GL


       -l pattfile
              Load area fill line patterns from the table in the pattfile  file.
              The  table  must  have  21 entries - one for each of the area fill
              patterns.  Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the  1.)
              pattern  number  (-1  -  6), 2.) pattern length (inches), 3.) fill
              type (1 - 5),  4.)  fill  spacing  (inches)  and  5.)  fill  angle
              (degrees).


       -m mag,x0,y0
              The magnification may appear as the first element in a comma sepa&#8208;
              rated list - mag,x0,y0 - where the  second  and  third  parameters
              specify an offset in inches.


       -P     Rotate the figure to portrait mode. The default is landscape mode.


       -p penfile
              Load  plotter  pen  specifications  from  the table in the penfile
              file.  The table must have 9 entries - one for each color  plus  a
              default.   Each  entry consists of 2 numbers which specify the 1.)
              pen number (1 - 8) and 2.) pen thickness (millimeters).


       -S speed
              Set the pen speed to speed (centimeters/second).


       -v     Plot the figure upside-down in portrait mode or backwards in land&#8208;
              scape  mode.  This allows you to write on the top surface of over&#8208;
              head transparencies without disturbing the plotter ink on the bot&#8208;
              tom surface.

       Fig2dev may be installed with either ANSI A or ISO A4 default paper size.
       The -a option selects the alternate paper size.  Fig2dev  does  not  fill
       closed splines.  The IBM-GEC is required to fill other polygons.  Fig2dev
       may be installed for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC.  The -c option
       selects the alternate instruction set.


OPTIONS COMMON TO ALL BITMAP FORMATS
       -b borderwidth
              Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth.


       -F     Use  correct  font sizes (points, 1/72 inch) instead of the tradi&#8208;
              tional size that xfig/fig2dev uses, which  is  (1/80  inch).   The
              corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.


       -g color
              Use color for the background.


       -N     Convert all colors to grayscale.


       -S smoothfactor
              This will smooth the output by passing smoothfactor to ghostscript
              in the -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicsAlphaBits options to  improve
              font rendering and graphic smoothing.  A value of 2 for smoothfac&#8208;
              tor provides some smoothing and 4 provides more.


GIF OPTIONS
       -t color
              Use color for the transparent color in the GIF file.  This must be
              specified in the same format that ppmmake(1) allows.  It may allow
              an X11 color name, but at least you may use a six-digit  hexadeci&#8208;
              mal RGBvalue using the # sign, e.g. #ff0000 (Red).


JPEG OPTIONS
       -q image_quality
              use the integer value image_quality for the JPEG &quot;Quality&quot; factor.
              Valid values are 0-100, with the default being 75.



LATEX OPTIONS
       -d dmag
              Set a separate magnification for the  length  of  line  dashes  to
              dmag.


       -E num Set  encoding  for  latex  text  translation  (0 no translation, 1
              ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)


       -l lwidth
              Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick  lines  to  lwidth
              pixels.   LaTeX supports only two different line width: \thinlines
              and \thicklines.  Lines of width greater than  lwidth  pixels  are
              drawn  as  \thicklines.   Also  affects the size of dots in dotted
              line style.  The default is 1.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the graphics objects which  can  be
       described  by Fig.  For example, the possible slopes which lines may have
       are limited.  Some objects, such as spline curves,  cannot  be  drawn  at
       all.  Fig2latex chooses the closest possible line slope, and prints error
       messages when objects cannot be drawn accurately


MAP (HTML image map) OPTIONS
       Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to  edit  comments
       for  each  Fig  object.   The fig2dev map output language will produce an
       HTML image map using Fig objects that have href=&quot;some_html_reference&quot;  in
       their  comments.   Any  Fig  object  except compound objects may used for
       this.  Usually, besides generating the map file, you would also  generate
       a PNG file, which is the image to which the map refers.

       For example, you may have an xfig drawing with an imported image that has
       the  comment  href=&quot;go_here.html&quot;  and  a  box  object  with  a   comment
       href=&quot;go_away.html&quot;.   This  will produce an image map file such the user
       may click on the image and the browser will load the &quot;go_here.html&quot; page,
       or click on the box and the browser will load the &quot;go_away.html&quot; page.

       After  the  map  file is generated by fig2dev you will need to edit it to
       fill out any additional information it may need.

       -b borderwidth
              Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth.



METAFONT OPTIONS
       fig2dev scales the figure by 1/8 before generating  METAFONT  code.   The
       magnification can be further changed with the -m option or by giving mag&#8208;
       nification options to mf.

       In order to process the generated METAFONT code, the mfpic macros must be
       installed where mf can find them. The mfpic macro package is available at
       any CTAN cite under the subdirectory: graphics/mfpic


       -C code
              specifies the starting METAFONT font code. The default is 32.

       -n name
              specifies the name to use in the output file.

       -p pen_magnification
              specifies how much the line width should be magnified compared  to
              the original figure. The default is 1.

       -t top specifies  the  top of the whole coordinate system. The default is
              ypos.

       -x xmin
              specifies the minimum x coordinate value of the  figure  (inches).
              The default is 0.

       -y ymin
              specifies  the  minumum y coordinate value of the figure (inches).
              The default is 0.

       -X xmax
              specifies the maximum x coordinate value of the  figure  (inches).
              The default is 8.

       -Y ymax
              specifies  the  maximum y coordinate value of the figure (inches).
              The default is 8.


METAPOST OPTIONS
       -i file
              Include file content via \input-command.


       -I file
              Include file content as additional header.


       -o     Old mode (no latex).


       -p number
              Adds the line &quot;prologues:=number&quot; to the output.



PIC OPTIONS
       -p ext Enables the use of certain PIC extensions which are known to  work
              with  the  groff  package;  compatibility with DWB PIC is unknown.
              The extensions enabled by each option are:

           arc     Allow ARC_BOX i.e. use rounded corners
           line    Use the &apos;line_thickness&apos; value
           fill    Allow ellipses to be filled
           all     Use all of the above
           psfont  Don&apos;t convert Postscript fonts generic type
                   (useful for files going to be Ditroff&apos;ed for
                   and printed on PS printer). DWB-compatible.
           allps   Use all of the above (i.e. &quot;all&quot; + &quot;psfont&quot;)
&#12;
PICTEX OPTIONS
       In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document, it is  necessary  to
       load the PiCTeX macros.

       PiCTeX uses TeX integer register arithmetic to generate curves, and so it
       is very slow.  PiCTeX draws curves by \put-ing  the  psymbol  repeatedly,
       and  so  requires  a large amount of TeX&apos;s internal memory, and generates
       large DVI files.  The size of TeX&apos;s memory limits the number of plot sym&#8208;
       bols  in  a  picture.   As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX to generate
       small pictures.


       -E num Set encoding for latex  text  translation  (0  no  translation,  1
              ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)


GBX OPTIONS (Gerber, RS-247-X)
       Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1.  See -g for more infor&#8208;
       mation.

       -d [mm|in]
              Output dimensions should be assumed  to  be  millimeters  (mm)  or
              inches (in).  The default is millimeters.

       -p [pos|neg]
              Select the image polarity.  For positive images lines drawn in the
              fig file will generate lines of  material.   For  negative  images
              lines drawn in the fig file will result in removed material.  Con&#8208;
              sider etching a chrome on glass transmission mask.  Drawing  lines
              in  the  fig  file  and  choosing &apos;neg&apos; will result in these lines
              being etched through the chrome, leaving transparent lines.

       -g &lt;x scale&gt;x&lt;y scale&gt;+&lt;x offset&gt;+&lt;y offset&gt;
              This controls the geometry of the output, scaling  the  dimensions
              as  shown  and applying the given offset.  Typically you will wish
              to set the y scale to -1, mirroring about the  x  axis.   This  is
              because  Gerber  assumes  the origin to be bottom left, while xfig
              selects top left.

       -f &lt;n digits&gt;.&lt;n digits&gt;
              This controls the number of digits of precision before  and  after
              the  implied  decimal  point.   With  -f  5.3 the following number
              12345678 corresponds to 12345.678.  Whereas with -f 3.5 it  corre&#8208;
              sponds to 123.45678.  The default is for 3 places before the deci&#8208;
              mal point and 5 after.  This corresponds, to a range of 0 to 1m in
              10 micron increments.

       -i [on|off]
              Controls  the  output  of  comments describing the type of objects
              being output.  The text appears as comments starting  with  ##  on
              each line in the output file.  By default this is on.


POSTSCRIPT, ENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT (EPS), and PDF OPTIONS
       With PostScript, xfig can be used to create multiple page figures Specify
       the -M option to produce a multi-page output.  For  posters,  add  -O  to
       overlap  the  pages slightly to get around the problem of the unprintable
       area in most printers, then cut and paste the  pages  together.   Due  to
       memory  limitations  of  most  laser printers, the figure should not have
       large imported images (bitmaps). Great for text with very big letters.

       The EPS driver has the following differences from PostScript:
           o No showpage is generated because the output is meant to be imported
           into another program or document and not printed
           o The landscape/portrait options are ignored
           o The centering option is ignored
           o The multiple-page option is ignored
           o The paper size option is ignored
           o The x/y offset options are ignored

       The EPS driver has the following two special options:

       -B &apos;Wx [Wy X0 Y0]&apos;
              This  specifies  that the bounding box of the EPS file should have
              the width Wx and the height Wy.  Note that it  doesn&apos;t  scale  the
              figure  to this size, it merely sets the bounding box.  If a value
              less than or equal to 0 is specified for Wx or Wy, these  are  set
              to the width/height respectively of the figure. Origin is relative
              to screen (0,0) (upper-left).  Wx, Wy, X0 and Y0  are  interpreted
              in  centimeters  or  inches  depending on the measure given in the
              fig-file.  Remember to put either quotes (&quot;) or apostrophes (&apos;) to
              group the arguments to -B.

       -R &apos;Wx [Wy X0 Y0]&apos;
              Same  as  the  -B  option except that X0 and Y0 is relative to the
              lower left corner of the figure.  Remember to  put  either  quotes
              (&quot;) or apostrophes (&apos;) to group the arguments to -R.

       The PDF driver uses all the PostScript options.

       Text  can  now  include  various ISO-character codes above 0x7f, which is
       useful for language specific characters to be printed directly.  Not  all
       ISO-characters are implemented.

       Color  support:  Colored objects created by Fig can be printed on a color
       postscript printer. There are 32 standard colors: black,  yellow,  white,
       gold,  five  shades  of  blue, four shades of green, four shades of cyan,
       four shades of red, five shades of magenta, four  shades  of  brown,  and
       four shades of pink.  In addition there may be user-defined colors in the
       file.  See the xfig FORMAT3.2 file for the definition  of  these  colors.
       On  a  monochrome  printer, colored objects will be mapped into different
       grayscales by the printer.  Filled objects are printed  using  the  given
       area fill and color.  There are 21 &quot;shades&quot; going from black to full sat&#8208;
       uration of the fill color, and 21 more &quot;tints&quot; from full saturation  +  1
       to  white.   In  addition, there are 16 patterns such as bricks, diagonal
       lines, crosshatch, etc.

       -A     Add an ASCII (EPSI) preview.

       -b borderwidth
              Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth.
              Not available in EPS.


       -C dummy_arg
              Add a color *binary* TIFF preview for Microsoft products that need
              a  binary  preview.   See  also  -T (monochrome preview).  A dummy
              argument must be supplied for historical reasons.

       -c     option centers the figure on the page.  The centering may  not  be
              accurate  if  there are texts in the fig_file that extends too far
              to the right of other objects.

       -e     option puts the figure against the  edge  (not  centered)  of  the
              page.  Not available in EPS.


       -F     Use  correct  font  sizes (points) instead of the traditional size
              that xfig/fig2dev uses, which is  1/80  inch.   The  corresponding
              xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.


       -g color
              Use color for the background.
&#12;       -l dummy_arg
              Generate figure in landscape mode.  The dummy argument is ignored,
              but must appear on the command line for reasons of  compatibility.
              This  option  will  override  the orientation specification in the
              file (for file versions 3.0 and higher).
              Not available in EPS.

       -M     Generate multiple pages if figure exceeds paper size.
              Not available in EPS.

       -N     Convert all colors to grayscale.


       -n name
              Set the Title part of the PostScript output to name.  This is use&#8208;
              ful when the input to fig2dev comes from standard input.

       -O     When  used  with -M, overlaps the pages slightly to get around the
              problem of the unprintable area in most printers.
              Not available in EPS.

       -p dummy_arg
              Generate figure in portrait mode.  The dummy argument is  ignored,
              but  must appear on the command line for reasons of compatibility.
              This option will override the  orientation  specification  in  the
              file  (for file versions 3.0 and higher).  This is the default for
              Fig files of version 2.1 or lower.
              Not available in EPS.


       -T     Add a monochrome *binary* TIFF preview for Microsoft products that
              need a binary preview.  See also -C (color preview).


       -x offset
              shift  the  figure in the X direction by offset units (1/72
              inch).  A negative value shifts the figure to the left  and
              a positive value to the right.
              Not available in EPS.

       -y offset
              shift  the  figure in the Y direction by offset units (1/72
              inch).  A negative value shifts the figure up and  a  posi&#8208;
              tive value down.
              Not available in EPS.

       -z papersize
              Sets the papersize.  Not available in EPS.
              Available paper sizes are:
                  &quot;Letter&quot; (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; also &quot;A&quot;),
                  &quot;Legal&quot; (11&quot; x 14&quot;)
                  &quot;Ledger&quot; (11&quot; x 17&quot;),
                  &quot;Tabloid&quot; (17&quot; x 11&quot;, really Ledger in Landscape mode),
                  &quot;A&quot; (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; also &quot;Letter&quot;),
                  &quot;B&quot; (11&quot; x 17&quot; also &quot;Ledger&quot;),
                  &quot;C&quot; (17&quot; x 22&quot;),
                  &quot;D&quot; (22&quot; x 34&quot;),
                  &quot;E&quot; (34&quot; x 44&quot;),
                  &quot;A4&quot; (21  cm x  29.7cm),
                  &quot;A3&quot; (29.7cm x  42  cm),
                  &quot;A2&quot; (42  cm x  59.4cm),
                  &quot;A1&quot; (59.4cm x  84.1cm),
                  &quot;A0&quot; (84.1cm x 118.9cm),
                  and &quot;B5&quot; (18.2cm x 25.7cm).

PSTEX OPTIONS
       The  pstex  language is a variant of ps which suppresses formatted
       (special) text.  The pstex_t language has the complementary behav&#8208;
       ior:  it  generates  only  the LaTeX special text and the commands
       necessary to position special text, and to overlay the  PostScript
       file generated using pstex.  These two drivers can be used to gen&#8208;
       erate a figure which combines the flexibility of PostScript graph&#8208;
       ics with LaTeX text formatting of special text.


       -F     Use  correct font sizes (points) instead of the traditional
              size that xfig/fig2dev uses, which is 1/80 inch.  The  cor&#8208;
              responding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.


       -g color
              Use color for the background.

       -n name
              sets the Title part of the PostScript output to name.  This
              is useful when the input to  fig2dev  comes  from  standard
              input.

PSTEX_T OPTIONS
       The  pstex_t language produces only the LaTeX special text and the
       commands necessary to position special text, and  to  overlay  the
       PostScript file generated using pstex.  (see above)


       -E num Set  encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation,
              1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)


       -F     Don&apos;t set the font face, series, and style; only  set  it&apos;s
              size  and  the baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5
              font parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is
              that  you can&apos;t set the font from your LaTeX document. With
              this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX  docu&#8208;
              ment (like &quot;\sfshape \input picture.eepic&quot;).

       -p file
              specifies  the  name of the PostScript file to be overlaid.
              If not set or its value is null then no  PS  file  will  be
              inserted.


PSTricks OPTIONS
       The  PSTricks  driver provides full LaTeX text and math formatting
       for XFig drawings without overlaying separate outputs  as  in  the
       PSTEX  methods.   The  output matches the quality of output of the
       PostScript driver except for text, where the Latex font  selection
       mechanism is used as for other fig2dev LaTeX drivers. In addition,
       text is rendered black, although font  color-changing  LaTex  code
       can  be  embedded  in the drawing.  The generated PSTricks code is
       meant to be readable.  Each command stands alone, not  relying  on
       global  option state variables.  Thus the user can easily use XFig
       to rough out a PSTricks drawing, then finish by hand editing.

       To  use  the  driver&apos;s  output,  give   the   command   &quot;\usepack&#8208;
       age{pstricks}&quot;  in  your  document  preamble.   The  graphicx  and
       pstricks-add packages may also be required.  The  former  is  used
       for  bitmap graphics and the second for complex line styles and/or
       hollow PSTricks arrows (with the -R 1 option).   The  driver  will
       tell you which packages are needed.  In the document body, include
       the figure with &quot;\input{pstfile}&quot; where pstfile.tex is the  output
       file.   Use  the  XFig  special  flag to have text passed as-is to
       LaTeX.  For non-special text, the same mechanism as the LaTeX  and
       epic  driver  mechanism  is  used to match font specs, but this is
       imprecise.
&#12;       Known bugs and limitations.
              PSTricks support for join styles is version dependent.  Raw
              postscript  is  inserted  with  &quot;\pstVerb&quot; for old versions
              when other than angle joins are needed.  The -t option con&#8208;
              trols  this  behavior.  PSTricks  does  not support rotated
              ellipses directly,  so  a  rput  command  is  emitted  that
              rotates  and  locates  a  horizontal ellipse.  This makes a
              problem with hatch patterns, which are  moved  and  rotated
              along  with  the  ellipse.   Hatch  rotation  is fixed by a
              counter-rotation, but the origin is not adjusted, so regis&#8208;
              tration  with  adjacent  hatch  patterns will be incorrect.
              Flipped bitmap graphics use an undocumented feature of  the
              graphicx  package: a negative height flips the image verti&#8208;
              cally.  This appears to work reliably.   However,  you  may
              want to flip graphics with another program before including
              them in Xfig drawings just to be sure.  With the -p option,
              the driver attempts to convert non-EPS pictures to EPS with
              the TeX distribution&apos;s bmeps program, but  bmeps  does  not
              know about very many file formats including gif.


       -G dummy_arg
              Draws  a standard PSTricks grid in light gray, ignoring the
              size parameters, numbered in PSTricks units.


       -l weight
              Sets a line weight factor that is multiplied by the  actual
              Fig  line width.  The default value 0.5 roughly matches the
              output of the PS driver.


       -n 0|1|2|3
              Sets environment type.  Default 0 creates a \picture  envi&#8208;
              ronment  with  bounding  box  exactly enclosing the picture
              (but see -x and -y ).  A 1  emits  bare  PSTricks  commands
              with  no  environment  at  all,  which  can  be  used  with
              \input{commands} inside an existing \pspicture.  A 2  emits
              a complete LaTeX document.  A 3 also emits a complete LaTeX
              document but attempts to set the PSTricks unit to fit a 7.5
              by 10 inch (portrait aspect) box.


       -P     Shorthand for -n 3
               .


       -p dir Attempts  to  run  the  bmeps  program to translate picture
              files to EPS, which is required by  PSTricks.   The  trans&#8208;
              lated  files  go  in  dir  ,  which must already exist (the
              driver will not create it). Moreover, (BIG CAVEAT HERE) the
              driver  overwrites  files  with impunity in this directory!
              Don&apos;t put your stuff here.  The includegraphics commands in
              the  output  file  refer to this directory.  Even if the -p
              option is not used, includegrpahics  commands  follow  this
              convention  with  the  default  directory  ./eps .  In this
              case, the user must do the conversions independently.   The
              bmeps  program is part of the standard TeX distribution. It
              converts the following formats to EPS:  png  jpg  pnm  tif.
              You can see the bmeps command with the -v option.


       -R 0|1|2
              Sets arrow style.  With the default style 0, Fig arrows are
              converted to lines and polygons.  With  style  1,  the  Fig
              arrowhead  dimensions  are  converted to PSTricks arrowhead
              dimensions and  PSTricks  arrowhead  options  are  emitted.
              Hollow arrows will require the additional package pstricks-
              add
               . With style 2, PSTricks  arrowhead  options  are  emitted
              with  no  dimensions at all, and arrowhead size may be con&#8208;
              trolled globally with psset
               .


       -S scale
              Scales the image according to the same  convention  as  the
              EPIC driver, i.e., to size scale
               /12.


       -t version
              Provides  the driver with PSTricks version number so output
              can match expected LaTeX input.


       -v     Print verbose warnings and extra  comments  in  the  output
              file.   Information  provided  includes  font  substitution
              details, the bmeps commands used for picture conversion, if
              any, and one comment per Fig object in the output.


       -x marginsize
              Adds  marginsize  on  the  left  and  right of the PStricks
              bounding box.  By default, the  box  exactly  encloses  the
              image.


       -y marginsize
              Adds  marginsize  on  the  top  and  bottom of the PStricks
              bounding box.  By default, the  box  exactly  encloses  the
              image.


       -z 0|1|2
              Sets  font  handling  option.  Default option 0 attempts to
              honor Fig font names and sizes, finding the best match with
              a standard LaTeX font.  Option 1 sets LaTeX font size only.
              Option 2 issues no font commands at all.


PSTEX_P and PDFTEX_P OPTIONS
       The pstex_p language has the same intention as the combination  of
       pstex  and  pstex_t.   The  only reason to use pstex_p is that you
       have partially overlayed texts.  pstex_p splits the Fig file  con&#8208;
       cerning the depths of existing texts. Because of it&apos;s necessary to
       get the resulting size of the figure for the pdf document you have
       to  specify  the  target  document format (i.e. using pstex_p rsp.
       pdftex_p).
       Two files results by using this language:

       1) A bash script for creating and removing the necessary  graphics
          files.  Extension: .create



       2)  The  latex  code which includes all graphics files and special
          texts. Content is put to stdout.


       The pstex_p driver has the following special options:


       -p basename
          specifies the basename of the files  to  be  created  (see  (1)
          above). This option is mandatory.

       -d dmag
          Set  a  separate magnification for the length of line dashes to
          dmag.

       -E num
          Set encoding for latex text translation (0  no  translation,  1
          ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)

       -l lwidth
          Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to lwidth
          pixels.  LaTeX supports only two different line  width:  \thin&#8208;
          lines and \thicklines.  Lines of width greater than lwidth pix&#8208;
          els are drawn as \thicklines.  Also affects the size of dots in
          dotted line style.  The default is 1.

       -v Verbose mode.

       -F Don&apos;t  set the font face, series, and style; only set it&apos;s size
          and the baselineskip. By  default,  fig2dev  sets  all  5  font
          parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you
          can&apos;t set the font from your LaTeX document. With  this  option
          on,  you  can  set  the  font  from  your  LaTeX document (like
          &quot;\sfshape \input picture.eepic&quot;).



TK and PTK OPTIONS (tcl/tk and Perl/tk)
       -l dummy_arg
              Generate figure in landscape mode.  The dummy  argument  is
              ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
              compatibility.  This option will override  the  orientation
              specification  in  the  file  (for  file  versions  3.0 and
              higher).

       -p dummy_arg
              Generate figure in portrait mode.  The  dummy  argument  is
              ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
              compatibility.  This option will override  the  orientation
              specification  in  the  file  (for  file  versions  3.0 and
              higher).  This is the default for Fig files of version  2.1
              or lower.

       -P     Generate  canvas  of  full  page  size instead of using the
              bounding box of the figure&apos;s objects. The default is to use
              only the bounding box.

       -z papersize
              Sets  the papersize.  See the POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS for avail&#8208;
              able paper sizes.  This is only used  when  the  -P  option
              (use full page) is used.

BUGS and RESTRICTIONS
       Please send bug reports, fixes, new features etc. to:
       xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov (Brian V. Smith)

       Arc-boxes are not supported for the tk output language, and only X
       bitmap pictures are supported because of the canvas limitation  in
       tk.

       Picture  objects  are not scaled with the magnification factor for
       tk output.

       Because tk scales canvas items according to the X display  resolu&#8208;
       tion,  polygons,  lines,  etc.  may  be  scaled  differently  than
       imported pictures (bitmaps) which aren&apos;t scaled at all.

       Rotated text is only supported in the  IBM-GL  (HP/GL)  and  Post&#8208;
       Script (including eps) languages.

       In  pdftex_p language fig2dev can not determine the exact sizes of
       the special texts set by pdflatex afterwards. If these  texts  are
       bigger  than  expected  the  calculated  bounding box might be too
       small so that some texts passes over  the  figure  boundaries.  If
       this  happen you have to put an invisible rectangle (line width 0)
       around the text or the entire figure.
