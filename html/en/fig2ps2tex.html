FIG2PS2TEX(1)                                                      FIG2PS2TEX(1)



NAME
       fig2ps2tex - generate a TeX file for including a PostScript file


SYNOPSIS
       fig2ps2tex file


DESCRIPTION
       Fig2ps2tex  generates a TeX file for including a PostScript file in a TeX
       document.  This involves calculating the bounding box from the Postscript
       document.  The TeX inclusion file is written to stdout.

       There  is  also  Fig2ps2tex.sh  for  those  systems without csh and/or dc
       (Linux for example).

       Note that the psfig macro package provides a more sophisticated  approach
       to including Postscript files in LaTeX docuements.  Fig2ps2tex works with
       plain TeX however.


USAGE
       Assume the Postscript file is called foo.ps .  The command

                             % fig2ps2tex foo.ps &gt;foo.tex

       will create the inclusion file with bounding information.   Then  include
       this file in your TeX document with the command

                                      \input{foo}


SEE ALSO
       psfig(1), latex(1), fig2dev(1), transfig(1).
