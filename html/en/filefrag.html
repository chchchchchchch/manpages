FILEFRAG(8)                                                          FILEFRAG(8)



NAME
       filefrag - report on file fragmentation

SYNOPSIS
       filefrag [ -Bbsvx ] [ files...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       filefrag  reports on how badly fragmented a particular file might be.  It
       makes allowances for indirect blocks for ext2 and ext3  filesystems,  but
       can be used on files for any filesystem.

       The  filefrag  program  initially  attempts to get the extent information
       using FIEMAP ioctl which is more efficient and faster.  If FIEMAP is  not
       supported then filefrag will fall back to using FIBMAP.

OPTIONS
       -B     Force  the  use  of  the  older FIBMAP ioctl instead of the FIEMAP
              ioctl for testing purposes.

       -b     Use 1024 byte blocksize for the output.

       -s     Sync the file before requesting the mapping.

       -v     Be verbose when checking for file fragmentation.

       -x     Display mapping of extended attributes.
