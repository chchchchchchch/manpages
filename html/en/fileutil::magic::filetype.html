NAME
       fileutil::magic::filetype - Procedures implementing file-type recognition

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command for the recognition of file types in pure
       Tcl.

       The core part of the recognizer was generated from a &quot;magic(5)&quot; file con&#8208;
       taining  the  checks  to perform to recognize files, and associated file-
       types.

       Beware! This recognizer is large, about 276  Kilobyte  of  generated  Tcl
       code.

       ::fileutil::magic::filetype filename
              This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.

              The  output  of  the  command  for  the specified file is a string
              describing the type of the file.

              This list will be empty if the type of the file is not recognized.
