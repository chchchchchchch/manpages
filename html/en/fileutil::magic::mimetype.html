NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command for the recognition of file types in pure
       Tcl. The output is standardized to mime-types.

       The core part of the recognizer was generated from a &quot;magic(5)&quot; file con&#8208;
       taining  the  checks  to perform to recognize files, and associated mime-
       types.

       ::fileutil::magic::mimetype filename
              This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.

              The output of the command for the specified file is not a list  of
              attributes describing the type of the file, but a list of standard
              mime-types the file may have.

              This list will be empty if the type of the file is not recognized.
