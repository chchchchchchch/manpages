NAME
       filter-key, filter-keytrans - Generic key event translator

SYNOPSIS
       filter-key: [&lt;file&gt;]

       filter-keytrans: [&lt;file&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
       This  filter  translates  key  events  according  to a set of translation
       rules. This can be used to remap a keyboard.

OPTIONS
       file   The name of the configuration file. If none given, the filter will
              first  look for the file filter/keytrans in the user GGI directory
              ($HOME/.ggi/ on UNIX), then in  the  base  GGI  directory  if  not
              found.


CONFIGURATION
       The  mapping  is  specified through a simple text file, each line being a
       translation rule. A line starting with a # is a comment. Each  line  must
       contain 10 values in the following order:

       modifier_mask
              Consider only the bits set here.


       modifier_value
              The bits set above must match this value.


       button_in, label_in, symbol_in
              If  this  is  not KEY_UNMAPPED==0xffff, the button/label/symbol of
              the incoming key must match these fields.


       modifier_changemask
              Change these bits from the original modifiers...


       modifier_ormask
              ... set them to these - one shouldn&apos;t use that.


       button_out, label_out, symbol_out
              The data that is then sent by the keymapper.  Any  fields  set  to
              KEY_UNMAPPED==0xffff will be copied from the incoming event.


EXAMPLE
       Mapping a symbol:

       # Take any key that produces a symbol of 0x41 (&apos;A&apos;) map it to ESC
       #
       # modmsk modval buttin lablin symin  modchg modor  butout labout symout
       0x0000 0x0000 0xffff 0xffff 0x0041 0x0000 0x0000 0xffff 0xffff 0x001b
