filter(7)                          Apple Inc.                          filter(7)



NAME
       filter - cups file conversion filter interface

SYNOPSIS
       filter job user title num-copies options [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  CUPS  filter interface provides a standard method for adding support
       for new document types to CUPS. Each filter is capable of converting from
       one  or  more  input formats to another format that can either be printed
       directly or piped into another filter to get it to a printable format.

       Filters must be capable of reading from a filename on the command-line or
       from  the  standard input, copying the standard input to a temporary file
       as required by the file format. All output must be sent to  the  standard
       output.

       The  command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the destination printer
       but is also available in the PRINTER environment variable.


OPTIONS
       Options passed on the command-line typically do not include  the  default
       choices  the  printer&apos;s PPD file. In addition, some options may be speci&#8208;
       fied in multiple ways  -  &quot;landscape&quot;  is  a  synonym  for  &quot;orientation-
       requested=4&quot;,  &quot;media&quot; is a synonym for &quot;PageSize&quot;, &quot;PageRegion&quot;, &quot;Input&#8208;
       Slot&quot;, and &quot;MediaType&quot;, and &quot;sides&quot; is a synonym for the various &quot;Duplex&quot;
       options. Non-raster filters must support both explicit and implicit spec&#8208;
       ification of PPD options - use the  ppdMarkDefaults  and  cupsMarkOptions
       functions  in  the  CUPS library to use the correct mapping, and ppdFind&#8208;
       MarkedChoice to get the user-selected choice.

       Raster filters should use option choices  set  through  the  raster  page
       header,  as those reflect the options in effect for a given page. Options
       specified on the command-line determine the default values for the entire
       job, which can be overridden on a per-page basis.


LOG MESSAGES
       Messages  sent  to  stderr  are generally logged to printer-state-message
       attribute and the current ErrorLog.  Each line  begins  with  a  standard
       prefix:


       ALERT: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;alert&quot; log level.


       ATTR: attribute=value [attribute=value]
            Sets the named job attribute(s). Typically this will be used to  set
            the job-remote-id attribute.


       CRIT: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;critical&quot; log level.


       DEBUG: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;debug&quot; log level.


       DEBUG2: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;debug2&quot; log level.


       EMERG: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;emergency&quot; log level.


       ERROR: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;error&quot; log level.


       INFO: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute. If the current LogLevel is
            set  to  &quot;debug2&quot;,  also  adds  the specified message to the current
            ErrorLog using the &quot;info&quot; log level.


       NOTICE: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;notice&quot; log level.


       PAGE: page-number #-copies

       PAGE: total #-pages
            Adds  an  entry to the current PageLog. The first form adds #-copies
            to the job-media-sheets-completed attribute. The  second  form  sets
            the job-media-sheets-completed attribute to #-pages.


       PPD: Keyword=Value ... KeywordN=Value
            Sets the named keywords in the printer&apos;s PPD file. This is typically
            used to update default option keywords such as  DefaultPageSize  and
            the various installable options in the PPD file.


       STATE: printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]

       STATE: + printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]

       STATE: - printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]
            Sets,  adds, or removes printer-state-reason keywords to the current
            queue. Typically this is used to indicate media, ink, and toner con&#8208;
            ditions on a printer.


       WARNING: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified mes&#8208;
            sage to the current ErrorLog using the &quot;warning&quot; log level.

       it  will only work with the System V interface script as the only filter.
       Typically the interface script will be provided via the  lpadmin(8)  com&#8208;
       mand using the -i option.
