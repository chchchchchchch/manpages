FIND2PERL(1)            Perl Programmers Reference Guide            FIND2PERL(1)



NAME
       find2perl - translate find command lines to Perl code

SYNOPSIS
               find2perl [paths] [predicates] | perl

DESCRIPTION
       find2perl is a little translator to convert find command lines to
       equivalent Perl code.  The resulting code is typically faster than
       running find itself.

       &quot;paths&quot; are a set of paths where find2perl will start its searches and
       &quot;predicates&quot; are taken from the following list.

       &quot;! PREDICATE&quot;
           Negate the sense of the following predicate.  The &quot;!&quot; must be passed
           as a distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by whitespace
           and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a backslash
           (just as with using find(1)).

       &quot;( PREDICATES )&quot;
           Group the given PREDICATES.  The parentheses must be passed as
           distinct arguments, so they may need to be surrounded by whitespace
           and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a backslash
           (just as with using find(1)).

       &quot;PREDICATE1 PREDICATE2&quot;
           True if _both_ PREDICATE1 and PREDICATE2 are true; PREDICATE2 is not
           evaluated if PREDICATE1 is false.

       &quot;PREDICATE1 -o PREDICATE2&quot;
           True if either one of PREDICATE1 or PREDICATE2 is true; PREDICATE2 is
           not evaluated if PREDICATE1 is true.

       &quot;-follow&quot;
           Follow (dereference) symlinks.  The checking of file attributes
           depends on the position of the &quot;-follow&quot; option. If it precedes the
           file check option, an &quot;stat&quot; is done which means the file check
           applies to the file the symbolic link is pointing to. If &quot;-follow&quot;
           option follows the file check option, this now applies to the
           symbolic link itself, i.e.  an &quot;lstat&quot; is done.

       &quot;-depth&quot;
           Change directory traversal algorithm from breadth-first to depth-
           first.

       &quot;-prune&quot;
           Do not descend into the directory currently matched.

       &quot;-xdev&quot;
           Do not traverse mount points (prunes search at mount-point
           directories).

       &quot;-name GLOB&quot;
           File name matches specified GLOB wildcard pattern.  GLOB may need to
           be quoted to avoid interpretation by the shell (just as with using
           find(1)).

       &quot;-iname GLOB&quot;
           Like &quot;-name&quot;, but the match is case insensitive.

       &quot;-path GLOB&quot;
           Path name matches specified GLOB wildcard pattern.
&#12;       &quot;-ipath GLOB&quot;
           Like &quot;-path&quot;, but the match is case insensitive.

       &quot;-perm PERM&quot;
           Low-order 9 bits of permission match octal value PERM.

       &quot;-perm -PERM&quot;
           The bits specified in PERM are all set in file&apos;s permissions.

       &quot;-type X&quot;
           The file&apos;s type matches perl&apos;s &quot;-X&quot; operator.

       &quot;-fstype TYPE&quot;
           Filesystem of current path is of type TYPE (only NFS/non-NFS
           distinction is implemented).

       &quot;-user USER&quot;
           True if USER is owner of file.

       &quot;-group GROUP&quot;
           True if file&apos;s group is GROUP.

       &quot;-nouser&quot;
           True if file&apos;s owner is not in password database.

       &quot;-nogroup&quot;
           True if file&apos;s group is not in group database.

       &quot;-inum INUM&quot;
           True file&apos;s inode number is INUM.

       &quot;-links N&quot;
           True if (hard) link count of file matches N (see below).

       &quot;-size N&quot;
           True if file&apos;s size matches N (see below) N is normally counted in
           512-byte blocks, but a suffix of &quot;c&quot; specifies that size should be
           counted in characters (bytes) and a suffix of &quot;k&quot; specifies that size
           should be counted in 1024-byte blocks.

       &quot;-atime N&quot;
           True if last-access time of file matches N (measured in days) (see
           below).

       &quot;-ctime N&quot;
           True if last-changed time of file&apos;s inode matches N (measured in
           days, see below).

       &quot;-mtime N&quot;
           True if last-modified time of file matches N (measured in days, see
           below).

       &quot;-newer FILE&quot;
           True if last-modified time of file matches N.

       &quot;-print&quot;
           Print out path of file (always true). If none of &quot;-exec&quot;, &quot;-ls&quot;,
           &quot;-print0&quot;, or &quot;-ok&quot; is specified, then &quot;-print&quot; will be added
           implicitly.

       &quot;-print0&quot;
           Like -print, but terminates with \0 instead of \n.

       &quot;-exec OPTIONS ;&quot;
           exec() the arguments in OPTIONS in a subprocess; any occurrence of {}
           in OPTIONS will first be substituted with the path of the current
           file.  Note that the command &quot;rm&quot; has been special-cased to use
           perl&apos;s unlink() function instead (as an optimization).  The &quot;;&quot; must
           be passed as a distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by
           whitespace and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a
           backslash (just as with using find(1)).

       &quot;-ok OPTIONS ;&quot;
           Like -exec, but first prompts user; if user&apos;s response does not begin
           with a y, skip the exec.  The &quot;;&quot; must be passed as a distinct
           argument, so it may need to be surrounded by whitespace and/or quoted
           from interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as with
           using find(1)).

       &quot;-eval EXPR&quot;
           Has the perl script eval() the EXPR.

       &quot;-ls&quot;
           Simulates &quot;-exec ls -dils {} ;&quot;

       &quot;-tar FILE&quot;
           Adds current output to tar-format FILE.

       &quot;-cpio FILE&quot;
           Adds current output to old-style cpio-format FILE.

       &quot;-ncpio FILE&quot;
           Adds current output to &quot;new&quot;-style cpio-format FILE.

       Predicates which take a numeric argument N can come in three forms:

          * N is prefixed with a +: match values greater than N
          * N is prefixed with a -: match values less than N
          * N is not prefixed with either + or -: match only values equal to N
