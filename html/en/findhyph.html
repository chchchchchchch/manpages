FINDHYPH(1)                                                          FINDHYPH(1)



NAME
       findhyph -- find words hyphenated by TeX in a document

INSTALLATION
       Copy findhyph or findhyph.bat (depending on OS used) to a directory
       included in system PATH. Perl interpreter is required to be in
       &quot;/usr/bin/&quot; for Unix-like systems or in PATH when using findhyph.bat.

SYNOPSIS
       1)  set &quot;\tracingparagraphs=1&quot; in a TeX document foo.tex and run:

       2)  tex foo.tex

       3)  findhyph [options] foo.log

       If you are setting &quot;\looseness=&lt;N&gt;&quot; to optimize paragraphs, you need to
       pass that information to the file foo.log in a form &quot;@looseness=&lt;N&gt;&quot; (on
       a separate line). You can use a macro like
       &quot;\def\setlooseness#1{\immediate\write-1{@looseness=#1}\looseness=#1}&quot; for
       this purpose. If the paragraph contains material in display math mode,
       you need to use the macro in all split parts of the paragraph.

OPTIONS
       -c  display hyphenated words in context

       -f  display font selectors and other strings starting with a backslash
           character

       -v  display program version

       -p  generate file containing information about one-letter prepositions
           and conjunctions left at the end of line

       -l=STRING
           use prepositions/conjunctions listed in STRING instead of default
           list of prepositions and conjunctions &quot;kKsSvVzZoOuUiIA&quot; used for
           Slovak and Czech language

OUTPUT FILES
       foo.hyph
           List of hyphenated words. All punctuation characters, parentheses and
           other character immediately preceding or following displayed words
           are included in this list. TeX constructs which are too difficult to
           display (&quot;\hbox{}&quot;, &quot;\mark{}&quot; etc.) are shown as &quot;[]&quot;. Math mode is
           indicated by &quot;$&quot; sign.

           Page numbers in square brackets refer to LOG file and may
           occasionally differ from the typeset document. The reason is that TeX
           may need to break more paragraphs than it would eventually fit on the
           page in order to find a page break.

           Words hyphenated in footnotes are listed before the words hyphenated
           in the paragraph in which the footnote is referenced.

       foo.prep
           List of prepositions if option -p is used.

HISTORY
       1.0 (2001-04-08)

       &#183;   public release
&#12;       2.0 (2009-08-10)

       &#183;   fixes in line breaks detection algorithm; support for the third pass
           of line breaking algorithm in TeX (positive \emergencystretch);
           support for discretionary breaks in the first pass

       &#183;   page number detection improved (recognized negative page numbers,
           compound page numbers when &quot;\count1&quot; to &quot;\count9&quot; registers are non-
           zero and &quot;[nn{mapfile}]&quot;, &quot;[nn&lt;picture&gt;]&quot; and &quot;[nn&lt;newline&gt;&quot; formats
           used by pdfTeX; false page number detection should be much more rare)

       &#183;   configurable list of prepositions and conjunctions

       &#183;   hyphenated words can be displayed in context

       &#183;   suggestions and testing by Pavel Striz

       3.0 (2012-02-01)

       &#183;   fixed a bug when total paragraph demerits are negative

       &#183;   &quot;\looseness&quot; setting is now taken into account (thanks to Karel Horak
           for identifying the issue)
