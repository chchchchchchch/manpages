FINDRULE(1p)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          FINDRULE(1p)



NAME
       findrule - command line wrapper to File::Find::Rule

USAGE
         findrule [path...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;findrule&quot; mostly borrows the interface from GNU find(1) to provide a
       command-line interface onto the File::Find::Rule heirarchy of modules.

       The syntax for expressions is the rule name, preceded by a dash, followed
       by an optional argument.  If the argument is an opening parenthesis it is
       taken as a list of arguments, terminated by a closing parenthesis.

       Some examples:

        find -file -name ( foo bar )

       files named &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;, below the current directory.

        find -file -name foo -bar

       files named &quot;foo&quot;, that have pubs (for this is what our ficticious &quot;bar&quot;
       clause specifies), below the current directory.

        find -file -name ( -bar )

       files named &quot;-bar&quot;, below the current directory.  In this case if we&apos;d
       have omitted the parenthesis it would have parsed as a call to name with
       no arguments, followed by a call to -bar.

   Supported switches
       I&apos;m very slack.  Please consult the File::Find::Rule manpage for now, and
       prepend - to the commands that you want.

   Extra bonus switches
       findrule automatically loads all of your installed File::Find::Rule::*
       extension modules, so check the documentation to see what those would be.
