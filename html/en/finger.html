FINGER(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                FINGER(1)

NAME
     finger &#8212; user information lookup program

SYNOPSIS
     finger [-lmsp] [user ...] [user@host ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The finger displays information about the system users.

     Options are:

     -s    Finger displays the user&apos;s login name, real name, terminal name and
           write status (as a ``*&apos;&apos; after the terminal name if write permission
           is denied), idle time, login time, office location and office phone
           number.

           Login time is displayed as month, day, hours and minutes, unless more
           than six months ago, in which case the year is displayed rather than
           the hours and minutes.

           Unknown devices as well as nonexistent idle and login times are dis&#8208;
           played as single asterisks.

     -l    Produces a multi-line format displaying all of the information
           described for the -s option as well as the user&apos;s home directory,
           home phone number, login shell, mail status, and the contents of the
           files &#8220;.plan&#8221;, &#8220;.project&#8221;, &#8220;.pgpkey&#8221; and &#8220;.forward&#8221; from the user&apos;s
           home directory.

           Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as ``+N-NNN-NNN-
           NNNN&apos;&apos;.  Numbers specified as ten or seven digits are printed as the
           appropriate subset of that string.  Numbers specified as five digits
           are printed as ``xN-NNNN&apos;&apos;.  Numbers specified as four digits are
           printed as ``xNNNN&apos;&apos;.

           If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase ``(messages
           off)&apos;&apos; is appended to the line containing the device name.  One entry
           per user is displayed with the -l option; if a user is logged on mul&#8208;
           tiple times, terminal information is repeated once per login.

           Mail status is shown as ``No Mail.&apos;&apos; if there is no mail at all,
           ``Mail last read DDD MMM ## HH:MM YYYY (TZ)&apos;&apos; if the person has
           looked at their mailbox since new mail arriving, or ``New mail
           received ...&apos;&apos;, ``  Unread since ...&apos;&apos; if they have new mail.

     -p    Prevents the -l option of finger from displaying the contents of the
           &#8220;.plan&#8221;, &#8220;.project&#8221; and &#8220;.pgpkey&#8221; files.

     -m    Prevent matching of user names.  User is usually a login name; how&#8208;
           ever, matching will also be done on the users&apos; real names, unless the
           -m option is supplied.  All name matching performed by finger is case
           insensitive.

     If no options are specified, finger defaults to the -l style output if op&#8208;
     erands are provided, otherwise to the -s style.  Note that some fields may
     be missing, in either format, if information is not available for them.

     If no arguments are specified, finger will print an entry for each user
     currently logged into the system.

     Finger may be used to look up users on a remote machine.  The format is to
     specify a user as &#8220;user@host&#8221;, or &#8220;@host&#8221;, where the default output format
     for the former is the -l style, and the default output format for the lat&#8208;
     ter is the -s style.  The -l option is the only option that may be passed
     to a remote machine.

     If standard output is a socket, finger will emit a carriage return (^M)
     before every linefeed (^J). This is for processing remote finger requests
     when invoked by fingerd(8).

FILES
     ~/.nofinger      If finger finds this file in a user&apos;s home directory, it
                      will, for finger requests originating outside the local
                      host, firmly deny the existence of that user.  For this to
                      work, the finger program, as started by fingerd(8), must
                      be able to see the .nofinger file. This generally means
                      that the home directory containing the file must have the
                      other-users-execute bit set (o+x). See chmod(1).  If you
                      use this feature for privacy, please test it with ``finger
                      @localhost&apos;&apos; before relying on it, just in case.

     ~/.plan

     ~/.project

     ~/.pgpkey        These files are printed as part of a long-format request.
                      The .plan file may be arbitrarily long.
