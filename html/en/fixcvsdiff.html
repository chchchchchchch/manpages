FIXCVSDIFF(1)                       Man pages                      FIXCVSDIFF(1)



NAME
       fixcvsdiff - fix problematic diff files

SYNOPSIS
       fixcvsdiff [-p] [-b] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       fixcvsdiff modifies diff files created from the cvs diff command, where
       files have been added or removed. CVS tends to create diff files that
       patch(1) mis-interprets. The diff file must retain the lines beginning
       with &#8220;Index:&#8221; in order for the correction to work.

OPTIONS
       -b
           Keep a .bak backup file.

       -p
           Print out the cvs add and cvs remove commands that must be made after
           applying the diff, but before running cvs commit.

SEE ALSO
       diff(1), patch(1), cvs(1)
