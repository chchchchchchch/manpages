fixnt(1)                             Debian                             fixnt(1)



NAME
       fixnt - Filter for the Windows NT postscript printer driver.

SYNOPSIS
       fixnt &lt; BADFILE.ps &gt; GOODFILE.ps

DESCRIPTION
       The Windows NT postscript driver has a tendency to make broken postscript
       files, that are incompatible with psutils.  fixnt is a filter that  fixes
       these problems, allowing the use of psnup(1).

       The filter takes the broken postscript file on stdin, and outputs a fixed
       postscript file on stdout.  It has no other form for invocation and takes
       no options on the command-line.

OPTIONS
       fixnt  takes no options.

BUGS
       fixnt  does not check for NTPSOct94.  For a workaround, use a sed(1) com&#8208;
       mand to replace &apos;NTPSOct94&apos; with &apos;NTPSOct95&apos;, like so:
              sed &apos;s/NTPSOct94/NTPSOct95/g&apos;
       This is particularly important for Windows NT 3.5 users.
