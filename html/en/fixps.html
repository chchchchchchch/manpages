FIXPS(1)                               FSF                              FIXPS(1)



NAME
       fixps - sanitize PostScript files

SYNOPSIS
       fixps [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Try to fix common PostScript problems that break postprocessing.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -q, --quiet
              don&apos;t print informational messages

       -o, --output=FILE
              save result in FILE.  If FILE is `-&apos;, send to stdout

       -f, --force
              force full rewrite by ghostscript

       -n, --no-fix
              don&apos;t fix the FILE, but still honor `-o&apos;

       -c, --check, --dry-run
              don&apos;t perform any action

   Fixes:
              -  Remove junk before and after PostScript content - Use only Unix
              end of lines (

       )

              - Remove empty  lines  -  Fix  Apple  prologue  (fixmacps)  -  Fix
              FrameMaker  prologue  (fixfmps) - Fix CorelDraw prologue (fixnt) -
              Fix Windows NT 3.5/4.0 prologue (fixnt) - Fix Windows 95  prologue
              -  Ensure  there  is a `%%BeginSetup/%%EndSetup&apos; section - Removes
              Canvas&apos; extraneaous `%%EndDocument:&apos; comments  -  Split  too  long
              lines

       If  the FILE seems really in a bad state, ghostscript may be used to per&#8208;
       form a full rewrite.  The output might then be significantly bigger,  but
       much safer.
