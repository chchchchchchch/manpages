NAME
       fiz - analyze damaged zoo archive for data recovery

SYNOPSIS
       fiz archive[.zoo]

DESCRIPTION
       Fiz  is used to analyze damaged zoo archives and locate directory entries
       and file data in them.  The current version of fiz is 2.0 and it is meant
       to be used in conjunction with zoo version 2.0.  Fiz makes no assumptions
       about archive structure.  Instead, it simply searches the entire  subject
       archive  for  tag values that mark the locations of directory entries and
       file data.  In a zoo archive,  a  directory  entry  contains  information
       about  a stored file such as its name, whether compressed or not, and its
       timestamp.  The file data are the actual data for the archived file,  and
       may be either the original data, or the result of compressing the file.

       For  each  directory  entry  found, fiz prints where in the archive it is
       located, the directory path and filename(s)  found  in  it,  whether  the
       directory entry appears to be corrupted (indicated by [*CRC Error*]), and
       the value of the pointer to the file data that is found in the  directory
       entry.   For  each  block  of  file data found in the archive, fiz prints
       where in the archive the block begins.  In the case of an  undamaged  ar&#8208;
       chive,  the  pointer  to file data found in a directory entry will corre&#8208;
       spond to where fiz actually locates the data.  Here is some sample output
       from fiz:

       ****************
           2526: DIR  [changes] ==&gt;   95
           2587: DATA
       ****************
           3909: DIR  [copyrite] ==&gt; 1478
           3970: DATA
           4769: DATA
       ****************

       In  such  output,  DIR indicates where fiz found a directory entry in the
       archive, and DATA indicates where fiz found file  data  in  the  archive.
       Filenames  located  by fiz are enclosed in square brackets, and the nota&#8208;
       tion &quot;==&gt;   95&quot; indicates that the directory entry found by fiz at  posi&#8208;
       tion  2526  has  a  file  data pointer to position 95.  In actuality, fiz
       found file data at positions 2587, 3970, and 4769.  Since fiz found  only
       two  directory entries, and each directory entry corresponds to one file,
       one of the file data positions is an artifact.

       Once the locations of directory entries and file data are  found,  the  @
       modifier  to  zoo&apos;s archive list and extract commands can be used and the
       archive contents selectively listed or extracted,  skipping  the  damaged
       portion.  This is further described in the documentation for zoo(1).

       In  the  above  case,  commands to try giving to zoo might be x@2526,2587
       (extract beginning at position 2526, and  get  file  data  from  position
       2587),  x@3090,3970 (extract at 3090, get data from 3970) and x@3909,4769
       (extract at 3909, get data from 4769).  Once a  correctly-matched  direc&#8208;
       tory  entry/file  data  pair is found, zoo will in most cases synchronize
       with and correctly extract all files subsequently found in  the  archive.
       Trial  and  error should allow all undamaged files to be extracted.  Also
       note that self-extracting archives created using sez (the Self-Extracting
       Zoo  utility for MS-DOS), which are normally executed on an MS-DOS system
       for extraction, can be extracted on non-MSDOS systems in a similar way.

&#12;BUGS
       Random byte patterns can occasionally be incorrectly  recognized  as  tag
       values.   This occurs very rarely, however, and trial and error will usu&#8208;
       ally permit all undamaged data to be extracted.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Fiz always exits with a status code of 0.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       Automation of data recovery from a damaged archive is potentially achiev&#8208;
       able.   However, since damaged archives occur only rarely, fiz as it cur&#8208;
       rently stands is unlikely to change much in the near future.
