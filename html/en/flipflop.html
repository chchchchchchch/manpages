NAME
       flipflop - draws a grid of 3D squares that change positions

SYNOPSIS
       flipflop   [-display   host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual]  [-window]
       [-count number | -free number] [-size number] [-size-x  number]  [-size-y
       number]  [-spin  number]  [-mode  sticks | tiles] [-delay number] [-wire&#8208;
       frame] [-fps] [-texture]

DESCRIPTION
       Flipflop draws a grid of 3D colored tiles that change positions with each
       other.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -count number
               Number of tiles on the board. A value of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;default&quot;. The
               default number of tiles depends on the size of the board and  the
               mode: 95% of total tiles for &quot;tiles&quot; mode and 80% of total sticks
               for &quot;sticks&quot; mode (e.g. 76 tiles or 64 sticks for a 9x9 board).

       -free number
               Number of tiles missing from the board. See -count.

       -size number
               Number of tiles on each side of the board. Takes precedence  over
               -size-x and -size-y. Default: 9.

       -size-x number
               Width (in tiles) of the board. Default: 9.

       -size-y number
               Length (in tiles) of the board. Default: 9.

       -spin number
               Angular velocity for the rotation of the board.

       -mode sticks
               Draw hopping sticks instead of flipping tiles.

       -mode tiles
               Draw flipping tiles. This is the default.

       -delay number
               Per-frame  delay,  in  microseconds.   Default:  20000 (0.02 sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -fps | -no-fps
               Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -wireframe
               Only draw outlines.

       -texture | -no-texture
               Whether to texture the tiles with a screen grab or an image.
&#12;ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
