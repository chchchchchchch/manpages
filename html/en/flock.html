FLOCK(1)                          User Commands                         FLOCK(1)



NAME
       flock - manage locks from shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       flock [-sxon] [-w timeout] lockfile [-c] command...

       flock [-sxon] [-w timeout] lockdir [-c] command...

       flock [-sxun] [-w timeout] fd

DESCRIPTION
       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or the com&#8208;
       mand line.

       The first and second forms wraps the lock around the executing a command,
       in  a manner similar to su(1) or newgrp(1).  It locks a specified file or
       directory, which is created (assuming  appropriate  permissions),  if  it
       does not already exist.

       The  third  form  is convenient inside shell scripts, and is usually used
       the following manner:

       (
         flock -n 9 || exit 1
         # ... commands executed under lock ...
       ) 9&gt;/var/lock/mylockfile

       The mode used to open the file doesn&apos;t matter to flock;  using  &gt;  or  &gt;&gt;
       allows  the lockfile to be created if it does not already exist, however,
       write permission is required; using &lt;  requires  that  the  file  already
       exists but only read permission is required.

       By default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired, flock waits until
       the lock is available.

OPTIONS
       -s, --shared
              Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.

       -x, -e, --exclusive
              Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock.  This  is
              the default.

       -u, --unlock
              Drop  a lock.  This is usually not required, since a lock is auto&#8208;
              matically dropped when the file is closed.   However,  it  may  be
              required  in  special  cases,  for example if the enclosed command
              group may have forked a background process  which  should  not  be
              holding the lock.

       -n, --nb, --nonblock
              Fail  (with an exit code of 1) rather than wait if the lock cannot
              be immediately acquired.

       -w, --wait, --timeout seconds
              Fail (with an exit code of 1)  if  the  lock  cannot  be  acquired
              within seconds seconds.  Decimal fractional values are allowed.

       -o, --close
              Close the file descriptor on which the lock is held before execut&#8208;
              ing command.  This is useful if command  spawns  a  child  process
              which should not be holding the lock.

       -c, --command command
              Pass a single command to the shell with -c.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message.
