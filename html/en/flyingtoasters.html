NAME
       flyingtoasters - 3d space-age jet-powered flying toasters (and toast)

SYNOPSIS
       flyingtoasters  [-display host:display.screen] [-visual visual] [-window]
       [-root] [-delay number] [-speed  number]  [-ntoasters  number]  [-nslices
       number] [-no-texture] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       Draws  a  squadron of shiny 3D space-age jet-powered flying toasters, and
       associated toast, flying across your screen.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  30000  (0.03  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -speed number
               How fast the toasters fly.  Larger for faster.  Default: 1.0.

       -ntoasters number
               How many toasters to draw.  Default 20.

       -nslices number
               How many slices of toast to draw.  Default 25.

       -no-texture
               Turn off texture mapping (for slow machines.)

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

&#12;       The original After Dark flying toasters, with  the  fluffy  white  wings,
       were  a  trademark of Berkeley Systems.  Berkeley Systems ceased to exist
       some time in 1998, having been gobbled up by Sierra Online, who were sub&#8208;
       sequently  gobbled  up  by  Flipside  and/or  Vivendi  (it&apos;s hard to tell
       exactly what happened when.)

       I doubt anyone even cares any  more,  but  if  they  do,  hopefully  this
       homage, with the space-age 3D jet-plane toasters, will be considered dif&#8208;
       ferent enough that whoever still owns the trademark to the  fluffy-winged
       2D bitmapped toasters won&apos;t get all huffy at us.
