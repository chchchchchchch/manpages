FMA(3)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     FMA(3)



NAME
       fma, fmaf, fmal - floating-point multiply and add

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double fma(double x, double y, double z);
       float fmaf(float x, float y, float z);
       long double fmal(long double x, long double y, long double z);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fma(), fmaf(), fmal():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The  fma()  function  computes  x  * y + z.  The result is rounded as one
       ternary operation according to the current rounding mode (see fenv(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the value of x * y + z,  rounded  as  one  ternary
       operation.

       If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x times y is an exact infinity, and z is an infinity with the opposite
       sign, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If one of x or y is an infinity, the other is 0, and z is not  a  NaN,  a
       domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If  one  of  x or y is an infinity, and the other is 0, and z is a NaN, a
       domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If x times y is not an infinity times zero (or vice versa), and  z  is  a
       NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If  the  result overflows, a range error occurs, and an infinity with the
       correct sign is returned.

       If the result underflows, a  range  error  occurs,  and  a  signed  0  is
       returned.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7)  for  information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x * y + z, or x * y is invalid and z is not a NaN
              An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

       Range error: result overflow
              An overflow floating-point exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

       Range error: result underflow
              An underflow floating-point exception (FE_UNDERFLOW) is raised.

       These functions do not set errno.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.
