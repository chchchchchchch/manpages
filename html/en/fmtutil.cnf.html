NAME
       fmtutil.cnf - configuration file for fmtutil

DESCRIPTION
       The  fmtutil.cnf  file  contains  the configuration information for fmtu&#8208;
       til(8).  Each line contains  the  name  of  the  format  (e.g.,  ``tex&#180;&#180;,
       ``latex&#180;&#180;, ``omega&#180;&#180;), the name of the engine that is used by that format
       (e.g., ``tex&#180;&#180;,  ``etex&#180;&#180;,  ``omega&#180;&#180;),  the  pattern  file  (e.g.,  lan&#8208;
       guage.dat, language.def), and any arguments (name of an .ini file).

       Fields  are  separated  by whitespace and complete lines can be commented
       out with ``#&#180;&#180;.  The ``pattern file&#180;&#180; field cannot be used  to  define  a
       file  that  is  used  while  building the format.  It tells fmtutil which
       files (separated by commas) the format creation procedure  reads  and  it
       has  an effect to the options --showhyphen and --byhyphen.  If the format
       has no way to customize hyphenation, a ``-&#180;&#180;  can  be  used  to  indicate
       this.

NOTES
       The  tex(1)  and amstex(1) formats always load hyphen.tex.  No customiza&#8208;
       tion by a pattern file is available for  these  formats.  Therefore,  the
       pattern-file  field  for  the  tex  and amstex is usually indicated to be
       empty (``-&#180;&#180;).

       You can, however, build customized formats on top of plain tex(1) or ams&#8208;
       tex(1) by using bplain.tex instead of plain.tex (b for the Babel system).
       See, for example, the bplain.ini file for the bplain format).

       etex(1) loads language.def, not language.dat.

       Symbolic links to the correct engines (e.g., bplain -&gt; tex) are generated
       by the texlinks(8) script.   Remember to run texlinks(8) if you run fmtu&#8208;
       til(8) yourself, rather than using the FORMATS option in texconfig(8).
