NAME
       fontmatrix - a powerful open source font manager


SYNOPSIS
       fontmatrix [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       Fontmatrix  is an open source font manager originally developed on Linux,
       but now runs on OSX as well.


       This man page only provides summaries of some aspects  of  the  program&apos;s
       use.  It&apos;s  main purpose is to make sure you can find the full documenta&#8208;
       tion quickly and easily.

OPTIONS
       The definitive options are in the program&apos;s usage statement. Run: fontma&#8208;
       trix --help to view the usage statement.


       -l, --lang xx
              Overrides  the  system  locale and runs Fontmatrix in language xx.
              The language is specified with the same POSIX language codes  that
              are  used  in the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables. For exam&#8208;
              ple, English can be selected with &apos;en&apos; (generic English),  &apos;en_GB&apos;
              (British  English),  &apos;en_US&apos;  (American  english), etc. Similarly,
              Deutsch can be selected with &apos;de&apos; or &apos;de_DE&apos;.


              -la, --langs-available
              Print a list of languages for which  user  interface  translations
              are  available. To use that language run Fontmatrix as &apos;fontmatrix
              -l xx&apos; where xx is the short language  code,  or  set  the  locale
              environment variables as described below.

       -v, --version
              Prints the Fontmatrix version number and exits.

       -f, --file
              Open  the  specified  file.  It&apos;s possible to simply pass the file
              name as an unqualified argument instead of using this,  though  if
              the  name  begins with a - you will need to use --, eg &apos;fontmatrix
              -- -myfile.sla&apos;.

       -h, --help
              Print a brief usage summary.

       -ns, --no-splash
              Suppresses display of the splash screen during SCribus start-up.

ENVIRONMENT
       Fontmatrix respects the standard locale environment variables. Others may
       be  used through underlying libraries, such as Qt, or by programs used by
       Fontmatrix.  LC_ALL,  LC_MESSAGES,  LANG  POSIX  locale.  See  locale(1).
       Fontmatrix uses these three environment variables, in the listed order of
       precedence, to select the language (including the user interface transla&#8208;
       tion) to use. If none are set, it will fall back on the locale set by the
       underlying Qt library.

       PATH   Fontmatrix may search the PATH for external tools if  their  paths
              are  not  specified  absolutely.  This is currently most likely to
              affect you if you have multiple copies of fontforge(1)  installed.
              You  can  set an absolute path to the correct fontforge(1) in your
              Fontmatrix preferences and bypass the PATH search.

       A few important environment variables from other programs are  summarised
       here for convenience, though you should check the original program&apos;s doc&#8208;
       umentation if you are having trouble.


       FILES

       $HOME/.fontmatrix/
              User preferences are  stored  in  $HOME/.fontmatrix/  on  Unix  or
              Linux. Most other paths are configurable from the Fontmatrix pref&#8208;
              erences.  $HOME/.fonts/

       $HOME/.fonts.conf

       /etc/fonts
              Fontconfig, the library used by Fontmatrix  to  locate  fonts,  is
              normally    configured    with   files   in   /etc/fonts,   mainly
              /etc/fonts/fonts.conf and /etc/fonts/local.conf . It may also  use
              a  config  file $HOME/.fonts.conf and fonts in $HOME/.fonts/ . See
              fonts.conf(5) and the fontconfig documentation for  more  informa&#8208;
              tion.  Note that Fontmatrix may also use its internal font path to
              locate more fonts - see  the  Preferences  dialog  and  fontmatrix
              help.
