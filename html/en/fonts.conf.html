NAME
       fonts.conf - Font configuration files

SYNOPSIS
          /etc/fonts/fonts.conf
          /etc/fonts/fonts.dtd
          /etc/fonts/conf.d
          ~/.fonts.conf.d
          ~/.fonts.conf

DESCRIPTION
       Fontconfig  is  a library designed to provide system-wide font configura&#8208;
       tion, customization and application access.

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
       Fontconfig contains two essential modules, the configuration module which
       builds  an  internal configuration from XML files and the matching module
       which accepts font patterns and returns the nearest matching font.

   FONT CONFIGURATION
       The configuration module consists of the FcConfig datatype, libexpat  and
       FcConfigParse  which  walks  over  an XML tree and amends a configuration
       with data found within.  From an external perspective,  configuration  of
       the  library  consists of generating a valid XML tree and feeding that to
       FcConfigParse.  The only other mechanism  provided  to  applications  for
       changing the running configuration is to add fonts and directories to the
       list of application-provided font files.

       The intent is to make font configurations relatively static,  and  shared
       by  as many applications as possible.  It is hoped that this will lead to
       more stable font selection when passing names  from  one  application  to
       another.   XML  was chosen as a configuration file format because it pro&#8208;
       vides a format which is easy for external agents to edit while  retaining
       the correct structure and syntax.

       Font  configuration  is separate from font matching; applications needing
       to do their own matching can access the available fonts from the  library
       and  perform  private  matching.  The intent is to permit applications to
       pick and choose appropriate functionality from  the  library  instead  of
       forcing  them  to choose between this library and a private configuration
       mechanism.  The hope is that this will ensure that configuration of fonts
       for  all applications can be centralized in one place.  Centralizing font
       configuration will simplify and regularize  font  installation  and  cus&#8208;
       tomization.

   FONT PROPERTIES
       While  font  patterns  may  contain essentially any properties, there are
       some well known properties with associated types.  Fontconfig  uses  some
       of  these  properties  for font matching and font completion.  Others are
       provided as a convenience for the applications&apos; rendering mechanism.

   FONT MATCHING
       Fontconfig performs matching by measuring the distance  from  a  provided
       pattern  to all of the available fonts in the system.  The closest match&#8208;
       ing font is selected.  This ensures that a font will always be  returned,
       but doesn&apos;t ensure that it is anything like the requested pattern.

       Font  matching  starts  with  an  application  constructed  pattern.  The
       desired attributes of the resulting font are collected together in a pat&#8208;
       tern.  Each property of the pattern can contain one or more values; these
       are listed in priority order; matches earlier in the list are  considered
       &quot;closer&quot; than matches later in the list.

       The  initial pattern is modified by applying the list of editing instruc&#8208;
       tions specific to patterns found in the configuration; each consists of a
       match  predicate  and  a set of editing operations.  They are executed in
       the order they appeared in the  configuration.   Each  match  causes  the
       associated sequence of editing operations to be applied.

       After  the  pattern  has been edited, a sequence of default substitutions
       are performed to canonicalize  the  set  of  available  properties;  this
       avoids the need for the lower layers to constantly provide default values
       for various font properties during rendering.

       The canonical font pattern  is  finally  matched  against  all  available
       fonts.  The distance from the pattern to the font is measured for each of
       several properties: foundry, charset, family, lang,  spacing,  pixelsize,
       style, slant, weight, antialias, rasterizer and outline.  This list is in
       priority order -- results of comparing  earlier  elements  of  this  list
       weigh more heavily than later elements.

       There  is  one special case to this rule; family names are split into two
       bindings; strong and weak.  Strong family names are given greater  prece&#8208;
       dence  in  the match than lang elements while weak family names are given
       lower precedence than lang elements.  This permits the document  language
       to drive font selection when any document specified font is unavailable.

       The pattern representing that font is augmented to include any properties
       found in the pattern but not found in the font itself; this  permits  the
       application  to pass rendering instructions or any other data through the
       matching system.  Finally, the list of editing instructions  specific  to
       fonts  found in the configuration are applied to the pattern.  This modi&#8208;
       fied pattern is returned to the application.

       The return value contains sufficient information to locate and  rasterize
       the  font,  including the file name, pixel size and other rendering data.
       As none of the information involved pertains  to  the  FreeType  library,
       applications are free to use any rasterization engine or even to take the
       identified font file and access it directly.

       The match/edit sequences in the configuration are performed in two passes
       because  there  are essentially two different operations necessary -- the
       first is to modify how fonts are selected; aliasing families  and  adding
       suitable  defaults.   The  second is to modify how the selected fonts are
       rasterized.  Those must apply to the selected font, not the original pat&#8208;
       tern as false matches will often occur.

   FONT NAMES
       Fontconfig  provides  a  textual  representation  for  patterns  that the
       library can both accept and generate.  The  representation  is  in  three
       parts,  first  a  list  of family names, second a list of point sizes and
       finally a list of additional properties:

            &lt;families&gt;-&lt;point sizes&gt;:&lt;name1&gt;=&lt;values1&gt;:&lt;name2&gt;=&lt;values2&gt;...


       Values in a list are separated with commas.   The  name  needn&apos;t  include
       either  families  or point sizes; they can be elided.  In addition, there
       are symbolic constants that simultaneously indicate both  a  name  and  a
       value.  Here are some examples:

         Name                            Meaning
         ----------------------------------------------------------
         Times-12                        12 point Times Roman
         Times-12:bold                   12 point Times Bold
         Courier:italic                  Courier Italic in the default size
         Monospace:matrix=1 .1 0 1       The users preferred monospace font
                                         with artificial obliquing


       The  &apos;\&apos;, &apos;-&apos;, &apos;:&apos; and &apos;,&apos; characters in family names must be preceded by
       a &apos;\&apos; character to avoid having them  misinterpreted.  Similarly,  values
       containing  &apos;\&apos;,  &apos;=&apos;, &apos;_&apos;, &apos;:&apos; and &apos;,&apos; must also have them preceded by a
       &apos;\&apos; character. The &apos;\&apos; characters are stripped out of the family name and
       values as the font name is read.

DEBUGGING APPLICATIONS
       To help diagnose font and applications problems, fontconfig is built with
       a large amount of internal debugging left enabled. It  is  controlled  by
       means of the FC_DEBUG environment variable. The value of this variable is
       interpreted as a number, and each bit within that value controls  differ&#8208;
       ent debugging messages.

         Name         Value    Meaning
         ---------------------------------------------------------
         MATCH            1    Brief information about font matching
         MATCHV           2    Extensive font matching information
         EDIT             4    Monitor match/test/edit execution
         FONTSET          8    Track loading of font information at startup
         CACHE           16    Watch cache files being written
         CACHEV          32    Extensive cache file writing information
         PARSE           64    (no longer in use)
         SCAN           128    Watch font files being scanned to build caches
         SCANV          256    Verbose font file scanning information
         MEMORY         512    Monitor fontconfig memory usage
         CONFIG        1024    Monitor which config files are loaded
         LANGSET       2048    Dump char sets used to construct lang values
         OBJTYPES      4096    Display message when value typechecks fail


       Add  the  value  of the desired debug levels together and assign that (in
       base 10) to the FC_DEBUG environment variable before running the applica&#8208;
       tion. Output from these statements is sent to stdout.

LANG TAGS
       Each font in the database contains a list of languages it supports.  This
       is computed by comparing the  Unicode  coverage  of  the  font  with  the
       orthography  of  each  language.   Languages are tagged using an RFC-3066
       compatible naming and occur in two parts -- the ISO 639 language tag fol&#8208;
       lowed  a  hyphen  and  then by the ISO 3166 country code.  The hyphen and
       country code may be elided.

       Fontconfig  has  orthographies  for  several  languages  built  into  the
       library.   No  provision  has  been  made  for adding new ones aside from
       rebuilding the library.  It currently supports 122 of the  139  languages
       named  in  ISO 639-1, 141 of the languages with two-letter codes from ISO
       639-2 and another 30 languages with only three-letter  codes.   Languages
       with  both two and three letter codes are provided with only the two let&#8208;
       ter code.

       For languages used in multiple territories with radically different char&#8208;
       acter   sets,  fontconfig  includes  per-territory  orthographies.   This
       includes Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Pashto, Tigrinya and Chinese.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       Configuration files for fontconfig are stored in XML format; this  format
       makes  external configuration tools easier to write and ensures that they
       will generate syntactically correct configuration files.   As  XML  files
       are  plain  text, they can also be manipulated by the expert user using a
       text editor.

       The fontconfig document type definition resides in  the  external  entity
       &quot;fonts.dtd&quot;;  this  is  normally stored in the default font configuration
       directory (/etc/fonts).  Each configuration file should contain the  fol&#8208;
       lowing structure:

            &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
            &lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM &quot;fonts.dtd&quot;&gt;
            &lt;fontconfig&gt;
       ...
            &lt;/fontconfig&gt;


   &lt;FONTCONFIG&gt;
       This  is  the  top level element for a font configuration and can contain
       &lt;dir&gt;, &lt;cache&gt;, &lt;include&gt;, &lt;match&gt; and &lt;alias&gt; elements in any order.

   &lt;DIR&gt;
       This element contains a directory name which will  be  scanned  for  font
       files to include in the set of available fonts.

   &lt;CACHE&gt;
       This element contains a file name for the per-user cache of font informa&#8208;
       tion.  If it starts with &apos;~&apos;, it refers to  a  file  in  the  users  home
       directory.   This file is used to hold information about fonts that isn&apos;t
       present in the per-directory cache files.  It is automatically maintained
       by   the   fontconfig   library.    The   default   for   this   file  is
       ``~/.fonts.cache-&lt;version&gt;&apos;&apos;, where &lt;version&gt; is the  font  configuration
       file version number (currently 2).

   &lt;INCLUDE IGNORE_MISSING= NO&quot;&gt;&quot;
       This  element  contains  the  name of an additional configuration file or
       directory.  If a directory, every file  within  that  directory  starting
       with  an  ASCII  digit  (U+0030  -  U+0039)  and  ending  with the string
       ``.conf&apos;&apos; will be processed in sorted order.  When the  XML  datatype  is
       traversed  by  FcConfigParse,  the  contents  of the file(s) will also be
       incorporated  into  the  configuration  by  passing  the  filename(s)  to
       FcConfigLoadAndParse.  If &apos;ignore_missing&apos; is set to &quot;yes&quot; instead of the
       default &quot;no&quot;, a missing file or directory will elicit no warning  message
       from the library.

   &lt;CONFIG&gt;
       This  element  provides  a  place to consolidate additional configuration
       information.  &lt;config&gt; can contain &lt;blank&gt; and &lt;rescan&gt; elements  in  any
       order.

   &lt;BLANK&gt;
       Fonts  often include &quot;broken&quot; glyphs which appear in the encoding but are
       drawn as blanks on the screen.  Within the &lt;blank&gt;  element,  place  each
       Unicode  characters  which  is  supposed to be blank in an &lt;int&gt; element.
       Characters outside of this set which are drawn as blank  will  be  elided
       from the set of characters supported by the font.

   &lt;RESCAN&gt;
       The  &lt;rescan&gt;  element holds an &lt;int&gt; element which indicates the default
       interval between automatic checks for font configuration changes.   Font&#8208;
       config  will  validate all of the configuration files and directories and
       automatically rebuild the  internal  datastructures  when  this  interval
       passes.

   &lt;SELECTFONT&gt;
       This  element  is  used  to  black/white  list fonts from being listed or
       matched against.  It holds acceptfont and rejectfont elements.

   &lt;ACCEPTFONT&gt;
       Fonts matched by an acceptfont element are &quot;whitelisted&quot;; such fonts  are
       explicitly  included  in  the set of fonts used to resolve list and match
       requests; including them in this list protects them  from  being  &quot;black&#8208;
       listed&quot;  by  a  rejectfont element.  Acceptfont elements include glob and
       pattern elements which are used to match fonts.

   &lt;REJECTFONT&gt;
       Fonts matched by an rejectfont element are &quot;blacklisted&quot;; such fonts  are
       excluded from the set of fonts used to resolve list and match requests as
       if they didn&apos;t exist in the system.  Rejectfont elements include glob and
       pattern elements which are used to match fonts.

   &lt;GLOB&gt;
       Glob  elements  hold  shell-style filename matching patterns (including ?
       and *) which match fonts based on their complete pathnames.  This can  be
       used  to  exclude  a  set of directories (/usr/share/fonts/uglyfont*), or
       particular font file types (*.pcf.gz), but the  latter  mechanism  relies
       rather  heavily  on  filenaming  conventions  which can&apos;t be relied upon.
       Note that globs only apply to directories, not to individual fonts.

   &lt;PATTERN&gt;
       Pattern elements perform list-style matching on incoming fonts; that  is,
       they hold a list of elements and associated values.  If all of those ele&#8208;
       ments have a matching value, then the pattern matches the font.  This can
       be  used to select fonts based on attributes of the font (scalable, bold,
       etc), which is a more reliable  mechanism  than  using  file  extensions.
       Pattern elements include patelt elements.

   &lt;PATELT NAME= PROPERTY&quot;&gt;&quot;
       Patelt  elements  hold a single pattern element and list of values.  They
       must have a &apos;name&apos; attribute which indicates the  pattern  element  name.
       Patelt  elements  include  int, double, string, matrix, bool, charset and
       const elements.

   &lt;MATCH TARGET= PATTERN&quot;&gt;&quot;
       This element holds first a (possibly empty) list of &lt;test&gt;  elements  and
       then  a  (possibly  empty) list of &lt;edit&gt; elements.  Patterns which match
       all of the tests are subjected to all the edits.  If &apos;target&apos; is  set  to
       &quot;font&quot; instead of the default &quot;pattern&quot;, then this element applies to the
       font name resulting from a  match  rather  than  a  font  pattern  to  be
       matched. If &apos;target&apos; is set to &quot;scan&quot;, then this element applies when the
       font is scanned to build the fontconfig database.

   &lt;TEST QUAL= ANY&quot; NAME=&quot;PROPERTY&quot; TARGET=&quot;DEFAULT&quot; COMPARE=&quot;EQ&quot;&gt;&quot;
       This element contains a single value which is compared  with  the  target
       (&apos;pattern&apos;,  &apos;font&apos;, &apos;scan&apos; or &apos;default&apos;) property &quot;property&quot; (substitute
       any of the property names seen above). &apos;compare&apos;  can  be  one  of  &quot;eq&quot;,
       &quot;not_eq&quot;,  &quot;less&quot;, &quot;less_eq&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, or &quot;more_eq&quot;.  &apos;qual&apos; may either be
       the default, &quot;any&quot;, in which case the match succeeds if any value associ&#8208;
       ated  with  the  property matches the test value, or &quot;all&quot;, in which case
       all of the values associated with the property must match the test value.
       When  used  in  a &lt;match target=&quot;font&quot;&gt; element, the target= attribute in
       the &lt;test&gt; element selects between matching the original pattern  or  the
       font.   &quot;default&quot;  selects whichever target the outer &lt;match&gt; element has
       selected.

   &lt;EDIT NAME= PROPERTY&quot; MODE=&quot;ASSIGN&quot; BINDING=&quot;WEAK&quot;&gt;&quot;
       This element contains a list of expression elements (any of the value  or
       operator  elements).   The  expression elements are evaluated at run-time
       and modify the property &quot;property&quot;.  The modification depends on  whether
       &quot;property&quot;  was  matched by one of the associated &lt;test&gt; elements, if so,
       the modification may affect the first matched value.  Any values inserted
       into  the  property  are given the indicated binding (&quot;strong&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; or
       &quot;same&quot;) with &quot;same&quot; binding using the value from the matched pattern ele&#8208;
       ment.  &apos;mode&apos; is one of:

         Mode                    With Match              Without Match

       These  elements  hold  a single value of the indicated type.  &lt;bool&gt; ele&#8208;
       ments hold either true or false.  An important limitation exists  in  the
       parsing  of  floating  point numbers -- fontconfig requires that the man&#8208;
       tissa start with a digit, not a decimal point, so insert a  leading  zero
       for purely fractional values (e.g. use 0.5 instead of .5 and -0.5 instead
       of -.5).

   &lt;MATRIX&gt;
       This element holds the four &lt;double&gt; elements of  an  affine  transforma&#8208;
       tion.

   &lt;RANGE&gt;
       This element holds the two &lt;int&gt; elements of a range representation.

   &lt;CHARSET&gt;
       This element holds at least one &lt;int&gt; element of an Unicode code point or
       more.

   &lt;LANGSET&gt;
       This element holds at least one &lt;string&gt; element of a RFC-3066-style lan&#8208;
       guages or more.
&#12;   &lt;NAME&gt;
       Holds a property name.  Evaluates to the first value from the property of
       the font, not the pattern.

   &lt;CONST&gt;
       Holds the name of a constant; these are always integers and serve as sym&#8208;
       bolic names for common font values:

   &lt;OR&gt;, &lt;AND&gt;, &lt;PLUS&gt;, &lt;MINUS&gt;, &lt;TIMES&gt;, &lt;DIVIDE&gt;
       These  elements  perform  the specified operation on a list of expression
       elements.  &lt;or&gt; and &lt;and&gt; are boolean, not bitwise.

   &lt;EQ&gt;, &lt;NOT_EQ&gt;, &lt;LESS&gt;, &lt;LESS_EQ&gt;, &lt;MORE&gt;, &lt;MORE_EQ&gt;
       These elements compare two values, producing a boolean result.

   &lt;NOT&gt;
       Inverts the boolean sense of its one expression element

   &lt;IF&gt;
       This element takes three expression elements; if the value of  the  first
       is  true,  it produces the value of the second, otherwise it produces the
       value of the third.

   &lt;ALIAS&gt;
       Alias elements provide a shorthand notation for the set of  common  match
       operations  needed  to substitute one font family for another.  They con&#8208;
       tain a &lt;family&gt; element  followed  by  optional  &lt;prefer&gt;,  &lt;accept&gt;  and
       &lt;default&gt;  elements.   Fonts  matching the &lt;family&gt; element are edited to
       prepend the list of &lt;prefer&gt;ed families  before  the  matching  &lt;family&gt;,
       append  the  &lt;accept&gt;able families after the matching &lt;family&gt; and append
       the &lt;default&gt; families to the end of the family list.

   &lt;FAMILY&gt;
       Holds a single font family name

   &lt;PREFER&gt;, &lt;ACCEPT&gt;, &lt;DEFAULT&gt;
       These hold a list of &lt;family&gt; elements to be used by the &lt;alias&gt; element.

FILES
       fonts.conf  contains configuration information for the fontconfig library
       consisting of directories to look at for  font  information  as  well  as
       instructions on editing program specified font patterns before attempting
       to match the available fonts.  It is in XML format.

       conf.d is the conventional name for a directory of additional  configura&#8208;
       tion  files  managed by external applications or the local administrator.
       The filenames starting with decimal digits are  sorted  in  lexicographic
       order and used as additional configuration files.  All of these files are
       in XML format.  The master fonts.conf file references this  directory  in
       an &lt;include&gt; directive.

       fonts.dtd is a DTD that describes the format of the configuration files.

       ~/.fonts.conf.d  is  the  conventional  name  for a per-user directory of
       (typically auto-generated) configuration files, although the actual loca&#8208;
       tion is specified in the global fonts.conf file.

       ~/.fonts.conf  is  the conventional location for per-user font configura&#8208;
       tion, although the actual location is specified in the global  fonts.conf
       file.

        ~/.fonts.cache-* is the conventional repository of font information that
       isn&apos;t found in the per-directory  caches.   This  file  is  automatically
       maintained by fontconfig.
