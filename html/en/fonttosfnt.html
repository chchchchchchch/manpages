FONTTOSFNT(1)                                                      FONTTOSFNT(1)



NAME
       fonttosfnt - Wrap a bitmap font in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       fonttosfnt [ options ] -o file.ttf [ -- ] font...

DESCRIPTION
       Wrap  a bitmap font or a set of bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType or Open&#8208;
       Type) wrapper.

OPTIONS
       -v     Be verbose.

       -c     Do not crop glyphs.  This usually increases  file  size,  but  may
              sometimes yield a modest decrease in file size for small character
              cell fonts (terminal fonts).

       -b     Write byte-aligned glyph data.   By  default,  unaligned  data  is
              written, which yields a smaller file size.

       -r     Do not reencode fonts.  By default, fonts are reencoded to Unicode
              whenever possible.

       -g n   Set the type of scalable glyphs that we write.   If  n  is  0,  no
              scalable  glyphs are written; this is legal but confuses most cur&#8208;
              rent software.  If n is 1, a single scalable glyph (the  undefined
              glyph) is written; this is recommended, but triggers a bug in cur&#8208;
              rent versions of FreeType.  If n is  2  (the  default),  a  suffi&#8208;
              ciently  high number of blank glyphs are written, which works with
              FreeType but increases file size.

       -m n   Set the type of scalable metrics that we write.  If  n  is  0,  no
              scalable metrics are written, which may or may not be legal.  If n
              is 1, full metrics for a single glyph are written, and  only  left
              sidebearing  values  are written for the other glyphs.  If n is 2,
              scalable metrics for all glyphs are written, which increases  file
              size and is not recommended.  The default is 1.

       --     End of options.

BUGS
       Some  of  the  font-level values, notably sub- and superscript positions,
       are dummy values.
