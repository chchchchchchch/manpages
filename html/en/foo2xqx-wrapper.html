NAME
       foo2xqx-wrapper - Convert Postscript into a XQX printer stream

SYNOPSIS
       foo2xqx-wrapper [options] [ps-file]

DESCRIPTION
       foo2xqx-wrapper  is a Foomatic compatible printer wrapper for the foo2xqx
       printer driver.  This script reads a Postscript ps-file or standard input
       and  converts  it  to  XQX  printer  format  for  driving the HP LaserJet
       P1005/P1006/P1007/P1008, the HP LaserJet P1505, the  HP  LaserJet  P2014,
       the HP LaserJet M1005 MFP, the HP LaserJet M1120 MFP, and other XQX-based
       printers.

       This script can be used in a standalone fashion, but is  intended  to  be
       called  from  a  printer  spooler  system which uses the Foomatic printer
       database.

   Printer Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to customize the operation of  foo2xqx  for  a
       particular printer.

       -u xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the start of the printable region from the upper
              left corner, in pixels [varies with  paper  size].   The  defaults
              should  work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on
              any other printers.

       -l xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the end of the printable region from  the  lower
              right  corner,  in  pixels [varies with paper size].  The defaults
              should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested  on
              any other printers.

       -L mask
              Send  the  logical  clipping  values  from  -u/-l in the ZjStream.
              foo2xqx-wrapper always runs Ghostscript with the ideal page dimen&#8208;
              sions,  so  that  the  scale  of  the image is correct, regardless
              whether or not the printer has unprintable regions.   This  option
              is used to move the position of the clipped image back to where it
              belongs on the page.  The default is to send the amount which  was
              clipped by -u and -l, and should be good in most cases.

              l  l.  0    don&apos;t send any logical clipping amounts 1    only send
              Y clipping amount 2    only send X clipping amount 3    send  both
              X and Y clipping amounts

   Debugging Options
       These options are used for debugging foo2xqx and its wrapper.

       -D level
              Set Debug level [0].


EXAMPLES
       Create  a monochrome ZjStream from a Postscript document, examine it, and
       then print it using a RAW print queue:

              foo2xqx-wrapper testpage.ps &gt; testpage.xqx
              xqxdecode &lt; testpage.xqx
              lpr -P raw testpage.xqx
