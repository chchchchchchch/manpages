       foomatic-configure  -  the  main  configuration  program  of the foomatic
       printing system.

SYNOPSIS
       foomatic-configure [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-configure  is a program to set up and configure print queues for
       every known spooler (CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ. CPS, no spooler)
       and  every  valid  printer/driver combo in the Foomatic database or every
       PPD file coming with PostScript printers. As  RIP  filter  (Raster  Image
       Processor,  translation  from  PostScript  to  the native language of the
       printer) always foomatic-rip(1) will be used, except  for  PPD  files  of
       PostScript printers under CUPS or PPR, they will be used without RIP fil&#8208;
       ter.

       It also comprises half of a programatic API for user tools: you can learn
       and  control everything about the static properties of print queues here.
       With the sister  program  foomatic-printjob(1),  you  can  do  everything
       related  to the print queue&apos;s dynamic state: submit jobs, and query, can&#8208;
       cel, reorder, and redirect them.


   Options
       -n queuename
                 Configure this print queue

       -N Name/Description
                 Use this proper human-readable name/description

       -L Location
                 Short phrase describing this printer&apos;s location

       -c connection
                 Printer is connected thusly (ex file:/dev/lp0)

       -d driver Foomatic database name for desired printer driver

       -p printer
                 Foomatic id for printer
&#12;       --ppd ppdfile
                 PPD file, for example the one supplied by the manufacturer of a
                 PostScript printer

       -s spooler
                 Explicit spooler type (cups, lpd, lprng, pdq, ppr, direct)

       -o option=value
                 Set the default of option to value

       -o option Turn on option by default

       -D        Set this queue as the default queue (just give -n queuename)

       -R        Remove this whole queue entirely (just give -n queuename)

       -C [ sourcespooler ] sourcequeue
                 Copy  sourcequeue  from  sourcespooler  (or  the current one if
                 sourcespooler is not given) into the queue given by  -n  queue&#8208;
                 name (of the current spooler).

       -Q        Query existing configuration (gives XML summary)

       -r        List also remotely defined queues (CUPS only)

       -P [ index ]
                 Get  Perl  dump of current configuration (as a Perl array named
                 QUEUES, the first index is index,  or  zero  if  index  is  not
                 given)

       -O        Print  XML  Overview  of  all known printer/drivers (this shows
                 also the Foomatic IDs of the printers)

       -X        Print XML data for -p printer and/or -d driver object

       -q        Run quietly



   Commands
       No commands, just options

BUGS
       foomatic-configure  currently  cannot  handle printcap files in the lprng
       style.  As lprng can use BSD style printcaps this is not much of a  prob&#8208;
       lem,  as  long as the GUI based print manager lprngtool is not used.  The
       difference between those formats is, that BSD style requires continuation
       lines  in  printer  definitions  to be ended with a colon and the newline
       character to be escaped with a backslash.  Lprng has no such restriction.

       To use a printcap file generated or edited with lprngtool with  foomatic-
       configure  it  is necessary to add :\ to the end of all but the last line
       of every printer definition, just as shown below:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp
       #alternate names
        |lp2|lp3
        |Example of a printer
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100
        :


       must be converted to:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp\
        |lp2|lp3\
        |Example of a printer\
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp:\
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100:
