FOOMATIC-GETPJLOPTIONS(8)                              FOOMATIC-GETPJLOPTIONS(8)



NAME
       foomatic-getpjloptions - &lt;put a short description here&gt;

SYNOPSIS
       foomatic-getpjloptions device

       foomatic-getpjloptions hostname port


DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-getpjloptions Sends a set of PJL commands and reads back the PJL
       options and status from a printer over a  network  connection  or  device
       bidirectional interface such as parallel, USB, serial.  printers to stan&#8208;
       dard output. The output can be piped into foomatic-addpjloptions  to  add
       options to the database.



   Options
       device    The  interface  to  which  a  local  printer is connected, e.g.
                 /dev/lp0, /dev/usb/lp0, /dev/tty00, etc.  For a parallel  port,
                 you  must  have bidirectional support enabled at the BIOS level
                 and the parallel port driver  must  support  the  bidirectional
                 mode.   Check  your  parallel  port  BIOS settings for  EPP/bi-
                 directional mode.


       hostname  Host name or IP address of a  network  printer  (HP  JetDirect,
                 DLINK, etc.).


       port      Port  on  which  your  network printer listens for socket (App&#8208;
                 socket) connections.  Most common ports are  9100  (JetDirect),
                 10000  (DLINK).   Usually you can configure the port via a con&#8208;
                 figuration interface.


EXIT STATUS
       foomatic-getpjloptions returns ???


AUTHOR
       Manfred Wassmann &lt;manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de&gt; for the foomatic  project
       using  output  from  the  associated  binary.  Modified by Patrick Powell
       &lt;papowell at lprng.com&gt; to provide betters support for network  printers,
       error messages, and remove CR and FF from output.


WARNINGS
       Uni-directional protocols as remote LPD are not supported as no status is
       returned.  Some network print servers which attach to a printer  parallel
       port do not support bidirectional mode.
