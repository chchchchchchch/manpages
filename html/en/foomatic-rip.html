DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-rip  is  a  universal  print filter which works with every known
       free software printer spooler. It has the following features:
&#12;       It translates PostScript and PDF (and also other file formats) from stan&#8208;
       dard input to the printer&apos;s native language (usually put to standard out&#8208;
       put).

       The translation is done with an external  renderer,  usually  Ghostscript
       (gs(1)).  If no translation is needed (PostScript printer) the renderer&apos;s
       command line reduces to cat(1). The way how this translation is  done  is
       described in a PPD file.

       Printer  capabilities,  how  to handle user options, and how to build the
       renderer command line is always described by PPD files, these  PPD  files
       usually come from Foomatic or can be the ones supplied by the manufactur&#8208;
       ers of PostScript printers. The PPD files are the same for all spoolers.

       foomatic-rip works with every known spooler (CUPS,  LPRng,  LPD,  GNUlpr,
       PPR,  PDQ,  CPS,  and  without spooler). It auto-detects the spooler from
       which it was called by the command line options and environment variables
       which were supplied by the spooler.

       Non-PostScript/PDF  files  are  translated  to PostScript before they are
       passed to the renderer. This is usually done by a2ps(1), enscript(1),  or
       mpage(1).  foomatic-rip auto-detects which program is installed, but man&#8208;
       ual configuration is also possible.

       foomatic-rip does not only apply option settings  supplied  by  the  user
       through  the  command line of the printing command, but also searches the
       entire job for embedded option settings (only PostScript jobs). Here  not
       only settings which affect the whole job are taken into account, but also
       settings in the page headers, which are only valid  for  the  page  where
       they were found, so applications which produce PostScript code with page-
       specific printer option settings are fully supported.


SPOOLER-LESS PRINTING
   Options
       -v        verbose mode for debugging.  WARNING: This will create  a  file
                 in  /tmp that contains the debugging information.  This opens a
                 security loophole and should not be used in production.


       -q        quiet mode - minimal information output


       -P &lt;printer&gt;
                 &lt;printer&gt; is the configured printer which should  be  used  for
                 this job.


       --ppd &lt;ppdfile&gt;
                 The  PPD  file  &lt;ppdfile&gt; should be applied for processing this
                 job.

       -J &lt;jobtitle&gt;
                 The &lt;jobtitle&gt; will be printed in the head line of  every  page
                 of a plain text job.

       -o &lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
                 Option settings for this job, do

                 foomatic-rip -P &lt;printer&gt; -o docs &lt;file&gt;

                 (&lt;file&gt; can be an arbitrary existing file, as .bashrc, will not
                 be printed) to print a list of available options for the speci&#8208;
                 fied &lt;printer&gt;.

       &lt;files&gt;   The file(s) to be printed.
&#12;
       foomatic-rip  will  print from standard input unless at least one file to
       be printed is specified on the command line.  If your printer PPD file is
       stored  as  /etc/direct/&lt;printer&gt;.ppd or ~/.foomatic/direct/&lt;printer&gt;.ppd
       you can use it by simply specifying &quot;-P &lt;printer&gt;&quot;.

       Put a line

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: &quot;| &lt;command&gt;&quot;

       into the PPD file, right after *PPD-Adobe: &quot;4.3&quot;, where  &lt;command&gt;  is  a
       command  into  which  you  want  to re-direct the output data. Due to the
       restrictions of PPD files &lt;, &gt;, and &quot; are not allowed in  the  &lt;command&gt;,
       replace them as follows:

       Character Replacement
       ---------------------
            &lt;    &amp;lt;
            &gt;    &amp;gt;
            &quot;    &amp;quot;
            &apos;    &amp;apos;
            &amp;    &amp;amp;

       This way you can print directly to your printer, use

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: &quot;| cat &amp;gt; /dev/lp0&quot;

       or

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: &quot;| cat &amp;gt; /dev/usb/lp0&quot;

       for  local  parallel  or USB printers. To make normal users able to print
       this way add them to the group lp and  make  sure  that  the  appropriate
       printer device file /dev/... is group-writable for the lp group.

       for  a  TCP/Socket/JetDirect printer with the host name printer listening
       on port 9100 you need this:

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: &quot;| /usr/bin/nc -w 1 printer 9100&quot;

       Note the &quot;-w  1&quot;  in  the  &quot;nc&quot;  command  line,  it  makes  &quot;nc&quot;  exiting
       immediately after the data is transferred to the printer.

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: &quot;| rlpr -Plp@printserver&quot;

       directs  your  jobs  to  the  LPD  printer  queue lp on the machine named
       printserver.

PRINTING WITH SPOOLER
       See    the    documentation    on    the    OpenPrinting    Web     site:
       http://www.openprinting.org/


CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  file  /etc/foomatic/filter.conf  is  read  whenever  foomatic-rip is
       executed. It allows to configure the behavior of foomatic-rip as  follows
       (lines beginning with # are comments and therefore get ignored):


       textfilter: &lt;command&gt;
                 Selects  the filter for input files which are not PostScript or
                 PDF.  &lt;command&gt; is one of a2ps, enscript, or mpage.   foomatic-
                 rip automatically selects the needed command line options.
&#12;
       debug: 0|1
                 Turns  on  (1) or off (0) the debug mode. This is equivalent to
                 supplying the --debug command line option. Default  setting  is
                 0.


       ps_accounting: 0|1
                 Turns  on  (1)  or  off  (0) inserting PostScript code for page
                 accounting into PostScript jobs. The inserted  PostScript  code
                 makes  Ghostscript  generating  accounting output on stderr and
                 CUPS can this way log each page which  got  printed.  The  code
                 will  only  be inserted if CUPS is the spooler. Default setting
                 is 1.


       echo: [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;executable&gt;
                 Sets the path to an echo(1) executable which supports -n.


       gspath: [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;executable&gt;
                 Sets the path to the Ghostscript (gs(1)) executable. To be used
                 if   Ghostscript  is  at  a  non-standard  location  or  if  an
                 alternative Ghostscript should be used.


       execpath: &lt;path&gt;[:&lt;path&gt;]...
                 Sets the $PATH variable to be used by foomatic-rip.


       cupsfilterpath: &lt;path&gt;[:&lt;path&gt;]...
                 Sets the directories (colon-separated)  in  which  foomatic-rip
                 searches for CUPS filters.


       preferred_shell: [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;executable&gt;
                 Sets    the    preferred    shell   to   use   when   executing
                 FoomaticRIPCommandLine and friends. Several PPD files use shell
                 constructs  that require a more modern shell like bash, zsh, or
                 ksh.
