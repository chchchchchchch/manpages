FORTUNE(6)                    UNIX Reference Manual                   FORTUNE(6)



NAME
       fortune - print a random, hopefully interesting, adage

SYNOPSIS
       fortune [-acefilosuw] [-n length] [ -m pattern] [[n%] file/dir/all]

DESCRIPTION
       When  fortune  is  run  with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.
       Epigrams are divided into several categories, where each category is sub-
       divided  into  those  which are potentially offensive and those which are
       not.

   Options
       The options are as follows:

       -a     Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and not.  (See the
              -o option for more information on offensive fortunes.)

       -c     Show the cookie file from which the fortune came.

       -e     Consider  all  fortune  files  to be of equal size (see discussion
              below on multiple files).

       -f     Print out the list of files which would  be  searched,  but  don&apos;t
              print a fortune.

       -l     Long  dictums  only.   See  -n  on how ``long&apos;&apos; is defined in this
              sense.

       -m pattern
              Print out all fortunes which match the  basic  regular  expression
              pattern.  The syntax of these expressions depends on how your sys&#8208;
              tem defines re_comp(3) or regcomp(3), but it  should  nevertheless
              be similar to the syntax used in grep(1).

              The fortunes are output to standard output, while the names of the
              file from which each fortune comes are printed to standard  error.
              Either or both can be redirected; if standard output is redirected
              to a file, the result is a valid fortunes database file.  If stan&#8208;
              dard  error  is  also redirected to this file, the result is still
              valid, but there will be ``bogus&apos;&apos; fortunes,  i.e.  the  filenames
              themselves,  in  parentheses.   This  can be useful if you wish to
              remove the gathered matches from their original files, since  each
              filename-record will precede the records from the file it names.

       -n length
              Set  the  longest  fortune length (in characters) considered to be
              ``short&apos;&apos; (the default is 160).  All fortunes longer than this are
              considered ``long&apos;&apos;.  Be careful!  If you set the length too short
              and ask for short fortunes, or too long and  ask  for  long  ones,
              fortune goes into a never-ending thrash loop.

       -o     Choose  only  from potentially offensive aphorisms.  The -o option
              is ignored if a fortune directory is specified.

              Please, please, please request a potentially offensive fortune  if
              and  only if you believe, deep in your heart, that you are willing
              to be offended. (And that you&apos;ll just quit using  -o  rather  than
              give us grief about it, okay?)

              ...  let  us  keep  in  mind the basic governing philosophy of The
              Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words:  we  believe
              in  healthy,  hearty laughter -- at the expense of the whole human
              race, if needs be.  Needs be.
                     --H. Allen Smith, &quot;Rude Jokes&quot;

       -s     Short apothegms only.  See -n on  which  fortunes  are  considered
              ``short&apos;&apos;.

       -i     Ignore case for -m patterns.

       -w     Wait  before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
              number of characters in the message.  This is useful if it is exe&#8208;
              cuted  as  part of the logout procedure to guarantee that the mes&#8208;
              sage can be read before the screen is cleared.

       -u     Don&apos;t translate UTF-8 fortunes to the  locale  when  searching  or
              translating.

       The user may specify alternate sayings.  You can specify a specific file,
       a directory which contains one or more files, or  the  special  word  all
       which  says  to use all the standard databases.  Any of these may be pre&#8208;
       ceded by a percentage, which is a number n between 0 and  100  inclusive,
       followed by a %.  If it is, there will be a n percent probability that an
       adage will be picked from that file or directory. If the  percentages  do
       not  sum  to  100,  and there are specifications without percentages, the
       remaining percent will apply to those files and/or directories, in  which
       case the probability of selecting from one of them will be based on their
       relative sizes.

       As an example, given two databases funny and not-funny, with funny  twice
       as big (in number of fortunes, not raw file size), saying

              fortune funny not-funny

       will get you fortunes out of funny two-thirds of the time.  The command

              fortune 90% funny 10% not-funny

       will  pick  out  90% of its fortunes from funny (the ``10% not-funny&apos;&apos; is
       unnecessary, since 10% is all that&apos;s left).

       The -e option says to consider all files equal; thus

              fortune -e funny not-funny

       is equivalent to

              fortune 50% funny 50% not-funny

       This fortune also supports the BSD method of appending ``-o&apos;&apos; to database
       names  to  specify  offensive  fortunes.  However this is not how fortune
       stores them: offensive fortunes are stored in a seperate directory  with&#8208;
       out the ``-o&apos;&apos; infix.  A plain name (i.e., not a path to a file or direc&#8208;
       tory) that ends in ``-o&apos;&apos; will be assumed to be  an  offensive  database,
       and  will  have  its suffix stripped off and be searched in the offensive
       directory (even if the neither of the -a or -o options  were  specified).
       This  feature  is not only for backwards-compatibility, but also to allow
       users to distinguish between inoffensive and offensive databases  of  the
       same name.

       For  example,  assuming there is a database named definitions in both the
       inoffensive and potentially offensive  collections,  then  the  following
       command  will  select  an  inoffensive  definition 90% of the time, and a
       potentially offensive definition for the remaining 10%:

              fortune 90% definitions definitions-o
&#12;FILES
       Note: these are the defaults as defined at compile time.

       /build/buildd-fortune-mod_1.99.1-4-i386-zDHWyn/fortune-
       mod-1.99.1/debian/fortune-mod/usr/share/games/fortunes
              Directory for innoffensive fortunes.
       /build/buildd-fortune-mod_1.99.1-4-i386-zDHWyn/fortune-
       mod-1.99.1/debian/fortune-mod/usr/share/games/fortunes/off
              Directory for offensive fortunes.

       If a particular set of fortunes is particularly  unwanted,  there  is  an
       easy  solution:  delete  the  associated .dat file.  This leaves the data
       intact, should the file later be wanted,  but  since  fortune  no  longer
       finds the pointers file, it ignores the text file.

BUGS
       The  division  of fortunes into offensive and non-offensive by directory,
       rather than via the `-o&apos; file infix, is not 100% compatible with original
       BSD  fortune.  Although  the  `-o&apos; infix is recognised as referring to an
       offensive database, the offensive database files still need to  be  in  a
       separate directory.  The workaround, of course, is to move the `-o&apos; files
       into the offensive directory (with or without renaming), and to  use  the
       -a option.

       The  supplied  fortune  databases have been attacked, in order to correct
       orthographical and grammatical errors, and particularly to reduce  redun&#8208;
       dancy  and  repetition  and  redundancy.  But especially to avoid repeti&#8208;
       tiousness.  This has not been a complete success.  In the  process,  some
       fortunes may also have been lost.

       The  fortune  databases  are  now divided into a larger number of smaller
       files, some organized by format (poetry, definitions), and some  by  con&#8208;
       tent  (religion,  politics).  There are parallel files in the main direc&#8208;
       tory and in the offensive files directory (e.g., fortunes/definitions and
       fortunes/off/definitions).   Not  all  the potentially offensive fortunes
       are in the offensive fortunes files, nor are  all  the  fortunes  in  the
       offensive  files potentially offensive, probably, though a strong attempt
       has been made to achieve greater consistency.  Also,  a  better  division
       might be made.

HISTORY
       This  version  of  fortune is based on the NetBSD fortune 1.4, but with a
       number of bug fixes and enhancements.

       The original fortune/strfile format used a single file; strfile read  the
       text  file  and converted it to null-delimited strings, which were stored
       after the table of pointers in the .dat file.   By  NetBSD  fortune  1.4,
       this had changed to two separate files: the .dat file was only the header
       (the table of pointers, plus flags; see strfile.h), and the text  strings
       were  left  in  their  own file.  The potential problem with this is that
       text file and header file may get out of synch, but the advantage is that
       the text files can be easily edited without resorting to unstr, and there
       is a potential savings in disk space (on the assumption that the sysadmin
       kept both .dat file with strings and the text file).

       Many  of  the  enhancements  made over the NetBSD version assumed a Linux
       system, and thus caused it to fail under other platforms, including  BSD.
       The  source code has since been made more generic, and currently works on
       SunOS 4.x as well as Linux, with support for more platforms  expected  in
       the  future.  Note that some bugs were inadvertently discovered and fixed
       during this process.

       At a guess, a great many people have worked on this program, many without
       leaving attributions.
