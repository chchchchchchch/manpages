FPUTWC(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  FPUTWC(3)



NAME
       fputwc, putwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);
       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the fputc(3)
       function.  It writes the wide character wc to stream.  If  ferror(stream)
       becomes  true,  it  returns  WEOF.   If a wide-character conversion error
       occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Otherwise  it  returns
       wc.

       The  putwc() function or macro functions identically to fputwc().  It may
       be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more than  once.
       There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  fputwc()  function returns wc if no error occurred, or WEOF to indi&#8208;
       cate an error.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ Conversion of wc to the stream&apos;s encoding fails.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of fputwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  current
       locale.

       In  the absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call, it
       is reasonable to expect that fputwc() will actually write  the  multibyte
       sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.
