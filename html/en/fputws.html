FPUTWS(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  FPUTWS(3)



NAME
       fputws - write a wide-character string to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int fputws(const wchar_t *ws, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputws()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the fputs(3)
       function.  It writes the wide-character string starting at ws, up to  but
       not including the terminating null wide character (L&apos;\0&apos;), to stream.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  fputws() function returns a nonnegative integer if the operation was
       successful, or -1 to indicate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of fputws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the  current
       locale.

       In  the absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call, it
       is reasonable to expect that fputws() will actually write  the  multibyte
       string corresponding to the wide-character string ws.
