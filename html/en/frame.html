NAME
       libcaca canvas frame handling -

   Functions
       __extern int caca_get_frame_count (caca_canvas_t const *)
           Get the number of frames in a canvas.
       __extern int caca_set_frame (caca_canvas_t *, int)
           Activate a given canvas frame.
       __extern char const * caca_get_frame_name (caca_canvas_t const *)
           Get the current frame&apos;s name.
       __extern int caca_set_frame_name (caca_canvas_t *, char const *)
           Set the current frame&apos;s name.
       __extern int caca_create_frame (caca_canvas_t *, int)
           Add a frame to a canvas.
       __extern int caca_free_frame (caca_canvas_t *, int)
           Remove a frame from a canvas.

Detailed Description
       These functions provide high level routines for canvas frame insertion,
       removal, copying etc.

Function Documentation
   __extern int caca_get_frame_count (caca_canvas_t const *cv) Return the
       current canvas&apos; frame count.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas

       Returns:
           The frame count

       Referenced by caca_set_canvas_boundaries().

   __extern int caca_set_frame (caca_canvas_t *cv, intid) Set the active canvas
       frame. All subsequent drawing operations will be performed on that frame.
       The current painting context set by caca_set_attr() is inherited.
       If the frame index is outside the canvas&apos; frame range, nothing happens.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EINVAL Requested frame is out of range.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas
           id The canvas frame to activate

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

       Referenced by caca_set_canvas_boundaries().

   __extern char const* caca_get_frame_name (caca_canvas_t const *cv) Return the
       current frame&apos;s name. The returned string is valid until the frame is
       deleted or caca_set_frame_name() is called to change the frame name
       again.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas.

       Returns:
           The current frame&apos;s name.

   __extern int caca_set_frame_name (caca_canvas_t *cv, char const *name) Set
       the current frame&apos;s name. Upon creation, a frame has a default name of
       &apos;frame#xxxxxxxx&apos; where xxxxxxxx is a self-incrementing hexadecimal
       number.
       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate new frame.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas.
           name The name to give to the current frame.

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

   __extern int caca_create_frame (caca_canvas_t *cv, intid) Create a new frame
       within the given canvas. Its contents and attributes are copied from the
       currently active frame.
       The frame index indicates where the frame should be inserted. Valid
       values range from 0 to the current canvas frame count. If the frame index
       is greater than or equals the current canvas frame count, the new frame
       is appended at the end of the canvas. If the frame index is less than
       zero, the new frame is inserted at index 0.

       The active frame does not change, but its index may be renumbered due to
       the insertion.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate new frame.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas
           id The index where to insert the new frame

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

   __extern int caca_free_frame (caca_canvas_t *cv, intid) Delete a frame from a
       given canvas.
       The frame index indicates the frame to delete. Valid values range from 0
       to the current canvas frame count minus 1. If the frame index is greater
       than or equals the current canvas frame count, the last frame is deleted.

       If the active frame is deleted, frame 0 becomes the new active frame.
       Otherwise, the active frame does not change, but its index may be
       renumbered due to the deletion.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EINVAL Requested frame is out of range, or attempt to delete the last
         frame of the canvas.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas
           id The index of the frame to delete

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.
