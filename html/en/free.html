NAME
       free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

SYNOPSIS
       free [options]

DESCRIPTION
       free  displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory
       in the system, as well as the buffers used by  the  kernel.   The  shared
       memory column should be ignored; it is obsolete.

OPTIONS
       -b, --bytes
              Display the amount of memory in bytes.

       -k, --kilo
              Display the amount of memory in kilobytes.  This is the default.

       -m, --mega
              Display the amount of memory in megabytes.

       -g, --giga
              Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.

       --tera Display the amount of memory in terabytes.

       -h, --human
              Show  all  output  fields  automatically  scaled to shortest three
              digit unit and display the units of print  out.   Following  units
              are used.

                B = bytes
                K = kilos
                M = megas
                G = gigas
                T = teras

              If unit is missing, and you have petabyte of RAM or swap, the num&#8208;
              ber is in terabytes and columns might not be aligned with header.

       -c, --count count
              Display the result count times.  Requires the -s option.

       -l, --lohi
              Show detailed low and high memory statistics.

       -o, --old
              Display the output in old format, the only difference  being  this
              option will disable the display of the &quot;buffer adjusted&quot; line.

       -s, --seconds seconds
              Continuously  display  the  result  delay  seconds apart.  You may
              actually specify any floating point number for delay, usleep(3) is
              used for microsecond resolution delay times.

       --si   Use power of 1000 not 1024.

       -t, --total
              Display a line showing the column totals.

       --help Print help.
&#12;       -V, --version
              Display version information.
