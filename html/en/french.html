NAME
       french - a list of french words

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/share/dict/french is an ASCII file which contains an alphabetic list
       of words, one per line.

FILES
       /etc/alternatives/dictionary    is    a    symbolic     link     to     a
       /usr/share/dict/&lt;language&gt;  file.   /usr/share/dict/words  is  a symbolic
       link to /etc/alternatives/dictionary, and is  the  name  by  which  other
       software  should  refer  to  the  system  word list.  See update-alterna&#8208;
       tives(8) for more information.

       The directory /usr/share/dict can contain word lists for many  languages,
       with name of the language in English, e.g., /usr/share/dict/american-eng&#8208;
       lish and /usr/share/dict/danish contain respectively lists of English and
       Danish  words  if  they  exist.  Such lists should be coded using the ISO
       8859-1 character set encoding.

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
       The words lists are not specific, and may be generated from any number of
       sources.
