NAME
     from &#8212; print names of those who have sent mail

SYNOPSIS
     from [-c] [-f file] [-s sender] [user]

DESCRIPTION
     The from utility prints out the mail header lines from the invoker&apos;s mail&#8208;

     The following options are available:

     -c      Just print a count of messages and exit.

     -f file
             The supplied file is examined instead of the invoker&apos;s mailbox.  If
             the -f option is used, the user argument should not be used.  Read
             from standard input if file name &#8220;-&#8221; is given.

     -s sender
             Only mail from addresses containing the supplied string are
             printed.

     If user is given, the user&apos;s mailbox is examined instead of the invoker&apos;s
     own mailbox.  (Privileges are required.)

             default in /var/mail is used.
