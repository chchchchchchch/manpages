FRONTEND-SPEC(7)                                                FRONTEND-SPEC(7)



NAME
       frontend-spec - interface between jw and its frontends

DESCRIPTION
       jw(1) calls frontends like frontends/docbook to get the informations spe&#8208;
       cific to a given input format. The frontend knows  which  information  to
       return  from the first command line parameter. It gets all necessary data
       via environment variables ready to use.

       This document describes that command line parameter and those environment
       variables.

       The  frontend  should return 0 if there weren&apos;t any problem, and return a
       positive value otherwise.

VARIABLES
                 $1
              The  command  line  parameter,  specifying  which  information  to
              return. It can take the following values:

              centralized-catalog
                     The frontend must return the DTD-specific centralized cata&#8208;
                     log  name.   Centralized  catalogs   normally   reside   in
                     /etc/sgml and provide the location of all the catalog files
                     useful for handling this input type (the  catalog  for  the
                     DTD,  the  catalog for the stylesheets, the catalog for the
                     entities, ...)

              style-sheet
                     The frontend must return the filename of the style sheet to
                     be used for this document type and with the chosen backend.

                 SGML_CATALOGS_DIR
              The  directory  where  the centralized catalogs reside. It is nor&#8208;
              mally /etc/sgml.

              (This variable is valid only  while  determining  the  centralized
              catalog to use.)

                 SGML_BASE_DIR
              The   base   directory   of   the  SGML  system.  It  is  normally
              /usr/share/sgml.

              (This variable is valid only while determining the style sheet  to
              use.)

                 SGML_FILE
              The name of the file to convert.

              (This  variable  is  valid  only while determining the centralized
              catalog to use.)

                 SGML_TYPE
              The type of the backend to use, whether it produces  output  files
              to  be  displayed  online  or  to be printed out.  It can take the
              value html or print.

              (This variable is valid only while determining the style sheet  to
              use).

                 SGML_STYLESHEETS
              The  desired  custom  stylesheet type, either none or default.  If
              none, the frontend must return the file name of  the  style  sheet
              provided by the system beneath the docbook-utils.  If default, the
              frontend must return the custom stylesheet provided  by  the  doc&#8208;
              book-utils.

              (This  variable is valid only while determining the style sheet to
              use).

                 SGML_XML
              The metalanguage of the file to convert, either sgml or xml.

              (This variable is valid only  while  determining  the  centralized
              catalog to use).
