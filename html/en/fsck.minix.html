FSCK(8)                       System Administration                      FSCK(8)



NAME
       fsck.minix - check consistency of Minix filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.minix [-larvsmf] device

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.minix  performs  a consistency check for the Linux MINIX filesystem.
       The current version supports the 14 character and 30  character  filename
       options.

       The  program  assumes the filesystem is quiescent.  fsck.minix should not
       be used on a mounted device unless you can be sure nobody is  writing  to
       it  (and  remember  that  the kernel can write to it when it searches for
       files).

       The device name will usually have the following form:
              /dev/hda[1-63] (IDE disk 1)
              /dev/hdb[1-63] (IDE disk 2)
              /dev/sda[1-15] (SCSI disk 1)
              /dev/sdb[1-15] (SCSI disk 2)

       If the filesystem was changed  (i.e.,  repaired),  then  fsck.minix  will
       print &quot;FILE SYSTEM HAS CHANGED&quot; and will sync(2) three times before exit&#8208;
       ing.  Since Linux does not currently have raw devices, there is  no  need
       to reboot at this time.

WARNING
       fsck.minix  should not be used on a mounted filesystem.  Using fsck.minix
       on a mounted filesystem is very dangerous, due to  the  possibility  that
       deleted files are still in use, and can seriously damage a perfectly good
       filesystem!  If you absolutely  have  to  run  fsck.minix  on  a  mounted
       filesystem  (i.e.,  the root filesystem), make sure nothing is writing to
       the disk, and that no files are &quot;zombies&quot; waiting for deletion.

OPTIONS
       -l     List all filenames.

       -r     Perform interactive repairs.

       -a     Perform automatic repairs.  (This option implies -r and serves  to
              answer  all  of  the questions asked with the default.)  Note that
              this can be extremely dangerous in the case of extensive  filesys&#8208;
              tem damage.

       -v     Be verbose.

       -s     Output super-block information.

       -m     Activate MINIX-like &quot;mode not cleared&quot; warnings.

       -f     Force  a  filesystem  check  even  if the filesystem was marked as
              valid (this marking is done by the kernel when the  filesystem  is
              unmounted).

SEE ALSO
       fsck(8),     fsck.ext(8),     fsck.ext2(8),    fsck.xiafs(8),    mkfs(8),
       mkfs.minix(8), mkfs.ext(8), mkfs.ext2(8), mkfs.xiafs(8), reboot(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
       There are numerous diagnostic messages.  The ones mentioned here are  the
       most commonly seen in normal usage.

       If the device does not exist, fsck.minix will print &quot;unable to read super
       block&quot;.  If the device exists, but is not a MINIX filesystem,  fsck.minix
       will print &quot;bad magic number in super-block&quot;.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code returned by fsck.minix is the sum of the following:

       0      No errors

       3      Filesystem errors corrected, system should be rebooted if filesys&#8208;
              tem was mounted

       4      Filesystem errors left uncorrected

       8      Operational error

       16     Usage or syntax error

       In point of fact, only 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 16 can ever be returned.
