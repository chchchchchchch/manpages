NAME
       fsck.nfs - Dummy fsck.nfs script that always returns success.

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.nfs

DESCRIPTION
       Debian GNU/Linux need this for when the root file system is on NFS: there
       is no way to find out if root is NFS mounted and we really want to  do  a
       &quot;fsck -a /&quot;.

EXIT CODE
       The  exit  code  returned by mount.nfs is always zero, meaning successful
       completion.

SEE ALSO
       fsck(8), fstab(5).
