fsck.xfs(8)                                                          fsck.xfs(8)



NAME
       fsck.xfs - do nothing, successfully

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.xfs [ filesys ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.xfs  is  called  by  the generic Linux fsck(8) program at startup to
       check and repair an XFS filesystem.  XFS is a journaling  filesystem  and
       performs recovery at mount(8) time if necessary, so fsck.xfs simply exits
       with a zero exit status.

       If you wish to check the consistency of an XFS filesystem,  or  repair  a
       damaged or corrupt XFS filesystem, see xfs_check(8) and xfs_repair(8).

FILES
       /etc/fstab.

SEE ALSO
       fsck(8), fstab(5), xfs(5), xfs_check(8), xfs_repair(8).
