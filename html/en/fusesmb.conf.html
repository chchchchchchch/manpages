FUSESMB.CONF(5)                                                  FUSESMB.CONF(5)



NAME
       fusesmb.conf - the configuration file for fusesmb


FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the
       name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next  sec&#8208;
       tion begins. Sections contain parameters of the form: name = value.

       The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents
       either a comment, a section name or a parameter.

       Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.

       Only the first equals sign in  a  parameter  is  significant.  Whitespace
       before  or  after  the first equals sign is discarded.  Leading, trailing
       and internal whitespace in section and  parameter  names  is  irrelevant.
       Leading  and   trailing   whitespace  in  a parameter value is discarded.
       Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim.

       Any  line beginning with a semicolon (``;&apos;&apos;) or a hash (``#&apos;&apos;)  character
       is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.


SPECIAL SECTIONS
       fusesmb.conf can contain the following sections:

       The [global] section
              Section for global parameters.

       The [ignore] section
              Section  for  specifying servers and/or workgroups that should not
              be listed.

       The [/SERVER] section
              Section for server-specific  settings.  The  section  name  should
              start with a slash ``/&apos;&apos; and not end with a slash.

       The [/SERVER/SHARE]
              Section for share-specific settings. The section name should start
              with a slash followed by the server name followed by a slash  end&#8208;
              ing on the share name. It should not end with a slash.


EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER
       This chapter explains each possible option. The section names - specified
       between parentheses after each option - shows the applicable sections for
       this option. For example: ( [global] ) specifies that this option is only
       possible for the section [global].

       ignore ( [/SERVER] )
              Ignore this server. Possible values are: true, false, 1 and 0.

              Example: ignore = true

       interval ( [global] )
              Interval for scanning the network for shares. Value  is  a  number
              that  specifies  the  network scanning interval in minutes. If the
              value is smaller or equal to zero the network is not scanned.

              Example: interval = 20
&#12;       password ( [global], [/SERVER], [/SERVER/SHARE] )
              Password. Value is string containing the password.

              Example: password = secret

       servers ( [ignore] )
              Servers to ignore. Value is each server to ignore separated  by  a
              comma.

              Example: servers = SERVER1, SERVER2, SERVER3


       showhiddenshares ( [global], [/SERVER] )
              Show hidden shares. Possible values are: true, false, 1 and 0.

              Example: showhiddenshares = false


       timeout ( [global] )
              Connection timeout in seconds. A server after this timeout is con&#8208;
              sidered offline. Values smaller than 2 seconds are ignored.

              Example: timeout = 10


       username ( [global], [/SERVER], [/SERVER/SHARE] )
              Username. Value is string containing the username.

              Example: username = johndoe


       workgroups ( [ignore] )
              Workgroups to ignore. Value is each workgroup to ignore  separated
              by a comma.

              Example: workgroups = WORKGROUP1, WORKGROUP2

       username=user
       password=totallysecret

       ; List hidden shares
       showhiddenshares=true

       ; Connection timeout in seconds
       timeout = 10

       ;Interval for updating new shares in minutes
       interval = 10

       ; Section for servers and/or workgroups to ignore
