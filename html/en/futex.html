FUTEX(7)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   FUTEX(7)



NAME
       futex - fast user-space locking

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       The Linux kernel provides futexes (&quot;Fast user-space mutexes&quot;) as a build&#8208;
       ing block for fast user-space locking and semaphores.  Futexes  are  very
       basic and lend themselves well for building higher level locking abstrac&#8208;
       tions such as POSIX mutexes.

       This page does not set out to document all design decisions but restricts
       itself  to issues relevant for application and library development.  Most
       programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but  instead  rely
       on  system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementa&#8208;
       tion.

       A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can  be  shared  between
       different  processes.   In  these  different  processes, it need not have
       identical addresses.  In its bare form, a futex has semaphore  semantics;
       it  is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically; pro&#8208;
       cesses can wait for the value to become positive.

       Futex operation is entirely user space for the  noncontended  case.   The
       kernel  is  only  involved  to arbitrate the contended case.  As any sane
       design will strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this
       situation.

       In  its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is only touched by
       atomic assembler instructions.  Processes can share  this  integer  using
       mmap(2),  via  shared memory segments or because they share memory space,
       in which case the application is commonly called multithreaded.

   Semantics
       Any futex operation starts in user space, but it may necessary to  commu&#8208;
       nicate with the kernel using the futex(2) system call.

       To  &quot;up&quot;  a  futex,  execute  the proper assembler instructions that will
       cause the host CPU to atomically increment the integer.  Afterward, check
       if  it has in fact changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no wait&#8208;
       ers and the operation is done.  This is the noncontended  case  which  is
       fast and should be common.

       In  the  contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter from -1
       (or some other negative number).  If this is detected, there are waiters.
       User  space  should  now  set the counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to
       wake up any waiters using the FUTEX_WAKE operation.

       Waiting on a futex, to &quot;down&quot; it, is the reverse  operation.   Atomically
       decrement  the  counter  and  check if it changed to 0, in which case the
       operation is done and the futex was uncontended.  In  all  other  circum&#8208;
       stances,  the  process  should set the counter to -1 and request that the
       kernel wait for another process to up the futex.  This is done using  the
       FUTEX_WAIT operation.

       The  futex(2)  system  call can optionally be passed a timeout specifying
       how long the kernel should wait for the futex to be upped.  In this case,
       semantics are more complex and the programmer is referred to futex(2) for
       more details.  The same holds for asynchronous futex waiting.

VERSIONS
       Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different seman&#8208;
       tics  from  those  described above.  Current semantics are available from
       Linux 2.5.40 onward.

NOTES
       To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy to use abstraction
       for  end-users.  Implementors are expected to be assembly literate and to
       have read the sources of the futex user-space library referenced below.

       This man page illustrates the most common use of the futex(2) primitives:
       it is by no means the only one.
