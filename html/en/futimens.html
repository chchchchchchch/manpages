DESCRIPTION
       utimensat()  and futimens() update the timestamps of a file with nanosec&#8208;
       ond  precision.   This  contrasts  with  the  historical   utime(2)   and
       utimes(2),  which  permit  only second and microsecond precision, respec&#8208;
       tively, when setting file timestamps.

       With utimensat() the file is specified via the pathname  given  in  path&#8208;
       name.   With  futimens()  the  file whose timestamps are to be updated is
       specified via an open file descriptor, fd.

       For both calls, the new file timestamps are specified in the array times:
       times[0] specifies the new &quot;last access time&quot; (atime); times[1] specifies
       the new &quot;last modification time&quot; (mtime).  Each of the elements of  times
       specifies  a  time  as  the  number  of seconds and nanoseconds since the
       Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  This information is conveyed  in
       a structure of the following form:

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;        /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
           };

       Updated  file  timestamps  are set to the greatest value supported by the
       file system that is not greater than the specified time.

       If the tv_nsec field of one of the timespec structures  has  the  special
       value UTIME_NOW, then the corresponding file timestamp is set to the cur&#8208;
       rent time.  If the tv_nsec field of one of the  timespec  structures  has
       the  special  value  UTIME_OMIT, then the corresponding file timestamp is
       left unchanged.  In both of these cases, the value of  the  corresponding
       tv_sec field is ignored.

       If times is NULL, then both timestamps are set to the current time.

   Permissions requirements
       To  set both file timestamps to the current time (i.e., times is NULL, or
       both tv_nsec fields specify UTIME_NOW), either:

       1. the caller must have write access to the file;

       2. the caller&apos;s effective user ID must match the owner of the file; or

       3. the caller must have appropriate privileges.

       To make any change other than setting both timestamps to the current time
       (i.e.,  times  is not NULL, and both tv_nsec fields are not UTIME_NOW and
       both tv_nsec fields are not UTIME_OMIT), either condition 2  or  3  above
       must apply.

       If  both  tv_nsec fields are specified as UTIME_OMIT, then no file owner&#8208;
       ship or permission checks are performed, and the file timestamps are  not
       modified, but other error conditions may still be detected.

   utimensat() specifics
       If  pathname  is  relative, then by default it is interpreted relative to
       the directory referred to by the open file descriptor, dirfd (rather than
       relative  to  the current working directory of the calling process, as is
       done by utimes(2) for a relative pathname).  See openat(2) for an  expla&#8208;
       nation of why this can be useful.

       If  pathname  is  relative  and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then
       pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory of  the
       calling process (like utimes(2)).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

       The  flags  field  is  a bit mask that may be 0, or include the following
       constant, defined in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
              If pathname specifies a symbolic link, then update the  timestamps
              of the link, rather than the file to which it refers.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  utimensat()  and  futimens()  return  0.   On  error, -1 is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES times is NULL, or both tv_nsec values are UTIME_NOW, and:
              * the effective user ID of the caller does not match the owner  of
                the file, the caller does not have write access to the file, and
                the caller is not privileged (Linux: does not  have  either  the
                CAP_FOWNER or the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability); or,
              * the file is marked immutable (see chattr(1)).

       EBADF  (futimens()) fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EBADF  (utimensat())  pathname  is a relative pathname, but dirfd is nei&#8208;
              ther AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT times pointed to an invalid address; or, dirfd was  AT_FDCWD,  and
              pathname is NULL or an invalid address.

       EINVAL Invalid value in flags.

       EINVAL Invalid  value in one of the tv_nsec fields (value outside range 0
              to 999,999,999, and not UTIME_NOW or UTIME_OMIT);  or  an  invalid
              value in one of the tv_sec fields.

       EINVAL pathname  is  NULL,  dirfd  is  not  AT_FDCWD,  and flags contains
              AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW.

       ELOOP  (utimensat()) Too many symbolic links were encountered in  resolv&#8208;
              ing pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              (utimensat()) pathname is too long.

       ENOENT (utimensat())  A component of pathname does not refer to an exist&#8208;
              ing directory or file, or pathname is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              (utimensat()) pathname is a relative pathname, but dirfd  is  nei&#8208;
              ther  AT_FDCWD nor a file descriptor referring to a directory; or,
              one of the prefix components of pathname is not a directory.

       EPERM  The caller attempted to change one or both timestamps to  a  value
              other than the current time, or to change one of the timestamps to
              the current time while  leaving  the  other  timestamp  unchanged,
              (i.e.,  times  is not NULL, both tv_nsec fields are not UTIME_NOW,
              and both tv_nsec fields are not UTIME_OMIT) and:
              * the caller&apos;s effective user ID does not match the owner of file,
                and  the  caller  is  not  privileged  (Linux: does not have the
                CAP_FOWNER capability); or,
              * the file is marked append-only or immutable (see chattr(1)).

       EROFS  The file is on a read-only file system.

       ESRCH  (utimensat()) Search permission is denied for one  of  the  prefix
              components of pathname.

VERSIONS
       utimensat()  was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.22; glibc support was added
       with version 2.6.

       Support for futimens() first appeared in glibc 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       futimens() and utimensat() are specified in POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       utimensat() obsoletes futimesat(2).

       On Linux, timestamps cannot be changed for a file marked  immutable,  and
       the  only  change  permitted  for  files marked append-only is to set the
       timestamps to the current time.  (This is consistent with the  historical
       behavior of utime(2) and utimes(2) on Linux.)

       On Linux, futimens() is a library function implemented on top of the uti&#8208;
       mensat() system call.  To support this, the Linux utimensat() system call
       implements a nonstandard feature: if pathname is NULL, then the call mod&#8208;
       ifies the timestamps of the file referred to by the file descriptor dirfd
       (which  may  refer  to  any  type of file).  Using this feature, the call
       futimens(fd, times) is implemented as:

           utimensat(fd, NULL, times, 0);

BUGS
       Several bugs afflict utimensat() and futimens() on kernels before 2.6.26.
       These  bugs  are either nonconformances with the POSIX.1 draft specifica&#8208;
       tion or inconsistencies with historical Linux behavior.

       * POSIX.1 specifies that if one of  the  tv_nsec  fields  has  the  value
         UTIME_NOW  or  UTIME_OMIT,  then  the value of the corresponding tv_sec
         field should be ignored.  Instead, the value of  the  tv_sec  field  is
         required to be 0 (or the error EINVAL results).

       * Various  bugs  mean  that  for the purposes of permission checking, the
         case where both tv_nsec  fields  are  set  to  UTIME_NOW  isn&apos;t  always
         treated  the  same  as specifying times as NULL, and the case where one
         tv_nsec value is UTIME_NOW and the other is  UTIME_OMIT  isn&apos;t  treated
         the  same  as  specifying  times as a pointer to an array of structures
         containing arbitrary time values.  As a result, in some cases: a)  file
         timestamps  can  be updated by a process that shouldn&apos;t have permission
         to perform updates; b) file timestamps can&apos;t be updated  by  a  process
         that  should have permission to perform updates; and c) the wrong errno
         value is returned in case of an error.

       * POSIX.1 says that a process that has write access to the file can  make
         a call with times as NULL, or with times pointing to an array of struc&#8208;
         tures in which both tv_nsec fields are UTIME_NOW, in  order  to  update
         both  timestamps  to  the  current  time.   However, futimens() instead
         checks whether the access mode of the file descriptor allows writing.
