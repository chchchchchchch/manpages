DESCRIPTION
       The  fuzzyflakes  program  draws  falling pastel colored snowflake/flower
       shapes.  Inspired by the credits of the anime &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;.

OPTIONS
       fuzzyflakes accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -mono   If on a color display, pretend we&apos;re on a monochrome display.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -delay usecs
               The delay  between  steps  of  the  animation,  in  microseconds.
               Default: 250000.

       -speed int
               How fast, 1-50.  Default 10.

       -arms int
               How many arms on the flakes; default 5.

       -thickness int
               How thick to make the lines; default 10 pixels.

       -bthickness int
               How thick to make the borders; default 3 pixels.

       -radius int
               Radius of the objects; default 20 pixels.

       -layers int
               How many layers of objects; default 3.

       -density int
               Default 5.

       -no-db  Disable double-buffering.

       -color string
               The  base  color  for  the  color scheme.  Typed as a hexadecimal

               both  acceptable.   If  the  saturation  of  you color is too low
               (&lt;0.03) the random color generator will  kick  in.   The  default
               color is #efbea5

               This  enables  the  random  color  generation.  It is disabled by

       -fps    Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

       XENVIRONMENT
