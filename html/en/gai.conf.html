gai.conf(5)                                                          gai.conf(5)



NAME
       gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       A call to getaddrinfo(3) might return multiple answers.  According to RFC
       3484 these answers must be sorted so that the  answer  with  the  highest
       success rate is first in the list.  The RFC provides an algorithm for the
       sorting.  The static rules are not always  adequate,  though.   For  this
       reason the RFC also requires that system administrators get the chance to
       dynamically change the sorting.  For the glibc implementation this can be
       achieved with the /etc/gai.conf file.

       Each line in the configuration file consists of a keyword and its parame&#8208;
       ters.  White spaces in any place are ignored.  Lines  starting  with  `#&apos;
       are comments and are ignored.

       The keywords currently recognized are:

       label netmask precedence
              The  value  is added to the label table used in the RFC 3484 sort&#8208;
              ing.  If any label definition is present in the configuration file
              is  present  the default table is not used.  All the label defini&#8208;
              tions of the default table which are to be maintained have  to  be
              duplicated.   Following the keyword the line has to contain a net&#8208;
              work mask and a label value.


       precedence netmask precedence
              This  keyword is similar to label but instead the value  is  added
              to the precedence table as specified in RFC 3484.  Once again, the
              presence of a single precedence line  in  the  configuration  file
              causes the default table to not be used.


       reload &lt;yes|no&gt;
              This keyword control whether a process checks whether the configu&#8208;
              ration file has been changes since the last time it was read.   If
              the value is `yes&apos; the file is re-read.  This might cause problems
              in multi-threaded applications and is generally a bad  idea.   The
              default is `no&apos;.


       scopev4 mask value
              Add another rule to the RFC 3484 scope table for IPv4 address.  By
              default the scope IDs described in section 3.2  in  RFC  3438  are
              used.  Changing these defaults should hardly ever be necessary.


EXAMPLE
       The  default table according to RFC 3484 would be specified with the fol&#8208;
       lowing configuration file:

       label  ::1/128       0
       label  ::/0          1
       label  2002::/16     2
       label ::/96          3
       label ::ffff:0:0/96  4
       precedence  ::1/128       50
       precedence  ::/0          40
       precedence  2002::/16     30
       precedence ::/96          20
       precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10
