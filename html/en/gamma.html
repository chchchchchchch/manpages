GAMMA(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   GAMMA(3)



NAME
       gamma, gammaf, gammal - (logarithm of the) gamma function

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double gamma(double x);
       float gammaf(float x);
       long double gammal(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       gamma():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
       gammaf(), gammal():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions are deprecated: instead, use either the tgamma(3) or the
       lgamma(3) functions, as appropriate.

       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

   *BSD version
       The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of FreeBSD had  a  gamma()  function
       that computes the Gamma function, as one would expect.

   glibc version
       Glibc has a gamma() function that is equivalent to lgamma(3) and computes
       the natural logarithm of the Gamma function.

RETURN VALUE
       See lgamma(3).

ERRORS
       See lgamma(3).

CONFORMING TO
       Because of historical variations in behavior across systems,  this  func&#8208;
       tion is not specified in any standard.

NOTES
   History
       4.2BSD  had a gamma() that computed ln(|Gamma(|x|)|), leaving the sign of
       Gamma(|x|) in the external integer  signgam.   In  4.3BSD  the  name  was
       changed to lgamma(3), and the man page promises

           &quot;At  some time in the future the name gamma will be rehabilitated and
           used for the Gamma function&quot;

       This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD, where gamma() computes the Gamma  func&#8208;
       tion  (with  no  effect on signgam).  However, this came too late, and we
       now have tgamma(3), the &quot;true gamma&quot; function.
