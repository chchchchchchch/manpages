NAME
       gasp - a preprocessor for assembly programs

SYNOPSIS
       gasp   [-a|--alternate] [-c CHAR | --commentchar CHAR] [-d|--debug]
              [-h|--help] [-M|--mri] [-o OUTFILE | --output OUTFILE]
              [-p|--print] [-s|--copysource] [-u|--unreasonable] [-v|--version]
              INFILE ...

DESCRIPTION
       The primary purpose of the GNU assembler is to  assemble  the  output  of
       other  programs--notably  compilers.  When you have to hand-code special&#8208;
       ized routines in assembly, that means the GNU assembler is an  unfriendly
       processor:  it  has no directives for macros, conditionals, or many other
       conveniences that you might expect.

       In some cases you can simply use the C  preprocessor,  or  a  generalized
       preprocessor like M4; but this can be awkward, since none of these things
       are designed with assembly in mind.

       gasp fills this need.  It is expressly designed to provide the facilities
       you  need with hand-coded assembly code.  Implementing it as a preproces&#8208;
       sor, rather than part of the assembler, allows the  maximum  flexibility:
       you  can  use  it  with  hand-coded assembly, without paying a penalty of
       added complexity in the assembler you use for compiler output.

       INFILE...  are the files to be preprocessed.


OPTIONS
       The simplest way to use GASP is to run it as a filter  and  assemble  its
       output.  In Unix and its ilk, you can do this, for example:

            $ gasp prog.asm | as -o prog.o

       Naturally,  there are also a few command-line options to allow you to re&#8208;
       quest variations on this basic theme.  Here is the full set of possibili&#8208;
       ties for the GASP command line.


       -a

       --alternate
              Use  alternative  macro syntax.  *Note Alternate macro syntax: Al&#8208;
              ternate, for a discussion of how this syntax differs from the  de&#8208;
              fault GASP syntax.


       -c CHAR

       --commentchar CHAR
              Use  CHAR as the comment character.  The default comment character
              is `!&apos;.  For example, to use a semicolon as the comment character,
              specify  `-c  &apos;;&apos;&apos; on the GASP command line.  Since assembler com&#8208;
              mand characters often have special significance to command shells,
              it  is a good idea to quote or escape CHAR when you specify a com&#8208;
              ment character.

              For the sake of simplicity, all examples in this  manual  use  the
              default comment character `!&apos;.
&#12;       -d

       --debug
              Show  debugging  statistics.  In this version of GASP, this option
              produces statistics about the string buffers that  GASP  allocates
              internally.   For each defined buffersize S, GASP shows the number
              of strings N that it allocated, with a line like this:

                   strings size S : N

              GASP displays these statistics on the standard error stream,  when
              done preprocessing.


       -h

       --help Display a summary of the GASP command line options.


       -M

       --mri  Use  MRI compatibility mode.  Using this option causes GASP to ac&#8208;
              cept the syntax and  pseudo-ops  used  by  the  Microtec  Research
              `ASM68K&apos; assembler.


       -o OUTFILE

       --output OUTFILE
              `-o  OUTFILE&apos; `--output OUTFILE&apos; Write the output in a file called
              OUTFILE.  If you do not use the `-o&apos; option, GASP writes its  out&#8208;
              put on the standard output stream.


       -p

       --print
              Print  line  numbers.   GASP  obeys this option _only_ if you also
              specify `-s&apos; to copy source lines to its output.   With  `-s  -p&apos;,
              GASP  displays the line number of each source line copied (immedi&#8208;
              ately after the comment character at the beginning of the line).


       -s

       --copysource
              Copy the source lines to the output file.  Use this option to  see
              the  effect  of  each  preprocessor line on the GASP output.  GASP
              places a comment character (`!&apos; by default) at  the  beginning  of
              each  source  line  it copies, so that you can use this option and
              still assemble the result.


       -u

       --unreasonable
              Bypass &quot;unreasonable expansion&quot; limit.  Since you can define  GASP
              macros  inside  other macro definitions, the preprocessor normally
              includes a sanity check.  If your program requires more than 1,000
              nested expansions, GASP normally exits with an error message.  Use
              this option to turn off this check, allowing unlimited nested  ex&#8208;
              pansions.


       -v
&#12;       --version
              Display the GASP version number.


       INFILE ...
              The  input  file names.  You must specify at least one input file;
              if you specify more, GASP preprocesses them all, concatenating the
              output in the order you list the INFILE arguments.

              Mark  the  end  of  each  input file with the preprocessor command
              `.END&apos;.
