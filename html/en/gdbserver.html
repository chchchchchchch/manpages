NAME
       gdbserver - Remote Server for the GNU Debugger

SYNOPSIS
       gdbserver
              tty prog [args...]

       gdbserver tty --attach PID

DESCRIPTION
       GDBSERVER  is a program that allows you to run GDB on a different machine
       than the one which is running the program being debugged.

       Usage (server (target) side):

       First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put  onto
       the  target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if needed,
       as GDBserver doesn&apos;t care about symbols.  All symbol  handling  is  taken
       care of by the GDB running on the host system.

       To  use  the  server,  you log on to the target system, and run the `gdb&#8208;
       server&apos; program.  You must tell it (a) how to communicate with  GDB,  (b)
       the name of your program, and (c) its arguments.  The general syntax is:

            target&gt; gdbserver COMM PROGRAM [ARGS ...]

       For example, using a serial port, you might say:

            target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt

       This  tells  gdbserver to debug emacs with an argument of foo.txt, and to
       communicate with GDB via /dev/com1.  Gdbserver now  waits  patiently  for
       the host GDB to communicate with it.

       To use a TCP connection, you could say:

            target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt

       This  says pretty much the same thing as the last example, except that we
       are going to communicate with the host  GDB  via  TCP.   The  `host:2345&apos;
       argument  means that we are expecting to see a TCP connection from `host&apos;
       to local TCP port 2345.  (Currently, the `host&apos; part  is  ignored.)   You
       can choose any number you want for the port number as long as it does not
       conflict with any existing TCP ports on the  target  system.   This  same
       port  number must be used in the host GDBs `target remote&apos; command, which
       will be described shortly.  Note that if you chose  a  port  number  that
       conflicts with another service, gdbserver will print an error message and
       exit.

       On some targets, gdbserver can also attach to running programs.  This  is
       accomplished via the --attach argument.  The syntax is:

            target&gt; gdbserver COMM --attach PID

       PID is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn&apos;t necessary
       to point gdbserver at a binary for the running process.

       Usage (host side):

       You need an unstripped copy of the target program on  your  host  system,
       since  GDB needs to examine it&apos;s symbol tables and such.  Start up GDB as
       you normally would, with the target program as the first argument.   (You
       may  need  to use the --baud option if the serial line is running at any&#8208;
       thing except 9600 baud.)  Ie: `gdb TARGET-PROG&apos;, or `gdb --baud BAUD TAR&#8208;
       GET-PROG&apos;.   After  that,  the only new command you need to know about is
       `target remote&apos;.  It&apos;s argument is either a device name (usually a serial
       device, like `/dev/ttyb&apos;), or a HOST:PORT descriptor.  For example:

            (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb

       communicates with the server via serial line /dev/ttyb, and:

            (gdb) target remote the-target:2345

       communicates  via  a  TCP  connection  to port 2345 on host `the-target&apos;,
       where you previously started up gdbserver  with  the  same  port  number.
       Note that for TCP connections, you must start up gdbserver prior to using
       the `target remote&apos; command, otherwise you may get an  error  that  looks
       something like `Connection refused&apos;.

OPTIONS
       You have to supply the name of the program to debug and the tty to commu&#8208;
       nicate on; the remote GDB will do everything else.  Any  remaining  argu&#8208;
       ments will be passed to the program verbatim.
