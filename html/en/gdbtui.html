NAME
       gdb - The GNU Debugger

SYNOPSIS
       gdb    [-help] [-nx] [-q] [-batch] [-cd=dir] [-f] [-b bps] [-tty=dev] [-s
              symfile] [-e prog] [-se prog] [-c core] [-x cmds] [-d dir] [prog
              [core|procID]]

       gdb    [options] --args prog [arguments]

       gdbtui [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  purpose  of  a  debugger  such as GDB is to allow you to see what is
       going on ``inside&apos;&apos; another program while  it  executes&#8212;or  what  another
       program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB  can  do  four  main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
       these) to help you catch bugs in the act:


          &#183;   Start your program, specifying  anything  that  might  affect  its
              behavior.


          &#183;   Make your program stop on specified conditions.


          &#183;   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.


          &#183;   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correct&#8208;
              ing the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, and Modula-2.   For&#8208;
       tran support will be added when a GNU Fortran compiler is ready.

       GDB  is  invoked with the shell command gdb.  Once started, it reads com&#8208;
       mands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with  the  GDB  command
       quit.  You can get online help from gdb itself by using the command help.

       You  can  run gdb with no arguments or options; but the most usual way to
       start GDB is with one argument or two, specifying an  executable  program
       as the argument:

       gdb program


       You can also start with both an executable program and a core file speci&#8208;
       fied:

       gdb program core


       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you  want
       to debug a running process:

       gdb program 1234


       would  attach  GDB  to  process  1234  (unless you also have a file named
       `1234&apos;; GDB does check for a core file first).

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       break [file:]function
               Set a breakpoint at function (in file).

       run [arglist]
              Start your program (with arglist, if specified).

       bt     Backtrace: display the program stack.

       print expr
               Display the value of an expression.

       c      Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g.  at  a  break&#8208;
              point).

       next   Execute next program line (after stopping); step over any function
              calls in the line.

       edit [file:]function
              look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       list [file:]function
              type the text of the program  in  the  vicinity  of  where  it  is
              presently stopped.

       step   Execute next program line (after stopping); step into any function
              calls in the line.

       help [name]
              Show information about GDB command name,  or  general  information
              about using GDB.

       quit   Exit from GDB.

       For  full  details on GDB, see Using GDB: A Guide to the GNU Source-Level
       Debugger, by Richard M. Stallman and Roland H. Pesch.  The same  text  is
       available online as the gdb entry in the info program.

OPTIONS
       Any arguments other than options specify an executable file and core file
       (or process ID); that is, the first argument encountered with no  associ&#8208;
       ated option flag is equivalent to a `-se&apos; option, and the second, if any,
       is equivalent to a `-c&apos; option if it&apos;s the name of a file.  Many  options
       have  both long and short forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are
       also recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option  is
       present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can flag option arguments
       with `+&apos; rather than `-&apos;, though we illustrate  the  more  usual  conven&#8208;
       tion.)

       All  the  options  and  command  line arguments you give are processed in
       sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the `-x&apos;  option  is
       used.

       -b bps   Set  the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
              interface used by GDB for remote debugging.


       -batch Run in batch mode.  Exit with status 0 after  processing  all  the
              command  files  specified with `-x&apos; (and `.gdbinit&apos;, if not inhib&#8208;
              ited).  Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs  in  executing
              the GDB commands in the command files.

              Batch  mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example
              to download and run a program on another  computer;  in  order  to
              make this more useful, the message

              Program exited normally.


              (which  is  ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB
              control terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.


       -c FILE, -core=FILE
              Use file file as a core dump to examine.


       -cd=directory
               Run GDB using directory as its working directory, instead of  the
              current directory.


       -d DIRECTORY, -directory=DIRECTORY
              Add directory to the path to search for source files.


       -e FILE, -exec=FILE
              Use  file file as the executable file to execute when appropriate,
              and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core dump.


       -f, -fullname
              Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells
              GDB  to  output  the full file name and line number in a standard,
              recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is  displayed  (which
              includes  each  time the program stops).  This recognizable format
              looks like two ` 32&apos; characters, followed by the file  name,  line
              number  and character position separated by colons, and a newline.
              The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two  ` 32&apos;  characters
              as a signal to display the source code for the frame.


       -h, -help
              List all options, with brief explanations.


       -n, -nx
              Do  not execute commands from any `.gdbinit&apos; initialization files.
              Normally, the commands in these files are executed after  all  the
              command options and arguments have been processed.


       -s FILE, -symbols=FILE
              Read symbol table from file file.


       -se=file
              Read  symbol  table  from  file  file and use it as the executable
              file.


       q, -quiet
              ``Quiet&apos;&apos;.  Do not print the introductory and copyright  messages.
              These messages are also suppressed in batch mode.


       -tty=device
               Run using device for your program&apos;s standard input and output.
&#12;       --args Pass  arguments  after  the program name to the program when it is
              run.


       -tui   Run GDB using a text (console) user interface.

       -write Enable writing into executable and core files.


       -x FILE, -command=FILE
              Execute GDB commands from file file.
