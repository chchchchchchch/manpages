GDK-PIXBUF-QUERY-(1)             [FIXME: manual]            GDK-PIXBUF-QUERY-(1)



NAME
       gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders - GdkPixbuf loader registration utility

SYNOPSIS
       gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders [--update-cache] [module...]

DESCRIPTION
       gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders collects information about loadable modules for
       gdk-pixbuf and writes it to the default cache file location, or to
       stdout.

       If called without arguments, it looks for modules in the gdk-pixbuf
       loader directory.

       If called with arguments, it looks for the specified modules. The
       arguments may be absolute or relative paths.

       Normally, the output of gdk-pixbuf-queryloaders is written to
       libdirgdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache, where gdk-pixbuf looks for it
       by default. If it is written to some other location, the environment
       variable GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE can be set to point gdk-pixbuf at the
       file.

OPTIONS
       --update-cache
           Write the output to the default cache location instead of stdout

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR can be used to specify a
       different loader directory. The default gdk-pixbuf loader directory is
       libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/version/loaders.

BUGS
       None known yet.
