NAME
       gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file generation

SYNOPSIS
       gendiff &lt;directory&gt; &lt;diff-extension&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       gendiff  is  a  rather simple script which aids in generating a diff file
       from a single directory.  It takes a directory name  and  a  &quot;diff-exten&#8208;
       sion&quot;  as  its  only  arguments.   The  diff extension should be a unique
       sequence of characters added to  the  end  of  all  original,  unmodified
       files.   The  output  of  the program is a diff file which may be applied
       with the patch program to recreate the changes.

       The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two identi&#8208;
       cal  directories,  make  changes  in one directory, and then use the diff
       utility to create a list of differences between the two.   Using  gendiff
       eliminates  the  need  for  the  extra, original and unmodified directory
       copy.  Instead, only the individual files that are modified  need  to  be
       saved.

       Before  editing  a  file, copy the file, appending the extension you have
       chosen to the filename.  I.e. if you were going to edit somefile.cpp  and
       have chosen the extension &quot;fix&quot;, copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before edit&#8208;
       ing it.  Then edit the first copy (somefile.cpp).

       After editing all the files you need to edit in this fashion,  enter  the
       directory one level above where your source code resides, and then type

           $ gendiff somedirectory .fix &gt; mydiff-fix.patch

       You should redirect the output to a file (as illustrated) unless you want
       to see the results on stdout.
