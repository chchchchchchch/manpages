GENISOIMAGERC(5)                                                GENISOIMAGERC(5)



NAME
       genisoimagerc - startup configuration file for genisoimage

DESCRIPTION
       genisoimage(1)  searches  for  a configuration file in several places; it
       uses the first one it is able to open.  First, if the GENISOIMAGERC envi&#8208;
       ronment  variable is set, its value is used as the filename; likewise for
       the MKISOFSRC environment variable.  Next, genisoimage  looks  for  files
       named  .genisoimagerc  or .mkisofsrc, first in the current working direc&#8208;
       tory,  then  in  the  user&apos;s  home  directory.   Next,   it   looks   for
       /etc/genisoimagerc.   Finally,  it looks for a .genisoimagerc in the same
       directory as genisoimage itself is stored.

       The .genisoimagerc file contains lines of the form

              TAG=value

       where TAG is one of the settings defined below.  The case of the  tag  is
       not significant.  All settings have command-line equivalents; if the com&#8208;
       mand-line parameter is specified, it takes priority over  the  configura&#8208;
       tion file.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with `#&apos; are ignored.
