EQN(1)                                                                    EQN(1)



NAME
       eqn - format equations for troff or MathML

SYNOPSIS
       eqn [-rvCNR] [-d xy] [-T name] [-M dir] [-f F] [-s n] [-p n] [-m n]
           [files...]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option  and  its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page describes the GNU version of eqn, which is part of the
       groff document formatting system.  eqn compiles descriptions of equations
       embedded  within  troff  input files into commands that are understood by
       troff.  Normally, it should be invoked using the -e option of groff.  The
       syntax  is  quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The output of GNU eqn cannot
       be processed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff.  If no
       files are given on the command line, the standard input is read.  A file&#8208;
       name of - causes the standard input to be read.

       eqn searches for the file eqnrc in the  directories  given  with  the  -M
       option  first,  then  in /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/site-
       tmac,    and    finally    in    the     standard     macro     directory
       /usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac.   If  it  exists, eqn processes it before the
       other input files.  The -R option prevents this.

       GNU eqn does not provide the functionality of neqn: it does  not  support
       low-resolution,  typewriter-like devices (although it may work adequately
       for very simple input).

OPTIONS
       -dxy   Specify delimiters x and y for the left  and  right  end,  respec&#8208;
              tively,  of in-line equations.  Any delim statements in the source
              file overrides this.

       -C     Recognize .EQ and .EN even when followed by a character other than
              space or newline.

       -N     Don&apos;t allow newlines within delimiters.  This option allows eqn to
              recover better from missing closing delimiters.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -r     Only one size reduction.

       -mn    The minimum point-size is n.  eqn does not reduce the size of sub&#8208;
              scripts or superscripts to a smaller size than n.

       -Tname The  output is for device name.  Normally, the only effect of this
              is to define a macro name with a value of 1; eqnrc  uses  this  to
              provide  definitions  appropriate for the output device.  However,
              if the specified device is &#8220;MathML&#8221;, the output is  MathML  markup
              rather  than  troff commands, and eqnrc is not loaded at all.  The
              default output device is ps.

       -Mdir  Search dir for eqnrc before the default directories.

       -R     Don&apos;t load eqnrc.

       -fF    This is equivalent to a gfont F command.

       -sn    This is equivalent to a gsize n command.  This  option  is  depre&#8208;
              cated.   eqn normally sets equations at whatever the current point
              size is when the equation is encountered.

       -pn    This says that subscripts and  superscripts  should  be  n  points
              smaller  than  the  surrounding  text.  This option is deprecated.
              Normally eqn sets subscripts and superscripts at 70% of  the  size
              of the surrounding text.

USAGE
       Only the differences between GNU eqn and Unix eqn are described here.

       GNU  eqn emits Presentation MathML output when invoked with the -T MathML
       option.

       GNU eqn sets the input token &quot;...&quot;  as three periods or low dots,  rather
       than the three centered dots of classic eqn.  To get three centered dots,
       write cdots or cdot cdot cdot.

       Most of the new features of the GNU eqn input language are based on  TeX.
       There  are  some  references  to  the differences between TeX and GNU eqn
       below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.

   Automatic spacing
       eqn gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts  the  spacing
       between components using that type.  Possible types are:

              ordinary     an ordinary character such as `1&apos; or `x&apos;;

              operator     a large operator such as `&#931;&apos;;

              binary       a binary operator such as `+&apos;;

              relation     a relation such as `=&apos;;

              opening      a opening bracket such as `(&apos;;

              closing      a closing bracket such as `)&apos;;

              punctuation  a punctuation character such as `,&apos;;

              inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

              suppress     spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       type t e
              This  yields  an  equation  component that contains e but that has
              type t, where t is one of the types mentioned above.  For example,
              times is defined as

                     type &quot;binary&quot; \(mu

              The  name  of the type doesn&apos;t have to be quoted, but quoting pro&#8208;
              tects from macro expansion.

       chartype t text
              Unquoted groups of characters are split up into individual charac&#8208;
              ters,  and  the  type of each character is looked up; this changes
              the type that is stored for each character; it says that the char&#8208;
              acters in text from now on have type t.  For example,

                     chartype &quot;punctuation&quot; .,;:

              would  make  the  characters `.,;:&apos; have type punctuation whenever
              they subsequently appeared in an equation.  The type t can also be
              letter  or digit; in these cases chartype changes the font type of
              the characters.  See the Fonts subsection.

   New primitives
       big e  Enlarges the expression it modifies; intended  to  have  semantics
              like  CSS  `large&apos;.   In troff output, the point size is increased
              by 5; in MathML output, the expression uses

                     &lt;mstyle mathsize=&apos;big&apos;&gt;

       e1 smallover e2
              This is similar to over; smallover reduces the size of e1 and  e2;
              it also puts less vertical space between e1 or e2 and the fraction
              bar.  The over primitive corresponds to the TeX \over primitive in
              display  styles;  smallover  corresponds  to  \over in non-display
              styles.

       vcenter e
              This vertically centers e about the math axis.  The math  axis  is
              the  vertical  position about which characters such as `+&apos; and `&#8722;&apos;
              are centered; also it is the vertical position used for the bar of
              fractions.  For example, sum is defined as

                     { type &quot;operator&quot; vcenter size +5 \(*S }

              (Note that vcenter is silently ignored when generating MathML.)

       e1 accent e2
              This  sets  e2  as  an accent over e1.  e2 is assumed to be at the
              correct height for a lowercase letter; e2 is moved down  according
              to  whether  e1 is taller or shorter than a lowercase letter.  For
              example, hat is defined as

                     accent { &quot;^&quot; }

              dotdot, dot, tilde, vec, and  dyad  are  also  defined  using  the
              accent primitive.

       e1 uaccent e2
              This  sets  e2  as an accent under e1.  e2 is assumed to be at the
              correct height for a character without a descender;  e2  is  moved
              down  if  e1 has a descender.  utilde is pre-defined using uaccent
              as a tilde accent below the baseline.

       split &quot;text&quot;
              This has the same effect as simply

                     text

              but text is not subject to macro expansion because it  is  quoted;
              text  is split up and the spacing between individual characters is
              adjusted.

       nosplit text
              This has the same effect as

                     &quot;text&quot;

              but because text is not quoted it is subject to  macro  expansion;
              text is not split up and the spacing between individual characters
              is not adjusted.

       e opprime
              This is a variant of prime that acts as an operator on e.  It pro&#8208;
              duces   a   different   result  from  prime  in  a  case  such  as
              A opprime sub 1: with opprime the 1 is tucked under the prime as a
              subscript  to  the  A (as is conventional in mathematical typeset&#8208;
              ting), whereas with prime the 1 is a subscript to the prime  char&#8208;
              acter.   The  precedence of opprime is the same as that of bar and
              under, which is higher than that of everything except  accent  and
              uaccent.   In unquoted text a &apos; that is not the first character is
              treated like opprime.

       special text e
              This constructs a new object from e using a troff(1)  macro  named
              text.  When the macro is called, the string 0s contains the output
              for e, and the number registers 0w, 0h, 0d, 0skern, and 0skew con&#8208;
              tain  the  width,  height,  depth,  subscript kern, and skew of e.
              (The subscript kern of an object says how much a subscript on that
              object  should be tucked in; the skew of an object says how far to
              the right of the center of the object an accent  over  the  object
              should  be  placed.)   The macro must modify 0s so that it outputs
              the desired result with its  origin  at  the  current  point,  and
              increase  the  current  horizontal  position  by  the width of the
              object.  The number registers must also be modified so  that  they
              correspond to the result.

              For  example,  suppose  you  wanted  a construct that `cancels&apos; an
              expression by drawing a diagonal line through it.

                     .EQ
                     define cancel &apos;special Ca&apos;
                     .EN
                     .de Ca
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z&apos;\\*(0s&apos;\
                     \v&apos;\\n(0du&apos;\
                     \D&apos;l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du&apos;\
                     \v&apos;\\n(0hu&apos;
                     ..

              Then you could cancel an expression e with cancel { e }

              Here&apos;s a more complicated construct that  draws  a  box  round  an
              expression:

                     .EQ
                     define box &apos;special Bx&apos;
                     .EN
                     .de Bx
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z&apos;\h&apos;1n&apos;\\*(0s&apos;\
                     \Z&apos;\
                     \v&apos;\\n(0du+1n&apos;\
                     \D&apos;l \\n(0wu+2n 0&apos;\
                     \D&apos;l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n&apos;\
                     \D&apos;l -\\n(0wu-2n 0&apos;\
                     \D&apos;l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n&apos;\
                     &apos;\
                     \h&apos;\\n(0wu+2n&apos;
                     .  nr 0w +2n
                     .  nr 0d +1n
                     .  nr 0h +1n
                     ..

       space n
              A  positive  value  of the integer n (in hundredths of an em) sets
              the vertical spacing before the equation, a  negative  value  sets
              the  spacing  after  the  equation,  replacing the default values.
              This primitive provides an interface to  groff&apos;s  \x  escape  (but
              with opposite sign).

              This  keyword  has no effect if the equation is part of a pic pic&#8208;
              ture.

   Extended primitives
       col n { ... }
       ccol n { ... }
       lcol n { ... }
       rcol n { ... }
       pile n { ... }
       cpile n { ... }
       lpile n { ... }
       rpile n { ... }
              The integer value n (in hundredths of an em) increases the  verti&#8208;
              cal  spacing  between rows, using groff&apos;s \x escape (the value has
              no effect in MathML mode).  Negative values are possible but  have
              no  effect.   If  there  is  more  than  a single value given in a
              matrix, the biggest one is used.

   Customization
       When eqn is generating troff markup, the appearance of equations is  con&#8208;
       trolled by a large number of parameters.  They have no effect when gener&#8208;
       ating MathML mode, which pushes typesetting and fine  motions  downstream
       to  a MathML rendering engine.  These parameters can be set using the set
       command.

       set p n
              This sets parameter p to value n; n is an integer.  For example,

                     set x_height 45

              says that eqn should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.

              Possible parameters are as follows.  Values are in units  of  hun&#8208;
              dredths  of an em unless otherwise stated.  These descriptions are
              intended to be expository rather than definitive.

              minimum_size
                     eqn doesn&apos;t set anything at a smaller point-size than this.
                     The value is in points.

              fat_offset
                     The fat primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting two
                     copies of the equation horizontally offset by this  amount.
                     This  parameter  is  not  used in MathML mode; instead, fat
                     text uses

                            &lt;mstyle mathvariant=&apos;double-struck&apos;&gt;

              over_hang
                     A fraction bar is longer by twice this amount than the max&#8208;
                     imum  of  the  widths  of the numerator and denominator; in
                     other words, it overhangs the numerator and denominator  by
                     at least this amount.

              accent_width
                     When  bar  or  under  is applied to a single character, the
                     line is this long.  Normally, bar or under produces a  line
                     whose  length  is  the  width  of  the  object  to which it
                     applies; in the case of a single character, this  tends  to
                     produce a line that looks too long.

              delimiter_factor
                     Extensible  delimiters  produced  with  the  left and right
                     primitives have a combined height and  depth  of  at  least
                     this  many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which
                     the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose  extends  away
                     from the axis.

              delimiter_shortfall
                     Extensible  delimiters  produced  with  the  left and right
                     primitives have a combined height and depth not  less  than
                     the  difference  of  twice  the maximum amount by which the
                     sub-equation that the delimiters enclose extends away  from
                     the axis and this amount.

              null_delimiter_space
                     This  much  horizontal  space is inserted on each side of a
                     fraction.

              script_space
                     The width of subscripts and superscripts  is  increased  by
                     this amount.

              thin_space
                     This  amount of space is automatically inserted after punc&#8208;
                     tuation characters.

              medium_space
                     This amount of space is automatically  inserted  on  either
                     side of binary operators.
&#12;              thick_space
                     This  amount  of  space is automatically inserted on either
                     side of relations.

              x_height
                     The height of lowercase letters without ascenders  such  as
                     `x&apos;.

              axis_height
                     The  height  above the baseline of the center of characters
                     such as `+&apos; and `&#8722;&apos;.  It is important that  this  value  is
                     correct for the font you are using.

              default_rule_thickness
                     This  should set to the thickness of the \(ru character, or
                     the thickness of horizontal  lines  produced  with  the  \D
                     escape sequence.

              num1   The  over  command shifts up the numerator by at least this
                     amount.

              num2   The smallover command shifts up the numerator by  at  least
                     this amount.

              denom1 The  over  command  shifts down the denominator by at least
                     this amount.

              denom2 The smallover command shifts down  the  denominator  by  at
                     least this amount.

              sup1   Normally  superscripts  are  shifted  up  by  at least this
                     amount.

              sup2   Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or numera&#8208;
                     tors of smallover fractions are shifted up by at least this
                     amount.  This is usually less than sup1.

              sup3   Superscripts within denominators or square  roots  or  sub&#8208;
                     scripts  or  lower  limits  are shifted up by at least this
                     amount.  This is usually less than sup2.

              sub1   Subscripts are normally  shifted  down  by  at  least  this
                     amount.

              sub2   When  there is both a subscript and a superscript, the sub&#8208;
                     script is shifted down by at least this amount.

              sup_drop
                     The baseline of a superscript is no  more  than  this  much
                     amount below the top of the object on which the superscript
                     is set.

              sub_drop
                     The baseline of a subscript is at least this much below the
                     bottom of the object on which the subscript is set.

              big_op_spacing1
                     The  baseline of an upper limit is at least this much above
                     the top of the object on which the limit is set.

              big_op_spacing2
                     The baseline of a lower limit is at least this  much  below
                     the bottom of the object on which the limit is set.

              big_op_spacing3
                     The  bottom  of  an upper limit is at least this much above
                     the top of the object on which the limit is set.

              big_op_spacing4
                     The top of a lower limit is at least this  much  below  the
                     bottom of the object on which the limit is set.

              big_op_spacing5
                     This much vertical space is added above and below limits.

              baseline_sep
                     The  baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix are normally
                     this far apart.  In most cases this should be equal to  the
                     sum of num1 and denom1.

              shift_down
                     The  midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom base&#8208;
                     line in a matrix or pile is shifted down by this much  from
                     the   axis.    In  most  cases  this  should  be  equal  to
                     axis_height.

              column_sep
                     This much space is added between columns in a matrix.

              matrix_side_sep
                     This much space is added at each side of a matrix.

              draw_lines
                     If this is non-zero, lines are drawn using  the  \D  escape
                     sequence,  rather  than with the \l escape sequence and the
                     \(ru character.

              body_height
                     The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this
                     is  added  as  extra  space  before the line containing the
                     equation (using \x).  The default value is 85.

              body_depth
                     The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds  this
                     is added as extra space after the line containing the equa&#8208;
                     tion (using \x).  The default value is 35.

              nroff  If this is non-zero, then ndefine behaves like  define  and
                     tdefine  is  ignored, otherwise tdefine behaves like define
                     and ndefine is ignored.  The default value is  0  (This  is
                     typically  changed  to  1  by the eqnrc file for the ascii,
                     latin1, utf8, and cp1047 devices.)

              A more precise description of the role of many of these parameters
              can be found in Appendix H of The TeXbook.

   Macros
       Macros  can  take  arguments.   In  a macro body, $n where n is between 1
       and 9, is replaced by the n-th argument if the macro is called with argu&#8208;
       ments; if there are fewer than n arguments, it is replaced by nothing.  A
       word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the word before  the
       left  parenthesis has been defined using the define command is recognized
       as a macro call with arguments; characters following the left parenthesis
       up  to  a matching right parenthesis are treated as comma-separated argu&#8208;
       ments; commas inside nested parentheses do not terminate an argument.

       sdefine name X anything X
              This is like the define command, but name  is  not  recognized  if
              called with arguments.

       include &quot;file&quot;
       copy &quot;file&quot;
              Include  the  contents  of  file  (include and copy are synonyms).
              Lines of file beginning with .EQ or .EN are ignored.

       ifdef name X anything X
              If name has been defined by  define  (or  has  been  automatically
              defined  because name is the output device) process anything; oth&#8208;
              erwise ignore anything.  X can be any character not  appearing  in
              anything.

       undef name
              Remove definition of name, making it undefined.

       Besides  the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are avail&#8208;
       able: Alpha, Beta, ..., Omega (this is the  same  as  ALPHA,  BETA,  ...,
       OMEGA), ldots (three dots on the base line), and dollar.

   Fonts
       eqn  normally  uses at least two fonts to set an equation: an italic font
       for letters, and a roman font for everything else.   The  existing  gfont
       command  changes  the  font  that is used as the italic font.  By default
       this is I.  The font that is used as the roman font can be changed  using
       the new grfont command.

       grfont f
              Set the roman font to f.
&#12;       The italic primitive uses the current italic font set by gfont; the roman
       primitive uses the current roman font set by grfont.  There is also a new
       gbfont  command,  which  changes the font used by the bold primitive.  If
       you only use the roman, italic  and  bold  primitives  to  changes  fonts
       within  an  equation, you can change all the fonts used by your equations
       just by using gfont, grfont and gbfont commands.

       You can control which characters are treated as  letters  (and  therefore
       set in italics) by using the chartype command described above.  A type of
       letter causes a character to be set in italic  type.   A  type  of  digit
       causes a character to be set in roman type.

INTERACTION WITH TBL
       It  is not advisable to use the hash character (#) as a delimiter for in-
       line equations in eqn since tbl(1) uses a macro  called  .T#,  causing  a
       clash.

MATHML MODE LIMITATIONS
       MathML is designed on the assumption that it cannot know the exact physi&#8208;
       cal characteristics of the media and devices on which  it  will  be  ren&#8208;
       dered.  It does not support fine control of motions and sizes to the same
       degree troff does.  Thus:

       *      eqn parameters have no effect on the generated MathML.

       *      The special, up, down, fwd, and back operations cannot  be  imple&#8208;
              mented, and yield a MathML `&lt;merror&gt;&apos; message instead.

       *      The  vcenter keyword is silently ignored, as centering on the math
              axis is the MathML default.

       *      Characters that eqn over troff sets  extra  large  &#8211;  notably  the
              integral  sign  &#8211;  may  appear  too  small  and need to have their
              `&lt;mstyle&gt;&apos; wrappers adjusted by hand.

       As in its troff mode, eqn in MathML mode leaves the .EQ  and  .EN  delim&#8208;
       iters  in place for displayed equations, but emits no explicit delimiters
       around inline equations.  They can, however,  be  recognized  as  strings
       that  begin  with  `&lt;math&gt;&apos;  and end with `&lt;/math&gt;&apos; and do not cross line
       boundaries.

       See the BUGS section for translation limits specific to eqn.

BUGS
       Inline equations are set at the point size that is current at the  begin&#8208;
       ning of the input line.

       In MathML mode, the mark and lineup features don&apos;t work.  These could, in
       theory, be implemented with `&lt;maligngroup&gt;&apos; elements.

       In MathML mode, each digit of a numeric literal  gets  a  separate  `&lt;mn&gt;
       &lt;/mn&gt;&apos;  pair,  and  decimal  points are tagged with `&lt;mo&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&apos;.  This is
       allowed by the specification, but inefficient.
