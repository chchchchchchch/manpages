GET_THREAD_AREA(2)          Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual         GET_THREAD_AREA(2)



NAME
       get_thread_area - get a thread-local storage (TLS) area

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;asm/ldt.h&gt;

       int get_thread_area(struct user_desc *u_info);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       get_thread_area()  returns  an entry in the current thread&apos;s thread-local
       storage (TLS) array.  The index of the entry corresponds to the value  of
       u_info-&gt;entry_number,  passed in by the user.  If the value is in bounds,
       get_thread_area() copies  the  corresponding  TLS  entry  into  the  area
       pointed to by u_info.

RETURN VALUE
       get_thread_area()  returns  0  on  success.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and
       sets errno appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT u_info is an invalid pointer.

       EINVAL u_info-&gt;entry_number is out of bounds.

VERSIONS
       A version of get_thread_area() first appeared in Linux 2.5.32.

CONFORMING TO
       get_thread_area() is Linux-specific and should not be  used  in  programs
       that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call, since it is gener&#8208;
       ally intended only for use by threading libraries.  In the unlikely event
       that you want to call it directly, use syscall(2).
