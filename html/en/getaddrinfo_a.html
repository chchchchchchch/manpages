DESCRIPTION
       The getaddrinfo_a() function performs the same  task  as  getaddrinfo(3),
       but  allows  multiple  name look-ups to be performed asynchronously, with
       optional notification on completion of look-up operations.

       The mode argument has one of the following values:

       GAI_WAIT
              Perform the look-ups synchronously.  The  call  blocks  until  the
              look-ups have completed.

       GAI_NOWAIT
              Perform  the  look-ups  asynchronously.   The call returns immedi&#8208;
              ately, and the requests are resolved in the background.   See  the
              discussion of the sevp argument below.

       The  array  list  specifies  the look-up requests to process.  The nitems
       argument specifies the number of elements in list.  The requested look-up
       operations  are  started in parallel.  NULL elements in list are ignored.
       Each request is described by a gaicb structure, defined as follows:

           struct gaicb {
               const char            *ar_name;
               const char            *ar_service;
               const struct addrinfo *ar_request;
               struct addrinfo       *ar_result;
           };

       The elements of this structure correspond  to  the  arguments  of  getad&#8208;
       drinfo(3).  Thus, ar_name corresponds to the node argument and ar_service
       to the service argument, identifying an Internet host and a service.  The
       ar_request element corresponds to the hints argument, specifying the cri&#8208;
       teria for selecting the returned  socket  address  structures.   Finally,
       ar_result  corresponds to the res argument; you do not need to initialize
       this element, it will be automatically set when the request is  resolved.
       The  addrinfo  structure referenced by the last two elements is described
       in getaddrinfo(3).

       When mode  is  specified  as  GAI_NOWAIT,  notifications  about  resolved
       requests  can  be obtained by employing the sigevent structure pointed to
       by the sevp argument.  For the definition and  general  details  of  this
       structure,  see  sigevent(7).   The sevp-&gt;sigev_notify field can have the
       following values:

       SIGEV_NONE
              Don&apos;t provide any notification.

       SIGEV_SIGNAL
              When a look-up completes, generate the signal sigev_signo for  the
              process.   See sigevent(7) for general details.  The si_code field
              of the siginfo_t structure will be set to SI_ASYNCNL.

       SIGEV_THREAD
              When a look-up completes, invoke sigev_notify_function  as  if  it
              were  the  start  function  of  a new thread.  See sigevent(7) for
              details.

       For  SIGEV_SIGNAL  and  SIGEV_THREAD,  it  may   be   useful   to   point
       sevp-&gt;sigev_value.sival_ptr to list.

       The  gai_suspend()  function  suspends  execution  of the calling thread,
       waiting for the completion of one or more requests  in  the  array  list.
       The  nitems  argument  specifies  the  size  of the array list.  The call
       blocks until one of the following occurs:

       *  One or more of the operations in list completes.

       *  The call is interrupted by a signal that is caught.

       *  The time interval specified in timeout elapses.  This argument  speci&#8208;
          fies  a  timeout  in  seconds  plus  nanoseconds (see nanosleep(2) for
          details of the timespec structure).  If timeout is NULL, then the call
          blocks indefinitely (until one of the events above occurs).

       No  explicit indication of which request was completed is given; you must
       determine which request(s) have completed by iterating  with  gai_error()
       over the list of requests.

       The  gai_error()  function  returns the status of the request req: either
       EAI_INPROGRESS if the request was not completed yet, 0 if it was  handled
       successfully, or an error code if the request could not be resolved.

       The  gai_cancel()  function  cancels the request req.  If the request has
       been canceled successfully, the error status of the request will  be  set
       to  EAI_CANCELLED and normal asynchronous notification will be performed.
       The request cannot be canceled if it is  currently  being  processed;  in
       that  case,  it will be handled as if gai_cancel() has never been called.
       If req is NULL, an attempt is made to  cancel  all  outstanding  requests
       that the process has made.

RETURN VALUE
       The  getaddrinfo_a()  function returns 0 if all of the requests have been
       enqueued successfully, or one of the following nonzero error codes:

       EAI_AGAIN
              The resources necessary to enqueue the look-up requests  were  not
              available.   The  application  may  check the error status of each
              request to determine which ones failed.

       EAI_MEMORY
              Out of memory.

       EAI_SYSTEM
              mode is invalid.

       The gai_suspend() function returns 0  if  at  least  one  of  the  listed
       requests  has been completed.  Otherwise, it returns one of the following
       nonzero error codes:

       EAI_AGAIN
              The given timeout expired before any of the requests could be com&#8208;
              pleted.

       EAI_ALLDONE
              There were no actual requests given to the function.

       EAI_INTR
              A  signal  has interrupted the function.  Note that this interrup&#8208;
              tion might have been caused by signal notification  of  some  com&#8208;
              pleted look-up request.

       The  gai_error()  function  can  return  EAI_INPROGRESS for an unfinished
       look-up request, 0 for a successfully  completed  look-up  (as  described
       above),  one of the error codes that could be returned by getaddrinfo(3),
       or the error code EAI_CANCELLED if the request has been canceled  explic&#8208;
       itly before it could be finished.

       The gai_cancel() function can return one of these values:

       EAI_CANCELLED
              The request has been canceled successfully.

       EAI_NOTCANCELLED
              The request has not been canceled.

       EAI_ALLDONE
              The request has already completed.

       The  gai_strerror(3)  function  translates  these  error codes to a human
       readable string, suitable for error reporting.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions; they first appeared in glibc in  ver&#8208;
       sion 2.2.3.

NOTES
       The  interface  of  getaddrinfo_a()  was  modeled after the lio_listio(3)
       interface.

EXAMPLE
       Two examples  are  provided:  a  simple  example  that  resolves  several
       requests in parallel synchronously, and a complex example showing some of
       the asynchronous capabilities.

   Synchronous Example
       The program below simply resolves several hostnames in parallel, giving a
       speed-up  compared  to  resolving the hostnames sequentially using getad&#8208;
       drinfo(3).  The program might be used like this:

           $ ./a.out ftp.us.kernel.org enoent.linuxfoundation.org gnu.cz

                   }
                   puts(host);

               } else {
                   puts(gai_strerror(ret));
               }
           }
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }


   Asynchronous Example
       This example shows a simple interactive getaddrinfo_a()  front-end.   The
       notification facility is not demonstrated.

       An example session might look like this:
