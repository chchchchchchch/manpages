GETDATE(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 GETDATE(3)



NAME
       getdate, getdate_r - convert a date-plus-time string to broken-down time

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       struct tm *getdate(const char *string);

       extern int getdate_err;

       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int getdate_r(const char *string, struct tm *res);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getdate():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
       getdate_r():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  getdate()  converts  a string representation of a date and
       time, contained in the buffer pointed to by string,  into  a  broken-down
       time.  The broken-down time is stored in a tm structure, and a pointer to
       this structure is returned as the function result.  This tm structure  is
       allocated  in  static storage, and consequently it will be overwritten by
       further calls to getdate().

       In contrast to strptime(3), (which has a format argument), getdate() uses
       the  formats  found in the file whose full pathname is given in the envi&#8208;
       ronment variable DATEMSK.  The first line in the file  that  matches  the
       given input string is used for the conversion.

       The  matching is done case insensitively.  Superfluous whitespace, either
       in the pattern or in the string to be converted, is ignored.

       The conversion specifications that a pattern can contain are those  given
       for  strptime(3).   One  more  conversion  specification  is specified in
       POSIX.1-2001:

       %Z     Timezone name.  This is not implemented in glibc.

       When %Z is given, the structure containing the broken-down time  is  ini&#8208;
       tialized with values corresponding to the current time in the given time&#8208;
       zone.  Otherwise, the structure is initialized to  the  broken-down  time
       corresponding to the current local time (as by a call to localtime(3)).

       When only the weekday is given, the day is taken to be the first such day
       on or after today.

       When only the month is given (and no year), the month is taken to be  the
       first  such  month  equal  to  or  after the current month.  If no day is
       given, it is the first day of the month.

       When no hour, minute and second are given, the current hour,  minute  and
       second are taken.

       If  no date is given, but we know the hour, then that hour is taken to be
       the first such hour equal to or after the current hour.

       getdate_r() is a GNU extension that provides a reentrant version of  get&#8208;
       date().   Rather  than  using  a  global  variable to report errors and a
       static buffer to return the broken down time, it returns errors  via  the
       function  result value, and returns the resulting broken-down time in the
       caller-allocated buffer pointed to by the argument res.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, getdate() returns a pointer to a struct tm.   Otherwise,
       it  returns  NULL  and sets the global variable getdate_err to one of the
       error numbers shown below.  Changes to errno are unspecified.

       On success getdate_r() returns 0; on error it returns one  of  the  error
       numbers shown below.

ERRORS
       The  following  errors are returned via getdate_err (for getdate()) or as
       the function result (for getdate_r()):

       1   The DATEMSK environment variable is not defined, or its value  is  an
           empty string.

       2   The template file specified by DATEMSK cannot be opened for reading.

       3   Failed to get file status information.

       4   The template file is not a regular file.

       5   An error was encountered while reading the template file.

       6   Memory allocation failed (not enough memory available).

       7   There is no line in the file that matches the input.

       8   Invalid input specification.

ENVIRONMENT
       DATEMSK
              File containing format patterns.

       TZ, LC_TIME
              Variables used by strptime(3).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The POSIX.1-2001 specification for strptime(3) contains conversion speci&#8208;
       fications using the %E or %O modifier, while such specifications are  not
       given  for  getdate().   In  glibc,  getdate() is implemented using strp&#8208;
       time(3), so that precisely the same conversions are supported by both.

EXAMPLE
       The program below calls getdate() for each of its command-line arguments,
       and  for  each  call displays the values in the fields of the returned tm
       structure.  The following shell session demonstrates the operation of the
       program:

           $ TFILE=$PWD/tfile
           $ echo &apos;%A&apos; &gt; $TFILE       # Full weekday name
           $ echo &apos;%T&apos; &gt;&gt; $TFILE      # ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
           $ echo &apos;%F&apos; &gt;&gt; $TFILE      # Time (HH:MM:SS)
           $ date
           $ export DATEMSK=$TFILE
           $ ./a.out Tuesday &apos;2009-12-28&apos; &apos;12:22:33&apos;
