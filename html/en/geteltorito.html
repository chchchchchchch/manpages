GETELTORITO(1)                                                    GETELTORITO(1)



NAME
       geteltorito - an El Torito boot image extractor

SYNOPSIS
       geteltorito &lt;image|device&gt; [-o outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       geteltorito is a Perl script which extracts the initial/default El Torito
       boot image from a CD if one exists. It will not extract any of other boot
       images that are allowed by the El Torito standard.

       The boot image file is written to stdout and all other information (e.g.,
       image type and size) is written to stderr.  To write the image to a  file
       instead of stdout, specify the output filename using -o filename.


SEE ALSO
       genisoimage(1), isoinfo(1).
