GETENV(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  GETENV(3)



NAME
       getenv, secure_getenv - get an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *getenv(const char *name);

       char *secure_getenv(const char *name);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       secure_getenv(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  getenv() function searches the environment list to find the environ&#8208;
       ment variable name, and returns a  pointer  to  the  corresponding  value
       string.

       The  GNU-specific  secure_getenv()  function is just like getenv() except
       that it returns NULL in  cases  where  &quot;secure  execution&quot;  is  required.
       Secure  execution is required if one of the following conditions was true
       when the program run by the calling process was loaded:

       *  the process&apos;s effective user ID did not match its real user ID or  the
          process&apos;s  effective  group  ID did not match its real group ID (typi&#8208;
          cally this is the result of executing a  set-user-ID  or  set-group-ID
          program);

       *  the effective capability bit was set on the executable file; or

       *  the process has a nonempty permitted capability set.

       Secure  execution  may  also required if triggered by some Linux security
       modules.

       The secure_getenv() function  is  intended  for  use  in  general-purpose
       libraries  to  avoid  vulnerabilities  that could occur if set-user-ID or
       set-group-ID programs accidentally trusted the environment.

RETURN VALUE
       The getenv() function returns a pointer to the value in the  environment,
       or NULL if there is no match.

CONFORMING TO
       getenv(): SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

       secure_getenv() is a GNU extension.

VERSIONS
       secure_getenv() first appeared in glibc 2.17.

NOTES
       The strings in the environment list are of the form name=value.

       As  typically  implemented, getenv() returns a pointer to a string within
       the environment list.  The caller must  take  care  not  to  modify  this
       string, since that would change the environment of the process.

       The  implementation  of  getenv()  is  not required to be reentrant.  The
       string pointed to by the return value of getenv() may be statically allo&#8208;
       cated,  and  can be modified by a subsequent call to getenv(), putenv(3),
       setenv(3), or unsetenv(3).

       The &quot;secure execution&quot; mode  of  secure_getenv()  is  controlled  by  the
       AT_SECURE  flag  contained in the auxiliary vector passed from the kernel
       to user space.
