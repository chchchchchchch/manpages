GETFSENT(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                GETFSENT(3)



NAME
       getfsent, getfsspec, getfsfile, setfsent, endfsent - handle fstab entries

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fstab.h&gt;

       void endfsent(void);

       struct fstab *getfsent(void);

       struct fstab *getfsfile(const char *mount_point);

       struct fstab *getfsspec(const char *special_file);

       int setfsent(void);

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  read  from  the  file  /etc/fstab.  The struct fstab is
       defined by:

           struct fstab {
               char       *fs_spec;       /* block device name */
               char       *fs_file;       /* mount point */
               char       *fs_vfstype;    /* file-sysem type */
               char       *fs_mntops;     /* mount options */
               const char *fs_type;       /* rw/rq/ro/sw/xx option */
               int         fs_freq;       /* dump frequency, in days */
               int         fs_passno;     /* pass number on parallel dump */
           };

       Here the field fs_type contains (on  a  *BSD  system)  one  of  the  five
       strings  &quot;rw&quot;, &quot;rq&quot;, &quot;ro&quot;, &quot;sw&quot;, &quot;xx&quot; (read-write, read-write with quota,
       read-only, swap, ignore).

       The function setfsent() opens the file when required and positions it  at
       the first line.

       The function getfsent() parses the next line from the file.  (After open&#8208;
       ing it when required.)

       The function endfsent() closes the file when required.

       The function getfsspec() searches the file from the start and returns the
       first  entry  found  for which the fs_spec field matches the special_file
       argument.

       The function getfsfile() searches the file from the start and returns the
       first  entry  found  for  which the fs_file field matches the mount_point
       argument.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon success, the  functions  getfsent(),  getfsfile(),  and  getfsspec()
       return  a  pointer  to  a struct fstab, while setfsent() returns 1.  Upon
       failure or end-of-file, these functions return NULL and 0, respectively.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are not in POSIX.1-2001.  Several operating systems  have
       them,  e.g.,  *BSD,  SunOS,  Digital  UNIX,  AIX  (which also has a getf&#8208;
       stype()).  HP-UX has functions of the same  names,  that  however  use  a
       struct  checklist  instead  of  a struct fstab, and calls these functions
       obsolete, superseded by getmntent(3).
&#12;NOTES
       These functions are not thread-safe.

       Since Linux allows mounting a block special device in several places, and
       since  several  devices  can  have  the  same mount point, where the last
       device with a given mount point is the interesting one, while getfsfile()
       and getfsspec() only return the first occurrence, these two functions are
       not suitable for use under Linux.
