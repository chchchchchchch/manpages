GETGROUPLIST(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            GETGROUPLIST(3)



NAME
       getgrouplist - get list of groups to which a user belongs

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;grp.h&gt;

       int getgrouplist(const char *user, gid_t group,
                        gid_t *groups, int *ngroups);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getgrouplist(): _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  getgrouplist()  function  scans the group database (see group(5)) to
       obtain the list of groups that user belongs to.  Up to *ngroups of  these
       groups are returned in the array groups.

       If  it  was  not among the groups defined for user in the group database,
       then group is included in the list of groups returned by  getgrouplist();
       typically  this  argument  is specified as the group ID from the password
       record for user.

       The ngroups argument is a value-result argument: on return it always con&#8208;
       tains  the  number  of groups found for user, including group; this value
       may be greater than the number of groups stored in groups.

RETURN VALUE
       If the number of groups of which user is a member is less than  or  equal
       to *ngroups, then the value *ngroups is returned.

       If the user is a member of more than *ngroups groups, then getgrouplist()
       returns -1.  In this case the value returned in *ngroups can be  used  to
       resize the buffer passed to a further call getgrouplist().

VERSIONS
       This function is present since glibc 2.2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is nonstandard; it appears on most BSDs.

BUGS
       In  glibc versions before 2.3.3, the implementation of this function con&#8208;
       tains a buffer-overrun bug: it returns the complete list  of  groups  for
       user  in  the  array  groups,  even  when  the  number  of groups exceeds
       *ngroups.

EXAMPLE
       The program below displays the group list for the user named in its first
       command-line  argument.   The  second command-line argument specifies the
       ngroups value to be supplied to getgrouplist().  The following shell ses&#8208;
       sion shows examples of the use of this program:

           $ ./a.out cecilia 0
           getgrouplist() returned -1; ngroups = 3
           $ ./a.out cecilia 3
           ngroups = 3
           16 (dialout)
           33 (video)
           100 (users)
