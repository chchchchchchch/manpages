GETHOSTID(3)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               GETHOSTID(3)



NAME
       gethostid,  sethostid  -  get or set the unique identifier of the current
       host

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       long gethostid(void);
       int sethostid(long hostid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       gethostid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
       sethostid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)

DESCRIPTION
       gethostid() and sethostid() respectively get or set a unique 32-bit iden&#8208;
       tifier for the current machine.  The 32-bit identifier is intended to  be
       unique  among all UNIX systems in existence.  This normally resembles the
       Internet address for the local machine, as returned by  gethostbyname(3),
       and thus usually never needs to be set.

       The sethostid() call is restricted to the superuser.

RETURN VALUE
       gethostid()  returns the 32-bit identifier for the current host as set by
       sethostid().

       On success, sethostid() returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       sethostid() can fail with the following errors:

       EACCES The  caller  did  not have permission to write to the file used to
              store the host ID.

       EPERM  The calling process&apos;s effective user or group ID is not  the  same
              as its corresponding real ID.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD;  these  functions  were  dropped  in 4.4BSD.  SVr4 includes geth&#8208;
       ostid() but not sethostid().  POSIX.1-2001 specifies gethostid() but  not
       sethostid().

NOTES
       In   the   glibc  implementation,  the  hostid  is  stored  in  the  file
       /etc/hostid.  (In glibc versions before 2.2, the file /var/adm/hostid was
       used.)

       In the glibc implementation, if gethostid() cannot open the file contain&#8208;
       ing the host ID, then  it  obtains  the  hostname  using  gethostname(2),
       passes  that hostname to gethostbyname_r(3) in order to obtain the host&apos;s
       IPv4 address, and returns a value  obtained  by  bit-twiddling  the  IPv4
       address.  (This value may not be unique.)

BUGS
       It is impossible to ensure that the identifier is globally unique.
