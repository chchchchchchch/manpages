GETNETENT_R(3)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             GETNETENT_R(3)



NAME
       getnetent_r,  getnetbyname_r,  getnetbyaddr_r  - get network entry (reen&#8208;
       trant)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

       int getnetent_r(struct netent *result_buf, char *buf,
                       size_t buflen, struct netent **result,
                       int *h_errnop);

       int getnetbyname_r(const char *name,
                       struct netent *result_buf, char *buf,
                       size_t buflen, struct netent **result,
                       int *h_errnop);

       int getnetbyaddr_r(uint32_t net, int type,
                       struct netent *result_buf, char *buf,
                       size_t buflen, struct netent **result,
                       int *h_errnop);

DESCRIPTION
       The getnetent_r(), getnetbyname_r(), and getnetbyaddr_r()  functions  are
       the  reentrant  equivalents  of,  respectively,  getnetent(3),  getnetby&#8208;
       name(3), and getnetbynumber(3).  They differ in the way that  the  netent
       structure  is  returned, and in the function calling signature and return
       value.  This manual page describes just the differences from the nonreen&#8208;
       trant functions.

       Instead of returning a pointer to a statically allocated netent structure
       as the function result, these functions copy the structure into the loca&#8208;
       tion pointed to by result_buf.

       The  buf  array  is  used  to  store  the string fields pointed to by the
       returned netent structure.  (The nonreentrant  functions  allocate  these
       strings  in  static  storage.)   The  size  of this array is specified in
       buflen.  If buf is too small, the call fails with the error  ERANGE,  and
       the caller must try again with a larger buffer.  (A buffer of length 1024
       bytes should be sufficient for most applications.)

       If the function call successfully obtains a network record, then  *result
       is set pointing to result_buf; otherwise, *result is set to NULL.

       The  buffer pointed to by h_errnop is used to return the value that would
       be stored in the global variable h_errno by the nonreentrant versions  of
       these functions.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these functions return 0.  On error, they return one of the
       positive error numbers listed in ERRORS.

       On error, record not found (getnetbyname_r(), getnetbyaddr_r()),  or  end
       of input (getnetent_r()) result is set to NULL.

ERRORS
       ENOENT (getnetent_r()) No more records in database.
&#12;       ERANGE buf  is  too small.  Try again with a larger buffer (and increased
              buflen).

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.  Functions with similar  names  exist
       on  some  other  systems,  though typically with different calling signa&#8208;
       tures.
