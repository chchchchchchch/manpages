GETOPT(1)                         User Commands                        GETOPT(1)



NAME
       getopt - parse command options (enhanced)

SYNOPSIS
       getopt optstring parameters
       getopt [options] [--] optstring parameters
       getopt [options] -o|--options optstring [options] [--] parameters

DESCRIPTION
       getopt  is  used  to  break  up (parse) options in command lines for easy
       parsing by shell procedures, and to check for legal options.  It uses the
       GNU getopt(3) routines to do this.

       The  parameters  getopt  is  called  with  can be divided into two parts:
       options which modify the way getopt will parse (options and  -o|--options
       optstring  in  the  SYNOPSIS),  and the parameters which are to be parsed
       (parameters in the SYNOPSIS).  The second part will start  at  the  first
       non-option  parameter  that is not an option argument, or after the first
       occurrence of `--&apos;.  If no `-o&apos; or `--options&apos; option  is  found  in  the
       first  part,  the first parameter of the second part is used as the short
       options string.

       If the environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set,  or  if  its  first
       parameter  is not an option (does not start with a `-&apos;, this is the first
       format in the SYNOPSIS), getopt will generate output that  is  compatible
       with  that  of  other  versions of getopt(1).  It will still do parameter
       shuffling and recognize optional arguments (see section COMPATIBILITY for
       more information).

       Traditional  implementations  of getopt(1) are unable to cope with white&#8208;
       space and other (shell-specific)  special  characters  in  arguments  and
       non-option  parameters.  To  solve  this problem, this implementation can
       generate quoted output which must once again be interpreted by the  shell
       (usually  by  using  the eval command). This has the effect of preserving
       those characters, but you must call getopt in a way  that  is  no  longer
       compatible  with other versions (the second or third format in the SYNOP&#8208;
       SIS).  To  determine  whether  this  enhanced  version  of  getopt(1)  is
       installed, a special test option (-T) can be used.

OPTIONS
       -a, --alternative
              Allow long options to start with a single `-&apos;.

       -h, --help
              Output  a small usage guide and exit successfully. No other output
              is generated.

       -l, --longoptions longopts
              The long (multi-character) options to be  recognized.   More  than
              one  option name may be specified at once, by separating the names
              with commas. This option may be given more than once, the longopts
              are cumulative.  Each long option name in longopts may be followed
              by one colon to indicate it has a required argument,  and  by  two
              colons to indicate it has an optional argument.

       -n, --name progname
              The  name  that  will  be  used  by the getopt(3) routines when it
              reports errors. Note that errors of getopt(1) are  still  reported
              as coming from getopt.

       -o, --options shortopts
              The short (one-character) options to be recognized. If this option
              is not found, the first parameter of getopt that  does  not  start
              with  a  `-&apos;  (and is not an option argument) is used as the short
              options string.  Each short option character in shortopts  may  be
              followed  by one colon to indicate it has a required argument, and
              by two colons to indicate it has an optional argument.  The  first
              character  of  shortopts  may  be  `+&apos; or `-&apos; to influence the way
              options are parsed and output is generated (see  section  SCANNING
              MODES for details).

       -q, --quiet
              Disable error reporting by getopt(3).

       -Q, --quiet-output
              Do  not  generate  normal  output.  Errors  are  still reported by
              getopt(3), unless you also use -q.

       -s, --shell shell
              Set quoting conventions to those of shell. If no  -s  argument  is
              found,  the  BASH  conventions  are used. Valid arguments are cur&#8208;
              rently `sh&apos; `bash&apos;, `csh&apos;, and `tcsh&apos;.

       -u, --unquoted
              Do  not  quote  the  output.  Note  that  whitespace  and  special
              (shell-dependent)  characters  can  cause havoc in this mode (like
              they do with other getopt(1) implementations).

       -T, --test
              Test if your getopt(1) is this enhanced version or an old version.
              This  generates  no  output, and sets the error status to 4. Other
              implementations of getopt(1), and this version if the  environment
              variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, will return `--&apos; and error sta&#8208;
              tus 0.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit successfully. No other  output
              is generated.

PARSING
       This section specifies the format of the second part of the parameters of
       getopt (the parameters in  the  SYNOPSIS).   The  next  section  (OUTPUT)
       describes  the  output that is generated. These parameters were typically
       the parameters a shell function was called with.  Care must be taken that
       each  parameter the shell function was called with corresponds to exactly
       one parameter in the parameter list of getopt (see  the  EXAMPLES).   All
       parsing is done by the GNU getopt(3) routines.

       The  parameters  are parsed from left to right. Each parameter is classi&#8208;
       fied as a short option, a long option, an argument to  an  option,  or  a
       non-option parameter.

       A  simple  short option is a `-&apos; followed by a short option character. If
       the option has a required argument, it may be written directly after  the
       option character or as the next parameter (ie. separated by whitespace on
       the command line). If the option has an optional  argument,  it  must  be
       written directly after the option character if present.

       It is possible to specify several short options after one `-&apos;, as long as
       all (except possibly the last) do not have  required  or  optional  argu&#8208;
       ments.

       A long option normally begins with `--&apos; followed by the long option name.
       If the option has a required argument, it may be written  directly  after
       the long option name, separated by `=&apos;, or as the next argument (ie. sep&#8208;
       arated by whitespace on the command line).  If the option has an optional
       argument,  it  must be written directly after the long option name, sepa&#8208;
       rated by `=&apos;, if present (if you add the `=&apos; but nothing behind it, it is
       interpreted  as if no argument was present; this is a slight bug, see the
       BUGS).  Long options may be abbreviated, as long as the  abbreviation  is
       not ambiguous.

       Each  parameter not starting with a `-&apos;, and not a required argument of a
       previous option, is a non-option parameter. Each parameter after  a  `--&apos;
       parameter  is always interpreted as a non-option parameter.  If the envi&#8208;
       ronment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, or if the  short  option  string
       started   with  a  `+&apos;,  all  remaining  parameters  are  interpreted  as
       non-option parameters as soon as the first non-option parameter is found.

OUTPUT
       Output is generated for each element described in the  previous  section.
       Output  is  done  in  the same order as the elements are specified in the
       input, except for non-option parameters. Output can be done in compatible
       (unquoted) mode, or in such way that whitespace and other special charac&#8208;
       ters within arguments and non-option parameters are preserved (see  QUOT&#8208;
       ING).   When the output is processed in the shell script, it will seem to
       be composed of distinct elements that can be processed  one  by  one  (by
       using  the  shift  command in most shell languages). This is imperfect in
       unquoted mode, as elements can be split at unexpected places if they con&#8208;
       tain whitespace or special characters.

       If  there  are  problems  parsing  the  parameters, for example because a
       required argument is not found or an option is not recognized,  an  error
       will  be  reported  on  stderr, there will be no output for the offending
       element, and a non-zero error status is returned.

       For a short option, a single `-&apos; and the option character  are  generated
       as  one parameter. If the option has an argument, the next parameter will
       be the argument. If the option takes an optional argument, but  none  was
       found, the next parameter will be generated but be empty in quoting mode,
       but no second parameter will be generated in unquoted (compatible)  mode.
       Note  that  many  other getopt(1) implementations do not support optional
       arguments.

       If several short options were specified after a single `-&apos;, each will  be
       present in the output as a separate parameter.

       For  a  long  option,  `--&apos; and the full option name are generated as one
       parameter. This is done regardless whether the option was abbreviated  or
       specified  with  a single `-&apos; in the input. Arguments are handled as with
       short options.

       Normally, no non-option parameters output is generated until all  options
       and their arguments have been generated. Then `--&apos; is generated as a sin&#8208;
       gle parameter, and after it the non-option parameters in the  order  they
       were found, each as a separate parameter.  Only if the first character of
       the short options string was a `-&apos;, non-option parameter output is gener&#8208;
       ated  at  the place they are found in the input (this is not supported if
       the first format of the SYNOPSIS is used;  in  that  case  all  preceding
       occurrences of `-&apos; and `+&apos; are ignored).

QUOTING
       In  compatible  mode,  whitespace or &apos;special&apos; characters in arguments or
       non-option parameters are not handled correctly. As the output is fed  to
       the  shell  script,  the script does not know how it is supposed to break
       the output into separate parameters.  To circumvent  this  problem,  this
       implementation  offers quoting. The idea is that output is generated with
       quotes around each parameter. When this output is once again fed  to  the
       shell (usually by a shell eval command), it is split correctly into sepa&#8208;
       rate parameters.

       Quoting is not enabled if the environment variable  GETOPT_COMPATIBLE  is
       set,  if the first form of the SYNOPSIS is used, or if the option `-u&apos; is
       found.

       Different shells use different quoting conventions. You can use the  `-s&apos;
       option  to  select the shell you are using. The following shells are cur&#8208;
       rently supported: `sh&apos;, `bash&apos;, `csh&apos; and  `tcsh&apos;.   Actually,  only  two
       `flavors&apos;  are  distinguished:  sh-like  quoting conventions and csh-like
       quoting conventions. Chances are that if you  use  another  shell  script
       language, one of these flavors can still be used.


SCANNING MODES
       The  first character of the short options string may be a `-&apos; or a `+&apos; to
       indicate a special scanning mode. If the first calling form in the SYNOP&#8208;
       SIS is used they are ignored; the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
       still examined, though.

       If  the  first  character  is  `+&apos;,  or  if  the   environment   variable
       POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  set,  parsing  stops as soon as the first non-option
       parameter (ie. a parameter that does not start with a `-&apos;) is found  that
       is  not  an option argument. The remaining parameters are all interpreted
       as non-option parameters.

       If the first character is a `-&apos;, non-option parameters are  outputted  at
       the  place  where  they are found; in normal operation, they are all col&#8208;
       lected at the end of output after a `--&apos; parameter  has  been  generated.
       Note  that  this `--&apos; parameter is still generated, but it will always be
       the last parameter in this mode.

COMPATIBILITY
       This version of getopt(1) is written to be as compatible as  possible  to
       other versions. Usually you can just replace them with this version with&#8208;
       out any modifications, and with some advantages.

       If the first character of the first parameter of getopt  is  not  a  `-&apos;,
       getopt  goes into compatibility mode. It will interpret its first parame&#8208;
       ter as the string of short options,  and  all  other  arguments  will  be
       parsed.  It will still do parameter shuffling (ie. all non-option parame&#8208;
       ters  are  outputted  at  the  end),  unless  the  environment   variable
       POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

       The environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE forces getopt into compatibil&#8208;
       ity mode. Setting both  this  environment  variable  and  POSIXLY_CORRECT
       offers 100% compatibility for `difficult&apos; programs. Usually, though, nei&#8208;
       ther is needed.

       In compatibility mode, leading  `-&apos;  and  `+&apos;  characters  in  the  short
       options string are ignored.

RETURN CODES
       getopt  returns  error  code  0  for  successful  parsing, 1 if getopt(3)
       returns errors, 2 if it does not understand its own parameters, 3  if  an
       internal error occurs like out-of-memory, and 4 if it is called with -T.

EXAMPLES
       Example  scripts  for  (ba)sh  and (t)csh are provided with the getopt(1)
       distribution,  and  are  optionally  installed  in   /usr/share/doc/util-
       linux/examples.


ENVIRONMENT
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              This  environment  variable is examined by the getopt(3) routines.
              If it is set, parsing stops as soon as a parameter is  found  that
              is  not  an option or an option argument. All remaining parameters
              are also interpreted as non-option parameters, regardless  whether
              they start with a `-&apos;.

       GETOPT_COMPATIBLE
              Forces  getopt to use the first calling format as specified in the
              SYNOPSIS.
&#12;BUGS
       getopt(3) can parse long options with optional arguments that  are  given
       an  empty optional argument (but can not do this for short options). This
       getopt(1) treats optional arguments that are empty as if  they  were  not
       present.

       The  syntax  if  you do not want any short option variables at all is not
       very intuitive (you have to set them explicitly to the empty string).
