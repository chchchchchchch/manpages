DESCRIPTION
       The getopt() function parses the command-line arguments.   Its  arguments
       argc  and  argv  are the argument count and array as passed to the main()
       function on program invocation.  An element of argv that starts with  &apos;-&apos;
       (and is not exactly &quot;-&quot; or &quot;--&quot;) is an option element.  The characters of
       this element (aside from the initial  &apos;-&apos;)  are  option  characters.   If
       getopt() is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option
       characters from each of the option elements.

       The variable optind is the index of the next element to be  processed  in
       argv.   The  system initializes this value to 1.  The caller can reset it
       to 1 to restart scanning of the same argv, or when scanning a  new  argu&#8208;
       ment vector.

       If  getopt()  finds  another option character, it returns that character,
       updating the external variable optind and a static variable  nextchar  so
       that  the  next  call  to getopt() can resume the scan with the following
       option character or argv-element.

       If there are no more option characters, getopt() returns -1.  Then optind
       is the index in argv of the first argv-element that is not an option.

       optstring  is  a  string containing the legitimate option characters.  If
       such a character is followed by a colon, the option requires an argument,
       so  getopt() places a pointer to the following text in the same argv-ele&#8208;
       ment, or the text of the following argv-element, in optarg.   Two  colons
       mean  an  option  takes  an optional arg; if there is text in the current
       argv-element (i.e., in the same word as the option name itself, for exam&#8208;
       ple,  &quot;-oarg&quot;), then it is returned in optarg, otherwise optarg is set to
       zero.  This is a GNU extension.  If optstring contains W  followed  by  a
       semicolon,  then  -W  foo  is  treated as the long option --foo.  (The -W
       option is reserved  by  POSIX.2  for  implementation  extensions.)   This
       behavior is a GNU extension, not available with libraries before glibc 2.
&#12;       By  default,  getopt() permutes the contents of argv as it scans, so that
       eventually all the nonoptions are at the end.  Two other modes  are  also
       implemented.   If the first character of optstring is &apos;+&apos; or the environ&#8208;
       ment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then  option  processing  stops  as
       soon  as  a nonoption argument is encountered.  If the first character of
       optstring is &apos;-&apos;, then each nonoption argv-element is handled  as  if  it
       were  the  argument of an option with character code 1.  (This is used by
       programs that were written to expect options and other  argv-elements  in
       any  order  and  that  care  about the ordering of the two.)  The special
       argument &quot;--&quot; forces an end of option-scanning regardless of the scanning
       mode.

       If  getopt()  does  not recognize an option character, it prints an error
       message to stderr, stores the character in optopt, and returns &apos;?&apos;.   The
       calling program may prevent the error message by setting opterr to 0.

       If  getopt()  finds  an option character in argv that was not included in
       optstring, or if it detects a missing option argument, it returns &apos;?&apos; and
       sets the external variable optopt to the actual option character.  If the
       first character (following any optional &apos;+&apos; or &apos;-&apos;  described  above)  of
       optstring  is  a colon (&apos;:&apos;), then getopt() returns &apos;:&apos; instead of &apos;?&apos; to
       indicate a missing option argument.  If an error was  detected,  and  the
       first  character  of  optstring is not a colon, and the external variable
       opterr is nonzero (which is the default), getopt() prints an  error  mes&#8208;
       sage.

   getopt_long() and getopt_long_only()
       The  getopt_long()  function  works  like  getopt()  except  that it also
       accepts long options, started with two dashes.  (If the  program  accepts
       only  long options, then optstring should be specified as an empty string
       (&quot;&quot;), not NULL.)  Long option names may be abbreviated if  the  abbrevia&#8208;
       tion  is  unique  or  is  an exact match for some defined option.  A long
       option may take a parameter, of the form --arg=param or --arg param.

       longopts is a pointer to the first element of an array of  struct  option
       declared in &lt;getopt.h&gt; as

           struct option {
               const char *name;
               int         has_arg;
               int        *flag;
               int         val;
           };

       The meanings of the different fields are:

       name   is the name of the long option.

       has_arg
              is:  no_argument  (or  0) if the option does not take an argument;
              required_argument (or 1) if the option requires  an  argument;  or
              optional_argument (or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

       flag   specifies  how results are returned for a long option.  If flag is
              NULL, then getopt_long() returns val.  (For example,  the  calling
              program  may  set  val  to the equivalent short option character.)
              Otherwise, getopt_long() returns 0, and flag points to a  variable
              which  is set to val if the option is found, but left unchanged if
              the option is not found.

       val    is the value to return, or to load into the variable pointed to by
              flag.

       The last element of the array has to be filled with zeros.

       If  longindex  is  not  NULL, it points to a variable which is set to the
       index of the long option relative to longopts.

       getopt_long_only() is like getopt_long(), but &apos;-&apos; as  well  as  &quot;--&quot;  can
       indicate  a  long  option.   If an option that starts with &apos;-&apos; (not &quot;--&quot;)
       doesn&apos;t match a long option, but does match a short option, it is  parsed
       as a short option instead.

RETURN VALUE
       If  an  option  was  successfully found, then getopt() returns the option
       character.  If all command-line options have been parsed,  then  getopt()
       returns  -1.   If getopt() encounters an option character that was not in
       optstring, then &apos;?&apos; is returned.  If getopt() encounters an option with a
       missing argument, then the return value depends on the first character in
       optstring: if it is &apos;:&apos;, then &apos;:&apos; is returned; otherwise &apos;?&apos; is returned.

       getopt_long() and getopt_long_only() also  return  the  option  character
       when a short option is recognized.  For a long option, they return val if
       flag is NULL, and 0 otherwise.  Error and -1 returns are the same as  for
       getopt(), plus &apos;?&apos; for an ambiguous match or an extraneous parameter.

ENVIRONMENT
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If  this  is set, then option processing stops as soon as a nonop&#8208;
              tion argument is encountered.

       _&lt;PID&gt;_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_
              This variable was used by bash(1)  2.0  to  communicate  to  glibc
              which  arguments  are  the  results  of  wildcard expansion and so
              should not be considered as options.  This behavior was removed in
              bash(1) version 2.01, but the support remains in glibc.

CONFORMING TO
       getopt():
              POSIX.2   and  POSIX.1-2001,  provided  the  environment  variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  Otherwise, the elements  of  argv  aren&apos;t
              really  const,  because we permute them.  We pretend they&apos;re const
              in the prototype to be compatible with other systems.

              The use of &apos;+&apos; and &apos;-&apos; in optstring is a GNU extension.

              On some older implementations, getopt() was declared in &lt;stdio.h&gt;.
              SUSv1  permitted the declaration to appear in either &lt;unistd.h&gt; or
              &lt;stdio.h&gt;.  POSIX.1-2001 marked the use of &lt;stdio.h&gt; for this pur&#8208;
              pose  as  LEGACY.   POSIX.1-2001 does not allow the declaration to
              appear in &lt;stdio.h&gt;.

       getopt_long() and getopt_long_only():
              These functions are GNU extensions.

NOTES
       A program that scans multiple argument vectors, or rescans the same  vec&#8208;
       tor  more  than once, and wants to make use of GNU extensions such as &apos;+&apos;
       and &apos;-&apos; at the start of optstring, or changes the value  of  POSIXLY_COR&#8208;
       RECT  between scans, must reinitialize getopt() by resetting optind to 0,
       rather than the traditional value of 1.  (Resetting to 0 forces the invo&#8208;
       cation  of  an internal initialization routine that rechecks POSIXLY_COR&#8208;
       RECT and checks for GNU extensions in optstring.)

BUGS
       The POSIX.2 specification of getopt() has a technical error described  in
       POSIX.2  Interpretation  150.   The  GNU implementation (and probably all
       other implementations) implements the correct behavior rather  than  that
       specified.

EXAMPLE
       The following trivial example program uses getopt() to handle two program
       options: -n, with no associated value; and -t val, which expects an asso&#8208;
       ciated value.

       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int flags, opt;
           int nsecs, tfnd;

           nsecs = 0;
           tfnd = 0;
           flags = 0;
           while ((opt = getopt(argc, argv, &quot;nt:&quot;)) != -1) {
               switch (opt) {
               case &apos;n&apos;:
                   flags = 1;
                   break;
               case &apos;t&apos;:
                   nsecs = atoi(optarg);
                   tfnd = 1;
                   break;
               default: /* &apos;?&apos; */
                   fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s [-t nsecs] [-n] name\n&quot;,
                           argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }
           }

           printf(&quot;flags=%d; tfnd=%d; optind=%d\n&quot;, flags, tfnd, optind);

           if (optind &gt;= argc) {
               fprintf(stderr, &quot;Expected argument after options\n&quot;);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf(&quot;name argument = %s\n&quot;, argv[optind]);

           /* Other code omitted */

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }

       The  following  example program illustrates the use of getopt_long() with
       most of its features.

       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;     /* for printf */
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;    /* for exit */
       #include &lt;getopt.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
           int c;
           int digit_optind = 0;

           while (1) {
               int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;
               int option_index = 0;
               static struct option long_options[] = {
                   {&quot;add&quot;,     required_argument, 0,  0 },
                   {&quot;append&quot;,  no_argument,       0,  0 },
                   {&quot;delete&quot;,  required_argument, 0,  0 },
                   {&quot;verbose&quot;, no_argument,       0,  0 },
                   {&quot;create&quot;,  required_argument, 0, &apos;c&apos;},
                   {&quot;file&quot;,    required_argument, 0,  0 },
                   {0,         0,                 0,  0 }
               };

               c = getopt_long(argc, argv, &quot;abc:d:012&quot;,
                        long_options, &amp;option_index);
               if (c == -1)
                   break;

                     printf(&quot;digits occur in two different argv-elements.\n&quot;);
                   digit_optind = this_option_optind;
