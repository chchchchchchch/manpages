GETPAGESIZE(2)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             GETPAGESIZE(2)



NAME
       getpagesize - get memory page size

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int getpagesize(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpagesize():
           Since glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE ||
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600)
           Before glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The function getpagesize() returns the number of bytes in a memory  page,
       where  &quot;page&quot; is a fixed-length block, the unit for memory allocation and
       file mapping performed by mmap(2).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.4BSD, SUSv2.  In SUSv2 the getpagesize() call is labeled  LEGACY,
       and in POSIX.1-2001 it has been dropped; HP-UX does not have this call.

NOTES
       Portable applications should employ sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) instead of get&#8208;
       pagesize():

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           long sz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);

       (Most systems allow the synonym _SC_PAGE_SIZE for _SC_PAGESIZE.)

       Whether getpagesize() is present as a Linux system call  depends  on  the
       architecture.   If  it  is, it returns the kernel symbol PAGE_SIZE, whose
       value depends on the architecture and machine model.  Generally, one uses
       binaries  that  are  dependent on the architecture but not on the machine
       model, in order to have a single binary  distribution  per  architecture.
       This  means that a user program should not find PAGE_SIZE at compile time
       from a header file, but use an actual system call,  at  least  for  those
       architectures  (like  sun4)  where  this  dependency exists.  Here libc4,
       libc5, glibc 2.0 fail because their getpagesize()  returns  a  statically
       derived  value,  and  does not use a system call.  Things are OK in glibc
       2.1.
