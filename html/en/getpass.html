GETPASS(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 GETPASS(3)



NAME
       getpass - get a password

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       char *getpass( const char *prompt);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpass():
           Since glibc 2.2.2:
               _BSD_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
                       _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &amp;&amp;
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600)
           Before glibc 2.2.2: none

DESCRIPTION
       This function is obsolete.  Do not use it.

       The  getpass()  function  opens /dev/tty (the controlling terminal of the
       process), outputs the string prompt, turns off echoing,  reads  one  line
       (the &quot;password&quot;), restores the terminal state and closes /dev/tty again.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  getpass()  returns a pointer to a static buffer containing
       (the first PASS_MAX bytes of) the password without the trailing  newline,
       terminated  by  a  null byte (&apos;\0&apos;).  This buffer may be overwritten by a
       following call.  On error, the terminal state is restored, errno  is  set
       appropriately, and NULL is returned.

ERRORS
       The function may fail if

       ENXIO  The process does not have a controlling terminal.

FILES
       /dev/tty

CONFORMING TO
       Present in SUSv2, but marked LEGACY.  Removed in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       For libc4 and libc5, the prompt is not written to /dev/tty but to stderr.
       Moreover, if /dev/tty cannot be opened, the password is read from  stdin.
       The  static buffer has length 128 so that only the first 127 bytes of the
       password are returned.  While reading  the  password,  signal  generation
       (SIGINT,  SIGQUIT,  SIGSTOP,  SIGTSTP)  is disabled and the corresponding
       characters (usually control-C, control-\, control-Z  and  control-Y)  are
       transmitted as part of the password.  Since libc 5.4.19 also line editing
       is disabled, so that also backspace and the like will be seen as part  of
       the password.

       For glibc2, if /dev/tty cannot be opened, the prompt is written to stderr
       and the password is read from stdin.  There is no limit on the length  of
       the password.  Line editing is not disabled.

       According  to  the  SUSv2, the value of PASS_MAX must be defined in &lt;lim&#8208;
       its.h&gt; in case it is smaller than 8, and can  in  any  case  be  obtained
       using  sysconf(_SC_PASS_MAX).   However,  POSIX.2 withdraws the constants
       PASS_MAX and _SC_PASS_MAX, and the function getpass().  Libc4  and  libc5
       have   never   supported   PASS_MAX   or  _SC_PASS_MAX.   Glibc2  accepts
       _SC_PASS_MAX and returns BUFSIZ (e.g., 8192).

BUGS
       The calling process should zero the password as soon as possible to avoid
       leaving the cleartext password visible in the process&apos;s address space.
