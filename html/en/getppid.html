GETPID(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  GETPID(2)



NAME
       getpid, getppid - get process identification

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t getpid(void);
       pid_t getppid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       getpid()  returns  the process ID of the calling process.  (This is often
       used by routines that generate unique temporary filenames.)

       getppid() returns the process ID of the parent of the calling process.

ERRORS
       These functions are always successful.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, SVr4.

NOTES
       Since glibc version 2.3.4, the glibc wrapper function for getpid() caches
       PIDs,  so  as  to avoid additional system calls when a process calls get&#8208;
       pid() repeatedly.  Normally this caching is invisible,  but  its  correct
       operation  relies  on  support  in  the  wrapper  functions  for fork(2),
       vfork(2), and clone(2): if an application bypasses the glibc wrappers for
       these  system  calls  by using syscall(2), then a call to getpid() in the
       child will return the wrong value (to be precise: it will return the  PID
       of the parent process).  See also clone(2) for discussion of a case where
       getpid() may return the wrong value even when invoking clone(2)  via  the
       glibc wrapper function.
