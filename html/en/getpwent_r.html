GETPWENT_R(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              GETPWENT_R(3)



NAME
       getpwent_r, fgetpwent_r - get passwd file entry reentrantly

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;

       int getpwent_r(struct passwd *pwbuf, char *buf,
                      size_t buflen, struct passwd **pwbufp);

       int fgetpwent_r(FILE *fp, struct passwd *pwbuf, char *buf,
                       size_t buflen, struct passwd **pwbufp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpwent_r(), _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
       fgetpwent_r(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  functions  getpwent_r() and fgetpwent_r() are the reentrant versions
       of getpwent(3) and fgetpwent(3).  The former reads the next passwd  entry
       from  the  stream  initialized by setpwent(3).  The latter reads the next
       passwd entry from the stream fp.

       The passwd structure is defined in &lt;pwd.h&gt; as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char    *pw_name;      /* username */
               char    *pw_passwd;    /* user password */
               uid_t    pw_uid;       /* user ID */
               gid_t    pw_gid;       /* group ID */
               char    *pw_gecos;     /* user information */
               char    *pw_dir;       /* home directory */
               char    *pw_shell;     /* shell program */
           };

       For more information about the fields of this structure, see passwd(5).

       The nonreentrant functions return a pointer to static storage, where this
       static  storage  contains  further pointers to user name, password, gecos
       field, home directory and shell.  The reentrant functions described  here
       return all of that in caller-provided buffers.  First of all there is the
       buffer pwbuf that can hold a struct passwd.  And next the buffer  buf  of
       size  buflen that can hold additional strings.  The result of these func&#8208;
       tions, the struct passwd read from the stream, is stored in the  provided
       buffer  *pwbuf,  and  a  pointer  to  this  struct  passwd is returned in
       *pwbufp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0 and *pwbufp  is  a  pointer  to  the
       struct  passwd.   On  error,  these  functions  return an error value and
       *pwbufp is NULL.

ERRORS
       ENOENT No more entries.

       ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.  Try again with larger buffer.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions, done in a style resembling the  POSIX
       version of functions like getpwnam_r(3).  Other systems use prototype

           struct passwd *
           getpwent_r(struct passwd *pwd, char *buf, int buflen);

       or, better,

           int
           getpwent_r(struct passwd *pwd, char *buf, int buflen,
                      FILE **pw_fp);

NOTES
       The  function  getpwent_r()  is  not really reentrant since it shares the
       reading position in the stream with all other threads.

EXAMPLE
       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #define BUFLEN 4096

       int
       main(void)
       {
           struct passwd pw, *pwp;
           char buf[BUFLEN];
           int i;

           setpwent();
           while (1) {
               i = getpwent_r(&amp;pw, buf, BUFLEN, &amp;pwp);
               if (i)
                   break;
               printf(&quot;%s (%d)\tHOME %s\tSHELL %s\n&quot;, pwp-&gt;pw_name,
                      pwp-&gt;pw_uid, pwp-&gt;pw_dir, pwp-&gt;pw_shell);
           }
           endpwent();
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
