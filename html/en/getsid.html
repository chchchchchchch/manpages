GETSID(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  GETSID(2)



NAME
       getsid - get session ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t getsid(pid_t pid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getsid():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
           || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       getsid(0)  returns  the  session  ID  of  the calling process.  getsid(p)
       returns the session ID of the process with process ID p.  (The session ID
       of a process is the process group ID of the session leader.)

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  a  session  ID  is  returned.  On error, (pid_t) -1 will be
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  A process with process ID p exists, but it is not in the same ses&#8208;
              sion as the calling process, and the implementation considers this
              an error.

       ESRCH  No process with process ID p was found.

VERSIONS
       This system call is available on Linux since version 2.0.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Linux does not return EPERM.
