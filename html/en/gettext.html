GETTEXT(1)                             GNU                            GETTEXT(1)



NAME
       gettext - translate message

SYNOPSIS
       gettext [OPTION] [[TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID]
       gettext [OPTION] -s [MSGID]...

DESCRIPTION
       The gettext program translates a natural language message into the user&apos;s
       language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog.

       Display native language translation of a textual message.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -n     suppress trailing newline

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID
              retrieve translated message corresponding to MSGID from TEXTDOMAIN

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is  determined  from
       the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is not found
       in the regular directory, another location  can  be  specified  with  the
       environment  variable  TEXTDOMAINDIR.   When  used with the -s option the
       program behaves like the `echo&apos; command.  But it does not simply copy its
       arguments  to stdout.  Instead those messages found in the selected cata&#8208;
       log are translated.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale
