GETWCHAR(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                GETWCHAR(3)



NAME
       getwchar - read a wide character from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t getwchar(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The   getwchar()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       getchar(3) function.  It reads a wide character from  stdin  and  returns
       it.   If  the end of stream is reached, or if ferror(stdin) becomes true,
       it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conversion error  occurs,  it  sets
       errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The  getwchar()  function  returns  the next wide-character from standard
       input, or WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of getwchar() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       It is reasonable to expect that getwchar() will actually read a multibyte
       sequence from standard input and then convert it to a wide character.
