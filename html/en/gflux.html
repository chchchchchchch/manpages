NAME
       gflux - rippling surface graphics hack

SYNOPSIS
       gflux  [-display host:display.screen] [-window] [-root] [-install] [-vis&#8208;
       ual visual] [-delay microseconds] [-squares num] [-resolution num] [-mode
       mode]  [-flat num] [-speed num] [-rotationx num] [-rotationy num] [-rota&#8208;

DESCRIPTION
       The gflux program draws a colourfull animated rippling square rotating in
       3D space.

OPTIONS
       gflux accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -squares num
               Specifies the size of the grid in squares. default 19

       -resolution num
               Specifies the wireframe detail of the squares. default 4

       -mode mode
               Specifies the draw method: wireframe; solid (meaning a solid col&#8208;
               ored  surface); light (same as solid, but with lighting effects);
               checker (a texture-mapped checkerboard pattern); or grab (meaning
               grab an image to manipulate.)

               When  grabbing images, the image will be grabbed from the portion
               of the screen underlying the window, or from the  system&apos;s  video
               input,  or  from a random file on disk, as indicated by the grab&#8208;
               DesktopImages, grabVideoFrames, and chooseRandomImages options in
               the  ~/.xscreensaver  file;  see  xscreensaver-demo(1)  for  more
               details.

       -wireframe
               Same as &quot;-mode wire&quot;.

       -flat num
               0 for smooth shading 1 for flat. default 0

       -speed num
               Specifies speed of ripples flowing over the surface. default 0.05

       -rotationx num -rotationy num -rotationz num
               Specifies the speed of rotation of the surface in these axis

       -waves num
               Specifies the number of ripple centres at any one  time.   Values
               should be greater than 1.  default 3

       -waveChange num
               Specifies  the duration of a ripple centre.  after this they fade
               away to be reborn elsewhere with a different  frequency.  default
               50

       -waveHeight num
               Specifies the height of ripples on the surface. default 1.0

       -waveFreq num
               Specifies the maximum frequency of ripples. default 3.0

       -zoom num
               Specifies  the  size  of  the  viewport.  Smaller values fill the
               screen with rippling surface. default 1.0

       -delay microseconds
               How long to pause between frames.  Default is 20000, or 0.02 sec&#8208;
               ond.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
