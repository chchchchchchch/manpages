gg-types(3)                            GGI                           gg-types(3)



NAME
       gg-types - Portable types defined by libGG

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gg.h&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       LibGG defines a few portable types used by other GGI libraries.  Applica&#8208;
       tion writers may use these types to avoid having  to  handle  os/platform
       specific types directly.

       The following types are defined:

       &#183;   sint8: 8 bits signed integer

       &#183;   uint8: 8 bits unsigned integer

       &#183;   sint16

       &#183;   uint16

       &#183;   sint32

       &#183;   uint32

       &#183;   sint64

       &#183;   uint64

       &#183;   ggi_sint: native signed integer

       &#183;   ggi_uint: native unsigned integer

NOTE
       These  types are now obsoleted by C99 types, and support for them is pro&#8208;
       vided for backward compatibility only.
