ggGetUserDir(3)                        GGI                       ggGetUserDir(3)



NAME
       ggGetUserDir - Get user home directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gg.h&gt;

       const char * ggGetUserDir(void);


DESCRIPTION
       ggGetUserDir  returns  a path to the home directory of the user executing
       an application, whatever it may be on a given system.   For  example,  on
       unix  systems  it  will be the contents of the HOME environment variable.
       If no user home exists, a suitable temporary directory is found.

       ggGetUserDir is threadsafe, but is not guaranteed to be safe to use in  a
       thread  that may be cancelled during its execution.  It is also not guar&#8208;
       anteed to be safe to use in special contexts such as LibGG task handlers,
       signal handlers and asyncronous procedure calls.

RETURN VALUE
       ggGetUserDir  returns  a  NULL-terminated string holding the path the the
       current user home directory.  This string may be a  reference  to  memory
       belonging to OS facilities, and *must not* be freed or altered.
