ggParseOptions(3)                      GGI                     ggParseOptions(3)



NAME
       ggParseOptions - Option parsing

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gg.h&gt;

       char *ggParseOptions(const char *str, gg_option *optlist, int count, int flag);


DESCRIPTION
       ggParseOptions  parses  a  string str of options in LibGG&apos;s option format
       and places the results in the &quot;.name&quot; members of the optlist.  The param&#8208;
       eter  count  specifies  the  length of optlist.  The parameter flags is a
       bitwise or of values that alter behavior, the only one  defined  at  this
       time  being  GG_PARSEOPTS_ALLOW_UNKNOWN,  which,  if  present, will cause
       ggParseOptions to ignore options found in the string for which there  are
       no  matching  entries in optlist (normally this generates a failure and a
       warning message).

       The normal LibGG option format is defined as follows:

       A colon or whitespace is the separator between options.

       Option names consist of any character except parenthesis, colons,  white&#8208;
       space characters, the equals sign (&apos;=&apos;) and the NULL (&apos;0&apos;) character.

       Option  values  may  consist  of any character except the NULL character,
       however in order to include colons, whitespace characters,  or  parenthe&#8208;
       sis,  the  option must be quoted.  Option values that begin with a single
       or double quote are considered to be quoted, and must end with  the  same
       quote  character with which they began.  The quotes are not considered to
       be part of the option value.  In order to include the quote character  in
       use  in   a  quoted  option  value it must be escaped by a backslash (&apos;&apos;)
       character.  Backslashes always escape, even in unquoted  values,  and  so
       must always be escaped with a backslash in order to be included.

       Named  options begin with a dash (-) character followed by an option name
       and may be boolean (present or not) or  may  contain  an  equal  sign  to
       assign  the option a string value (everything following the equal sign up
       to the next forbidden character as described above.)   Matching  is  case
       sensitive,  but  options can be abbreviated right down to a single letter
       as long as the name remains unique among the entries in optlist  and  the
       GG_PARSEOPTS_ALLOW_UNKNOWN flag is not used.

       Unnamed  options  do  not  (duh)  have  a name field and are positionally
       mapped to entries in optlist.  Unnamed options are  processed  after  the
       first  option  field  not starting with a dash is encountered, and occupy
       the rest of the option string.  They are assigned to any unnamed-eligible
       options  (see below) in the order they appear in optlist, but if any were
       previously discovered in named form they forfeit their position  in  that
       order.

       Options  that  are  eligible to be used in an unnamed fashion must have a
       colon or dash prefixed to their optname in the  optlist  when  ggParseOp&#8208;
       tions  is  invoked.  Unnamed options may appear as named options as well.
       ggParseOptions will alter the first character in the  corresponding  opt&#8208;
       name  entry  in  optlist to a colon or to a dash depending on whether the
       option was present in unnamed or  named  form,  respectively.   Thus  the
       caller can determine whether the option was presented in named or unnamed
       form.

       Options that appear in boolean form will  have  the  first  character  in
       their  result changed to &quot;y&quot;.  This can be distinguished from an explicit
       value of &quot;y&quot; because no NULL terminator is appended to the &quot;y&quot;.

       Options that are not found are left unaltered in optlist.

       Option  names  and   values   in   str   are   limited   in   length   to
       GG_MAX_OPTION_NAME  and GG_MAX_OPTION_RESULT bytes, respectively, includ&#8208;
       ing one byte for a terminating NULL character.

RETURN VALUE
       ggParseOptions returns the position in str after the last character of  a
       valid  option  string,  or  NULL  if str was determined not to be a valid
       option string.  Even on failure, the contents of optlist  may  have  been
       altered.
