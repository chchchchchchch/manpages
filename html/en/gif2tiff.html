GIF2TIFF(1)                                                          GIF2TIFF(1)



NAME
       gif2tiff - create a TIFF file from a GIF87 format image file

SYNOPSIS
       gif2tiff [ options ] input.gif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Gif2tiff  converts a file in the GIF87 format to TIFF.  The TIFF image is
       created as a palette image, with samples compressed with the Lempel-Ziv &amp;
       Welch  algorithm  (Compression=5).  These characteristics can overridden,
       or explicitly specified with the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when writing  image  data:  -c
              none  for no compression, -c packbits for the PackBits compression
              algorithm, -c zip for the Deflate compression  algorithm,  and  -c
              lzw for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch (the default).

       -r     Write  data  with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
              the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip is approx&#8208;
              imately 8 kilobytes.

NOTES
       The  program  is based on Paul Haeberli&apos;s fromgif program which, in turn,
       is based on Marcel J.E. Mol&apos;s GIF reader.

BUGS
       Should have more options to control output format.
