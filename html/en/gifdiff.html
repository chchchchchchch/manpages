GIFDIFF(1)                                                            GIFDIFF(1)



NAME
       gifdiff - compares GIF images

SYNOPSIS
       gifdiff [options] GIF-file-1 GIF-file-2

DESCRIPTION
       gifdiff  compares  two GIF files and determines if they appear identical.
       Differences that don&apos;t affect appearance (like colormap ordering  or  how
       much an animation is optimized) are not reported.

       gifdiff  prints  details of any differences it finds. If the GIFs are the
       same, it prints nothing. It exits with status 0 if there were no  differ&#8208;
       ences, 1 if there were some differences, and 2 if there was trouble.

OPTIONS
       --brief, -q
            Report  only whether the GIFs differ, not the details of the differ&#8208;
            ences.

       --ignore-redundancy, -w
            Do not report differences in the numbers of redundant frames (frames
            which do not change the displayed image).

       --help
            Print usage information and exit.

       --version
            Print  the  version number and some quickie warranty information and
            exit.
