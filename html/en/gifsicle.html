GIFSICLE(1)                                                          GIFSICLE(1)



NAME
       gifsicle - manipulates GIF images and animations

SYNOPSIS
       gifsicle [options, frames, and filenames]...

DESCRIPTION
       gifsicle is a powerful command-line program for creating, editing, manip&#8208;
       ulating, and getting information about GIF images and animations.

INTRODUCTION
       Without options, gifsicle acts like a filter: you feed it a GIF on  stan&#8208;
       dard  input,  and it writes that GIF on standard output. That means these
       two commands do the same thing:

            gifsicle &lt; in.gif &gt; out.gif
            gifsicle &lt; in.gif | gifsicle | gifsicle &gt; out.gif

       Not too interesting. Most times you&apos;ll tell gifsicle to alter its  inputs
       by  giving  it command line options. The -i option, for example, tells it
       to interlace its input files:

            gifsicle -i &lt; pic.gif &gt; interlaced-pic.gif

       To modify GIF files in place, you should use  the  --batch  option.  With
       --batch,  gifsicle will modify the files you specify instead of writing a
       new file to the standard output. To interlace all the GIFs in the current
       directory, you could say:

            gifsicle --batch -i *.gif

       gifsicle  is  good  at creating and manipulating GIF animations. The sim&#8208;
       plest way to create an animation is to give more  than  one  input  file,
       which gifsicle will combine to create a ``flipbook&apos;&apos; animation:

            gifsicle pic1.gif pic2.gif pic3.gif &gt; animation.gif

       Use options like --delay, --loopcount, and --optimize to tune your anima&#8208;
       tions; see their descriptions for more details.

       The bulk of this manual page indexes  gifsicle&apos;s  options  and  describes
       them  in  gory detail. New users may want to skip to the Examples section
       at the end.

COMMAND LINE
       gifsicle&apos;s command line consists of GIF input files and options. Most op&#8208;
       tions  start with a dash (-) or plus (+); frame selections, a kind of op&#8208;
       tion, start with a number sign (#). Anything else is a GIF input file.

       gifsicle reads and processes GIF input files in order. If  no  GIF  input
       file  is  given,  or you give the special filename `-&apos;, it reads from the
       standard input.

       gifsicle exits with status 0 if there were no errors and status 1  other&#8208;
       wise.

OPTIONS
       Every  option has a long form, `--long-descriptive-name&apos;.  You don&apos;t need
       to type the whole long descriptive name, just enough to make it unambigu&#8208;
       ous.

       Some options also have a short form, `-X&apos;.  You can combine short options
       if they don&apos;t take arguments: `-IIb&apos; is the same as `-I -I -b&apos;.   But  be
       careful  with  options  that do take arguments: `-cblah&apos; means `-c blah&apos;,
       not `-c -b -l -a -h&apos;.

       Many options also have a converse, `--no-option&apos;, which turns off the op&#8208;
       tion. You can turn off a short option `-X&apos; by saying `+X&apos; instead.

   Mode Options
       Mode  options tell gifsicle what kind of output to generate. There can be
       at most one, and it must precede any GIF inputs.

       --merge, -m
            Combine all GIF inputs into one file with multiple frames and  write
            that file to the standard output. This is the default mode.

       --batch, -b
            Modify  each  GIF  input in place by reading and writing to the same
            filename.  (GIFs read from the standard input  are  written  to  the
            standard output.)

       --explode, -e
            Create  an  output GIF for each frame of each input file. The output
            GIFs are named `xxx.000&apos;, `xxx.001&apos;, and so on, where `xxx&apos;  is  the
            name  of  the input file (or whatever you specified with `--output&apos;)
            and the numeric extension is the frame number.

       --explode-by-name, -E
            Same as --explode, but write any named frames  to  files  `xxx.name&apos;
            instead  of `xxx.frame-number&apos;.  Frames are named using the `--name&apos;
            option.

   General Options
       General options control the information  gifsicle  prints  and  where  it
       writes  its output. The info options and --verbose can be turned off with
       `--no-X&apos;.

       --color-info
            Like --info, but also print  information  about  input  files&apos;  col&#8208;
            ormaps.  --cinfo is a synonym for --color-info.

       --extension-info
            Like  --info,  but  also  print any unrecognized GIF extensions in a
            hexdump(1)-like format.  --xinfo is a synonym for --extension-info.

       --help, -h
            Print usage information and exit.

       --info, -I
            Print a human-readable description of each input GIF to the standard
            output, or whatever file you specify with -o.  This option suppress&#8208;
            es normal output, and cannot be  combined  with  mode  options  like
            --batch.  If you give two --info or -I options, however, normal out&#8208;
            put is not suppressed; information will be printed on  standard  er&#8208;
            ror, and you can supply a mode option.

       -o file
       --output file
            Send  output  to  file.  The special filename `-&apos; means the standard
            output.

       --verbose, -V
            Print progress information (files read and written) to standard  er&#8208;
            ror.

       --no-warnings, -w
            Suppress all warning messages.

       --version
            Print the version number and some short non-warranty information and
            exit.

       --conserve-memory
            Conserve memory usage at the expense of processing time. This may be
            useful  if  you are processing large GIFs on a computer without very
            much memory.

       --nextfile
            Allow input files to contain multiple concatenated GIF images. If  a
            filename  appears  multiple times on the command line, gifsicle will
            read a new image from the file  each  time.  This  option  can  help
            scripts  avoid  the need for temporary files. For example, to create
            an animated GIF with three frames with different delays,  you  might
            run  &quot;gifsicle  --nextfile -d10 - -d20 - -d30 - &gt; out.gif&quot; and write
            the three GIF images, in sequence, to gifsicle&apos;s standard input.

       --multifile
            Like --nextfile, but read as many GIF images as possible  from  each
            file.  This option is intended for scripts. For example, to merge an
            unknown number of GIF images into a single animation, run  &quot;gifsicle
            --multifile  -  &gt; out.gif&quot; and write the GIF images, in sequence, to
            gifsicle&apos;s standard input.  Any frame selections apply only  to  the
            last file in the concatenation.

   Frame Selections
       A frame selection tells gifsicle which frames to use from the current in&#8208;
       put file. They are useful only for animations, as non-animated GIFs  only
       have one frame. Here are the acceptable forms for frame specifications.

       #num         Select  frame  num. (The first frame is `#0&apos;.  Negative num&#8208;
                    bers count backwards from the last frame, which is `#-1&apos;.)
       #num1-num2   Select frames num1 through num2.
       #num1-       Select frames num1 through the last frame.
       #name        Select the frame named name.

       The `#&apos; character has special meaning for many shells, so  you  generally
       need to quote it.

       For example,
            gifsicle happy.gif &quot;#0&quot;
       uses the first frame from happy.gif;
            gifsicle happy.gif &quot;#0-2&quot;
       uses its first three frames; and
            gifsicle happy.gif &quot;#-1-0&quot;
       uses `happy.gif&apos;s frames in reverse order (starting from frame #-1 -- the
       last frame -- and ending at frame #0 -- the first).

       The action performed with the selected  frames  depends  on  the  current
       mode.  In merge mode, only the selected frames are merged into the output
       GIF. In batch mode, only the selected frames are modified;  other  frames
       remain  unchanged. In explode mode, only the selected frames are exploded
       into output GIFs.

   Frame Change Options
       Frame change options insert new frames into an animation  or  replace  or
       delete  frames  that  already exist. Some things -- for example, changing
       one frame in an animation -- are difficult to express with  frame  selec&#8208;
       tions, but easy with frame changes.

       --delete frames [frames...]
            Delete frames from the input GIF.

       --insert-before frame other-GIFs
            Insert other-GIFs before frame in the input GIF.

       --append other-GIFs
            Append other-GIFs to the input GIF.

       --replace frames other-GIFs
            Replace frames from the input GIF with other-GIFs.

       --done
            Complete the current set of frame changes.

       The  frames  arguments  are frame selections (see above). These arguments
       always refer to frames from the original input GIF. So, if `a.gif&apos; has  3
       frames and `b.gif&apos; has one, this command
            gifsicle a.gif --delete &quot;#0&quot; --replace &quot;#2&quot; b.gif
       will  produce  an  output  animation with 2 frames: `a.gif&apos; frame 1, then
       `b.gif&apos;.

       The other-GIFs arguments are any number of GIF input files and frame  se&#8208;
       lections.  These images are combined in merge mode and added to the input
       GIF.  The other-GIFs last until the next frame  change  option,  so  this
       command  replaces  the  first frame of `in.gif&apos; with the merge of `a.gif&apos;
       and `b.gif&apos;:
            gifsicle -b in.gif --replace &quot;#0&quot; a.gif b.gif

       This command, however, replaces the first frame of `in.gif&apos; with  `a.gif&apos;
       and then processes `b.gif&apos; separately:
            gifsicle -b in.gif --replace &quot;#0&quot; a.gif --done b.gif

       Warning: You shouldn&apos;t use both frame selections and frame changes on the
       same input GIF.

   Image Options
       Image options modify input  images  --  by  changing  their  interlacing,
       transparency,  and cropping, for example. Image options have three forms:
       `--X&apos;, `--no-X&apos;, and `--same-X&apos;.  The `--X&apos; form selects a value for  the
       feature, the `--no-X&apos; form turns off the feature, and the `--same-X&apos; form
       means that the feature&apos;s value is copied from each input. The default  is
       always  `--same-X&apos;.   For  example,  -background=&quot;#0000FF&quot; sets the back&#8208;
       ground color to blue, --no-background turns the background color off  (by
       setting it to 0), and --same-background uses input images&apos; existing back&#8208;
       ground colors. You can give each option multiple times; for example,
            gifsicle -b -O2 -i a.gif --same-interlace b.gif c.gif
       will make `a.gif&apos; interlaced, but leave `b.gif&apos;  and  `c.gif&apos;  interlaced
       only if they were already.

       -B color
       --background color
            Set the output GIF&apos;s background to color.  The argument can have the
            same forms as in the --transparent option below.

       --crop x1,y1-x2,y2
       --crop x1,y1+widthxheight
            Crop the following input frames to a smaller rectangular  area.  The
            top-left  corner  of  this rectangle is (x1,y1); you can give either
            the lower-right corner, (x2,y2), or the width and height of the rec&#8208;
            tangle. In the x1,y1+widthxheight form, width and height can be zero
            or negative. A zero dimension means the cropping area  goes  to  the
            edge  of  the  image;  a negative dimension brings the cropping area
            that many pixels back from  the  image  edge.  For  example,  --crop
            2,2+-2x-2  will  shave  2  pixels  off each side of the input image.
            Cropping takes place before any rotation, flipping, resizing, or po&#8208;
            sitioning.

       --crop-transparency
            Crop  any  transparent  borders off the following input frames. This
            happens after any cropping due to the --crop option. It works on the
            raw input images; for example, any transparency options have not yet
            been applied.

       --flip-horizontal
       --flip-vertical
            Flip the following frames horizontally or vertically.

       -i
       --interlace
            Turn interlacing on.

       -S widthxheight
       --logical-screen widthxheight
            Set the output logical screen to widthxheight.   --no-logical-screen
            sets  the  output  logical  screen to the size of the largest output
            frame, while --same-logical-screen sets the output logical screen to
            the largest input logical screen.  --screen is a synonym for --logi&#8208;
            cal-screen.

       -p x,y
       --position x,y
            Set the following frames&apos; positions to (x,y).   --no-position  means
            --position  0,0.   Normally,  --position x,y places every succeeding
            frame exactly at x,y. However, if an entire animation is input,  x,y
            is treated as the position for the animation.

       --rotate-90
       --rotate-180
       --rotate-270
            Rotate the following frames by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.  --no-rotate
            turns off any rotation.

       -t color
       --transparent color
            Make color transparent in the following frames.  Color can be a col&#8208;
            ormap   index  (0-255),  a  hexadecimal  color  specification  (like
            &quot;#FF00FF&quot; for magenta), or slash- or comma-separated red, green  and
            blue values (each between 0 and 255).

   Extension Options
       Extension  options add non-visual information to the output GIF. This in&#8208;
       cludes names, comments, and generic extensions.

       -x app-name extension
       --app-extension app-name extension
            Add an application extension named app-name and with the  value  ex&#8208;
            tension to the output GIF.

       -c text
       --comment text
            Add  a  comment, text, to the output GIF. The comment will be placed
            before the next frame in the stream.

            --no-comments and --same-comments affect all the  images  following,
            and apply only to input GIF comments, not ones added with --comment.
&#12;       --extension number extension
            Add an extension numbered number and with the value extension to the
            output GIF.  Number can be in decimal, octal, hex, or it  can  be  a
            single character like `n&apos;, whose ASCII value is used.

            --no-extensions  (or +x) and --same-extensions affect all the images
            following, and apply only to input GIF extensions.

       -n text
       --name text
            Set the next frame&apos;s name to text.  This name is stored as an exten&#8208;
            sion in the output GIF (extension number 0xCE, followed by the char&#8208;
            acters of the frame name).

            --no-names and --same-names affect all the  images  following.  They
            apply only to input GIF names, not ones added with --name.

   Animation Options
       Animation options apply to GIF animations, or to individual frames in GIF
       animations. As with image options,  most  animation  options  have  three
       forms,  `--X&apos;,  `--no-X&apos;,  and `--same-X&apos;, and you can give animation op&#8208;
       tions multiple times; for example,
            gifsicle -b a.gif -d50 &quot;#0&quot; &quot;#1&quot; -d100 &quot;#2&quot; &quot;#3&quot;
       sets the delays of frames 0 and 1 to 50, and frames 2 and 3 to 100.

       -d time
       --delay time
            Set the delay between frames to time in hundredths of a second.

       -D method
       --disposal method
            Set the disposal method for  the  following  frames  to  method.   A
            frame&apos;s  disposal  method  determines how a viewer should remove the
            frame when it&apos;s time to display the next.  Method can  be  a  number
            between  0  and  7 (although only 0 through 3 are generally meaning&#8208;
            ful), or one of these names: none (leave the frame visible  for  fu&#8208;
            ture  frames  to  build upon), asis (same as &quot;none&quot;), background (or
            bg) (replace the frame with the background),  or  previous  (replace
            the  frame  with  the  area  from  the  previous  displayed  frame).
            --no-disposal means --disposal=none.

       -l[count]
       --loopcount[=count]
            Set the Netscape loop extension to count.  Count is an  integer,  or
            forever  to loop endlessly. If you supply a --loopcount option with&#8208;
            out specifying count, Gifsicle  will  use  forever.   --no-loopcount
            (the default) turns off looping.

            Set the loop count to one less than the number of times you want the
            animation to run. An animation with --no-loopcount will  show  every
            frame  once;  --loopcount=1 will loop once, thus showing every frame
            twice; and so forth.   Note  that  --loopcount=0  is  equivalent  to
            --loopcount=forever, not --no-loopcount.

       -O[level]
       --optimize[=level]
            Optimize output GIF animations for space.  Level determines how much
            optimization is done; higher levels take longer, but may have better
            results. There are currently three levels:

            -O1  Stores  only the changed portion of each image. This is the de&#8208;
                 fault.
            -O2  Also uses transparency to shrink the file further.
            -O3  Try several optimization  methods  (usually  slower,  sometimes
                 better results).

            Other optimization flags provide finer-grained control.

            -Okeep-empty
                 Preserve  empty  transparent  frames  (they  are dropped by de&#8208;
                 fault).

            There is no --same-optimize option.

       -U
       --unoptimize
            Unoptimize GIF animations into an easy-to-edit form.

            GIF animations are often optimized (see  --optimize)  to  make  them
            smaller and faster to load, which unfortunately makes them difficult
            to edit.  --unoptimize changes optimized input GIFs into unoptimized
            GIFs,  where  each frame is a faithful representation of what a user
            would see at that point in the animation.

            There is no --same-unoptimize option.

   Whole-GIF Options
       Whole-GIF options effect entire GIFs as they are read  or  written.  They
       can be turned off with `--no-option&apos;.

       --careful
            Write  slightly larger GIFs that avoid bugs in some other GIF imple&#8208;
            mentations. Some Java and Internet Explorer versions cannot  display
            the  correct, minimal GIFs that Gifsicle produces. Use the --careful
            option if you are having problems with a particular image.

       --change-color color1 color2
            Change color1 to color2 in the following input GIFs. (The color  ar&#8208;
            guments  have  the  same  forms as in the -t option.) You can change
            multiple colors by giving the option multiple times.  Color  changes
            don&apos;t  interfere with one another, so you can safely swap two colors
            with `--change-color color1 color2  --change-color  color2  color1&apos;.
            They  all  take  effect  as an input GIF is read.  --no-change-color
            cancels all color changes.

       -k num
       --colors num
            Reduce the number of distinct colors in each output GIF  to  num  or
            less.   Num  must  be  between 2 and 256. This can be used to shrink
            output GIFs or eliminate any local color tables.

            Unless you give --use-colormap, an adaptive group of colors is  cho&#8208;
            sen from the existing color table.  You can affect this process with
            the --color-method option. Gifsicle may need to  add  an  additional
            color (making num+1 in all) if there is transparency in the image.

       --color-method method
            Determine how a smaller colormap is chosen. There are three choices:
            diversity, the default, is xv(1)&apos;s diversity algorithm, which uses a
            strict  subset of the existing colors.  blend-diversity is a modifi&#8208;
            cation of this: some color values are blended from a  group  of  the
            existing  colors.   median-cut is the median cut algorithm described
            by Heckbert.  --method is a synonym for --color-method.

       -f
       --dither
            This option only matters if the colormap was changed. With  --dither
            on,  Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion is used to approximate any col&#8208;
            ors that were removed. This looks better, but makes bigger files and
            can cause animation artifacts, so it is off by default.

       --resize widthxheight
            Resize  the  output GIF to widthxheight.  Either width or height may
            be an underscore `_&apos;. If the argument is widthx_,  then  the  output
            GIF  is  scaled to width pixels wide without changing its aspect ra&#8208;
            tio. An analogous operation is  performed  for  _xheight.   Resizing
            happens  after  all input frames have been combined and before opti&#8208;
            mization. Gifsicle&apos;s resize algorithm is  designed  for  speed,  not
            quality; for best-looking results you will need to use other tools.

       --resize-width width
       --resize-height height
            Like --resize widthx_ and --resize _xheight respectively.

       --resize-fit widthxheight
            Like  --resize, but resizes the output GIF to fit within a rectangle
            with dimensions widthxheight.  The GIF&apos;s aspect  ratio  remains  un&#8208;
            changed.  No  resize is performed if the GIF already fits within the
            given rectangle. Either width or height may be  an  underscore  `_&apos;,
            which is treated as infinity.

       --resize-fit-width width
       --resize-fit-height height
            Like --resize-fit widthx_ and --resize-fit _xheight respectively.

       --scale Xfactor[xYfactor]
            Scale  the output GIF&apos;s width and height by Xfactor and Yfactor.  If
            Yfactor is not given, it defaults to Xfactor.  Scaling happens after
            all input frames have been combined and before optimization.

       --transform-colormap command
            Command should be a shell command that reads from standard input and
            writes to standard output. Each colormap in the output GIF is trans&#8208;
            lated into text colormap format (see --use-colormap below) and piped
            to the command. The output that command generates (which should also
            be in text colormap format) will be used as the colormap instead.

       --use-colormap colormap
            Set  the  image&apos;s colormap to colormap.  Colormap can be web for the
            216-color ``Web-safe palette&apos;&apos;; gray for grayscale;  bw  for  black-
            and-white;  or the name of a file. That file should either be a text
            file (the format is described below) or a  GIF  file,  whose  global
            colormap  will be used. If --colors=N is also given, an N-sized sub&#8208;
            set of colormap will be used.

            Text colormap files have a very simple format:

            # each non-comment line represents one color, &quot;red green blue&quot;
            # each component should be between 0 and 255
            0 0 0            # like this
            255 255 255
EXAMPLES
       Here are a bunch of examples showing how gifsicle is commonly used.

       First, let&apos;s create an animation, `anim.gif&apos;:

            gifsicle a.gif b.gif c.gif d.gif &gt; anim.gif

       This animation will move very quickly: since we didn&apos;t specify a delay, a
       browser  will  cycle  through the frames as fast as it can. Let&apos;s slow it
       down and pause .5 seconds between frames, using the --delay option.

            gifsicle --delay 50 a.gif b.gif c.gif d.gif &gt; anim.gif

       If we also want the GIF to loop three times, we can use --loopcount:

            gifsicle -d 50 --loop=3 a.gif b.gif c.gif d.gif &gt; anim.gif

       (Rather than type --delay again, we used its short form,  -d.   Many  op&#8208;
       tions  have  short  forms; you can see them by running `gifsicle --help&apos;.
       We also abbreviated --loopcount to --loop, which is OK since no other op&#8208;
       tion starts with `loop&apos;.)

       To explode `anim.gif&apos; into its component frames:

            gifsicle --explode anim.gif
            ls anim.gif*
            anim.gif      anim.gif.000  anim.gif.001  anim.gif.002  anim.gif.003

       To optimize `anim.gif&apos;:

            gifsicle -b -O2 anim.gif

       To change the second frame of `anim.gif&apos; to `x.gif&apos;:

            gifsicle -b --unoptimize -O2 anim.gif --replace &quot;#1&quot; x.gif

       --unoptimize  is  used  since  `anim.gif&apos; was optimized in the last step.
       Editing individual frames in optimized GIFs is dangerous without  --unop&#8208;
       timize;  frames  following  the  changed  frame could be corrupted by the
       change.  Of course, this might be what you want.

       Note that --unoptimize and --optimize can be on simultaneously.   --unop&#8208;
       timize  affects  input  GIF  files,  while  --optimize affects output GIF
       files.

       To print information about the first and fourth frames of `anim.gif&apos;:

            gifsicle -I &quot;#0&quot; &quot;#3&quot; &lt; anim.gif

       To make black the transparent color in all the GIFs in the current direc&#8208;
       tory, and also print information about each:

            gifsicle -bII --trans &quot;#000000&quot; *.gif

       Giving -I twice forces normal output to occur. With only one -I, the GIFs
       would not be modified.

       To change `anim.gif&apos; to use a 64-color subset of the Web-safe palette:

            gifsicle -b --colors=64 --use-col=web anim.gif

       To make a dithered black-and-white version of `anim.gif&apos;:

            gifsicle --dither --use-col=bw anim.gif &gt; anim-bw.gif

       To overlay one GIF atop another -- producing a one-frame output GIF  that
       looks like the superposition of the two inputs -- use gifsicle twice:

            gifsicle bottom.gif top.gif | gifsicle -U &quot;#1&quot; &gt; result.gif

BUGS
       Some optimized output GIFs may appear incorrectly on some GIF implementa&#8208;
       tions (for example, Java&apos;s); see the --careful option.
