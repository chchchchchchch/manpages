GIFVIEW(1)                                                            GIFVIEW(1)



NAME
       gifview - displays GIF images and animations on the X window system

SYNOPSIS
       gifview [--display display] [options] [filenames and frames]...

DESCRIPTION
       gifview  displays  GIF  image files on workstations and terminals running
       the X Window System.  gifview understands multi-image GIFs, which can  be
       displayed either as slideshows or as animations.

INTERACTION
       gifview windows recognize several keystrokes and button commands. Many of
       them are only useful for multi-image GIFs.

       Space or n  Go to the next frame.

       b or p      Go to the previous frame.

       r or &lt;      Go to the first frame.

       &gt;           Go to the last frame.

       ESC         Stop the animation.

       s or a      Toggle between animation and slideshow mode.

       u           Toggle between normal and unoptimized mode.

       Backspace   Delete this window.

       q           Quit gifview.

       Left-clicking on a window goes to the next  frame;  right-clicking  on  a
       window deletes that window.

COMMAND LINE
       gifview&apos;s  command  line  consists  of GIF input files and options.  Most
       options start with a dash (-) or plus (+); frame selections,  a  kind  of
       option, start with a number sign (#). Anything else is a GIF input file.

       gifview  displays  one  window for each GIF input file you specify. If no
       GIF input file is given, or you give the special filename `-&apos;,  it  reads
       from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       --animate, -a
            Animate  multi-image  GIFs  by  default.  Normally, multi-image GIFs
            first appear in slideshow mode. You can always use the `a&apos; keystroke
            to  toggle between modes. This option has a converse, `--no-animate&apos;
            or `+a&apos;.

       --unoptimize, -U
            Display multi-image GIFs as ``unoptimized&apos;&apos;, which shows a  faithful
            representation  of  what  a user will see at each frame of an anima&#8208;
            tion. See gifsicle(1) for a more detailed description of unoptimiza&#8208;
            tion.  This  option has a converse, `--no-unoptimize&apos; or `+U&apos;.  GIFs
            are always displayed unoptimized in animation mode.

       -d display
       --display display
            Sets the X display to display.  This option must come before any GIF
            files.

       --name name
            Sets  the  application  name under which resources are found, rather
            than the default of &quot;gifview&quot;. Since gifview itself does not use the
            resource database, this is mostly useful for communication with your
            window manager.

       --geometry geometry
            Set the size and position of gifview&apos;s windows. This is a standard X
            option.  At most one --geometry option can be given per window (that
            is, per input GIF file).

       --title title
            Sets the gifview window&apos;s title. The default is &quot;gifview&quot;,  followed
            by information about the currently displayed file and frame.

       -w window
       --window window
            Display  the next GIF input in an existing X window, instead of mak&#8208;
            ing a new top-level window. This way, you can use gifview to display
            animated GIFs in a window you created with another program. The win&#8208;
            dow argument should be an integer (gifview will use that window  ID)
            or `root&apos; (gifview will use the root window).

       --new-window window
            Display  the  next GIF input in a new child of an existing X window.
            This child window will disappear  when  gifview  exits.  The  window
            argument  should  be an integer (gifview will use that window ID) or
            `root&apos; (gifview will use the root window).

       --install-colormap, -i
            Use a private colormap for each window (if you are using  a  Pseudo&#8208;
            Color display). This avoids polluting the existing colormap, and may
            produce better results if your colormap is full, but causes annoying
            colormap flashing.

       --background color
       --bg color
            Set the background color, which is used for transparent pixels.

       --min-delay delay
            Set  the minimum delay between frames to delay, which is measured in
            hundredths of a second. Default is 0.

       --no-interactive, +e
            Don&apos;t pay attention to mouse buttons or keystrokes.

       --help
            Print usage information and exit.

       --version
            Print the version number and some quickie warranty  information  and
            exit.

   Frame Selections
       A frame selection tells gifview which frame to initially display from the
       current input file. They are useful only for animations, as  non-animated
       GIFs  only  have  one  frame.  Frame  selections can only be displayed in
       slideshow mode.

       #num         Select frame num. (The first frame is `#0&apos;.   Negative  num&#8208;
                    bers count backwards from the last frame, which is `#-1&apos;.)
       #name        Select the frame named name.

       If  you  give  two  or more frame selections, you will get one window per
       frame selection.
