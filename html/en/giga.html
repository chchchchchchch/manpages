UNITS(7)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   UNITS(7)



NAME
       units, kilo, kibi, mega, mebi, giga, gibi - decimal and binary prefixes

DESCRIPTION
   Decimal prefixes
       The  SI  system  of  units  uses prefixes that indicate powers of ten.  A
       kilometer is 1000 meter, and a megawatt is 1000000 watt.  Below the stan&#8208;
       dard prefixes.

              1000000000000000000000000

       The  symbol for micro is the Greek letter mu, often written u in an ASCII
       context where this Greek letter is not available.  See also

   Binary prefixes
       The binary prefixes resemble the decimal ones, but have an additional &apos;i&apos;
       (and &quot;Ki&quot; starts with a capital &apos;K&apos;).  The names are formed by taking the
       first syllable of the names of the decimal prefix with roughly  the  same
       size, followed by &quot;bi&quot; for &quot;binary&quot;.

   Discussion
       Before these binary prefixes were introduced, it was fairly common to use
       k=1000 and K=1024, just like b=bit, B=byte.  Unfortunately, the M is cap&#8208;
       ital already, and cannot be capitalized to indicate binary-ness.

       At first that didn&apos;t matter too much, since memory modules and disks came
       in  sizes that were powers of two, so everyone knew that in such contexts
       &quot;kilobyte&quot; and &quot;megabyte&quot; meant 1024  and  1048576  bytes,  respectively.
       What  originally  was  a  sloppy  use  of  the prefixes &quot;kilo&quot; and &quot;mega&quot;
       started to become regarded as the &quot;real true meaning&quot; when computers were
       involved.   But then disk technology changed, and disk sizes became arbi&#8208;
       trary numbers.  After a period of uncertainty all disk manufacturers set&#8208;
       tled on the standard, namely k=1000, M=1000k, G=1000M.

       The  situation  was  messy:  in  the  14k4  modems, k=1000; in the 1.44MB
       diskettes, M=1024000; etc.  In 1998 the IEC approved  the  standard  that
       defines  the  binary  prefixes given above, enabling people to be precise
       and unambiguous.
&#12;       Thus, today, MB = 1000000B and MiB = 1048576B.

       In the free software world programs are slowly being changed to  conform.
       When the Linux kernel boots and says

              hda: 120064896 sectors (61473 MB) w/2048KiB Cache

       the MB are megabytes and the KiB are kibibytes.
