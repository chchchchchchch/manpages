NAME
       giiEventSend - Inject an event into the input

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gii.h&gt;

       int giiEventSend(gii_input_t inp, gii_event *ev);


DESCRIPTION
       giiEventSend  injects an event into the queue. Such events can be identi&#8208;
       fied by (event-&gt;any.target == GII_EV_TARGET_QUEUE).  There are three main
       uses for this function:

       1   Simulating input for independent subprograms.

       2   Sending  events  to  externally  attached  programs  via  specialized
           inputs, that are actually rather outputs.

       3   Sending command events to inputs, like querying the axis of a  valua&#8208;
           tor device.

RETURN VALUE
       giiEventSend returns 0 on success, or an gii-error(3) code otherwise.
