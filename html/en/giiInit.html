giiInit(3)                             GGI                            giiInit(3)



NAME
       giiInit, giiExit - Initialize and uninitialize LibGII

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gii.h&gt;

       int giiInit(void);

       int giiExit(void);


DESCRIPTION
       giiInit  initializes  the  library.  This  function must be called before
       using other LibGII functions; otherwise the results will be undefined.

       giiExit uninitializes the library (after being  initialized  by  giiInit)
       and  automatically  cleanup if necessary.  This should be called after an
       application is finished with the  library.   If  any  GGI  functions  are
       called  after  the  library  has  been uninitialized, the results will be
       undefined.

       giiInit allows multiple invocations.  A reference  count  is  maintained,
       and  to  completely  uninitialize  the library, giiExit must be called as
       many times as giiInit has been called beforehand.

RETURN VALUE
       giiInit returns 0 for OK, otherwise an gii-error(3) code.

       giiExit returns:

       0      after successfully cleaning up,


       &gt;0     the number of &apos;open&apos; giiInit calls, if there has  been  more  than
              one call to giiInit.  As giiInit and giiExit must be used in prop&#8208;
              erly nested pairs, e.g. the first giiExit after two  giiInit  will
              return 1.


       &lt;0     gii-error(3), especially if more giiExit calls have been done than
              giiInit calls.


EXAMPLES
       Initialize and uninitialize LibGII:

       if (!giiInit()) {
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  /* can&apos;t start! */
       }

       /* Do some libgii stuff */

       giiExit();
