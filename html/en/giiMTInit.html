giiMTInit(3)                           GGI                          giiMTInit(3)



NAME
       giiMTInit - Make LibGII thread-safe

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gii.h&gt;

       int giiMTInit(void);


DESCRIPTION
       giiMTInit sets up LibGII so that it is fully thread-safe. This allows the
       application to call LibGII functions (on the same  input)  without  doing
       its  own locking. This will enable extra checks and locks that are off by
       default to avoid overhead.

       This function does not replace giiInit(3), which must still be called  at
       least once.

RETURN VALUE
       giiMTInit returns 0 on successful execution.

KNOWN BUGS
       This function has not been well tested.
