giiPanic(3)                            GGI                           giiPanic(3)



NAME
       giiPanic - Exit LibGII programs for fatal errors

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gii.h&gt;

       int giiPanic(const char * format, ...);


DESCRIPTION
       ggiPanic(3)   shuts  down  the  application,  closing  all  inputs,  with
       printf(3)-style reporting to stderr, taking a format string and any addi&#8208;
       tional variables.

       giiPanic  should  only  be  used  by  usermode programs when something is
       really screwed, and they do not know what to do.  The  same  applies  for
       libraries,  but  might  be  used in rare situations such as corruption of
       critical data structures.

EXAMPLES
       An unrecoverable error:

       if (my_important_struct-&gt;magic != MAGIC) {
         giiPanic(&quot;Fatal error: magic corrupted\n&quot;);
       }
