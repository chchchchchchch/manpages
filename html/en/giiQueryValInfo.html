giiQueryValInfo(3)                     GGI                    giiQueryValInfo(3)



NAME
       giiQueryValInfo - Get data about valuators

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/gii.h&gt;

       int giiQueryValInfo(gii_input_t inp, uint32_t origin,
                           uint32_t valnumber, gii_cmddata_getvalinfo *info);


DESCRIPTION
       Though  when using GII inputs the exact type of device is fully transpar&#8208;
       ent to the  program,  information  about  the  device  that  is  actually
       attached to a given gii input and origin id can be queried, e.g. for con&#8208;
       figuration interfaces.

       For giiQueryValInfo is used on devices, where  giiQueryDeviceInfo(3)  has
       indicated  that  the device has one or more valuator axes and you want to
       gather additional info about the physical  equivalent  of  each  axis.The
       parameters inp and origin select the input to query and valnumber selects
       the specific valuator (an input can have multiple valuators).

       The queried data is put into info.  See gii_cmddata_getvalinfo(3) for the
       description of the structure.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success (info is valid, then) or -1 otherwise.
