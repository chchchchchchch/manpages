       structures

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/events.h&gt;

       typedef union gii_event {

           uint8_t                 size;

DESCRIPTION
       Events are of type gii_event. It is an union of all of the structures for
       each specific type of event.

STRUCTURE MEMBERS
       All  of  the  event  structures  contains housekeeping information at the
       beginning, as defined by COMMON_DATA.

       Thus, by analyzing the contents of any.type, you can determine  what  the
       given  event is, and select the appropriate member of the gii_event union
       to access to get at the event

       The common fields found in any event structure are:

       size   Specifies the size of the given event (in bytes).


       type   An enumeration of the possible types of LibGII  events  (see  next
              section).


       error  Mainly there to round things up to a 32-bit boundary, but could be
              used to signal an error in a send-reply sequence.


       origin A device handle: it distinguishes one input device  from  another.
              Other than that there&apos;s no real meaning to the number.


       target Also  a  device  handle,  but for distinguishes input devices when
              sending events to an input device via giiEventSend(3).


       time   Indicates when the event in question has been generated. See  get&#8208;
              timeofday(2) for more info on the timeval structure.


EVENT TYPES
       The  different  types  of  events  are  defined as an enumeration of type
       gii_event_type. The possible values are:

       &#183;   evNothing          : event is not valid.

       &#183;   evCommand          : report command or do action.

       &#183;   evInformation      : notification of new information.

       &#183;   evExposure         : exposure event.

       &#183;   evKeyPress         : a key has been pressed.

       &#183;   evKeyRelease       : a key has been released.

       &#183;   evKeyRepeat        : automatically repeated keypress.

       &#183;   evPtrRelative      : pointer movement reported  in  relative  coordi&#8208;
           nates.

       &#183;   evPtrAbsolute       :  pointer  movement reported in absolute coordi&#8208;
           nates.

       &#183;   evPtrButtonPress   : a pointer button has been pressed.

       &#183;   evPtrButtonRelease : a pointer button has been released.

       &#183;   evValRelative      : valuator change reported as a relative value.

       &#183;   evValAbsolute      : valuator change reported as an absolute value.

EVENT MASKS
       gii_event_mask is passed to various event handling functions to  indicate
       which  types  of events the program is interested in. The list below sums
       the available event masks:

       &#183;   emCommand        : evCommand

       &#183;   emInformation    : evInformation

       &#183;   emExpose         : evExpose

       &#183;   emKeyPress       : evKeyPress

       &#183;   emKeyRelease     : evKeyRelease

       &#183;   emKeyRepeat      : evKeyRepeat

       &#183;   emKey            : Any of evKeyPress, evKeyRelease or evKeyRepeat

       &#183;   emPtrRelative    : evPtrRelative

       &#183;   emPtrAbsolute    : evPtrAbsolute

       &#183;   emPtrButtonPress : evPtrButtonPress
&#12;       &#183;   emButtonRelease  : evButtonRelease

       &#183;   emPtrMove        : Any of evPtrRelative or evPtrAbsolute

       &#183;   emPtrButton      : Any of evPtrButtonPress or evPtrButtonRelease

       &#183;   emPointer        : All pointer events

       &#183;   emValRelative    : evValRelative

       &#183;   emValAbsolute    : evValAbsolute

       &#183;   emValuator       : Any of evValRelative or evValAbsolute

       &#183;   emAll            : Any event type

       &#183;   emNothing        : Matches no event type
