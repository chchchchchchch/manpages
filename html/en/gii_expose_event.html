gii_expose_event(3)                    GGI                   gii_expose_event(3)



NAME
       gii_expose_event - LibGII expose events

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/events.h&gt;

       typedef struct gii_expose_event {

           COMMON_DATA;

           uint32_t  x,y;
           uint32_t  h,w;

       } gii_expose_event;


DESCRIPTION
       If  an  application loses the focus and is not physically displayed (e.g.
       console switching, iconifying), it  may  be  stopped.  Some  targets  may
       implement a backbuffer and allow continuing, though.

       After  reactivation,  the  application will receive a redraw event, evEx&#8208;
       pose.

GENERATED EVENTS
       The gii_expose_event is used for the evExpose event.

STRUCTURE MEMBERS
       The fields describe the region which needs to be redrawn.

EXAMPLES
       evExpose handling skeleton:

       ggi_visual_t vis;
       ggi_event ev;

       /* ... wait and get the event... */

       if (ev.any.type == evExpose) {
           /* We might not be able to render partially ... */
           render_screen(vis);

           /* but flush only the region needed */
           ggiFlushRegion(vis, ev.expose.x, ev.expose.y,
                               ev.expose.w, ev.expose.h);
       }

       /* ... etc ... */
