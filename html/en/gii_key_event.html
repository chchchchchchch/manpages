gii_key_event(3)                       GGI                      gii_key_event(3)



NAME
       gii_key_event - LibGII key events

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/events.h&gt;

       typedef struct gii_key_event {

           COMMON_DATA;

           uint32_t  modifiers;
           uint32_t  sym;
           uint32_t  label;
           uint32_t  button;

       } gii_key_event;


DESCRIPTION
       The  gii_key_event  structure represents key/button events from keyboards
       and other devices.

GENERATED EVENTS
       evKeyPress
              The key specified in the structure is pressed. Not repeatedly pro&#8208;
              duced while holding down the key.


       evKeyRelease
              A key specified in the structure is released.


       evKeyRepeat
              Makes sense when dealing with character input. A key is being held
              down and the character should be processed at intervals  when  the
              key is held down.

              The key repeat rate and the delay before repeat is unspecified and
              depends on the user&apos;s environment.


STRUCTURE MEMBERS
       modifiers
              Result of bitwise-or of the following  flags,  indicating  certain
              shift states:

              &#183;   GII_MOD_SHIFT

              &#183;   GII_MOD_CTRL

              &#183;   GII_MOD_ALT

              &#183;   GII_MOD_META

              &#183;   GII_MOD_SUPER

              &#183;   GII_MOD_HYPER

              &#183;   GII_MOD_ALTGR

              &#183;   GII_MOD_CAPS
&#12;              &#183;   GII_MOD_NUM

              &#183;   GII_MOD_SCROLL

       sym    The  symbol  of the key, which is the resultant character produced
              by the key. This is roughly a transformation of the label with the
              current  modifiers.  It  also depends on the user&apos;s key configura&#8208;
              tion.


       label  The actual label visible on the key in question.  This  is  either
              the  symbol produced when there are no modifiers or it is the most
              prominent symbol on that key.  For example:

              &#183;   The numeric keys on top of the letter keys on  a  standard  PC
                  keyboard  have  label values which are the digit characters in
                  ASCII.

              &#183;   The English letter keys on a keyboard  are  represented  by  A
                  through  Z  in  label. Although in their unshifted state these
                  keys produce lowercase letters, the keycaps are  printed  with
                  uppercase by convention, so this is what LibGII returns.

              label  can  be used as a generalized, portable keycode or scancode
              of the key (That is, if the documentation for an applications says
              that  something is is mapped to key y, it is, even for German key&#8208;
              board, where y and z are swapped)


       button The button number distinguishing between the different buttons  on
              the  device.   For example, on a keyboard it is a number from 0 to
              127 (i.e. a scancode), on a joystick it might be 1 to 4, and on  a
              spaceorb it will be 1 to 8.


       If  an  application  is  interested in what physical keys are pressed and
       released (most games for example), read the label field. Usually the mod&#8208;
       ifiers in effect are irrelevant for these applications (however, for non-
       alphanumeric symbols like + and -, it is wise  to  check  the  sym  field
       instead  of label as they are accessed using shifts on some keyboard con&#8208;
       figurations).

       If an application wants a stream  of  characters  (for  text  input),  it
       should read the sym field.

GGI KEYSYM SYSTEM
       In GGI, key values are defined in ggi/keyboard.h. They are basically Uni&#8208;
       code characters with some extensions:

       Keys which are not represented by  codepoints  in  the  Unicode  standard
       (such  as the numeric keypad keys) are assigned codepoints in the private
       range. Applications should use the GIIK_ #defines for representing  these
       keys.  These codepoints are used in label, but they can also occur in sym
       when the symbol is not any character (e.g. arrow keys, function keys).

       The GIIUC_ #defines represent normal Unicode characters. The #defines are
       interchangeable  with their corresponding codepoint scalars and their use
       is optional. However, it is recommended  to  use  them  for  the  symbols
       GIIUC_BackSpace, GIIUC_Return, GIIUC_Escape and GIIUC_Delete.
              Important:  In  the  LibGII system, no key is guaranteed to exist;
              the key values are for identification only.  Particularly,  appli&#8208;
              cations  should not rely on their presence.  Also, because not all
              keyboards are configured in the same way, applications are encour&#8208;
              aged  to  allow  user configuration of the keys used and not hard-
              code their values.
