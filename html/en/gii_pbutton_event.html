NAME
       gii_pbutton_event - LibGII pointer button events

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ggi/events.h&gt;

       typedef struct gii_pbutton_event {

           COMMON_DATA;

           uint32_t  button;

       } gii_pbutton_event;


DESCRIPTION
       Button  events  are  sent  to  report  a  change in pointer button state.
       Depending on the event type,  the  button  is  either  being  pressed  or
       released.

GENERATED EVENTS
       This  structure  is  used  for  evPtrButtonPress  and  evPtrButtonRelease
       events.

STRUCTURE MEMBERS
       gii_pbutton_event  simply  specifies  that  the  button  is  pressed   or
       released.

       Pointer  buttons are specified in order of common usage, with 1 being the
       primary button. The following values are defined:

       &#183;   GII_PBUTTON_LEFT, GII_PBUTTON_PRIMARY, GGI_PBUTTON_FIRST equal 1.

       &#183;   GII_PBUTTON_RIGHT, GII_PBUTTON_SECONDARY, GGI_PBUTTON_SECOND equal 2.

       &#183;   GII_PBUTTON_MIDDLE, GII_PBUTTON_TERTIARY, GGI_PBUTTON_THIRD equal 3.

       Of course, applications should avoid hardcoding mouse button values.
