GIMPRC(5)                                                              GIMPRC(5)



NAME
       gimprc - gimp configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  gimprc  file is a configuration file read by GIMP when it starts up.
       There are two of these: one system-wide one stored in  /etc/gimp/2.0/gim&#8208;
       prc  and a per-user $HOME/.gimp-2.8/gimprc which may override system set&#8208;
       tings.

       Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the end of
       the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

       The  gimprc file associates values with properties.  These properties may
       be set by lisp-like assignments of the form:

              (property-name value)

       where:

       property-name
                 is one of the property names described below.

       value     is the value the property is to be set to.

       Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.

PROPERTIES
       Valid properties and their default values are:


       (temp-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/tmp&quot;)

              Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here dur&#8208;
              ing  the  course  of running GIMP.  Most files will disappear when
              GIMP exits, but some files are likely to remain, so it is best  if
              this  folder  not be one that is shared by other users.  This is a
              single folder.


       (swap-path &quot;${gimp_dir}&quot;)

              Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory alloca&#8208;
              tion  scheme.   The  swap  file is used to quickly and easily swap
              tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that  the  swap  file  can
              easily  get  very  large  if GIMP is used with large images. Also,
              things can get horribly slow if the swap  file  is  created  on  a
              folder  that  is  mounted  over NFS.  For these reasons, it may be
              desirable to put your swap file  in  &quot;/tmp&quot;.   This  is  a  single
              folder.


       (num-processors 1)

              Sets  how  many  processors GIMP should try to use simultaneously.
              This is an integer value.


       (tile-cache-size 2038980k)

              When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will  start
              to  swap tiles to disk.  This is a lot slower but it makes it pos&#8208;
              sible to work on images that wouldn&apos;t fit into  memory  otherwise.
              If  you  have  a  lot of RAM, you may want to set this to a higher
              value.  The integer size can contain a suffix of &apos;B&apos;, &apos;K&apos;, &apos;M&apos;  or
              &apos;G&apos;  which  makes  GIMP  interpret  the size as being specified in
              bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix  is  speci&#8208;
              fied the size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.



       Specifies  the  language to use for the user interface.  This is a string
       value.


       (interpolation-type cubic)

              Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other  trans&#8208;
              formations.  Possible values are none, linear, cubic and lanczos.


       (default-threshold 15)

              Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a
              seed-fill algorithm.   The  seed  fill  starts  at  the  initially
              selected  pixel and progresses in all directions until the differ&#8208;
              ence of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a speci&#8208;
              fied threshold. This value represents the default threshold.  This
              is an integer value.


       (plug-in-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/plug-ins:${gimp_plug_in_dir}/plug-ins&quot;)

              Sets the plug-in search path.  This is a colon-separated  list  of

                  (width 640)
                  (height 400)
                  (unit pixels)
                  (xresolution 72.000000)
                  (yresolution 72.000000)
                  (resolution-unit inches)
                  (image-type rgb)
                  (fill-type background-fill)
                  (comment &quot;Created with GIMP&quot;))

              Sets the default image in the &quot;File/New&quot; dialog.  This is a param&#8208;
              eter list.


       (default-grid
                  (style solid)
                  (fgcolor (color-rgba 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000))
                  (bgcolor (color-rgba 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000))
                  (xspacing 10.000000)
                  (yspacing 10.000000)
                  (spacing-unit inches)
                  (xoffset 0.000000)
                  (yoffset 0.000000)
                  (offset-unit inches))

              Specify a default image grid.  This is a parameter list.


       (undo-levels 5)

              Sets  the  minimal  number  of operations that can be undone. More
              undo levels are  kept  available  until  the  undo-size  limit  is
              reached.  This is an integer value.


       (undo-size 64M)

              Sets  an  upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep
              operations on the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least
              as many undo-levels as configured can be undone.  The integer size
              can contain a suffix of &apos;B&apos;, &apos;K&apos;, &apos;M&apos;  or  &apos;G&apos;  which  makes  GIMP
              interpret  the  size  as  being  specified  in  bytes,  kilobytes,
              megabytes or  gigabytes.  If  no  suffix  is  specified  the  size
              defaults to being specified in kilobytes.


       (undo-preview-size large)

              Sets  the size of the previews in the Undo History.  Possible val&#8208;
              ues are tiny,  extra-small,  small,  medium,  large,  extra-large,
              huge, enormous and gigantic.


       (plug-in-history-size 10)

              How many recently used plug-ins to keep on the Filters menu.  This
              is an integer value.


       (pluginrc-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/pluginrc&quot;)

              Sets the pluginrc search path.  This is a single filename.


       (layer-previews yes)

              Sets whether GIMP should create previews of layers  and  channels.
              Previews  in  the  layers and channels dialog are nice to have but
              they can slow things down when working with large images.   Possi&#8208;
              ble values are yes and no.


       (layer-preview-size medium)

              Sets  the  preview  size  used  for layers and channel previews in
              newly created dialogs.  Possible  values  are  tiny,  extra-small,
              small, medium, large, extra-large, huge, enormous and gigantic.


       (thumbnail-size normal)

              Sets the size of the thumbnail shown in the Open dialog.  Possible
              values are none, normal and large.


       (thumbnail-filesize-limit 4M)

              The thumbnail in the Open dialog will be automatically updated  if
              the  file  being previewed is smaller than the size set here.  The
              integer size can contain a suffix of &apos;B&apos;, &apos;K&apos;, &apos;M&apos;  or  &apos;G&apos;  which
              makes  GIMP  interpret the size as being specified in bytes, kilo&#8208;
              bytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the  size
              defaults to being specified in kilobytes.


       (color-management
                  (mode display)
                  (display-profile-from-gdk no)

              ble values are ask, keep and convert.


       (save-document-history yes)

              Keep a permanent record of all  opened  and  saved  files  in  the
              Recent Documents list.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (quick-mask-color (color-rgba 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.500000))

              Sets  the default quick mask color.  The color is specified in the
              form (color-rgba red green blue  alpha)  with  channel  values  as
              floats in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.


       (transparency-size medium-checks)

              Sets  the  size  of the checkerboard used to display transparency.
              Possible values are small-checks, medium-checks and large-checks.


       (transparency-type gray-checks)

              Sets the manner in which  transparency  is  displayed  in  images.
              Possible values are light-checks, gray-checks, dark-checks, white-
              only, gray-only and black-only.
&#12;
       (snap-distance 8)

              This is the distance in pixels where Guide and Grid snapping acti&#8208;
              vates.  This is an integer value.


       (marching-ants-speed 200)

              Speed of marching ants in the selection outline.  This value is in
              milliseconds (less time indicates faster marching).   This  is  an
              integer value.


       (resize-windows-on-zoom no)

              When  enabled,  the  image window will automatically resize itself
              when zooming into and out of images.  Possible values are yes  and
              no.


       (resize-windows-on-resize no)

              When  enabled,  the  image window will automatically resize itself
              whenever the physical image size changes.  Possible values are yes
              and no.


       (default-dot-for-dot yes)

              When  enabled,  this  will ensure that each pixel of an image gets
              mapped to a pixel on the screen.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (initial-zoom-to-fit yes)

              When enabled, this will ensure that  the  full  image  is  visible
              after  a  file  is  opened,  otherwise it will be displayed with a
              scale of 1:1.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (perfect-mouse yes)

              When enabled, the X server is  queried  for  the  mouse&apos;s  current
              position on each motion event, rather than relying on the position
              hint.  This means painting with large brushes should be more accu&#8208;
              rate,  but  it  may  be  slower.   Conversely,  on  some X servers
              enabling this option results in faster painting.  Possible  values
              are yes and no.


       (cursor-mode tool-icon)

              Sets the type of mouse pointers to use.  Possible values are tool-
              icon, tool-crosshair and crosshair.


       (cursor-updating yes)

              Context-dependent mouse pointers are helpful.  They are enabled by
              default.   However,  they require overhead that you may want to do
              without.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (show-brush-outline yes)

              When enabled, all paint tools will show a preview of  the  current
              brush&apos;s outline.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (show-paint-tool-cursor yes)

              When enabled, the mouse pointer will be shown over the image while
              using a paint tool.  Possible values are yes and no.


       (image-title-format &quot;%D*%f-%p.%i (%t, %L) %wx%h&quot;)

              Sets the text to appear in image window titles.  This is a  format
              string;  certain % character sequences are recognised and expanded
              as follows:

              %%  literal percent sign
              %f  bare filename, or &quot;Untitled&quot;

              %s  source scale factor
              %d  destination scale factor
              %Dx expands to x if the image is dirty, the empty string otherwise
              %Cx expands to x if the image is clean, the empty string otherwise
              %B  expands to (modified) if the image is dirty, the empty  string
              otherwise
              %A   expands  to  (clean)  if the image is clean, the empty string
              otherwise
              %l  the number of layers
              %L  the number of layers (long form)

       There are a few variables that are pre-defined:

       gimp_dir
              The personal gimp directory which is set to the value of the envi&#8208;

              Base for paths to shareable data, which is set to the value of the
              environment variable GIMP2_DATADIR or to the  compiled-in  default
              value ${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0.
