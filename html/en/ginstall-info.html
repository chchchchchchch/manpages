NAME
       ginstall-info - update info/dir entries

SYNOPSIS
       ginstall-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION
       Add or remove entries in INFO-FILE from the Info directory DIR-FILE.

OPTIONS
       --debug
              report what is being done.

       --delete
              delete  existing entries for INFO-FILE from DIR-FILE; don&apos;t insert
              any new entries.

       --description=TEXT
              the description of the entry is TEXT; used with the --name  option
              to become synonymous with the --entry option.

       --dir-file=NAME
              specify  file name of Info directory file; equivalent to using the
              DIR-FILE argument.

       --dry-run
              same as --test.

       --entry=TEXT
              insert TEXT as an Info directory entry.  TEXT  is  written  as  an
              Info menu item line followed

              by zero or more extra lines starting with whitespace.

              If  you  specify more than one entry, all are added.  If you don&apos;t
              specify any entries, they are determined

              from information in the Info file itself.

              When removing, TEXT specifies the entry to remove.  TEXT  is  only
              removed as a last resort, if the entry as determined from the Info
              file is not present, and the basename of the Info file isn&apos;t found
              either.

       --help display this help and exit.

       --info-dir=DIR
              same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.

       --info-file=FILE
              specify Info file to install in the directory; equivalent to using
              the INFO-FILE argument.

       --item=TEXT
              same as --entry=TEXT.

       --keep-old
              do not replace entries, or remove empty sections.

       --menuentry=TEXT
              same as --name=TEXT.
&#12;       --name=TEXT
              the name of the entry is TEXT; used with --description  to  become
              synonymous with the --entry option.

       --no-indent
              do not format new entries in the DIR file.

       --quiet
              suppress warnings.

       --regex=R
              put  this  file&apos;s  entries  in all sections that match the regular
              expression R (ignoring case).

       --remove
              same as --delete.

       --remove-exactly
              only remove if the info file name matches exactly;  suffixes  such
              as .info and .gz are not ignored.

       --section=SEC
              put  entries in section SEC of the directory.  If you specify more
              than one section, all the entries

              are added in each of the sections.

              If you don&apos;t specify any sections, they are determined

              from information in the Info file itself.

       --section R SEC
              equivalent to --regex=R --section=SEC --add-once.

       --silent
              suppress warnings.

       --test suppress updating of DIR-FILE.

       --version
              display version information and exit.
