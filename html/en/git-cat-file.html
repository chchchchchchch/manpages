GIT-CAT-FILE(1)                    Git Manual                    GIT-CAT-FILE(1)



NAME
       git-cat-file - Provide content or type and size information for
       repository objects

SYNOPSIS
       git cat-file (-t | -s | -e | -p | &lt;type&gt; | --textconv ) &lt;object&gt;
       git cat-file (--batch | --batch-check) &lt; &lt;list-of-objects&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       In its first form, the command provides the content or the type of an
       object in the repository. The type is required unless -t or -p is used to
       find the object type, or -s is used to find the object size, or
       --textconv is used (which implies type &quot;blob&quot;).

       In the second form, a list of objects (separated by linefeeds) is
       provided on stdin, and the SHA1, type, and size of each object is printed
       on stdout.

OPTIONS
       &lt;object&gt;
           The name of the object to show. For a more complete list of ways to
           spell object names, see the &quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in
           gitrevisions(7).

       -t
           Instead of the content, show the object type identified by &lt;object&gt;.

       -s
           Instead of the content, show the object size identified by &lt;object&gt;.

       -e
           Suppress all output; instead exit with zero status if &lt;object&gt; exists
           and is a valid object.

       -p
           Pretty-print the contents of &lt;object&gt; based on its type.

       &lt;type&gt;
           Typically this matches the real type of &lt;object&gt; but asking for a
           type that can trivially be dereferenced from the given &lt;object&gt; is
           also permitted. An example is to ask for a &quot;tree&quot; with &lt;object&gt; being
           a commit object that contains it, or to ask for a &quot;blob&quot; with
           &lt;object&gt; being a tag object that points at it.

       --textconv
           Show the content as transformed by a textconv filter. In this case,
           &lt;object&gt; has be of the form &lt;treeish&gt;:&lt;path&gt;, or :&lt;path&gt; in order to
           apply the filter to the content recorded in the index at &lt;path&gt;.

       --batch
           Print the SHA1, type, size, and contents of each object provided on
           stdin. May not be combined with any other options or arguments.

       --batch-check
           Print the SHA1, type, and size of each object provided on stdin. May
           not be combined with any other options or arguments.

OUTPUT
       If -t is specified, one of the &lt;type&gt;.

       If -s is specified, the size of the &lt;object&gt; in bytes.

       If -e is specified, no output.

       If -p is specified, the contents of &lt;object&gt; are pretty-printed.

       If &lt;type&gt; is specified, the raw (though uncompressed) contents of the
       &lt;object&gt; will be returned.

       If --batch is specified, output of the following form is printed for each
       object specified on stdin:

           &lt;sha1&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;contents&gt; LF


       If --batch-check is specified, output of the following form is printed
       for each object specified on stdin:

           &lt;sha1&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; SP &lt;size&gt; LF


       For both --batch and --batch-check, output of the following form is
       printed for each object specified on stdin that does not exist in the
       repository:

           &lt;object&gt; SP missing LF
