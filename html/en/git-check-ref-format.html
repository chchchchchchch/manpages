GIT-CHECK-REF-FOR(1)               Git Manual               GIT-CHECK-REF-FOR(1)



NAME
       git-check-ref-format - Ensures that a reference name is well formed

SYNOPSIS
       git check-ref-format [--normalize]
              [--[no-]allow-onelevel] [--refspec-pattern]
              &lt;refname&gt;
       git check-ref-format --branch &lt;branchname-shorthand&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       Checks if a given refname is acceptable, and exits with a non-zero status
       if it is not.

       A reference is used in git to specify branches and tags. A branch head is
       stored in the refs/heads hierarchy, while a tag is stored in the
       refs/tags hierarchy of the ref namespace (typically in
       $GIT_DIR/refs/heads and $GIT_DIR/refs/tags directories or, as entries in
       file $GIT_DIR/packed-refs if refs are packed by git gc).

       git imposes the following rules on how references are named:

        1. They can include slash / for hierarchical (directory) grouping, but
           no slash-separated component can begin with a dot .  or end with the
           sequence .lock.

        2. They must contain at least one /. This enforces the presence of a
           category like heads/, tags/ etc. but the actual names are not
           restricted. If the --allow-onelevel option is used, this rule is
           waived.

        3. They cannot have two consecutive dots ..  anywhere.

        4. They cannot have ASCII control characters (i.e. bytes whose values
           are lower than \040, or \177 DEL), space, tilde ~, caret ^, or colon
           : anywhere.

        5. They cannot have question-mark ?, asterisk *, or open bracket [
           anywhere. See the --refspec-pattern option below for an exception to
           this rule.

        6. They cannot begin or end with a slash / or contain multiple
           consecutive slashes (see the --normalize option below for an
           exception to this rule)

        7. They cannot end with a dot ..

        8. They cannot contain a sequence @{.

        9. They cannot contain a \.

       These rules make it easy for shell script based tools to parse reference
       names, pathname expansion by the shell when a reference name is used
       unquoted (by mistake), and also avoids ambiguities in certain reference
       name expressions (see gitrevisions(7)):

        1. A double-dot ..  is often used as in ref1..ref2, and in some contexts
           this notation means ^ref1 ref2 (i.e. not in ref1 and in ref2).

        2. A tilde ~ and caret ^ are used to introduce the postfix nth parent
           and peel onion operation.
&#12;        3. A colon : is used as in srcref:dstref to mean &quot;use srcref&#8217;s value and
           store it in dstref&quot; in fetch and push operations. It may also be used
           to select a specific object such as with git cat-file: &quot;git cat-file
           blob v1.3.3:refs.c&quot;.

        4. at-open-brace @{ is used as a notation to access a reflog entry.

       With the --branch option, it expands the &#8220;previous branch syntax&#8221; @{-n}.
       For example, @{-1} is a way to refer the last branch you were on. This
       option should be used by porcelains to accept this syntax anywhere a
       branch name is expected, so they can act as if you typed the branch name.

OPTIONS
       --allow-onelevel, --no-allow-onelevel
           Controls whether one-level refnames are accepted (i.e., refnames that
           do not contain multiple /-separated components). The default is
           --no-allow-onelevel.

       --refspec-pattern
           Interpret &lt;refname&gt; as a reference name pattern for a refspec (as
           used with remote repositories). If this option is enabled, &lt;refname&gt;
           is allowed to contain a single * in place of a one full pathname
           component (e.g., foo/*/bar but not foo/bar*).

       --normalize
           Normalize refname by removing any leading slash (/) characters and
           collapsing runs of adjacent slashes between name components into a
           single slash. Iff the normalized refname is valid then print it to
           standard output and exit with a status of 0. (--print is a deprecated
           way to spell --normalize.)

EXAMPLES
       &#183;   Print the name of the previous branch:

               $ git check-ref-format --branch @{-1}


       &#183;   Determine the reference name to use for a new branch:

               $ ref=$(git check-ref-format --normalize &quot;refs/heads/$newbranch&quot;) ||
               die &quot;we do not like &apos;$newbranch&apos; as a branch name.&quot;
