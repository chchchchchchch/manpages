GIT-CHERRY(1)                      Git Manual                      GIT-CHERRY(1)



NAME
       git-cherry - Find commits not merged upstream

SYNOPSIS
       git cherry [-v] [&lt;upstream&gt; [&lt;head&gt; [&lt;limit&gt;]]]


DESCRIPTION
       The changeset (or &quot;diff&quot;) of each commit between the fork-point and
       &lt;head&gt; is compared against each commit between the fork-point and
       &lt;upstream&gt;. The commits are compared with their patch id, obtained from
       the git patch-id program.

       Every commit that doesn&#8217;t exist in the &lt;upstream&gt; branch has its id
       (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent
       change already in the &lt;upstream&gt; branch are prefixed with a minus (-)
       sign, and those that only exist in the &lt;head&gt; branch are prefixed with a
       plus (+) symbol:

                      __*__*__*__*__&gt; &lt;upstream&gt;
                     /
           fork-point
                     \__+__+__-__+__+__-__+__&gt; &lt;head&gt;

       If a &lt;limit&gt; has been given then the commits along the &lt;head&gt; branch up
       to and including &lt;limit&gt; are not reported:

                      __*__*__*__*__&gt; &lt;upstream&gt;
                     /
           fork-point
                     \__*__*__&lt;limit&gt;__-__+__&gt; &lt;head&gt;

       Because git cherry compares the changeset rather than the commit id
       (sha1), you can use git cherry to find out if a commit you made locally
       has been applied &lt;upstream&gt; under a different commit id. For example,
       this will happen if you&#8217;re feeding patches &lt;upstream&gt; via email rather
       than pushing or pulling commits directly.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Verbose.

       &lt;upstream&gt;
           Upstream branch to compare against. Defaults to the first tracked
           remote branch, if available.

       &lt;head&gt;
           Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;limit&gt;
           Do not report commits up to (and including) limit.
