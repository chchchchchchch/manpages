GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)              Git Manual              GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)



NAME
       git-credential-store - helper to store credentials on disk

SYNOPSIS
       git config credential.helper &apos;store [options]&apos;


DESCRIPTION
           Note
           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk,
           protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is not an
           acceptable security tradeoff, try git-credential-cache(1), or find a
           helper that integrates with secure storage provided by your operating
           system.

       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by future
       git programs.

       You probably don&#8217;t want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
       be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
       gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.

OPTIONS
       --store=&lt;path&gt;
           Use &lt;path&gt; to store credentials. The file will have its filesystem
           permissions set to prevent other users on the system from reading it,
           but will not be encrypted or otherwise protected. Defaults to
           ~/.git-credentials.

EXAMPLES
       The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
       your username or password. For example:

           $ git config credential.helper store
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           Username: &lt;type your username&gt;
           Password: &lt;type your password&gt;

           [several days later]
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           [your credentials are used automatically]


STORAGE FORMAT
       The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is
       stored on its own line as a URL like:

           https://user:pass@example.com


       When git needs authentication for a particular URL context,
       credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match against
       each entry in the credentials file. If the protocol, hostname, and
       username (if we already have one) match, then the password is returned to
       git. See the discussion of configuration in gitcredentials(7) for more
       information.
