GIT-FETCH(1)                       Git Manual                       GIT-FETCH(1)



NAME
       git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository

SYNOPSIS
       git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;repository&gt; [&lt;refspec&gt;...]]
       git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;group&gt;
       git fetch --multiple [&lt;options&gt;] [(&lt;repository&gt; | &lt;group&gt;)...]
       git fetch --all [&lt;options&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
       Fetches named heads or tags from one or more other repositories, along
       with the objects necessary to complete them.

       The ref names and their object names of fetched refs are stored in
       .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information is left for a later merge operation
       done by git merge.

       When &lt;refspec&gt; stores the fetched result in remote-tracking branches, the
       tags that point at these branches are automatically followed. This is
       done by first fetching from the remote using the given &lt;refspec&gt;s, and if
       the repository has objects that are pointed by remote tags that it does
       not yet have, then fetch those missing tags. If the other end has tags
       that point at branches you are not interested in, you will not get them.

       git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository, or from
       several repositories at once if &lt;group&gt; is given and there is a
       remotes.&lt;group&gt; entry in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).

OPTIONS
       --all
           Fetch all remotes.

       -a, --append
           Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing
           contents of .git/FETCH_HEAD. Without this option old data in
           .git/FETCH_HEAD will be overwritten.

       --depth=&lt;depth&gt;
           Deepen the history of a shallow repository created by git clone with
           --depth=&lt;depth&gt; option (see git-clone(1)) by the specified number of
           commits.

       --dry-run
           Show what would be done, without making any changes.

       -f, --force
           When git fetch is used with &lt;rbranch&gt;:&lt;lbranch&gt; refspec, it refuses
           to update the local branch &lt;lbranch&gt; unless the remote branch
           &lt;rbranch&gt; it fetches is a descendant of &lt;lbranch&gt;. This option
           overrides that check.

       -k, --keep
           Keep downloaded pack.

       --multiple
           Allow several &lt;repository&gt; and &lt;group&gt; arguments to be specified. No
           &lt;refspec&gt;s may be specified.

       -p, --prune
           After fetching, remove any remote-tracking branches which no longer
           exist on the remote.

       -n, --no-tags
           By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the
           remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option
           disables this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a
           remote may be specified with the remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagopt setting. See
           git-config(1).

       -t, --tags
           Most of the tags are fetched automatically as branch heads are
           downloaded, but tags that do not point at objects reachable from the
           branch heads that are being tracked will not be fetched by this
           mechanism. This flag lets all tags and their associated objects be
           downloaded. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with
           the remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagopt setting. See git-config(1).

       --recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]
           This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of
           populated submodules should be fetched too. It can be used as a
           boolean option to completely disable recursion when set to no or to
           unconditionally recurse into all populated submodules when set to
           yes, which is the default when this option is used without any value.
           Use on-demand to only recurse into a populated submodule when the
           superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule&#8217;s
           reference to a commit that isn&#8217;t already in the local submodule
           clone.

       --no-recurse-submodules
           Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as
           using the --recurse-submodules=no option).

       --submodule-prefix=&lt;path&gt;
           Prepend &lt;path&gt; to paths printed in informative messages such as
           &quot;Fetching submodule foo&quot;. This option is used internally when
           recursing over submodules.

       --recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]
           This option is used internally to temporarily provide a non-negative
           default value for the --recurse-submodules option. All other methods
           of configuring fetch&#8217;s submodule recursion (such as settings in
           gitmodules(5) and git-config(1)) override this option, as does
           specifying --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.

       -u, --update-head-ok
           By default git fetch refuses to update the head which corresponds to
           the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is purely for
           the internal use for git pull to communicate with git fetch, and
           unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed
           to use it.

       --upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt;
           When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by git
           fetch-pack, --exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt; is passed to the command to specify
           non-default path for the command run on the other end.

       -q, --quiet
           Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally used
           git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       --progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default
           when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag
           forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not
           directed to a terminal.

       &lt;repository&gt;
           The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is the source of a fetch or pull
           operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT
           URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).

       &lt;group&gt;
           A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of
           remotes.&lt;group&gt; in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).

       &lt;refspec&gt;
           The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus +, followed
           by the source ref &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon :, followed by the
           destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.

           The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt; is fetched, and if &lt;dst&gt; is not
           empty string, the local ref that matches it is fast-forwarded using
           &lt;src&gt;. If the optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated even
           if it does not result in a fast-forward update.

               Note
               If the remote branch from which you want to pull is modified in
               non-linear ways such as being rewound and rebased frequently,
               then a pull will attempt a merge with an older version of itself,
               likely conflict, and fail. It is under these conditions that you
               would want to use the + sign to indicate non-fast-forward updates
               will be needed. There is currently no easy way to determine or
               declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with
               this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the
               expected usage pattern for a branch.

               Note
               You never do your own development on branches that appear on the
               right hand side of a &lt;refspec&gt; colon on Pull: lines; they are to
               be updated by git fetch. If you intend to do development derived
               from a remote branch B, have a Pull: line to track it (i.e.
               Pull: B:remote-B), and have a separate branch my-B to do your
               development on top of it. The latter is created by git branch
               my-B remote-B (or its equivalent git checkout -b my-B remote-B).
               Run git fetch to keep track of the progress of the remote side,
               and when you see something new on the remote branch, merge it
               into your development branch with git pull . remote-B, while you
               are on my-B branch.

               Note
               There is a difference between listing multiple &lt;refspec&gt; directly
               on git pull command line and having multiple Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;
               lines for a &lt;repository&gt; and running git pull command without any
               explicit &lt;refspec&gt; parameters. &lt;refspec&gt; listed explicitly on the
               command line are always merged into the current branch after
               fetching. In other words, if you list more than one remote refs,
               you would be making an Octopus. While git pull run without any
               explicit &lt;refspec&gt; parameter takes default &lt;refspec&gt;s from Pull:
               lines, it merges only the first &lt;refspec&gt; found into the current
               branch, after fetching all the remote refs. This is because
               making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping
               track of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than
               one is often useful.
           Some short-cut notations are also supported.

           &#183;    tag &lt;tag&gt; means the same as refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;; it
               requests fetching everything up to the given tag.

           &#183;   A parameter &lt;ref&gt; without a colon is equivalent to &lt;ref&gt;: when
               pulling/fetching, so it merges &lt;ref&gt; into the current branch
               without storing the remote branch anywhere locally

GIT URLS
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
       address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
       on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git natively supports ssh, git, http, https, ftp, ftps, and rsync
       protocols. The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       &#183;   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       &#183;   [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

       &#183;   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;   [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       For local repositories, also supported by git natively, the following
       syntaxes may be used:

       &#183;   /path/to/repo.git/

       &#183;    file:///path/to/repo.git/

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
       former implies --local option. See git-clone(1) for details.

       When git doesn&#8217;t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
       attempts to use the remote-&lt;transport&gt; remote helper, if one exists. To
       explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       &#183;   &lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;

       where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
       URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
       See git-remote-helpers(1) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
       you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
       will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
       section of the form:

                   [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                           insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;


       For example, with this:

                   [url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:


       a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like &quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
       rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
       &quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration
       section of the form:

                   [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                           pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;


       For example, with this:

                   [url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/


       a URL like &quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten to
       &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; for pushes, but pulls will still use
       the original URL.

REMOTES
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
       &lt;repository&gt; argument:

       &#183;   a remote in the git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,

       &#183;   a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or

       &#183;   a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
       because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

   Named remote in configuration file
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
       configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or even by a manual edit to
       the $GIT_DIR/config file. The URL of this remote will be used to access
       the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by default when
       you do not provide a refspec on the command line. The entry in the config
       file would appear like this:

                   [remote &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;]
                           url = &lt;url&gt;
                           pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt;
                           push = &lt;refspec&gt;
                           fetch = &lt;refspec&gt;


       The &lt;pushurl&gt; is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to
       &lt;url&gt;.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL
       in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec in this
       file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on the
       command line. This file should have the following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL format
                   Push: &lt;refspec&gt;
                   Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;


       Push: lines are used by git push and Pull: lines are used by git pull and
       git fetch. Multiple Push: and Pull: lines may be specified for additional
       branch mappings.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/branches. The
       URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file should
       have the following format:

                   &lt;url&gt;#&lt;head&gt;


       &lt;url&gt; is required; #&lt;head&gt; is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs,
       if you don&#8217;t provide one on the command line. &lt;branch&gt; is the name of
       this file in $GIT_DIR/branches and &lt;head&gt; defaults to master.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;


       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;


EXAMPLES
       &#183;   Update the remote-tracking branches:

               $ git fetch origin

           The above command copies all branches from the remote refs/heads/
           namespace and stores them to the local refs/remotes/origin/
           namespace, unless the branch.&lt;name&gt;.fetch option is used to specify a
           non-default refspec.

       &#183;   Using refspecs explicitly:

               $ git fetch origin +pu:pu maint:tmp

           This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches pu and tmp in the
           local repository by fetching from the branches (respectively) pu and
           maint from the remote repository.

           The pu branch will be updated even if it is does not fast-forward,
           because it is prefixed with a plus sign; tmp will not be.

BUGS
       Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked
       out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the
       just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself can not be
       fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later without
       having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future git
       version.
