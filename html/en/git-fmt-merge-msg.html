GIT-FMT-MERGE-MSG(1)               Git Manual               GIT-FMT-MERGE-MSG(1)



NAME
       git-fmt-merge-msg - Produce a merge commit message

SYNOPSIS
       git fmt-merge-msg [-m &lt;message&gt;] [--log[=&lt;n&gt;] | --no-log] &lt;$GIT_DIR/FETCH_HEAD
       git fmt-merge-msg [-m &lt;message&gt;] [--log[=&lt;n&gt;] | --no-log] -F &lt;file&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       Takes the list of merged objects on stdin and produces a suitable commit
       message to be used for the merge commit, usually to be passed as the
       &lt;merge-message&gt; argument of git merge.

       This command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts automatically
       invoking git merge.

OPTIONS
       --log[=&lt;n&gt;]
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line
           descriptions from the actual commits that are being merged. At most
           &lt;n&gt; commits from each merge parent will be used (20 if &lt;n&gt; is
           omitted). This overrides the merge.log configuration variable.

       --no-log
           Do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being
           merged.

       --summary, --no-summary
           Synonyms to --log and --no-log; these are deprecated and will be
           removed in the future.

       -m &lt;message&gt;, --message &lt;message&gt;
           Use &lt;message&gt; instead of the branch names for the first line of the
           log message. For use with --log.

       -F &lt;file&gt;, --file &lt;file&gt;
           Take the list of merged objects from &lt;file&gt; instead of stdin.

CONFIGURATION
       merge.branchdesc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the branch
           description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

       merge.log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most
           the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual commits
           that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for
           20.

       merge.summary
           Synonym to merge.log; this is deprecated and will be removed in the
           future.
