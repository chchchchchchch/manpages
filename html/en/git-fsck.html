GIT-FSCK(1)                        Git Manual                        GIT-FSCK(1)



NAME
       git-fsck - Verifies the connectivity and validity of the objects in the
       database

SYNOPSIS
       git fsck [--tags] [--root] [--unreachable] [--cache] [--no-reflogs]
                [--[no-]full] [--strict] [--verbose] [--lost-found]
                [--[no-]dangling] [--[no-]progress] [&lt;object&gt;*]


DESCRIPTION
       Verifies the connectivity and validity of the objects in the database.

OPTIONS
       &lt;object&gt;
           An object to treat as the head of an unreachability trace.

           If no objects are given, git fsck defaults to using the index file,
           all SHA1 references in .git/refs/*, and all reflogs (unless
           --no-reflogs is given) as heads.

       --unreachable
           Print out objects that exist but that aren&#8217;t reachable from any of
           the reference nodes.

       --dangling, --no-dangling
           Print objects that exist but that are never directly used (default).
           --no-dangling can be used to omit this information from the output.

       --root
           Report root nodes.

       --tags
           Report tags.

       --cache
           Consider any object recorded in the index also as a head node for an
           unreachability trace.

       --no-reflogs
           Do not consider commits that are referenced only by an entry in a
           reflog to be reachable. This option is meant only to search for
           commits that used to be in a ref, but now aren&#8217;t, but are still in
           that corresponding reflog.

       --full
           Check not just objects in GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY ($GIT_DIR/objects),
           but also the ones found in alternate object pools listed in
           GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES or $GIT_DIR/objects/info/alternates,
           and in packed git archives found in $GIT_DIR/objects/pack and
           corresponding pack subdirectories in alternate object pools. This is
           now default; you can turn it off with --no-full.

       --strict
           Enable more strict checking, namely to catch a file mode recorded
           with g+w bit set, which was created by older versions of git.
           Existing repositories, including the Linux kernel, git itself, and
           sparse repository have old objects that triggers this check, but it
           is recommended to check new projects with this flag.

       --verbose
           Be chatty.

       --lost-found
           Write dangling objects into .git/lost-found/commit/ or
           .git/lost-found/other/, depending on type. If the object is a blob,
           the contents are written into the file, rather than its object name.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default
           when it is attached to a terminal, unless --no-progress or --verbose
           is specified. --progress forces progress status even if the standard
           error stream is not directed to a terminal.

DISCUSSION
       git-fsck tests SHA1 and general object sanity, and it does full tracking
       of the resulting reachability and everything else. It prints out any
       corruption it finds (missing or bad objects), and if you use the
       --unreachable flag it will also print out objects that exist but that
       aren&#8217;t reachable from any of the specified head nodes (or the default
       set, as mentioned above).

       Any corrupt objects you will have to find in backups or other archives
       (i.e., you can just remove them and do an rsync with some other site in
       the hopes that somebody else has the object you have corrupted).

EXTRACTED DIAGNOSTICS
       expect dangling commits - potential heads - due to lack of head
       information
           You haven&#8217;t specified any nodes as heads so it won&#8217;t be possible to
           differentiate between un-parented commits and root nodes.

       missing sha1 directory &lt;dir&gt;
           The directory holding the sha1 objects is missing.

       unreachable &lt;type&gt; &lt;object&gt;
           The &lt;type&gt; object &lt;object&gt;, isn&#8217;t actually referred to directly or
           indirectly in any of the trees or commits seen. This can mean that
           there&#8217;s another root node that you&#8217;re not specifying or that the tree
           is corrupt. If you haven&#8217;t missed a root node then you might as well
           delete unreachable nodes since they can&#8217;t be used.

       missing &lt;type&gt; &lt;object&gt;
           The &lt;type&gt; object &lt;object&gt;, is referred to but isn&#8217;t present in the
           database.

       dangling &lt;type&gt; &lt;object&gt;
           The &lt;type&gt; object &lt;object&gt;, is present in the database but never
           directly used. A dangling commit could be a root node.

       sha1 mismatch &lt;object&gt;
           The database has an object who&#8217;s sha1 doesn&#8217;t match the database
           value. This indicates a serious data integrity problem.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           used to specify the object database root (usually $GIT_DIR/objects)

       GIT_INDEX_FILE
           used to specify the index file of the index

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           used to specify additional object database roots (usually unset)
