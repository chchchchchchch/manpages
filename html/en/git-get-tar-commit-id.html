GIT-GET-TAR-COMMI(1)               Git Manual               GIT-GET-TAR-COMMI(1)



NAME
       git-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created using
       git-archive

SYNOPSIS
       git get-tar-commit-id &lt; &lt;tarfile&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       Acts as a filter, extracting the commit ID stored in archives created by
       git archive. It reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its
       runtime is not influenced by the size of &lt;tarfile&gt; very much.

       If no commit ID is found, git get-tar-commit-id quietly exists with a
       return code of 1. This can happen if &lt;tarfile&gt; had not been created using
       git archive or if the first parameter of git archive had been a tree ID
       instead of a commit ID or tag.
