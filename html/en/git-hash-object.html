GIT-HASH-OBJECT(1)                 Git Manual                 GIT-HASH-OBJECT(1)



NAME
       git-hash-object - Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a
       file

SYNOPSIS
       git hash-object [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w] [--path=&lt;file&gt;|--no-filters] [--stdin] [--] &lt;file&gt;...
       git hash-object [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w] --stdin-paths [--no-filters] &lt; &lt;list-of-paths&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       Computes the object ID value for an object with specified type with the
       contents of the named file (which can be outside of the work tree), and
       optionally writes the resulting object into the object database. Reports
       its object ID to its standard output. This is used by git cvsimport to
       update the index without modifying files in the work tree. When &lt;type&gt; is
       not specified, it defaults to &quot;blob&quot;.

OPTIONS
       -t &lt;type&gt;
           Specify the type (default: &quot;blob&quot;).

       -w
           Actually write the object into the object database.

       --stdin
           Read the object from standard input instead of from a file.

       --stdin-paths
           Read file names from stdin instead of from the command-line.

       --path
           Hash object as it were located at the given path. The location of
           file does not directly influence on the hash value, but path is used
           to determine what git filters should be applied to the object before
           it can be placed to the object database, and, as result of applying
           filters, the actual blob put into the object database may differ from
           the given file. This option is mainly useful for hashing temporary
           files located outside of the working directory or files read from
           stdin.

       --no-filters
           Hash the contents as is, ignoring any input filter that would have
           been chosen by the attributes mechanism, including the end-of-line
           conversion. If the file is read from standard input then this is
           always implied, unless the --path option is given.
