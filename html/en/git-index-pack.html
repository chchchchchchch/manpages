GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)                  Git Manual                  GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)



NAME
       git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive

SYNOPSIS
       git index-pack [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;] &lt;pack-file&gt;
       git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
                        [&lt;pack-file&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds a pack
       index file (.idx) for it. The packed archive together with the pack index
       can then be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git repository.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status.

       -o &lt;index-file&gt;
           Write the generated pack index into the specified file. Without this
           option the name of pack index file is constructed from the name of
           packed archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program
           fails if the name of packed archive does not end with .pack).

       --stdin
           When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin instead and a
           copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified,
           the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the current git
           repository with a default name determined from the pack content. If
           &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified consider using --keep to prevent a race
           condition between this process and git repack.

       --fix-thin
           Fix a &quot;thin&quot; pack produced by git pack-objects --thin (see git-pack-
           objects(1) for details) by adding the excluded objects the deltified
           objects are based on to the pack. This option only makes sense in
           conjunction with --stdin.

       --keep
           Before moving the index into its final destination create an empty
           .keep file for the associated pack file. This option is usually
           necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous git repack process
           from deleting the newly constructed pack and index before refs can be
           updated to use objects contained in the pack.

       --keep=&lt;msg&gt;
           Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index into its
           final destination, but rather than creating an empty file place &lt;msg&gt;
           followed by an LF into the .keep file. The &lt;msg&gt; message can later be
           searched for within all .keep files to locate any which have outlived
           their usefulness.

       --index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
           This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows to
           force the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64-bit
           index entries on objects located above the given offset.

       --strict
           Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.

NOTE
       Once the index has been created, the list of object names is sorted and
       the SHA1 hash of that list is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also used
       then this is prefixed by either &quot;pack\t&quot;, or &quot;keep\t&quot; if a new .keep file
       was successfully created. This is useful to remove a .keep file used as a
       lock to prevent the race with git repack mentioned above.
