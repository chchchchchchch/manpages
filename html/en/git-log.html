GIT-LOG(1)                         Git Manual                         GIT-LOG(1)



NAME
       git-log - Show commit logs

SYNOPSIS
       git log [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;since&gt;..&lt;until&gt;] [[--] &lt;path&gt;...]


DESCRIPTION
       Shows the commit logs.

       The command takes options applicable to the git rev-list command to
       control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff-*
       commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown.

OPTIONS
       -&lt;n&gt;
           Limits the number of commits to show. Note that this is a commit
           limiting option, see below.

       &lt;since&gt;..&lt;until&gt;
           Show only commits between the named two commits. When either &lt;since&gt;
           or &lt;until&gt; is omitted, it defaults to HEAD, i.e. the tip of the
           current branch. For a more complete list of ways to spell &lt;since&gt; and
           &lt;until&gt;, see gitrevisions(7).

       --follow
           Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for
           a single file).

       --no-decorate, --decorate[=short|full|no]
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If short is
           specified, the ref name prefixes refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and
           refs/remotes/ will not be printed. If full is specified, the full ref
           name (including prefix) will be printed. The default option is short.

       --source
           Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit
           was reached.

       --full-diff
           Without this flag, &quot;git log -p &lt;path&gt;...&quot; shows commits that touch
           the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths. With
           this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified
           paths; this means that &quot;&lt;path&gt;...&quot; limits only commits, and doesn&#8217;t
           limit diff for those commits.

           Note that this affects all diff-based output types, e.g. those
           produced by --stat etc.

       --log-size
           Before the log message print out its size in bytes. Intended mainly
           for porcelain tools consumption. If git is unable to produce a valid
           value size is set to zero. Note that only message is considered, if
           also a diff is shown its size is not included.

       [--] &lt;path&gt;...
           Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match
           the specified paths came to be. See &quot;History Simplification&quot; below
           for details and other simplification modes.

           To prevent confusion with options and branch names, paths may need to
           be prefixed with &quot;-- &quot; to separate them from options or refnames.

   Commit Limiting
       Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
       special notations explained in the description, additional commit
       limiting may be applied. Note that they are applied before commit
       ordering and formatting options, such as --reverse.

       -n number, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;
           Limit the number of commits to output.

       --skip=&lt;number&gt;
           Skip number commits before starting to show the commit output.

       --since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

       --until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits older than a specific date.

       --author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines
           that match the specified pattern (regular expression).

       --grep=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the
           specified pattern (regular expression).

       --all-match
           Limit the commits output to ones that match all given --grep,
           --author and --committer instead of ones that match at least one.

       -i, --regexp-ignore-case
           Match the regexp limiting patterns without regard to letters case.

       -E, --extended-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
           instead of the default basic regular expressions.

       -F, --fixed-strings
           Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don&#8217;t interpret
           pattern as a regular expression).

       --remove-empty
           Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.

       --merges
           Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
           --min-parents=2.

       --no-merges
           Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly the
           same as --max-parents=1.

       --min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents,
       --no-max-parents
           Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many commits.
           In particular, --max-parents=1 is the same as --no-merges,
           --min-parents=2 is the same as --merges.  --max-parents=0 gives all
           root commits and --min-parents=3 all octopus merges.

           --no-min-parents and --no-max-parents reset these limits (to no
           limit) again. Equivalent forms are --min-parents=0 (any commit has 0
           or more parents) and --max-parents=-1 (negative numbers denote no
           upper limit).

       --first-parent
           Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This
           option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a
           particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to
           be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and
           this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to
           your history by such a merge.

       --not
           Reverses the meaning of the ^ prefix (or lack thereof) for all
           following revision specifiers, up to the next --not.

       --all
           Pretend as if all the refs in refs/ are listed on the command line as
           &lt;commit&gt;.

       --branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in refs/heads are listed on the command
           line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given, limit branches to ones
           matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks ?, *, or [, /* at the end
           is implied.

       --tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in refs/tags are listed on the command
           line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given, limit tags to ones matching
           given shell glob. If pattern lacks ?, *, or [, /* at the end is
           implied.

       --remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in refs/remotes are listed on the command
           line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given, limit remote-tracking
           branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks ?, *, or
           [, /* at the end is implied.

       --glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob &lt;glob-pattern&gt; are
           listed on the command line as &lt;commit&gt;. Leading refs/, is
           automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks ?, *, or [, /*
           at the end is implied.

       --ignore-missing
           Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the
           bad input was not given.

       --bisect
           Pretend as if the bad bisection ref refs/bisect/bad was listed and as
           if it was followed by --not and the good bisection refs
           refs/bisect/good-* on the command line.

       --stdin
           In addition to the &lt;commit&gt; listed on the command line, read them
           from the standard input. If a -- separator is seen, stop reading
           commits and start reading paths to limit the result.

       --cherry-mark
           Like --cherry-pick (see below) but mark equivalent commits with =
           rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with +.

       --cherry-pick
           Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on
           the &quot;other side&quot; when the set of commits are limited with symmetric
           difference.

           For example, if you have two branches, A and B, a usual way to list
           all commits on only one side of them is with --left-right (see the
           example below in the description of the --left-right option). It
           however shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other
           branch (for example, &quot;3rd on b&quot; may be cherry-picked from branch A).
           With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output.

       --left-only, --right-only
           List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric range, i.e.
           only those which would be marked &lt; resp.  &gt; by --left-right.

           For example, --cherry-pick --right-only A...B omits those commits
           from B which are in A or are patch-equivalent to a commit in A. In
           other words, this lists the + commits from git cherry A B. More
           precisely, --cherry-pick --right-only --no-merges gives the exact
           list.

       --cherry
           A synonym for --right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges; useful to limit
           the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been
           applied to the other side of a forked history with git log --cherry
           upstream...mybranch, similar to git cherry upstream mybranch.

       -g, --walk-reflogs
           Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries
           from the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you
           cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, ^commit,
           commit1..commit2, nor commit1...commit2 notations cannot be used).

           With --pretty format other than oneline (for obvious reasons), this
           causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from
           the reflog. By default, commit@{Nth} notation is used in the output.
           When the starting commit is specified as commit@{now}, output also
           uses commit@{timestamp} notation instead. Under --pretty=oneline, the
           commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line.
           This option cannot be combined with --reverse. See also git-
           reflog(1).

       --merge
           After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a conflict
           and don&#8217;t exist on all heads to merge.

       --boundary
           Output uninteresting commits at the boundary, which are usually not
           shown.

   History Simplification
       Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example
       the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of
       History Simplification, one part is selecting the commits and the other
       is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history.

       The following options select the commits to be shown:

       &lt;paths&gt;
           Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.

       --simplify-by-decoration
           Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.

       Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.

       The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:

       Default mode
           Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final
           state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if
           the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same
           content)
&#12;       --full-history
           Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.

       --dense
           Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful
           history.

       --sparse
           All commits in the simplified history are shown.

       --simplify-merges
           Additional option to --full-history to remove some needless merges
           from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
           contributing to this merge.

       --ancestry-path
           When given a range of commits to display (e.g.  commit1..commit2 or
           commit2 ^commit1), only display commits that exist directly on the
           ancestry chain between the commit1 and commit2, i.e. commits that are
           both descendants of commit1, and ancestors of commit2.

       A more detailed explanation follows.

       Suppose you specified foo as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that
       modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for foo,
       they look different and equal, respectively.)

       In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
       illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
       that you are filtering for a file foo in this commit graph:

                     .-A---M---N---O---P
                    /     /   /   /   /
                   I     B   C   D   E
                    \   /   /   /   /
                     `-------------&apos;


       The horizontal line of history A---P is taken to be the first parent of
       each merge. The commits are:

       &#183;    I is the initial commit, in which foo exists with contents &quot;asdf&quot;,
           and a file quux exists with contents &quot;quux&quot;. Initial commits are
           compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME.

       &#183;   In A, foo contains just &quot;foo&quot;.

       &#183;    B contains the same change as A. Its merge M is trivial and hence
           TREESAME to all parents.

       &#183;    C does not change foo, but its merge N changes it to &quot;foobar&quot;, so it
           is not TREESAME to any parent.

       &#183;    D sets foo to &quot;baz&quot;. Its merge O combines the strings from N and D
           to &quot;foobarbaz&quot;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       &#183;    E changes quux to &quot;xyzzy&quot;, and its merge P combines the strings to
           &quot;quux xyzzy&quot;. Despite appearing interesting, P is TREESAME to all
           parents.

       rev-list walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits
       based on whether --full-history and/or parent rewriting (via --parents or
       --children) are used. The following settings are available.

       Default mode
           Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though
           this can be changed, see --sparse below). If the commit was a merge,
           and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even if
           there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.)
           Otherwise, follow all parents.

           This results in:

                         .-A---N---O
                        /     /   /
                       I---------D

           Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
           available, removed B from consideration entirely.  C was considered
           via N, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an empty tree,
           so I is !TREESAME.

           Parent/child relations are only visible with --parents, but that does
           not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
           parent lines.

       --full-history without parent rewriting
           This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all
           parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if
           more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this
           does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get

                       I  A  B  N  D  O

           P and M were excluded because they are TREESAME to a parent.  E, C
           and B were all walked, but only B was !TREESAME, so the others do not
           appear.

           Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
           about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
           them disconnected.

       --full-history with parent rewriting
           Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this
           can be changed, see --sparse below).

           Merges are always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
           Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
           themselves. This results in

                         .-A---M---N---O---P
                        /     /   /   /   /
                       I     B   /   D   /
                        \   /   /   /   /
                         `-------------&apos;

           Compare to --full-history without rewriting above. Note that E was
           pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
           rewritten to contain E&apos;s parent I. The same happened for C and N.
           Note also that P was included despite being TREESAME.

       In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
       affects inclusion:

       --dense
           Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any
           parent.

       --sparse
           All commits that are walked are included.

           Note that without --full-history, this still simplifies merges: if
           one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other
           sides of the merge are never walked.

       --simplify-merges
           First, build a history graph in the same way that --full-history with
           parent rewriting does (see above).

           Then simplify each commit C to its replacement C&apos; in the final
           history according to the following rules:

           &#183;   Set C&apos; to C.

           &#183;   Replace each parent P of C&apos; with its simplification P&apos;. In the
               process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents, and
               remove duplicates.

           &#183;   If after this parent rewriting, C&apos; is a root or merge commit (has
               zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains.
               Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.

           The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
           --full-history with parent rewriting. The example turns into:

                         .-A---M---N---O
                        /     /       /
                       I     B       D
                        \   /       /
                         `---------&apos;

           Note the major differences in N and P over --full-history:

           &#183;    N&apos;s parent list had I removed, because it is an ancestor of the
               other parent M. Still, N remained because it is !TREESAME.

           &#183;    P&apos;s parent list similarly had I removed.  P was then removed
               completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.

       Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:

       --ancestry-path
           Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry chain
           between the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; commits in the given commit range. I.e.
           only display commits that are ancestor of the &quot;to&quot; commit, and
           descendants of the &quot;from&quot; commit.

           As an example use case, consider the following commit history:

                           D---E-------F
                          /     \       \
                         B---C---G---H---I---J
                        /                     \
                       A-------K---------------L--M

           A regular D..M computes the set of commits that are ancestors of M,
           but excludes the ones that are ancestors of D. This is useful to see
           what happened to the history leading to M since D, in the sense that
           &quot;what does M have that did not exist in D&quot;. The result in this
           example would be all the commits, except A and B (and D itself, of
           course).

           When we want to find out what commits in M are contaminated with the
           bug introduced by D and need fixing, however, we might want to view
           only the subset of D..M that are actually descendants of D, i.e.
           excluding C and K. This is exactly what the --ancestry-path option
           does. Applied to the D..M range, it results in:
&#12;                               E-------F
                                \       \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M


       The --simplify-by-decoration option allows you to view only the big
       picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
       referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept
       after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
       referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on
       the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be
       simplified away).

   Commit Ordering
       By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

       --topo-order
           This option makes them appear in topological order (i.e. descendant
           commits are shown before their parents).

       --date-order
           This option is similar to --topo-order in the sense that no parent
           comes before all of its children, but otherwise things are still
           ordered in the commit timestamp order.

       --reverse
           Output the commits in reverse order. Cannot be combined with
           --walk-reflogs.

   Object Traversal
       These options are mostly targeted for packing of git repositories.

       --objects
           Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed commits.
           --objects foo ^bar thus means &quot;send me all object IDs which I need to
           download if I have the commit object bar, but not foo&quot;.

       --objects-edge
           Similar to --objects, but also print the IDs of excluded commits
           prefixed with a &quot;-&quot; character. This is used by git-pack-objects(1) to
           build &quot;thin&quot; pack, which records objects in deltified form based on
           objects contained in these excluded commits to reduce network
           traffic.

       --unpacked
           Only useful with --objects; print the object IDs that are not in
           packs.

       --no-walk
           Only show the given revs, but do not traverse their ancestors.

       --do-walk
           Overrides a previous --no-walk.

   Commit Formatting
       --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;
           Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
           &lt;format&gt; can be one of oneline, short, medium, full, fuller, email,
           raw and format:&lt;string&gt;. See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some
           additional details for each format. When omitted, the format defaults
           to medium.

           Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
           configuration (see git-config(1)).

       --abbrev-commit
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name,
           show only a partial prefix. Non default number of digits can be
           specified with &quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff output, if it
           is displayed).

           This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more readable for
           people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
           Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
           --abbrev-commit and those options which imply it such as &quot;--oneline&quot;.
           It also overrides the log.abbrevCommit variable.

       --oneline
           This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit&quot; used
           together.

       --encoding[=&lt;encoding&gt;]
           The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in
           their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to
           re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user.
           For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8.

       --notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]
           Show the notes (see git-notes(1)) that annotate the commit, when
           showing the commit log message. This is the default for git log, git
           show and git whatchanged commands when there is no --pretty, --format
           nor --oneline option given on the command line.

           By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
           core.notesRef and notes.displayRef variables (or corresponding
           environment overrides). See git-config(1) for more details.

           With an optional &lt;ref&gt; argument, show this notes ref instead of the
           default notes ref(s). The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it is
           not qualified.

           Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
           being displayed. Examples: &quot;--notes=foo&quot; will show only notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot;; &quot;--notes=foo --notes&quot; will show both notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot; and from the default notes ref(s).

       --no-notes
           Do not show notes. This negates the above --notes option, by
           resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown. Options
           are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g. &quot;--notes
           --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar&quot; will only show notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/bar&quot;.

       --show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes
           These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
           options instead.

       --relative-date
           Synonym for --date=relative.

       --date=(relative|local|default|iso|rfc|short|raw)
           Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such as
           when using &quot;--pretty&quot;.  log.date config variable sets a default value
           for log command&#8217;s --date option.

           --date=relative shows dates relative to the current time, e.g. &quot;2
           hours ago&quot;.
&#12;           --date=local shows timestamps in user&#8217;s local timezone.

           --date=iso (or --date=iso8601) shows timestamps in ISO 8601 format.

           --date=rfc (or --date=rfc2822) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format,
           often found in E-mail messages.

           --date=short shows only date but not time, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

           --date=raw shows the date in the internal raw git format %s %z
           format.

           --date=default shows timestamps in the original timezone (either
           committer&#8217;s or author&#8217;s).

       --parents
           Print also the parents of the commit (in the form &quot;commit
           parent...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see History
           Simplification below.

       --children
           Print also the children of the commit (in the form &quot;commit
           child...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see History Simplification
           below.

       --left-right
           Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from.
           Commits from the left side are prefixed with &lt; and those from the
           right with &gt;. If combined with --boundary, those commits are prefixed
           with -.

           For example, if you have this topology:

                            y---b---b  branch B
                           / \ /
                          /   .
                         /   / \
                        o---x---a---a  branch A

           you would get an output like this:

                       $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
                       -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
                       -xxxxxxx... 1st on a


       --graph
           Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on
           the left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be
           printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be
           drawn properly.

           This enables parent rewriting, see History Simplification below.

           This implies the --topo-order option by default, but the --date-order
           option may also be specified.

   Diff Formatting
       Below are listed options that control the formatting of diff output. Some
       of them are specific to git-rev-list(1), however other diff options may
       be given. See git-diff-files(1) for more options.

       -c
           With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows the
           differences from each of the parents to the merge result
           simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and
           the result one at a time. Furthermore, it lists only files which were
           modified from all parents.

       --cc
           This flag implies the -c options and further compresses the patch
           output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents in the parents
           have only two variants and the merge result picks one of them without
           modification.

       -m
           This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like regular
           commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry and diff is
           generated. An exception is that only diff against the first parent is
           shown when --first-parent option is given; in that case, the output
           represents the changes the merge brought into the then-current
           branch.

       -r
           Show recursive diffs.

       -t
           Show the tree objects in the diff output. This implies -r.

       -s
           Suppress diff output.

PRETTY FORMATS
       If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not oneline, email
       or raw, an additional line is inserted before the Author: line. This line
       begins with &quot;Merge: &quot; and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed,
       separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be
       the list of the direct parent commits if you have limited your view of
       history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a
       certain directory or file.

       There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional formats
       by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another format name,
       or a format: string, as described below (see git-config(1)). Here are the
       details of the built-in formats:

       &#183;    oneline

               &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;title line&gt;

           This is designed to be as compact as possible.

       &#183;    short

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

       &#183;    medium

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Date:   &lt;author date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;
&#12;               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    full

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Commit: &lt;committer&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    fuller

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author:     &lt;author&gt;
               AuthorDate: &lt;author date&gt;
               Commit:     &lt;committer&gt;
               CommitDate: &lt;committer date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    email

               From &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;date&gt;
               From: &lt;author&gt;
               Date: &lt;author date&gt;
               Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    raw

           The raw format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the
           commit object. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in full, regardless
           of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and parents information
           show the true parent commits, without taking grafts nor history
           simplification into account.

       &#183;    format:&lt;string&gt;

           The format:&lt;string&gt; format allows you to specify which information
           you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format, with the
           notable exception that you get a newline with %n instead of \n.

           E.g, format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&quot;
           would show something like this:

               The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
               The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;

           The placeholders are:

           &#183;    %H: commit hash

           &#183;    %h: abbreviated commit hash

           &#183;    %T: tree hash

           &#183;    %t: abbreviated tree hash

           &#183;    %P: parent hashes

           &#183;    %p: abbreviated parent hashes

           &#183;    %an: author name

           &#183;    %aN: author name (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1) or
               git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %ae: author email

           &#183;    %aE: author email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1) or
               git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %ad: author date (format respects --date= option)

           &#183;    %aD: author date, RFC2822 style

           &#183;    %ar: author date, relative

           &#183;    %at: author date, UNIX timestamp

           &#183;    %ai: author date, ISO 8601 format

           &#183;    %cn: committer name

           &#183;    %cN: committer name (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1) or
               git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %ce: committer email

           &#183;    %cE: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1)
               or git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %cd: committer date

           &#183;    %cD: committer date, RFC2822 style

           &#183;    %cr: committer date, relative

           &#183;    %ct: committer date, UNIX timestamp

           &#183;    %ci: committer date, ISO 8601 format

           &#183;    %d: ref names, like the --decorate option of git-log(1)

           &#183;    %e: encoding

           &#183;    %s: subject

           &#183;    %f: sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename

           &#183;    %b: body

           &#183;    %B: raw body (unwrapped subject and body)

           &#183;    %N: commit notes

           &#183;    %gD: reflog selector, e.g., refs/stash@{1}

           &#183;    %gd: shortened reflog selector, e.g., stash@{1}

           &#183;    %gn: reflog identity name

           &#183;    %gN: reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see git-
               shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %ge: reflog identity email
&#12;           &#183;    %gE: reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see git-
               shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %gs: reflog subject

           &#183;    %Cred: switch color to red

           &#183;    %Cgreen: switch color to green

           &#183;    %Cblue: switch color to blue

           &#183;    %Creset: reset color

           &#183;    %C(...): color specification, as described in color.branch.*
               config option

           &#183;    %m: left, right or boundary mark

           &#183;    %n: newline

           &#183;    %%: a raw %

           &#183;    %x00: print a byte from a hex code

           &#183;    %w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]]): switch line wrapping, like the -w
               option of git-shortlog(1).

           Note
           Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision
           traversal engine. For example, the %g* reflog options will insert an
           empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by git
           log -g). The %d placeholder will use the &quot;short&quot; decoration format if
           --decorate was not already provided on the command line.

       If you add a + (plus sign) after % of a placeholder, a line-feed is
       inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
       expands to a non-empty string.

       If you add a - (minus sign) after % of a placeholder, line-feeds that
       immediately precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
       placeholder expands to an empty string.

       If you add a ` ` (space) after % of a placeholder, a space is inserted
       immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
       to a non-empty string.

       &#183;    tformat:

           The tformat: format works exactly like format:, except that it
           provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of &quot;separator&quot; semantics. In
           other words, each commit has the message terminator character
           (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between
           entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line format will
           be properly terminated with a new line, just as the &quot;oneline&quot; format
           does. For example:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe &apos;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/&apos;
               4da45be
               7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe &apos;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/&apos;
               4da45be
               7134973
&#12;           In addition, any unrecognized string that has a % in it is
           interpreted as if it has tformat: in front of it. For example, these
           two are equivalent:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
               $ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef


COMMON DIFF OPTIONS
       -p, -u, --patch
           Generate patch (see section on generating patches).

       -U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;
           Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.
           Implies -p.

       --raw
           Generate the raw format.

       --patch-with-raw
           Synonym for -p --raw.

       --minimal
           Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.

       --patience
           Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm.

       --histogram
           Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot; algorithm.

       --stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]
           Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary will be
           used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum
           width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
           terminal, and can be overriden by &lt;width&gt;. The width of the filename
           part can be limited by giving another width &lt;name-width&gt; after a
           comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
           --stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt; (affects all commands generating a stat
           graph) or by setting diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt; (does not affect git
           format-patch). By giving a third parameter &lt;count&gt;, you can limit the
           output to the first &lt;count&gt; lines, followed by ...  if there are
           more.

           These parameters can also be set individually with
           --stat-width=&lt;width&gt;, --stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt; and
           --stat-count=&lt;count&gt;.

       --numstat
           Similar to --stat, but shows number of added and deleted lines in
           decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more
           machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two - instead of saying 0
           0.

       --shortstat
           Output only the last line of the --stat format containing total
           number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted
           lines.

       --dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]
           Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
           sub-directory. The behavior of --dirstat can be customized by passing
           it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled
           by the diff.dirstat configuration variable (see git-config(1)). The
           following parameters are available:
&#12;           changes
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been
               removed from the source, or added to the destination. This
               ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other
               words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as
               other changes. This is the default behavior when no parameter is
               given.

           lines
               Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
               analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary
               files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no
               natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive --dirstat
               behavior than the changes behavior, but it does count rearranged
               lines within a file as much as other changes. The resulting
               output is consistent with what you get from the other --*stat
               options.

           files
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
               changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
               analysis. This is the computationally cheapest --dirstat
               behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at
               all.

           cumulative
               Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as
               well. Note that when using cumulative, the sum of the percentages
               reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
               can be specified with the noncumulative parameter.

           &lt;limit&gt;
               An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
               Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
               are not shown in the output.

           Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
           directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files,
           and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
           --dirstat=files,10,cumulative.

       --summary
           Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as
           creations, renames and mode changes.

       --patch-with-stat
           Synonym for -p --stat.

       -z
           Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new newlines.

           Also, when --raw or --numstat has been given, do not munge pathnames
           and use NULs as output field terminators.

           Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double
           quotes, and backslash characters replaced with \t, \n, \&quot;, and \\,
           respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double quotes if
           any of those replacements occurred.

       --name-only
           Show only names of changed files.

       --name-status
           Show only names and status of changed files. See the description of
           the --diff-filter option on what the status letters mean.
&#12;       --submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]
           Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When --submodule or
           --submodule=log is given, the log format is used. This format lists
           the commits in the range like git-submodule(1) summary does. Omitting
           the --submodule option or specifying --submodule=short, uses the
           short format. This format just shows the names of the commits at the
           beginning and end of the range.

       --color[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Show colored diff. The value must be always (the default for &lt;when&gt;),
           never, or auto. The default value is never.

       --no-color
           Turn off colored diff. It is the same as --color=never.

       --word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]
           Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed words. By
           default, words are delimited by whitespace; see --word-diff-regex
           below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to plain, and must be one of:

           color
               Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies --color.

           plain
               Show words as [-removed-] and {+added+}. Makes no attempts to
               escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the output
               may be ambiguous.

           porcelain
               Use a special line-based format intended for script consumption.
               Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified
               diff format, starting with a +/-/` ` character at the beginning
               of the line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the
               input are represented by a tilde ~ on a line of its own.

           none
               Disable word diff again.

           Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
           highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.

       --word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;
           Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of considering runs of
           non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies --word-diff unless it was
           already enabled.

           Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word.
           Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and
           ignored(!) for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to
           append |[^[:space:]] to your regular expression to make sure that it
           matches all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a
           newline is silently truncated(!) at the newline.

           The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option,
           see gitattributes(1) or git-config(1). Giving it explicitly overrides
           any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers override
           configuration settings.

       --color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]
           Equivalent to --word-diff=color plus (if a regex was specified)
           --word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;.

       --no-renames
           Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the
           default to do so.
&#12;       --check
           Warn if changes introduce whitespace errors. What are considered
           whitespace errors is controlled by core.whitespace configuration. By
           default, trailing whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
           whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately followed by a
           tab character inside the initial indent of the line are considered
           whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if problems are found.
           Not compatible with --exit-code.

       --full-index
           Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre- and
           post-image blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when generating
           patch format output.

       --binary
           In addition to --full-index, output a binary diff that can be applied
           with git-apply.

       --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name in
           diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show only a
           partial prefix. This is independent of the --full-index option above,
           which controls the diff-patch output format. Non default number of
           digits can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.

       -B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;], --break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]
           Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This
           serves two purposes:

           It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
           not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
           few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a
           single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of
           everything new, and the number m controls this aspect of the -B
           option (defaults to 60%).  -B/70% specifies that less than 30% of the
           original should remain in the result for git to consider it a total
           rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of
           deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).

           When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
           source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared
           as the source of a rename), and the number n controls this aspect of
           the -B option (defaults to 50%).  -B20% specifies that a change with
           addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#8217;s size are
           eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to
           another file.

       -M[&lt;n&gt;], --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]
           If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit. For
           following files across renames while traversing history, see
           --follow. If n is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
           index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#8217;s
           size). For example, -M90% means git should consider a delete/add pair
           to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&#8217;t changed.

       -C[&lt;n&gt;], --find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Detect copies as well as renames. See also --find-copies-harder. If n
           is specified, it has the same meaning as for -M&lt;n&gt;.

       --find-copies-harder
           For performance reasons, by default, -C option finds copies only if
           the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset.
           This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
           for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large
           projects, so use it with caution. Giving more than one -C option has
           the same effect.

       -D, --irreversible-delete
           Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the
           diff between the preimage and /dev/null. The resulting patch is not
           meant to be applied with patch nor git apply; this is solely for
           people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the
           change. In addition, the output obviously lack enough information to
           apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the
           option.

           When used together with -B, omit also the preimage in the deletion
           part of a delete/create pair.

       -l&lt;num&gt;
           The -M and -C options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the
           number of potential rename/copy targets. This option prevents
           rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy
           targets exceeds the specified number.

       --diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]
           Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D),
           Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i.e. regular file,
           symlink, submodule, ...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown
           (X), or have had their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the
           filter characters (including none) can be used. When * (All-or-none)
           is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any
           file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no
           file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected.

       -S&lt;string&gt;
           Look for differences that introduce or remove an instance of
           &lt;string&gt;. Note that this is different than the string simply
           appearing in diff output; see the pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore(7) for
           more details.

       -G&lt;regex&gt;
           Look for differences whose added or removed line matches the given
           &lt;regex&gt;.

       --pickaxe-all
           When -S or -G finds a change, show all the changes in that changeset,
           not just the files that contain the change in &lt;string&gt;.

       --pickaxe-regex
           Make the &lt;string&gt; not a plain string but an extended POSIX regex to
           match.

       -O&lt;orderfile&gt;
           Output the patch in the order specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has
           one shell glob pattern per line.

       -R
           Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on-disk file
           to tree contents.

       --relative[=&lt;path&gt;]
           When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to
           exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to
           it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a
           bare repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output
           relative to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument.

       -a, --text
           Treat all files as text.

       --ignore-space-at-eol
           Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

       -b, --ignore-space-change
           Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at
           line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
           characters to be equivalent.

       -w, --ignore-all-space
           Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even
           if one line has whitespace where the other line has none.

       --inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;
           Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of
           lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.

       -W, --function-context
           Show whole surrounding functions of changes.

       --ext-diff
           Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an external
           diff driver with gitattributes(5), you need to use this option with
           git-log(1) and friends.

       --no-ext-diff
           Disallow external diff drivers.

       --textconv, --no-textconv
           Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when
           comparing binary files. See gitattributes(5) for details. Because
           textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting
           diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For
           this reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for git-
           diff(1) and git-log(1), but not for git-format-patch(1) or diff
           plumbing commands.

       --ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. &lt;when&gt; can be
           either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default
           Using &quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when it either
           contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the
           commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any
           settings of the ignore option in git-config(1) or gitmodules(5). When
           &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they
           only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for
           modified content). Using &quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree
           of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject
           are shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot; hides all
           changes to submodules.

       --src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;
           Show the given source prefix instead of &quot;a/&quot;.

       --dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;
           Show the given destination prefix instead of &quot;b/&quot;.

       --no-prefix
           Do not show any source or destination prefix.

       For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
       gitdiffcore(7).

GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P
       When &quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;, or &quot;git-diff-files&quot; are run with
       a -p option, &quot;git diff&quot; without the --raw option, or &quot;git log&quot; with the
       &quot;-p&quot; option, they do not produce the output described above; instead they
       produce a patch file. You can customize the creation of such patches via
       the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment variables.

       What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
       diff format:

        1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header that looks like this:

               diff --git a/file1 b/file2

           The a/ and b/ filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved.
           Especially, even for a creation or a deletion, /dev/null is not used
           in place of the a/ or b/ filenames.

           When rename/copy is involved, file1 and file2 show the name of the
           source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that
           rename/copy produces, respectively.

        2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines:

               old mode &lt;mode&gt;
               new mode &lt;mode&gt;
               deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
               new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
               copy from &lt;path&gt;
               copy to &lt;path&gt;
               rename from &lt;path&gt;
               rename to &lt;path&gt;
               similarity index &lt;number&gt;
               dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
               index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;

           File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file
           type and file permission bits.

           Path names in extended headers do not include the a/ and b/ prefixes.

           The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
           dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a
           rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity
           index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100%
           dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the
           new one.

           The index line includes the SHA-1 checksum before and after the
           change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not change;
           otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.

        3. TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in pathnames are
           represented as \t, \n, \&quot; and \\, respectively. If there is need for
           such substitution then the whole pathname is put in double quotes.

        4. All the file1 files in the output refer to files before the commit,
           and all the file2 files refer to files after the commit. It is
           incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially. For
           example, this patch will swap a and b:

               diff --git a/a b/b
               rename from a
               rename to b
               diff --git a/b b/a
               rename from b
               rename to a

COMBINED DIFF FORMAT
       Any diff-generating command can take the &#8216;-c` or --cc option to produce a
       combined diff when showing a merge. This is the default format when
       showing merges with git-diff(1) or git-show(1). Note also that you can
       give the `-m&#8217; option to any of these commands to force generation of
       diffs with individual parents of a merge.

       A combined diff format looks like this:

           diff --combined describe.c
           index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
           --- a/describe.c
           +++ b/describe.c
           @@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@
                   return (a_date &gt; b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1;
             }

           - static void describe(char *arg)
            -static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
           ++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one)
             {
            +      unsigned char sha1[20];
            +      struct commit *cmit;
                   struct commit_list *list;
                   static int initialized = 0;
                   struct commit_name *n;

            +      if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt; 0)
            +              usage(describe_usage);
            +      cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1);
            +      if (!cmit)
            +              usage(describe_usage);
            +
                   if (!initialized) {
                           initialized = 1;
                           for_each_ref(get_name);



        1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header, that looks like this (when
           -c option is used):

               diff --combined file

           or like this (when --cc option is used):

               diff --cc file

        2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example
           shows a merge with two parents):

               index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
               mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
               new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
               deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;

           The mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line appears only if at least one of
           the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest. Extended headers with
           information about detected contents movement (renames and copying
           detection) are designed to work with diff of two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are
           not used by combined diff format.

        3. It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header

               --- a/file
               +++ b/file

           Similar to two-line header for traditional unified diff format,
           /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted files.

        4. Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally
           feeding it to patch -p1. Combined diff format was created for review
           of merge commit changes, and was not meant for apply. The change is
           similar to the change in the extended index header:

               @@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@

           There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header
           for combined diff format.

       Unlike the traditional unified diff format, which shows two files A and B
       with a single column that has - (minus &#8212; appears in A but removed in B),
       + (plus &#8212; missing in A but added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space &#8212; unchanged)
       prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one
       file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN. One column for each
       of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X&#8217;s line is
       different from it.

       A - character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it
       does not appear in the result. A + character in the column N means that
       the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in
       other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent).

       In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both
       files (hence two - removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean
       one line that was added does not appear in either file1 nor file2). Also
       eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2
       (hence prefixed with +).

       When shown by git diff-tree -c, it compares the parents of a merge commit
       with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When shown by
       git diff-files -c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the
       working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our version&quot;, file2 is
       stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).

EXAMPLES
       git log --no-merges
           Show the whole commit history, but skip any merges

       git log v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
           Show all commits since version v2.6.12 that changed any file in the
           include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

       git log --since=&quot;2 weeks ago&quot; -- gitk
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk. The &quot;--&quot;
           is necessary to avoid confusion with the branch named gitk

       git log --name-status release..test
           Show the commits that are in the &quot;test&quot; branch but not yet in the
           &quot;release&quot; branch, along with the list of paths each commit modifies.

       git log --follow builtin-rev-list.c
           Shows the commits that changed builtin-rev-list.c, including those
           commits that occurred before the file was given its present name.

       git log --branches --not --remotes=origin
           Shows all commits that are in any of local branches but not in any of
           remote-tracking branches for origin (what you have that origin
           doesn&#8217;t).

       git log master --not --remotes=*/master
           Shows all commits that are in local master but not in any remote
           repository master branches.

       git log -p -m --first-parent
           Shows the history including change diffs, but only from the &quot;main
           branch&quot; perspective, skipping commits that come from merged branches,
           and showing full diffs of changes introduced by the merges. This
           makes sense only when following a strict policy of merging all topic
           branches when staying on a single integration branch.

DISCUSSION
       At the core level, git is character encoding agnostic.

       &#183;   The pathnames recorded in the index and in the tree objects are
           treated as uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL bytes. What readdir(2)
           returns are what are recorded and compared with the data git keeps
           track of, which in turn are expected to be what lstat(2) and creat(2)
           accepts. There is no such thing as pathname encoding translation.

       &#183;   The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of
           bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core level.

       &#183;   The commit log messages are uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL bytes.

       Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8,
       both the core and git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
       projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
       convenient to use legacy encodings, git does not forbid it. However,
       there are a few things to keep in mind.

        1.  git commit and git commit-tree issues a warning if the commit log
           message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless
           you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to
           say this is to have i18n.commitencoding in .git/config file, like
           this:

               [i18n]
                       commitencoding = ISO-8859-1

           Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
           i18n.commitencoding in its encoding header. This is to help other
           people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
           commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

        2.  git log, git show, git blame and friends look at the encoding header
           of a commit object, and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8
           unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired output
           encoding with i18n.logoutputencoding in .git/config file, like this:

               [i18n]
                       logoutputencoding = ISO-8859-1

           If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
           i18n.commitencoding is used instead.

       Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message
       when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because
       re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.

CONFIGURATION
       See git-config(1) for core variables and git-diff(1) for settings related
       to diff generation.

       format.pretty
           Default for the --format option. (See &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; above.)
           Defaults to &quot;medium&quot;.

       i18n.logOutputEncoding
           Encoding to use when displaying logs. (See &quot;Discussion&quot;, above.)
           Defaults to the value of i18n.commitEncoding if set, UTF-8 otherwise.

       log.date
           Default format for human-readable dates. (Compare the --date option.)
           Defaults to &quot;default&quot;, which means to write dates like Sat May 8
           19:35:34 2010 -0500.

       log.showroot
           If false, git log and related commands will not treat the initial
           commit as a big creation event. Any root commits in git log -p output
           would be shown without a diff attached. The default is true.

       mailmap.file
           See git-shortlog(1).

       notes.displayRef
           Which refs, in addition to the default set by core.notesRef or
           GIT_NOTES_REF, to read notes from when showing commit messages with
           the log family of commands. See git-notes(1).

           May be an unabbreviated ref name or a glob and may be specified
           multiple times. A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist,
           but a glob that does not match any refs is silently ignored.

           This setting can be disabled by the --no-notes option, overridden by
           the GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF environment variable, and overridden by the
           --notes=&lt;ref&gt; option.
