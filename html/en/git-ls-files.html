GIT-LS-FILES(1)                    Git Manual                    GIT-LS-FILES(1)



NAME
       git-ls-files - Show information about files in the index and the working
       tree

SYNOPSIS
       git ls-files [-z] [-t] [-v]
                       (--[cached|deleted|others|ignored|stage|unmerged|killed|modified])*
                       (-[c|d|o|i|s|u|k|m])*
                       [-x &lt;pattern&gt;|--exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;]
                       [-X &lt;file&gt;|--exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;]
                       [--exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;]
                       [--exclude-standard]
                       [--error-unmatch] [--with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
                       [--full-name] [--abbrev] [--] [&lt;file&gt;...]


DESCRIPTION
       This merges the file listing in the directory cache index with the actual
       working directory list, and shows different combinations of the two.

       One or more of the options below may be used to determine the files
       shown:

OPTIONS
       -c, --cached
           Show cached files in the output (default)

       -d, --deleted
           Show deleted files in the output

       -m, --modified
           Show modified files in the output

       -o, --others
           Show other (i.e. untracked) files in the output

       -i, --ignored
           Show only ignored files in the output. When showing files in the
           index, print only those matched by an exclude pattern. When showing
           &quot;other&quot; files, show only those matched by an exclude pattern.

       -s, --stage
           Show staged contents&apos; object name, mode bits and stage number in the
           output.

       --directory
           If a whole directory is classified as &quot;other&quot;, show just its name
           (with a trailing slash) and not its whole contents.

       --no-empty-directory
           Do not list empty directories. Has no effect without --directory.

       -u, --unmerged
           Show unmerged files in the output (forces --stage)

       -k, --killed
           Show files on the filesystem that need to be removed due to
           file/directory conflicts for checkout-index to succeed.

       -z
           \0 line termination on output.
&#12;       -x &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Skip untracked files matching pattern. Note that pattern is a shell
           wildcard pattern. See EXCLUDE PATTERNS below for more information.

       -X &lt;file&gt;, --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;
           Read exclude patterns from &lt;file&gt;; 1 per line.

       --exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;
           Read additional exclude patterns that apply only to the directory and
           its subdirectories in &lt;file&gt;.

       --exclude-standard
           Add the standard git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in
           each directory, and the user&#8217;s global exclusion file.

       --error-unmatch
           If any &lt;file&gt; does not appear in the index, treat this as an error
           (return 1).

       --with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;
           When using --error-unmatch to expand the user supplied &lt;file&gt; (i.e.
           path pattern) arguments to paths, pretend that paths which were
           removed in the index since the named &lt;tree-ish&gt; are still present.
           Using this option with -s or -u options does not make any sense.

       -t
           This feature is semi-deprecated. For scripting purpose, git-status(1)
           --porcelain and git-diff-files(1) --name-status are almost always
           superior alternatives, and users should look at git-status(1) --short
           or git-diff(1) --name-status for more user-friendly alternatives.

           This option identifies the file status with the following tags
           (followed by a space) at the start of each line:

       H
           cached

       S
           skip-worktree

       M
           unmerged

       R
           removed/deleted

       C
           modified/changed

       K
           to be killed

       ?
           other

       -v
           Similar to -t, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as
           assume unchanged (see git-update-index(1)).

       --full-name
           When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths
           relative to the current directory. This option forces paths to be
           output relative to the project top directory.

       --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object lines, show
           only a partial prefix. Non default number of digits can be specified
           with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.

       --debug
           After each line that describes a file, add more data about its cache
           entry. This is intended to show as much information as possible for
           manual inspection; the exact format may change at any time.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       &lt;file&gt;
           Files to show. If no files are given all files which match the other
           specified criteria are shown.

OUTPUT
       git ls-files just outputs the filenames unless --stage is specified in
       which case it outputs:

           [&lt;tag&gt; ]&lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;stage&gt; &lt;file&gt;

       git ls-files --unmerged and git ls-files --stage can be used to examine
       detailed information on unmerged paths.

       For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single mode/SHA1 pair, the
       index records up to three such pairs; one from tree O in stage 1, A in
       stage 2, and B in stage 3. This information can be used by the user (or
       the porcelain) to see what should eventually be recorded at the path.
       (see git-read-tree(1) for more information on state)

       When -z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in
       pathnames are represented as \t, \n, and \\, respectively.

EXCLUDE PATTERNS
       git ls-files can use a list of &quot;exclude patterns&quot; when traversing the
       directory tree and finding files to show when the flags --others or
       --ignored are specified. gitignore(5) specifies the format of exclude
       patterns.

       These exclude patterns come from these places, in order:

        1. The command line flag --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt; specifies a single pattern.
           Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear in the command
           line.

        2. The command line flag --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt; specifies a file
           containing a list of patterns. Patterns are ordered in the same order
           they appear in the file.

        3. The command line flag --exclude-per-directory=&lt;name&gt; specifies a name
           of the file in each directory git ls-files examines, normally
           .gitignore. Files in deeper directories take precedence. Patterns are
           ordered in the same order they appear in the files.

       A pattern specified on the command line with --exclude or read from the
       file specified with --exclude-from is relative to the top of the
       directory tree. A pattern read from a file specified by
       --exclude-per-directory is relative to the directory that the pattern
       file appears in.
