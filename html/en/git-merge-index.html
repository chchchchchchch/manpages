GIT-MERGE-INDEX(1)                 Git Manual                 GIT-MERGE-INDEX(1)



NAME
       git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging

SYNOPSIS
       git merge-index [-o] [-q] &lt;merge-program&gt; (-a | [--] &lt;file&gt;*)


DESCRIPTION
       This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any merge
       entries, passes the SHA1 hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty
       argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4. File modes for the three
       files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.

OPTIONS
       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       -a
           Run merge against all files in the index that need merging.

       -o
           Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them in one
           shot - continue with merging even when previous merges returned
           errors, and only return the error code after all the merges.

       -q
           Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program failure
           usually indicates conflicts during the merge). This is for porcelains
           which might want to emit custom messages.

       If git merge-index is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s (or -a) then it
       processes them in turn only stopping if merge returns a non-zero exit
       code.

       Typically this is run with a script calling git&#8217;s imitation of the merge
       command from the RCS package.

       A sample script called git merge-one-file is included in the
       distribution.

       ALERT ALERT ALERT! The git &quot;merge object order&quot; is different from the RCS
       merge program merge object order. In the above ordering, the original is
       first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge program merge is to have
       the original in the middle. Don&#8217;t ask me why.

       Examples:

           torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat MM
           This is MM from the original tree.                    # original
           This is modified MM in the branch A.                  # merge1
           This is modified MM in the branch B.                  # merge2
           This is modified MM in the branch B.                  # current contents

       or

           torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat AA MM
           cat: : No such file or directory
           This is added AA in the branch A.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           fatal: merge program failed
&#12;       where the latter example shows how git merge-index will stop trying to
       merge once anything has returned an error (i.e., cat returned an error
       for the AA file, because it didn&#8217;t exist in the original, and thus git
       merge-index didn&#8217;t even try to merge the MM thing).
