NAME
       git-mergetool--lib - Common git merge tool shell scriptlets

SYNOPSIS
       TOOL_MODE=(diff|merge) . &quot;$(git --exec-path)/git-mergetool--lib&quot;


DESCRIPTION
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The git-mergetool--lib scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by
       other shell scripts to set up functions for working with git merge tools.

       Before sourcing git-mergetool--lib, your script must set TOOL_MODE to
       define the operation mode for the functions listed below. diff and merge
       are valid values.

FUNCTIONS
       get_merge_tool
           returns a merge tool.

       get_merge_tool_cmd
           returns the custom command for a merge tool.

       get_merge_tool_path
           returns the custom path for a merge tool.

       run_merge_tool
           launches a merge tool given the tool name and a true/false flag to
           indicate whether a merge base is present.  $MERGED, $LOCAL, $REMOTE,
           and $BASE must be defined for use by the merge tool.
