GIT-MV(1)                          Git Manual                          GIT-MV(1)



NAME
       git-mv - Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink

SYNOPSIS
       git mv &lt;options&gt;... &lt;args&gt;...


DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink.

           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;
           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; ... &lt;destination directory&gt;

       In the first form, it renames &lt;source&gt;, which must exist and be either a
       file, symlink or directory, to &lt;destination&gt;. In the second form, the
       last argument has to be an existing directory; the given sources will be
       moved into this directory.

       The index is updated after successful completion, but the change must
       still be committed.

OPTIONS
       -f, --force
           Force renaming or moving of a file even if the target exists

       -k
           Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error condition.
           An error happens when a source is neither existing nor controlled by
           GIT, or when it would overwrite an existing file unless -f is given.

       -n, --dry-run
           Do nothing; only show what would happen

       -v, --verbose
           Report the names of files as they are moved.
