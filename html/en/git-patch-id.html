GIT-PATCH-ID(1)                    Git Manual                    GIT-PATCH-ID(1)



NAME
       git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch

SYNOPSIS
       git patch-id &lt; &lt;patch&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       A &quot;patch ID&quot; is nothing but a SHA1 of the diff associated with a patch,
       with whitespace and line numbers ignored. As such, it&#8217;s &quot;reasonably
       stable&quot;, but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches
       that have the same &quot;patch ID&quot; are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.

       IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits.

       When dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes advantage of the fact
       that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and
       outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch
       ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a
       mapping from patch ID to commit ID.

OPTIONS
       &lt;patch&gt;
           The diff to create the ID of.
