GIT-REBASE(1)                      Git Manual                      GIT-REBASE(1)



NAME
       git-rebase - Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head

SYNOPSIS
       git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] [--onto &lt;newbase&gt;]
               [&lt;upstream&gt;] [&lt;branch&gt;]
       git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] --onto &lt;newbase&gt;
               --root [&lt;branch&gt;]
       git rebase --continue | --skip | --abort


DESCRIPTION
       If &lt;branch&gt; is specified, git rebase will perform an automatic git
       checkout &lt;branch&gt; before doing anything else. Otherwise it remains on the
       current branch.

       If &lt;upstream&gt; is not specified, the upstream configured in
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options will be used; see
       git-config(1) for details. If you are currently not on any branch or if
       the current branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will
       abort.

       All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in
       &lt;upstream&gt; are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of commits
       that would be shown by git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD (or git log HEAD, if
       --root is specified).

       The current branch is reset to &lt;upstream&gt;, or &lt;newbase&gt; if the --onto
       option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as git reset --hard
       &lt;upstream&gt; (or &lt;newbase&gt;). ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the
       branch before the reset.

       The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then
       reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any
       commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in
       HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt; are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream
       with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).

       It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being
       completely automatic. You will have to resolve any such merge failure and
       run git rebase --continue. Another option is to bypass the commit that
       caused the merge failure with git rebase --skip. To check out the
       original &lt;branch&gt; and remove the .git/rebase-apply working files, use the
       command git rebase --abort instead.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is &quot;topic&quot;:

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G master


       From this point, the result of either of the following commands:

           git rebase master
           git rebase master topic

       would be:

                             A&apos;--B&apos;--C&apos; topic
                            /
               D---E---F---G master


       NOTE: The latter form is just a short-hand of git checkout topic followed
       by git rebase master. When rebase exits topic will remain the checked-out
       branch.

       If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g.,
       because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit
       will be skipped. For example, running &#8216;git rebase master` on the
       following history (in which A&#8217; and A introduce the same set of changes,
       but have different committer information):

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---A&apos;---F master


       will result in:

                              B&apos;---C&apos; topic
                             /
               D---E---A&apos;---F master


       Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one branch to
       another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the latter
       branch, using rebase --onto.

       First let&#8217;s assume your topic is based on branch next. For example, a
       feature developed in topic depends on some functionality which is found
       in next.

               o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next
                                      \
                                       o---o---o  topic


       We want to make topic forked from branch master; for example, because the
       functionality on which topic depends was merged into the more stable
       master branch. We want our tree to look like this:

               o---o---o---o---o  master
                   |            \
                   |             o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;  topic
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next


       We can get this using the following command:

           git rebase --onto master next topic

       Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a branch. If we
       have the following situation:

                                       H---I---J topicB
                                      /
                             E---F---G  topicA
                            /
               A---B---C---D  master


       then the command
&#12;           git rebase --onto master topicA topicB

       would result in:

                            H&apos;--I&apos;--J&apos;  topicB
                           /
                           | E---F---G  topicA
                           |/
               A---B---C---D  master


       This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.

       A range of commits could also be removed with rebase. If we have the
       following situation:

               E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA


       then the command

           git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA

       would result in the removal of commits F and G:

               E---H&apos;---I&apos;---J&apos;  topicA


       This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be part
       of topicA. Note that the argument to --onto and the &lt;upstream&gt; parameter
       can be any valid commit-ish.

       In case of conflict, git rebase will stop at the first problematic commit
       and leave conflict markers in the tree. You can use git diff to locate
       the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make edits to resolve the conflict. For each
       file you edit, you need to tell git that the conflict has been resolved,
       typically this would be done with

           git add &lt;filename&gt;

       After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the
       desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with

           git rebase --continue

       Alternatively, you can undo the git rebase with

           git rebase --abort

CONFIGURATION
       rebase.stat
           Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last
           rebase. False by default.

       rebase.autosquash
           If set to true enable --autosquash option by default.

OPTIONS
       &lt;newbase&gt;
           Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the --onto
           option is not specified, the starting point is &lt;upstream&gt;. May be any
           valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.

           As a special case, you may use &quot;A...B&quot; as a shortcut for the merge
           base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out
           at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;upstream&gt;
           Upstream branch to compare against. May be any valid commit, not just
           an existing branch name. Defaults to the configured upstream for the
           current branch.

       &lt;branch&gt;
           Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

       --continue
           Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a merge conflict.

       --abort
           Abort the rebase operation and reset HEAD to the original branch. If
           &lt;branch&gt; was provided when the rebase operation was started, then
           HEAD will be reset to &lt;branch&gt;. Otherwise HEAD will be reset to where
           it was when the rebase operation was started.

       --skip
           Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch.

       -m, --merge
           Use merging strategies to rebase. When the recursive (default) merge
           strategy is used, this allows rebase to be aware of renames on the
           upstream side.

           Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the
           working branch on top of the &lt;upstream&gt; branch. Because of this, when
           a merge conflict happens, the side reported as ours is the so-far
           rebased series, starting with &lt;upstream&gt;, and theirs is the working
           branch. In other words, the sides are swapped.

       -s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy. If there is no -s option git
           merge-recursive is used instead. This implies --merge.

           Because git rebase replays each commit from the working branch on top
           of the &lt;upstream&gt; branch using the given strategy, using the ours
           strategy simply discards all patches from the &lt;branch&gt;, which makes
           little sense.

       -X &lt;strategy-option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;strategy-option&gt;
           Pass the &lt;strategy-option&gt; through to the merge strategy. This
           implies --merge and, if no strategy has been specified, -s recursive.
           Note the reversal of ours and theirs as noted in above for the -m
           option.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet. Implies --no-stat.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose. Implies --stat.

       --stat
           Show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last rebase. The
           diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option rebase.stat.

       -n, --no-stat
           Do not show a diffstat as part of the rebase process.

       --no-verify
           This option bypasses the pre-rebase hook. See also githooks(5).

       --verify
           Allows the pre-rebase hook to run, which is the default. This option
           can be used to override --no-verify. See also githooks(5).

       -C&lt;n&gt;
           Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines of surrounding context match before and
           after each change. When fewer lines of surrounding context exist they
           all must match. By default no context is ever ignored.

       -f, --force-rebase
           Force the rebase even if the current branch is a descendant of the
           commit you are rebasing onto. Normally non-interactive rebase will
           exit with the message &quot;Current branch is up to date&quot; in such a
           situation. Incompatible with the --interactive option.

           You may find this (or --no-ff with an interactive rebase) helpful
           after reverting a topic branch merge, as this option recreates the
           topic branch with fresh commits so it can be remerged successfully
           without needing to &quot;revert the reversion&quot; (see the
           revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for details).

       --ignore-whitespace, --whitespace=&lt;option&gt;
           These flag are passed to the git apply program (see git-apply(1))
           that applies the patch. Incompatible with the --interactive option.

       --committer-date-is-author-date, --ignore-date
           These flags are passed to git am to easily change the dates of the
           rebased commits (see git-am(1)). Incompatible with the --interactive
           option.

       -i, --interactive
           Make a list of the commits which are about to be rebased. Let the
           user edit that list before rebasing. This mode can also be used to
           split commits (see SPLITTING COMMITS below).

       -p, --preserve-merges
           Instead of ignoring merges, try to recreate them.

           This uses the --interactive machinery internally, but combining it
           with the --interactive option explicitly is generally not a good idea
           unless you know what you are doing (see BUGS below).

       --root
           Rebase all commits reachable from &lt;branch&gt;, instead of limiting them
           with an &lt;upstream&gt;. This allows you to rebase the root commit(s) on a
           branch. Must be used with --onto, and will skip changes already
           contained in &lt;newbase&gt; (instead of &lt;upstream&gt;). When used together
           with --preserve-merges, all root commits will be rewritten to have
           &lt;newbase&gt; as parent instead.

       --autosquash, --no-autosquash
           When the commit log message begins with &quot;squash! ...&quot; (or &quot;fixup!
           ...&quot;), and there is a commit whose title begins with the same ...,
           automatically modify the todo list of rebase -i so that the commit
           marked for squashing comes right after the commit to be modified, and
           change the action of the moved commit from pick to squash (or fixup).

           This option is only valid when the --interactive option is used.

           If the --autosquash option is enabled by default using the
           configuration variable rebase.autosquash, this option can be used to
           override and disable this setting.

       --no-ff
           With --interactive, cherry-pick all rebased commits instead of
           fast-forwarding over the unchanged ones. This ensures that the entire
           history of the rebased branch is composed of new commits.

           Without --interactive, this is a synonym for --force-rebase.

           You may find this helpful after reverting a topic branch merge, as
           this option recreates the topic branch with fresh commits so it can
           be remerged successfully without needing to &quot;revert the reversion&quot;
           (see the revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for details).

MERGE STRATEGIES
       The merge mechanism (git-merge and git-pull commands) allows the backend
       merge strategies to be chosen with -s option. Some strategies can also
       take their own options, which can be passed by giving -X&lt;option&gt;
       arguments to git-merge and/or git-pull.

       resolve
           This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another
           branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
           carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered
           generally safe and fast.

       recursive
           This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When
           there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way
           merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that
           as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to
           result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests
           done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development
           history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
           renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging
           one branch.

           The recursive strategy can take the following options:

           ours
               This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly
               by favoring our version. Changes from the other tree that do not
               conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result.

               This should not be confused with the ours merge strategy, which
               does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It
               discards everything the other tree did, declaring our history
               contains all that happened in it.

           theirs
               This is opposite of ours.

           patience
               With this option, merge-recursive spends a little extra time to
               avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant matching
               lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use this when the
               branches to be merged have diverged wildly. See also git-diff(1)
               --patience.

           ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol
               Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
               unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes
               mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored. See also git-
               diff(1) -b, -w, and --ignore-space-at-eol.

               &#183;   If their version only introduces whitespace changes to a
                   line, our version is used;

               &#183;   If our version introduces whitespace changes but their
                   version includes a substantial change, their version is used;

               &#183;   Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

           renormalize
               This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of
               a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to
               be used when merging branches with different clean filters or
               end-of-line normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with
               differing checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in gitattributes(5) for
               details.

           no-renormalize
               Disables the renormalize option. This overrides the
               merge.renormalize configuration variable.

           rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;
               Controls the similarity threshold used for rename detection. See
               also git-diff(1) -M.

           subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]
               This option is a more advanced form of subtree strategy, where
               the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
               match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path
               is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of
               two trees to match.

       octopus
           This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a
           complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to
           be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default
           merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.

       ours
           This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
           merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring
           all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to
           supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is
           different from the -Xours option to the recursive merge strategy.

       subtree
           This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if
           B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the
           tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level.
           This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.

NOTES
       You should understand the implications of using git rebase on a
       repository that you share. See also RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE
       below.

       When the git-rebase command is run, it will first execute a &quot;pre-rebase&quot;
       hook if one exists. You can use this hook to do sanity checks and reject
       the rebase if it isn&#8217;t appropriate. Please see the template pre-rebase
       hook script for an example.

       Upon completion, &lt;branch&gt; will be the current branch.

INTERACTIVE MODE
       Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit the commits
       which are rebased. You can reorder the commits, and you can remove them
       (weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches).

       The interactive mode is meant for this type of workflow:

        1. have a wonderful idea

        2. hack on the code

        3. prepare a series for submission
&#12;        4. submit

       where point 2. consists of several instances of

       a) regular use

        1. finish something worthy of a commit

        2. commit

       b) independent fixup

        1. realize that something does not work

        2. fix that

        3. commit it

       Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite
       perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch
       series. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after
       plenty of &quot;a&quot;s and &quot;b&quot;s, by rearranging and editing commits, and
       squashing multiple commits into one.

       Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:

           git rebase -i &lt;after-this-commit&gt;

       An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch
       (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit. You can
       reorder the commits in this list to your heart&#8217;s content, and you can
       remove them. The list looks more or less like this:

           pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
           pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
           ...


       The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; git rebase will
       not look at them but at the commit names (&quot;deadbee&quot; and &quot;fa1afe1&quot; in this
       example), so do not delete or edit the names.

       By replacing the command &quot;pick&quot; with the command &quot;edit&quot;, you can tell git
       rebase to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files
       and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing.

       If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the
       command &quot;pick&quot; with the command &quot;reword&quot;.

       If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command
       &quot;pick&quot; for the second and subsequent commits with &quot;squash&quot; or &quot;fixup&quot;. If
       the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be attributed
       to the author of the first commit. The suggested commit message for the
       folded commit is the concatenation of the commit messages of the first
       commit and of those with the &quot;squash&quot; command, but omits the commit
       messages of commits with the &quot;fixup&quot; command.

       git rebase will stop when &quot;pick&quot; has been replaced with &quot;edit&quot; or when a
       command fails due to merge errors. When you are done editing and/or
       resolving conflicts you can continue with git rebase --continue.

       For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what
       was HEAD~4 becomes the new HEAD. To achieve that, you would call git
       rebase like this:

           $ git rebase -i HEAD~5


       And move the first patch to the end of the list.

       You might want to preserve merges, if you have a history like this:

                      X
                       \
                    A---M---B
                   /
           ---o---O---P---Q


       Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;. Make
       sure that the current HEAD is &quot;B&quot;, and call

           $ git rebase -i -p --onto Q O


       Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested intermediate
       steps. You may want to check that your history editing did not break
       anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate
       points in history by using the &quot;exec&quot; command (shortcut &quot;x&quot;). You may do
       so by creating a todo list like this one:

           pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
           fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
           exec make
           pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
           edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
           exec cd subdir; make test
           ...


       The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i.e. exits with
       non-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can
       continue with git rebase --continue.

       The &quot;exec&quot; command launches the command in a shell (the one specified in
       $SHELL, or the default shell if $SHELL is not set), so you can use shell
       features (like &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;;&quot; ...). The command is run from the root of
       the working tree.

SPLITTING COMMITS
       In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action &quot;edit&quot;.
       However, this does not necessarily mean that git rebase expects the
       result of this edit to be exactly one commit. Indeed, you can undo the
       commit, or you can add other commits. This can be used to split a commit
       into two:

       &#183;   Start an interactive rebase with git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;^, where
           &lt;commit&gt; is the commit you want to split. In fact, any commit range
           will do, as long as it contains that commit.

       &#183;   Mark the commit you want to split with the action &quot;edit&quot;.

       &#183;   When it comes to editing that commit, execute git reset HEAD^. The
           effect is that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the index follows
           suit. However, the working tree stays the same.

       &#183;   Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first
           commit. You can use git add (possibly interactively) or git gui (or
           both) to do that.

       &#183;   Commit the now-current index with whatever commit message is
           appropriate now.

       &#183;   Repeat the last two steps until your working tree is clean.

       &#183;   Continue the rebase with git rebase --continue.

       If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are
       consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use git
       stash to stash away the not-yet-committed changes after each commit,
       test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary.

RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE
       Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based
       work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix
       their history. This section explains how to do the fix from the
       downstream&#8217;s point of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid
       rebasing the upstream in the first place.

       To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a
       subsystem branch, and you are working on a topic that is dependent on
       this subsystem. You might end up with a history like the following:

               o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  subsystem
                                      \
                                       *---*---*  topic


       If subsystem is rebased against master, the following happens:

               o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \                       \
                     o---o---o---o---o       o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;  subsystem
                                      \
                                       *---*---*  topic


       If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge topic to
       subsystem, the commits from subsystem will remain duplicated forever:

               o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \                       \
                     o---o---o---o---o       o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--M  subsystem
                                      \                         /
                                       *---*---*-..........-*--*  topic


       Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up
       history, making it harder to follow. To clean things up, you need to
       transplant the commits on topic to the new subsystem tip, i.e., rebase
       topic. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from topic is
       forced to rebase too, and so on!

       There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following subsections:

       Easy case: The changes are literally the same.
           This happens if the subsystem rebase was a simple rebase and had no
           conflicts.

       Hard case: The changes are not the same.
           This happens if the subsystem rebase had conflicts, or used
           --interactive to omit, edit, squash, or fixup commits; or if the
           upstream used one of commit --amend, reset, or filter-branch.

   The easy case
       Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on
       subsystem are literally the same before and after the rebase subsystem
       did.

       In that case, the fix is easy because git rebase knows to skip changes
       that are already present in the new upstream. So if you say (assuming
       you&#8217;re on topic)

               $ git rebase subsystem


       you will end up with the fixed history

               o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
                                            \
                                             o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;--o&apos;  subsystem
                                                              \
                                                               *---*---*  topic


   The hard case
       Things get more complicated if the subsystem changes do not exactly
       correspond to the ones before the rebase.

           Note
           While an &quot;easy case recovery&quot; sometimes appears to be successful even
           in the hard case, it may have unintended consequences. For example, a
           commit that was removed via git rebase --interactive will be
           resurrected!

       The idea is to manually tell git rebase &quot;where the old subsystem ended
       and your topic began&quot;, that is, what the old merge-base between them was.
       You will have to find a way to name the last commit of the old subsystem,
       for example:

       &#183;   With the subsystem reflog: after git fetch, the old tip of subsystem
           is at subsystem@{1}. Subsequent fetches will increase the number.
           (See git-reflog(1).)

       &#183;   Relative to the tip of topic: knowing that your topic has three
           commits, the old tip of subsystem must be topic~3.

       You can then transplant the old subsystem..topic to the new tip by saying
       (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on topic already):

               $ git rebase --onto subsystem subsystem@{1}


       The ripple effect of a &quot;hard case&quot; recovery is especially bad: everyone
       downstream from topic will now have to perform a &quot;hard case&quot; recovery
       too!

BUGS
       The todo list presented by --preserve-merges --interactive does not
       represent the topology of the revision graph. Editing commits and
       rewording their commit messages should work fine, but attempts to reorder
       commits tend to produce counterintuitive results.

       For example, an attempt to rearrange

           1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4 --- 5


       to

           1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 3 --- 5


       by moving the &quot;pick 4&quot; line will result in the following history:

                   3
                  /
           1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 5
