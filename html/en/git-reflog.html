GIT-REFLOG(1)                      Git Manual                      GIT-REFLOG(1)



NAME
       git-reflog - Manage reflog information

SYNOPSIS
       git reflog &lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;options&gt;


DESCRIPTION
       The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on
       the subcommand:

           git reflog expire [--dry-run] [--stale-fix] [--verbose]
                   [--expire=&lt;time&gt;] [--expire-unreachable=&lt;time&gt;] [--all] &lt;refs&gt;...
           git reflog delete ref@{specifier}...
           git reflog [show] [log-options] [&lt;ref&gt;]


       Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are updated.
       This command is to manage the information recorded in it.

       The subcommand &quot;expire&quot; is used to prune older reflog entries. Entries
       older than expire time, or entries older than expire-unreachable time and
       not reachable from the current tip, are removed from the reflog. This is
       typically not used directly by the end users &#8212; instead, see git-gc(1).

       The subcommand &quot;show&quot; (which is also the default, in the absence of any
       subcommands) will take all the normal log options, and show the log of
       the reference provided in the command-line (or HEAD, by default). The
       reflog will cover all recent actions (HEAD reflog records branch
       switching as well). It is an alias for git log -g --abbrev-commit
       --pretty=oneline; see git-log(1).

       The reflog is useful in various git commands, to specify the old value of
       a reference. For example, HEAD@{2} means &quot;where HEAD used to be two moves
       ago&quot;, master@{one.week.ago} means &quot;where master used to point to one week
       ago&quot;, and so on. See gitrevisions(7) for more details.

       To delete single entries from the reflog, use the subcommand &quot;delete&quot; and
       specify the exact entry (e.g. &quot;git reflog delete master@{2}&quot;).

OPTIONS
       --stale-fix
           This revamps the logic &#8212; the definition of &quot;broken commit&quot; becomes: a
           commit that is not reachable from any of the refs and there is a
           missing object among the commit, tree, or blob objects reachable from
           it that is not reachable from any of the refs.

           This computation involves traversing all the reachable objects, i.e.
           it has the same cost as git prune. Fortunately, once this is run, we
           should not have to ever worry about missing objects, because the
           current prune and pack-objects know about reflogs and protect objects
           referred by them.

       --expire=&lt;time&gt;
           Entries older than this time are pruned. Without the option it is
           taken from configuration gc.reflogExpire, which in turn defaults to
           90 days.

       --expire-unreachable=&lt;time&gt;
           Entries older than this time and not reachable from the current tip
           of the branch are pruned. Without the option it is taken from
           configuration gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, which in turn defaults to
           30 days.

       --all
           Instead of listing &lt;refs&gt; explicitly, prune all refs.

       --updateref
           Update the ref with the sha1 of the top reflog entry (i.e. &lt;ref&gt;@{0})
           after expiring or deleting.

       --rewrite
           While expiring or deleting, adjust each reflog entry to ensure that
           the old sha1 field points to the new sha1 field of the previous
           entry.

       --verbose
           Print extra information on screen.
