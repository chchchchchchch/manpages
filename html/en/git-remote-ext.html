GIT-REMOTE-EXT(1)                  Git Manual                  GIT-REMOTE-EXT(1)



NAME
       git-remote-ext - Bridge smart transport to external command.

SYNOPSIS
       git remote add &lt;nick&gt; &quot;ext::&lt;command&gt;[ &lt;arguments&gt;...]&quot;


DESCRIPTION
       This remote helper uses the specified &lt;command&gt; to connect to a remote
       git server.

       Data written to stdin of the specified &lt;command&gt; is assumed to be sent to
       a git:// server, git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or git-upload-archive
       (depending on situation), and data read from stdout of &lt;command&gt; is
       assumed to be received from the same service.

       Command and arguments are separated by an unescaped space.

       The following sequences have a special meaning:

       &apos;% &apos;
           Literal space in command or argument.

       %%
           Literal percent sign.

       %s
           Replaced with name (receive-pack, upload-pack, or upload-archive) of
           the service git wants to invoke.

       %S
           Replaced with long name (git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, or
           git-upload-archive) of the service git wants to invoke.

       %G (must be the first characters in an argument)
           This argument will not be passed to &lt;command&gt;. Instead, it will cause
           the helper to start by sending git:// service requests to the remote
           side with the service field set to an appropriate value and the
           repository field set to rest of the argument. Default is not to send
           such a request.

           This is useful if remote side is git:// server accessed over some
           tunnel.

       %V (must be first characters in argument)
           This argument will not be passed to &lt;command&gt;. Instead it sets the
           vhost field in the git:// service request (to rest of the argument).
           Default is not to send vhost in such request (if sent).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
       GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG
           If set, prints debugging information about various reads/writes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PASSED TO COMMAND:
       GIT_EXT_SERVICE
           Set to long name (git-upload-pack, etc...) of service helper needs to
           invoke.

       GIT_EXT_SERVICE_NOPREFIX
           Set to long name (upload-pack, etc...) of service helper needs to
           invoke.
&#12;EXAMPLES:
       This remote helper is transparently used by git when you use commands
       such as &quot;git fetch &lt;URL&gt;&quot;, &quot;git clone &lt;URL&gt;&quot;, , &quot;git push &lt;URL&gt;&quot; or &quot;git
       remote add &lt;nick&gt; &lt;URL&gt;&quot;, where &lt;URL&gt; begins with ext::. Examples:

       &quot;ext::ssh -i /home/foo/.ssh/somekey user@host.example %S foo/repo&quot;
           Like host.example:foo/repo, but use /home/foo/.ssh/somekey as keypair
           and user as user on remote side. This avoids needing to edit
           .ssh/config.

       &quot;ext::socat -t3600 - ABSTRACT-CONNECT:/git-server %G/somerepo&quot;
           Represents repository with path /somerepo accessable over git
           protocol at abstract namespace address /git-server.

       &quot;ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo&quot;
           Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the helper
           program &quot;git-server-alias foo&quot;. The path to the repository and type
           of request are not passed on the command line but as part of the
           protocol stream, as usual with git:// protocol.

       &quot;ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo %Vfoo&quot;
           Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the helper
           program &quot;git-server-alias foo&quot;. The hostname for the remote server
           passed in the protocol stream will be &quot;foo&quot; (this allows multiple
           virtual git servers to share a link-level address).

       &quot;ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo% with% spaces %Vfoo&quot;
           Represents a repository with path /repo with spaces accessed using
           the helper program &quot;git-server-alias foo&quot;. The hostname for the
           remote server passed in the protocol stream will be &quot;foo&quot; (this
           allows multiple virtual git servers to share a link-level address).

       &quot;ext::git-ssl foo.example /bar&quot;
           Represents a repository accessed using the helper program &quot;git-ssl
           foo.example /bar&quot;. The type of request can be determined by the
           helper using environment variables (see above).
