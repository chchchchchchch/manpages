DESCRIPTION
       Manage the set of repositories (&quot;remotes&quot;) whose branches you track.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name. NOTE: This
           must be placed between remote and subcommand.

COMMANDS
       With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes. Several subcommands
       are available to perform operations on the remotes.

       add
           Adds a remote named &lt;name&gt; for the repository at &lt;url&gt;. The command
           git fetch &lt;name&gt; can then be used to create and update
           remote-tracking branches &lt;name&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;.

           With -f option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; is run immediately after the remote
           information is set up.

           With --tags option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; imports every tag from the
           remote repository.

           With --no-tags option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; does not import tags from the
           remote repository.

           With -t &lt;branch&gt; option, instead of the default glob refspec for the
           remote to track all branches under the refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/
           namespace, a refspec to track only &lt;branch&gt; is created. You can give
           more than one -t &lt;branch&gt; to track multiple branches without grabbing
           all branches.

           With -m &lt;master&gt; option, a symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is
           set up to point at remote&#8217;s &lt;master&gt; branch. See also the set-head
           command.

           When a fetch mirror is created with --mirror=fetch, the refs will not
           be stored in the refs/remotes/ namespace, but rather everything in
           refs/ on the remote will be directly mirrored into refs/ in the local
           repository. This option only makes sense in bare repositories,
           because a fetch would overwrite any local commits.

           When a push mirror is created with --mirror=push, then git push will
           always behave as if --mirror was passed.

       rename
           Rename the remote named &lt;old&gt; to &lt;new&gt;. All remote-tracking branches
           and configuration settings for the remote are updated.

           In case &lt;old&gt; and &lt;new&gt; are the same, and &lt;old&gt; is a file under
           $GIT_DIR/remotes or $GIT_DIR/branches, the remote is converted to the
           configuration file format.

       rm
           Remove the remote named &lt;name&gt;. All remote-tracking branches and
           configuration settings for the remote are removed.

       set-head
           Sets or deletes the default branch (i.e. the target of the
           symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD) for the named remote. Having a
           default branch for a remote is not required, but allows the name of
           the remote to be specified in lieu of a specific branch. For example,
           if the default branch for origin is set to master, then origin may be
           specified wherever you would normally specify origin/master.

           With -d, the symbolic ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is deleted.

           With -a, the remote is queried to determine its HEAD, then the
           symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is set to the same branch.
           e.g., if the remote HEAD is pointed at next, &quot;git remote set-head
           origin -a&quot; will set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to
           refs/remotes/origin/next. This will only work if
           refs/remotes/origin/next already exists; if not it must be fetched
           first.

           Use &lt;branch&gt; to set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD
           explicitly. e.g., &quot;git remote set-head origin master&quot; will set the
           symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to refs/remotes/origin/master.
           This will only work if refs/remotes/origin/master already exists; if
           not it must be fetched first.

       set-branches
           Changes the list of branches tracked by the named remote. This can be
           used to track a subset of the available remote branches after the
           initial setup for a remote.

           The named branches will be interpreted as if specified with the -t
           option on the git remote add command line.

           With --add, instead of replacing the list of currently tracked
           branches, adds to that list.

       set-url
           Changes URL remote points to. Sets first URL remote points to
           matching regex &lt;oldurl&gt; (first URL if no &lt;oldurl&gt; is given) to
           &lt;newurl&gt;. If &lt;oldurl&gt; doesn&#8217;t match any URL, error occurs and nothing
           is changed.

           With --push, push URLs are manipulated instead of fetch URLs.

           With --add, instead of changing some URL, new URL is added.

           With --delete, instead of changing some URL, all URLs matching regex
           &lt;url&gt; are deleted. Trying to delete all non-push URLs is an error.

       show
           Gives some information about the remote &lt;name&gt;.

           With -n option, the remote heads are not queried first with git
           ls-remote &lt;name&gt;; cached information is used instead.

       prune
           Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under &lt;name&gt;. These stale
           branches have already been removed from the remote repository
           referenced by &lt;name&gt;, but are still locally available in
           &quot;remotes/&lt;name&gt;&quot;.

           With --dry-run option, report what branches will be pruned, but do
           not actually prune them.

       update
           Fetch updates for a named set of remotes in the repository as defined
           by remotes.&lt;group&gt;. If a named group is not specified on the command
           line, the configuration parameter remotes.default will be used; if
           remotes.default is not defined, all remotes which do not have the
           configuration parameter remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate set to true
           will be updated. (See git-config(1)).

           With --prune option, prune all the remotes that are updated.

DISCUSSION
       The remote configuration is achieved using the remote.origin.url and
       remote.origin.fetch configuration variables. (See git-config(1)).

EXAMPLES
       &#183;   Add a new remote, fetch, and check out a branch from it

               $ git remote
               origin
               $ git branch -r
               origin/master
               $ git remote add linux-nfs git://linux-nfs.org/pub/linux/nfs-2.6.git
               $ git remote
               linux-nfs
               origin
               $ git fetch
               * refs/remotes/linux-nfs/master: storing branch &apos;master&apos; ...
                 commit: bf81b46
               $ git branch -r
               origin/master
               linux-nfs/master
               $ git checkout -b nfs linux-nfs/master
               ...


       &#183;   Imitate git clone but track only selected branches

               $ mkdir project.git
               $ cd project.git
               $ git init
               $ git remote add -f -t master -m master origin git://example.com/git.git/
               $ git merge origin
