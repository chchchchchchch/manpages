GIT-SEND-PACK(1)                   Git Manual                   GIT-SEND-PACK(1)



NAME
       git-send-pack - Push objects over git protocol to another repository

SYNOPSIS
       git send-pack [--all] [--dry-run] [--force] [--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;] [--verbose] [--thin] [&lt;host&gt;:]&lt;directory&gt; [&lt;ref&gt;...]


DESCRIPTION
       Usually you would want to use git push, which is a higher-level wrapper
       of this command, instead. See git-push(1).

       Invokes git-receive-pack on a possibly remote repository, and updates it
       from the current repository, sending named refs.

OPTIONS
       --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;
           Path to the git-receive-pack program on the remote end. Sometimes
           useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do not
           have the program in a directory on the default $PATH.

       --exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;
           Same as --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;.

       --all
           Instead of explicitly specifying which refs to update, update all
           heads that locally exist.

       --dry-run
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --force
           Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
           ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables
           the check. What this means is that the remote repository can lose
           commits; use it with care.

       --verbose
           Run verbosely.

       --thin
           Send a &quot;thin&quot; pack, which records objects in deltified form based on
           objects not included in the pack to reduce network traffic.

       &lt;host&gt;
           A remote host to house the repository. When this part is specified,
           git-receive-pack is invoked via ssh.

       &lt;directory&gt;
           The repository to update.

       &lt;ref&gt;...
           The remote refs to update.

SPECIFYING THE REFS
       There are three ways to specify which refs to update on the remote end.

       With --all flag, all refs that exist locally are transferred to the
       remote side. You cannot specify any &lt;ref&gt; if you use this flag.

       Without --all and without any &lt;ref&gt;, the heads that exist both on the
       local side and on the remote side are updated.
&#12;       When one or more &lt;ref&gt; are specified explicitly, it can be either a
       single pattern, or a pair of such pattern separated by a colon &quot;:&quot; (this
       means that a ref name cannot have a colon in it). A single pattern &lt;name&gt;
       is just a shorthand for &lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt;.

       Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon) and the
       destination side (after the colon). The ref to be pushed is determined by
       finding a match that matches the source side, and where it is pushed is
       determined by using the destination side. The rules used to match a ref
       are the same rules used by git rev-parse to resolve a symbolic ref name.
       See git-rev-parse(1).

       &#183;   It is an error if &lt;src&gt; does not match exactly one of the local refs.

       &#183;   It is an error if &lt;dst&gt; matches more than one remote refs.

       &#183;   If &lt;dst&gt; does not match any remote ref, either

           &#183;   it has to start with &quot;refs/&quot;; &lt;dst&gt; is used as the destination
               literally in this case.

           &#183;   &lt;src&gt; == &lt;dst&gt; and the ref that matched the &lt;src&gt; must not exist
               in the set of remote refs; the ref matched &lt;src&gt; locally is used
               as the name of the destination.

       Without --force, the &lt;src&gt; ref is stored at the remote only if &lt;dst&gt; does
       not exist, or &lt;dst&gt; is a proper subset (i.e. an ancestor) of &lt;src&gt;. This
       check, known as &quot;fast-forward check&quot;, is performed in order to avoid
       accidentally overwriting the remote ref and lose other peoples&apos; commits
       from there.

       With --force, the fast-forward check is disabled for all refs.

       Optionally, a &lt;ref&gt; parameter can be prefixed with a plus + sign to
       disable the fast-forward check only on that ref.
