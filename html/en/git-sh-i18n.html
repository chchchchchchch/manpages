GIT-SH-I18N(1)                     Git Manual                     GIT-SH-I18N(1)



NAME
       git-sh-i18n - Git&apos;s i18n setup code for shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       . &quot;$(git --exec-path)/git-sh-i18n&quot;


DESCRIPTION
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The &apos;git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by Git&#8217;s
       porcelain programs implemented in shell script. It provides wrappers for
       the GNU gettext and eval_gettext functions accessible through the
       gettext.sh script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on systems without
       GNU gettext.

FUNCTIONS
       gettext
           Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
           around printf(1). Will be replaced by a real gettext implementation
           in a later version.

       eval_gettext
           Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
           around printf(1) with variables expanded by the git-sh-
           i18n--envsubst(1) helper. Will be replaced by a real gettext
           implementation in a later version.
