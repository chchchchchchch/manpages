GIT-SHELL(1)                       Git Manual                       GIT-SHELL(1)



NAME
       git-shell - Restricted login shell for Git-only SSH access

SYNOPSIS
       git shell [-c &lt;command&gt; &lt;argument&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
       A login shell for SSH accounts to provide restricted Git access. When -c
       is given, the program executes &lt;command&gt; non-interactively; &lt;command&gt; can
       be one of git receive-pack, git upload-pack, git upload-archive, cvs
       server, or a command in COMMAND_DIR. The shell is started in interactive
       mode when no arguments are given; in this case, COMMAND_DIR must exist,
       and any of the executables in it can be invoked.

       cvs server is a special command which executes git-cvsserver.

       COMMAND_DIR is the path &quot;$HOME/git-shell-commands&quot;. The user must have
       read and execute permissions to the directory in order to execute the
       programs in it. The programs are executed with a cwd of $HOME, and
       &lt;argument&gt; is parsed as a command-line string.
