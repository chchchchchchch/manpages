GIT-SHOW-BRANCH(1)                 Git Manual                 GIT-SHOW-BRANCH(1)



NAME
       git-show-branch - Show branches and their commits

SYNOPSIS
       git show-branch [-a|--all] [-r|--remotes] [--topo-order | --date-order]
                       [--current] [--color[=&lt;when&gt;] | --no-color] [--sparse]
                       [--more=&lt;n&gt; | --list | --independent | --merge-base]
                       [--no-name | --sha1-name] [--topics]
                       [(&lt;rev&gt; | &lt;glob&gt;)...]
       git show-branch (-g|--reflog)[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]] [--list] [&lt;ref&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
       Shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named with
       &lt;rev&gt;s or &lt;globs&gt;s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags)
       semi-visually.

       It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time.

       It uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration items if no &lt;rev&gt;
       nor &lt;glob&gt; is given on the command line.

OPTIONS
       &lt;rev&gt;
           Arbitrary extended SHA1 expression (see gitrevisions(7)) that
           typically names a branch head or a tag.

       &lt;glob&gt;
           A glob pattern that matches branch or tag names under refs/. For
           example, if you have many topic branches under refs/heads/topic,
           giving topic/* would show all of them.

       -r, --remotes
           Show the remote-tracking branches.

       -a, --all
           Show both remote-tracking branches and local branches.

       --current
           With this option, the command includes the current branch to the list
           of revs to be shown when it is not given on the command line.

       --topo-order
           By default, the branches and their commits are shown in reverse
           chronological order. This option makes them appear in topological
           order (i.e., descendant commits are shown before their parents).

       --date-order
           This option is similar to --topo-order in the sense that no parent
           comes before all of its children, but otherwise commits are ordered
           according to their commit date.

       --sparse
           By default, the output omits merges that are reachable from only one
           tip being shown. This option makes them visible.

       --more=&lt;n&gt;
           Usually the command stops output upon showing the commit that is the
           common ancestor of all the branches. This flag tells the command to
           go &lt;n&gt; more common commits beyond that. When &lt;n&gt; is negative, display
           only the &lt;reference&gt;s given, without showing the commit ancestry
           tree.

       --list
           Synonym to --more=-1

       --merge-base
           Instead of showing the commit list, determine possible merge bases
           for the specified commits. All merge bases will be contained in all
           specified commits. This is different from how git-merge-base(1)
           handles the case of three or more commits.

       --independent
           Among the &lt;reference&gt;s given, display only the ones that cannot be
           reached from any other &lt;reference&gt;.

       --no-name
           Do not show naming strings for each commit.

       --sha1-name
           Instead of naming the commits using the path to reach them from heads
           (e.g. &quot;master~2&quot; to mean the grandparent of &quot;master&quot;), name them with
           the unique prefix of their object names.

       --topics
           Shows only commits that are NOT on the first branch given. This helps
           track topic branches by hiding any commit that is already in the main
           line of development. When given &quot;git show-branch --topics master
           topic1 topic2&quot;, this will show the revisions given by &quot;git rev-list
           ^master topic1 topic2&quot;

       -g, --reflog[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]] [&lt;ref&gt;]
           Shows &lt;n&gt; most recent ref-log entries for the given ref. If &lt;base&gt; is
           given, &lt;n&gt; entries going back from that entry. &lt;base&gt; can be
           specified as count or date. When no explicit &lt;ref&gt; parameter is
           given, it defaults to the current branch (or HEAD if it is detached).

       --color[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Color the status sign (one of these: * !  + -) of each commit
           corresponding to the branch it&#8217;s in. The value must be always (the
           default), never, or auto.

       --no-color
           Turn off colored output, even when the configuration file gives the
           default to color output. Same as --color=never.

       Note that --more, --list, --independent and --merge-base options are
       mutually exclusive.

OUTPUT
       Given N &lt;references&gt;, the first N lines are the one-line description from
       their commit message. The branch head that is pointed at by $GIT_DIR/HEAD
       is prefixed with an asterisk * character while other heads are prefixed
       with a ! character.

       Following these N lines, one-line log for each commit is displayed,
       indented N places. If a commit is on the I-th branch, the I-th
       indentation character shows a + sign; otherwise it shows a space. Merge
       commits are denoted by a - sign. Each commit shows a short name that can
       be used as an extended SHA1 to name that commit.

       The following example shows three branches, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;fixes&quot; and &quot;mhf&quot;:

           $ git show-branch master fixes mhf
           * [master] Add &apos;git show-branch&apos;.
            ! [fixes] Introduce &quot;reset type&quot; flag to &quot;git reset&quot;
             ! [mhf] Allow &quot;+remote:local&quot; refspec to cause --force when fetching.
           ---
             + [mhf] Allow &quot;+remote:local&quot; refspec to cause --force when fetching.
             + [mhf~1] Use git-octopus when pulling more than one heads.
            +  [fixes] Introduce &quot;reset type&quot; flag to &quot;git reset&quot;
             + [mhf~2] &quot;git fetch --force&quot;.
             + [mhf~3] Use .git/remote/origin, not .git/branches/origin.
             + [mhf~4] Make &quot;git pull&quot; and &quot;git fetch&quot; default to origin
             + [mhf~5] Infamous &apos;octopus merge&apos;
             + [mhf~6] Retire git-parse-remote.
             + [mhf~7] Multi-head fetch.
             + [mhf~8] Start adding the $GIT_DIR/remotes/ support.
           *++ [master] Add &apos;git show-branch&apos;.


       These three branches all forked from a common commit, [master], whose
       commit message is &quot;Add &apos;git show-branch&apos;&quot;. The &quot;fixes&quot; branch adds one
       commit &quot;Introduce &quot;reset type&quot; flag to &quot;git reset&quot;&quot;. The &quot;mhf&quot; branch
       adds many other commits. The current branch is &quot;master&quot;.

EXAMPLE
       If you keep your primary branches immediately under refs/heads, and topic
       branches in subdirectories of it, having the following in the
       configuration file may help:

           [showbranch]
                   default = --topo-order
                   default = heads/*


       With this, git show-branch without extra parameters would show only the
       primary branches. In addition, if you happen to be on your topic branch,
       it is shown as well.

           $ git show-branch --reflog=&quot;10,1 hour ago&quot; --list master


       shows 10 reflog entries going back from the tip as of 1 hour ago. Without
       --list, the output also shows how these tips are topologically related
       with each other.
