GIT-UNPACK-OBJECTS(1)              Git Manual              GIT-UNPACK-OBJECTS(1)



NAME
       git-unpack-objects - Unpack objects from a packed archive

SYNOPSIS
       git unpack-objects [-n] [-q] [-r] [--strict] &lt;pack-file


DESCRIPTION
       Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding the
       objects contained within and writing them into the repository in &quot;loose&quot;
       (one object per file) format.

       Objects that already exist in the repository will not be unpacked from
       the pack-file. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use this
       command on a pack-file that exists within the target repository.

       See git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and replace existing
       ones.

OPTIONS
       -n
           Dry run. Check the pack file without actually unpacking the objects.

       -q
           The command usually shows percentage progress. This flag suppresses
           it.

       -r
           When unpacking a corrupt packfile, the command dies at the first
           corruption. This flag tells it to keep going and make the best effort
           to recover as many objects as possible.

       --strict
           Don&#8217;t write objects with broken content or links.
