GIT-VAR(1)                         Git Manual                         GIT-VAR(1)



NAME
       git-var - Show a git logical variable

SYNOPSIS
       git var ( -l | &lt;variable&gt; )


DESCRIPTION
       Prints a git logical variable.

OPTIONS
       -l
           Cause the logical variables to be listed. In addition, all the
           variables of the git configuration file .git/config are listed as
           well. (However, the configuration variables listing functionality is
           deprecated in favor of git config -l.)

EXAMPLE
           $ git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
           Eric W. Biederman &lt;ebiederm@lnxi.com&gt; 1121223278 -0600

VARIABLES
       GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
           The author of a piece of code.

       GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
           The person who put a piece of code into git.

       GIT_EDITOR
           Text editor for use by git commands. The value is meant to be
           interpreted by the shell when it is used. Examples: ~/bin/vi,
           $SOME_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, &quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe&quot; --nofork.
           The order of preference is the $GIT_EDITOR environment variable, then
           core.editor configuration, then $VISUAL, then $EDITOR, and then
           finally vi.

       GIT_PAGER
           Text viewer for use by git commands (e.g., less). The value is meant
           to be interpreted by the shell. The order of preference is the
           $GIT_PAGER environment variable, then core.pager configuration, then
           $PAGER, and then finally less.
