GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)                 Git Manual                 GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)



NAME
       git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces

SYNOPSIS
       git whatchanged &lt;option&gt;...


DESCRIPTION
       Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces. The command
       internally invokes git rev-list piped to git diff-tree, and takes command
       line options for both of these commands.

       This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.

OPTIONS
       -p
           Show textual diffs, instead of the git internal diff output format
           that is useful only to tell the changed paths and their nature of
           changes.

       -&lt;n&gt;
           Limit output to &lt;n&gt; commits.

       &lt;since&gt;..&lt;until&gt;
           Limit output to between the two named commits (bottom exclusive, top
           inclusive).

       -r
           Show git internal diff output, but for the whole tree, not just the
           top level.

       -m
           By default, differences for merge commits are not shown. With this
           flag, show differences to that commit from all of its parents.

           However, it is not very useful in general, although it is useful on a
           file-by-file basis.

       --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;
           Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
           &lt;format&gt; can be one of oneline, short, medium, full, fuller, email,
           raw and format:&lt;string&gt;. See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some
           additional details for each format. When omitted, the format defaults
           to medium.

           Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
           configuration (see git-config(1)).

       --abbrev-commit
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name,
           show only a partial prefix. Non default number of digits can be
           specified with &quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff output, if it
           is displayed).

           This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more readable for
           people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
           Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
           --abbrev-commit and those options which imply it such as &quot;--oneline&quot;.
           It also overrides the log.abbrevCommit variable.
&#12;       --oneline
           This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit&quot; used
           together.

       --encoding[=&lt;encoding&gt;]
           The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in
           their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to
           re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user.
           For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8.

       --notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]
           Show the notes (see git-notes(1)) that annotate the commit, when
           showing the commit log message. This is the default for git log, git
           show and git whatchanged commands when there is no --pretty, --format
           nor --oneline option given on the command line.

           By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
           core.notesRef and notes.displayRef variables (or corresponding
           environment overrides). See git-config(1) for more details.

           With an optional &lt;ref&gt; argument, show this notes ref instead of the
           default notes ref(s). The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it is
           not qualified.

           Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
           being displayed. Examples: &quot;--notes=foo&quot; will show only notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot;; &quot;--notes=foo --notes&quot; will show both notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot; and from the default notes ref(s).

       --no-notes
           Do not show notes. This negates the above --notes option, by
           resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown. Options
           are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g. &quot;--notes
           --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar&quot; will only show notes from
           &quot;refs/notes/bar&quot;.

       --show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes
           These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
           options instead.

PRETTY FORMATS
       If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not oneline, email
       or raw, an additional line is inserted before the Author: line. This line
       begins with &quot;Merge: &quot; and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed,
       separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be
       the list of the direct parent commits if you have limited your view of
       history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a
       certain directory or file.

       There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional formats
       by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another format name,
       or a format: string, as described below (see git-config(1)). Here are the
       details of the built-in formats:

       &#183;    oneline

               &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;title line&gt;

           This is designed to be as compact as possible.

       &#183;    short

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

       &#183;    medium

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Date:   &lt;author date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    full

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Commit: &lt;committer&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    fuller

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author:     &lt;author&gt;
               AuthorDate: &lt;author date&gt;
               Commit:     &lt;committer&gt;
               CommitDate: &lt;committer date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    email

               From &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;date&gt;
               From: &lt;author&gt;
               Date: &lt;author date&gt;
               Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       &#183;    raw

           The raw format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the
           commit object. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in full, regardless
           of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and parents information
           show the true parent commits, without taking grafts nor history
           simplification into account.

       &#183;    format:&lt;string&gt;

           The format:&lt;string&gt; format allows you to specify which information
           you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format, with the
           notable exception that you get a newline with %n instead of \n.

           E.g, format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&quot;
           would show something like this:

               The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
               The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;

           The placeholders are:

           &#183;    %H: commit hash
&#12;           &#183;    %h: abbreviated commit hash

           &#183;    %T: tree hash

           &#183;    %cE: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1)
               or git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %cd: committer date

           &#183;    %cD: committer date, RFC2822 style

           &#183;    %cr: committer date, relative

           &#183;    %ct: committer date, UNIX timestamp

           &#183;    %ci: committer date, ISO 8601 format

           &#183;    %d: ref names, like the --decorate option of git-log(1)

           &#183;    %e: encoding

           &#183;    %s: subject

           &#183;    %f: sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename

&#12;           &#183;    %gd: shortened reflog selector, e.g., stash@{1}

           &#183;    %gn: reflog identity name

           &#183;    %gN: reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see git-
               shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))

           &#183;    %ge: reflog identity email

           &#183;    %gE: reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see git-

           &#183;    %C(...): color specification, as described in color.branch.*
               config option

           &#183;    %m: left, right or boundary mark

           &#183;    %n: newline

           &#183;    %%: a raw %

           &#183;    %x00: print a byte from a hex code

           &#183;    %w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]]): switch line wrapping, like the -w
               option of git-shortlog(1).

           Note
           Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision
           traversal engine. For example, the %g* reflog options will insert an
           empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by git
           log -g). The %d placeholder will use the &quot;short&quot; decoration format if
           --decorate was not already provided on the command line.

       If you add a + (plus sign) after % of a placeholder, a line-feed is
       inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
       expands to a non-empty string.

       If you add a - (minus sign) after % of a placeholder, line-feeds that
       immediately precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
       placeholder expands to an empty string.

       If you add a ` ` (space) after % of a placeholder, a space is inserted
       immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
       to a non-empty string.

       &#183;    tformat:

           The tformat: format works exactly like format:, except that it
           provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of &quot;separator&quot; semantics. In
           other words, each commit has the message terminator character
           (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between
           entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line format will
           be properly terminated with a new line, just as the &quot;oneline&quot; format
           does. For example:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe &apos;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/&apos;
               4da45be
               7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe &apos;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/&apos;
               4da45be
               7134973

           In addition, any unrecognized string that has a % in it is
           interpreted as if it has tformat: in front of it. For example, these
           two are equivalent:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
               $ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef


EXAMPLES
       git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
           Show as patches the commits since version v2.6.12 that changed any
           file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

       git whatchanged --since=&quot;2 weeks ago&quot; -- gitk
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk. The &quot;--&quot;
           is necessary to avoid confusion with the branch named gitk
