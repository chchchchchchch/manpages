GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)                  Git Manual                  GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)



NAME
       git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index

SYNOPSIS
       git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;/]


DESCRIPTION
       Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new tree
       object is printed to standard output.

       The index must be in a fully merged state.

       Conceptually, git write-tree sync()s the current index contents into a
       set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your
       directory right now, you need to have done a git update-index phase
       before you did the git write-tree.

OPTIONS
       --missing-ok
           Normally git write-tree ensures that the objects referenced by the
           directory exist in the object database. This option disables this
           check.

       --prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;/
           Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory &lt;prefix&gt;. This
           can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the
           named subdirectory.
