GITK(1)                            Git Manual                            GITK(1)



NAME
       gitk - The git repository browser

SYNOPSIS
       gitk [&lt;option&gt;...] [&lt;revs&gt;] [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]


DESCRIPTION
       Displays changes in a repository or a selected set of commits. This
       includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to
       each commit, and the files in the trees of each revision.

       Historically, gitk was the first repository browser. It&#8217;s written in
       tcl/tk and started off in a separate repository but was later merged into
       the main git repository.

OPTIONS
       To control which revisions to show, the command takes options applicable
       to the git rev-list command (see git-rev-list(1)). This manual page
       describes only the most frequently used options.

       -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;
           Limits the number of commits to show.

       --since=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

       --until=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits older than a specific date.

       --all
           Show all branches.

       --merge
           After an attempt to merge stops with conflicts, show the commits on
           the history between two branches (i.e. the HEAD and the MERGE_HEAD)
           that modify the conflicted files and do not exist on all the heads
           being merged.

       --argscmd=&lt;command&gt;
           Command to be run each time gitk has to determine the list of &lt;revs&gt;
           to show. The command is expected to print on its standard output a
           list of additional revs to be shown, one per line. Use this instead
           of explicitly specifying &lt;revs&gt; if the set of commits to show may
           vary between refreshes.

       --select-commit=&lt;ref&gt;
           Automatically select the specified commit after loading the graph.
           Default behavior is equivalent to specifying --select-commit=HEAD.

       &lt;revs&gt;
           Limit the revisions to show. This can be either a single revision
           meaning show from the given revision and back, or it can be a range
           in the form &quot;&lt;from&gt;..&lt;to&gt;&quot; to show all revisions between &lt;from&gt; and
           back to &lt;to&gt;. Note, more advanced revision selection can be applied.
           For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
           gitrevisions(7).

       &lt;path&gt;...
           Limit commits to the ones touching files in the given paths. Note, to
           avoid ambiguity with respect to revision names use &quot;--&quot; to separate
           the paths from any preceding options.

EXAMPLES
       gitk v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
           Show the changes since version v2.6.12 that changed any file in the
           include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

       gitk --since=&quot;2 weeks ago&quot; -- gitk
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk. The &quot;--&quot;
           is necessary to avoid confusion with the branch named gitk

       gitk --max-count=100 --all -- Makefile
           Show at most 100 changes made to the file Makefile. Instead of only
           looking for changes in the current branch look in all branches.

FILES
       Gitk creates the .gitk file in your $HOME directory to store preferences
       such as display options, font, and colors.
