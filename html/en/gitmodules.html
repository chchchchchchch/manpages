GITMODULES(5)                      Git Manual                      GITMODULES(5)



NAME
       gitmodules - defining submodule properties

SYNOPSIS
       $GIT_WORK_DIR/.gitmodules

DESCRIPTION
       The .gitmodules file, located in the top-level directory of a git working
       tree, is a text file with a syntax matching the requirements of git-
       config(1).

       The file contains one subsection per submodule, and the subsection value
       is the name of the submodule. Each submodule section also contains the
       following required keys:

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.path
           Defines the path, relative to the top-level directory of the git
           working tree, where the submodule is expected to be checked out. The
           path name must not end with a /. All submodule paths must be unique
           within the .gitmodules file.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url
           Defines a URL from which the submodule repository can be cloned. This
           may be either an absolute URL ready to be passed to git-clone(1) or
           (if it begins with ./ or ../) a location relative to the
           superproject&#8217;s origin repository.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update
           Defines what to do when the submodule is updated by the superproject.
           If checkout (the default), the new commit specified in the
           superproject will be checked out in the submodule on a detached HEAD.
           If rebase, the current branch of the submodule will be rebased onto
           the commit specified in the superproject. If merge, the commit
           specified in the superproject will be merged into the current branch
           in the submodule. If none, the submodule with name $name will not be
           updated by default.

               This config option is overridden if &apos;git submodule update&apos; is given
               the &apos;--merge&apos;, &apos;--rebase&apos; or &apos;--checkout&apos; options.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules
           This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this
           submodule. If this option is also present in the submodules entry in
           .git/config of the superproject, the setting there will override the
           one found in .gitmodules. Both settings can be overridden on the
           command line by using the &quot;--[no-]recurse-submodules&quot; option to &quot;git
           fetch&quot; and &quot;git pull&quot;.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore
           Defines under what circumstances &quot;git status&quot; and the diff family
           show a submodule as modified. When set to &quot;all&quot;, it will never be
           considered modified, &quot;dirty&quot; will ignore all changes to the
           submodules work tree and takes only differences between the HEAD of
           the submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject into
           account. &quot;untracked&quot; will additionally let submodules with modified
           tracked files in their work tree show up. Using &quot;none&quot; (the default
           when this option is not set) also shows submodules that have
           untracked files in their work tree as changed. If this option is also
           present in the submodules entry in .git/config of the superproject,
           the setting there will override the one found in .gitmodules. Both
           settings can be overridden on the command line by using the
           &quot;--ignore-submodule&quot; option.

EXAMPLES
       Consider the following .gitmodules file:

           [submodule &quot;libfoo&quot;]
                   path = include/foo
                   url = git://foo.com/git/lib.git

           [submodule &quot;libbar&quot;]
                   path = include/bar
                   url = git://bar.com/git/lib.git

       This defines two submodules, libfoo and libbar. These are expected to be
       checked out in the paths include/foo and include/bar, and for both
       submodules a URL is specified which can be used for cloning the
       submodules.
