GITWEB.CONF(5)                     Git Manual                     GITWEB.CONF(5)



NAME
       gitweb.conf - Gitweb (git web interface) configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/gitweb.conf, /etc/gitweb-common.conf, $GITWEBDIR/gitweb_config.perl

DESCRIPTION
       The gitweb CGI script for viewing Git repositories over the web uses a
       perl script fragment as its configuration file. You can set variables
       using &quot;our $variable = value&quot;; text from a &quot;#&quot; character until the end of
       a line is ignored. See perlsyn(1) for details.

       An example:

           # gitweb configuration file for http://git.example.org
           #
           our $projectroot = &quot;/srv/git&quot;; # FHS recommendation
           our $site_name = &apos;Example.org &gt;&gt; Repos&apos;;

       The configuration file is used to override the default settings that were
       built into gitweb at the time the gitweb.cgi script was generated.

       While one could just alter the configuration settings in the gitweb CGI
       itself, those changes would be lost upon upgrade. Configuration settings
       might also be placed into a file in the same directory as the CGI script
       with the default name gitweb_config.perl &#8212; allowing one to have multiple
       gitweb instances with different configurations by the use of symlinks.

       Note that some configuration can be controlled on per-repository rather
       than gitweb-wide basis: see &quot;Per-repository gitweb configuration&quot;
       subsection on gitweb(1) manpage.

DISCUSSION
       Gitweb reads configuration data from the following sources in the
       following order:

       &#183;   built-in values (some set during build stage),

       &#183;   common system-wide configuration file (defaults to
           /etc/gitweb-common.conf),

       &#183;   either per-instance configuration file (defaults to
           gitweb_config.perl in the same directory as the installed gitweb), or
           if it does not exists then fallback system-wide configuration file
           (defaults to /etc/gitweb.conf).

       Values obtained in later configuration files override values obtained
       earlier in the above sequence.

       Locations of the common system-wide configuration file, the fallback
       system-wide configuration file and the per-instance configuration file
       are defined at compile time using build-time Makefile configuration
       variables, respectively GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON, GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM and
       GITWEB_CONFIG.

       You can also override locations of gitweb configuration files during
       runtime by setting the following environment variables:
       GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON, GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM and GITWEB_CONFIG to a
       non-empty value.

       The syntax of the configuration files is that of Perl, since these files
       are handled by sourcing them as fragments of Perl code (the language that
       gitweb itself is written in). Variables are typically set using the our
       qualifier (as in &quot;our $variable = &lt;value&gt;;&quot;) to avoid syntax errors if a
       new version of gitweb no longer uses a variable and therefore stops
       declaring it.

       You can include other configuration file using read_config_file()
       subroutine. For example, one might want to put gitweb configuration
       related to access control for viewing repositories via Gitolite (one of
       git repository management tools) in a separate file, e.g. in
       /etc/gitweb-gitolite.conf. To include it, put

           read_config_file(&quot;/etc/gitweb-gitolite.conf&quot;);


       somewhere in gitweb configuration file used, e.g. in per-installation
       gitweb configuration file. Note that read_config_file() checks itself
       that the file it reads exists, and does nothing if it is not found. It
       also handles errors in included file.

       The default configuration with no configuration file at all may work
       perfectly well for some installations. Still, a configuration file is
       useful for customizing or tweaking the behavior of gitweb in many ways,
       and some optional features will not be present unless explicitly enabled
       using the configurable %features variable (see also &quot;Configuring gitweb
       features&quot; section below).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       Some configuration variables have their default values (embedded in the
       CGI script) set during building gitweb &#8212; if that is the case, this fact
       is put in their description. See gitweb&#8217;s INSTALL file for instructions
       on building and installing gitweb.

   Location of repositories
       The configuration variables described below control how gitweb finds git
       repositories, and how repositories are displayed and accessed.

       See also &quot;Repositories&quot; and later subsections in gitweb(1) manpage.

       $projectroot
           Absolute filesystem path which will be prepended to project path; the
           path to repository is $projectroot/$project. Set to
           $GITWEB_PROJECTROOT during installation. This variable has to be set
           correctly for gitweb to find repositories.

           For example, if $projectroot is set to &quot;/srv/git&quot; by putting the
           following in gitweb config file:

               our $projectroot = &quot;/srv/git&quot;;

           then

               http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi?p=foo/bar.git

           and its path_info based equivalent

               http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi/foo/bar.git

           will map to the path /srv/git/foo/bar.git on the filesystem.

       $projects_list
           Name of a plain text file listing projects, or a name of directory to
           be scanned for projects.

           Project list files should list one project per line, with each line
           having the following format
&#12;               &lt;URI-encoded filesystem path to repository&gt; SP &lt;URI-encoded repository owner&gt;

           The default value of this variable is determined by the GITWEB_LIST
           makefile variable at installation time. If this variable is empty,
           gitweb will fall back to scanning the $projectroot directory for
           repositories.

       $project_maxdepth
           If $projects_list variable is unset, gitweb will recursively scan
           filesystem for git repositories. The $project_maxdepth is used to
           limit traversing depth, relative to $projectroot (starting point); it
           means that directories which are further from $projectroot than
           $project_maxdepth will be skipped.

           It is purely performance optimization, originally intended for MacOS
           X, where recursive directory traversal is slow. Gitweb follows
           symbolic links, but it detects cycles, ignoring any duplicate files
           and directories.

           The default value of this variable is determined by the build-time
           configuration variable GITWEB_PROJECT_MAXDEPTH, which defaults to
           2007.

       $export_ok
           Show repository only if this file exists (in repository). Only
           effective if this variable evaluates to true. Can be set when
           building gitweb by setting GITWEB_EXPORT_OK. This path is relative to
           GIT_DIR. git-daemon[1] uses git-daemon-export-ok, unless started with
           --export-all. By default this variable is not set, which means that
           this feature is turned off.

       $export_auth_hook
           Function used to determine which repositories should be shown. This
           subroutine should take one parameter, the full path to a project, and
           if it returns true, that project will be included in the projects
           list and can be accessed through gitweb as long as it fulfills the
           other requirements described by $export_ok, $projects_list, and
           $projects_maxdepth. Example:

               our $export_auth_hook = sub { return -e &quot;$_[0]/git-daemon-export-ok&quot;; };

           though the above might be done by using $export_ok instead

               our $export_ok = &quot;git-daemon-export-ok&quot;;

           If not set (default), it means that this feature is disabled.

           See also more involved example in &quot;Controlling access to git
           repositories&quot; subsection on gitweb(1) manpage.

       $strict_export
           Only allow viewing of repositories also shown on the overview page.
           This for example makes $gitweb_export_ok file decide if repository is
           available and not only if it is shown. If $gitweb_list points to file
           with list of project, only those repositories listed would be
           available for gitweb. Can be set during building gitweb via
           GITWEB_STRICT_EXPORT. By default this variable is not set, which
           means that you can directly access those repositories that are hidden
           from projects list page (e.g. the are not listed in the
           $projects_list file).

   Finding files
       The following configuration variables tell gitweb where to find files.
       The values of these variables are paths on the filesystem.

       $GIT
           Core git executable to use. By default set to $GIT_BINDIR/git, which
           in turn is by default set to $(bindir)/git. If you use git installed
           from a binary package, you should usually set this to &quot;/usr/bin/git&quot;.
           This can just be &quot;git&quot; if your web server has a sensible PATH; from
           security point of view it is better to use absolute path to git
           binary. If you have multiple git versions installed it can be used to
           choose which one to use. Must be (correctly) set for gitweb to be
           able to work.

       $mimetypes_file
           File to use for (filename extension based) guessing of MIME types
           before trying /etc/mime.types.  NOTE that this path, if relative, is
           taken as relative to the current git repository, not to CGI script.
           If unset, only /etc/mime.types is used (if present on filesystem). If
           no mimetypes file is found, mimetype guessing based on extension of
           file is disabled. Unset by default.

       $highlight_bin
           Path to the highlight executable to use (it must be the one from
           http://www.andre-simon.de due to assumptions about parameters and
           output). By default set to highlight; set it to full path to
           highlight executable if it is not installed on your web server&#8217;s
           PATH. Note that highlight feature must be set for gitweb to actually
           use syntax hightlighting.

           NOTE: if you want to add support for new file type (supported by
           &quot;highlight&quot; but not used by gitweb), you need to modify
           %highlight_ext or %highlight_basename, depending on whether you
           detect type of file based on extension (for example &quot;sh&quot;) or on its
           basename (for example &quot;Makefile&quot;). The keys of these hashes are
           extension and basename, respectively, and value for given key is name
           of syntax to be passed via --syntax &lt;syntax&gt; to highlighter.

           For example if repositories you are hosting use &quot;phtml&quot; extension for
           PHP files, and you want to have correct syntax-highlighting for those
           files, you can add the following to gitweb configuration:

               our %highlight_ext;
               $highlight_ext{&apos;phtml&apos;} = &apos;php&apos;;


   Links and their targets
       The configuration variables described below configure some of gitweb
       links: their target and their look (text or image), and where to find
       page prerequisites (stylesheet, favicon, images, scripts). Usually they
       are left at their default values, with the possible exception of
       @stylesheets variable.

       @stylesheets
           List of URIs of stylesheets (relative to the base URI of a page). You
           might specify more than one stylesheet, for example to use
           &quot;gitweb.css&quot; as base with site specific modifications in a separate
           stylesheet to make it easier to upgrade gitweb. For example, you can
           add a site stylesheet by putting

               push @stylesheets, &quot;gitweb-site.css&quot;;

           in the gitweb config file. Those values that are relative paths are
           relative to base URI of gitweb.

           This list should contain the URI of gitweb&#8217;s standard stylesheet. The
           default URI of gitweb stylesheet can be set at build time using the
           GITWEB_CSS makefile variable. Its default value is static/gitweb.css
           (or static/gitweb.min.css if the CSSMIN variable is defined, i.e. if
           CSS minifier is used during build).
&#12;           Note: there is also a legacy $stylesheet configuration variable,
           which was used by older gitweb. If $stylesheet variable is defined,
           only CSS stylesheet given by this variable is used by gitweb.

       $logo
           Points to the location where you put git-logo.png on your web server,
           or to be more the generic URI of logo, 72x27 size). This image is
           displayed in the top right corner of each gitweb page and used as a
           logo for the Atom feed. Relative to the base URI of gitweb (as a
           path). Can be adjusted when building gitweb using GITWEB_LOGO
           variable By default set to static/git-logo.png.

       $favicon
           Points to the location where you put git-favicon.png on your web
           server, or to be more the generic URI of favicon, which will be
           served as &quot;image/png&quot; type. Web browsers that support favicons
           (website icons) may display them in the browser&#8217;s URL bar and next to
           the site name in bookmarks. Relative to the base URI of gitweb. Can
           be adjusted at build time using GITWEB_FAVICON variable. By default
           set to static/git-favicon.png.

       $javascript
           Points to the location where you put gitweb.js on your web server, or
           to be more generic the URI of JavaScript code used by gitweb.
           Relative to the base URI of gitweb. Can be set at build time using
           the GITWEB_JS build-time configuration variable.

           The default value is either static/gitweb.js, or static/gitweb.min.js
           if the JSMIN build variable was defined, i.e. if JavaScript minifier
           was used at build time.  Note that this single file is generated from
           multiple individual JavaScript &quot;modules&quot;.

       $home_link
           Target of the home link on the top of all pages (the first part of
           view &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;). By default it is set to the absolute URI of a
           current page (to the value of $my_uri variable, or to &quot;/&quot; if $my_uri
           is undefined or is an empty string).

       $home_link_str
           Label for the &quot;home link&quot; at the top of all pages, leading to
           $home_link (usually the main gitweb page, which contains the projects
           list). It is used as the first component of gitweb&#8217;s &quot;breadcrumb
           trail&quot;: &lt;home link&gt; / &lt;project&gt; / &lt;action&gt;. Can be set at build time
           using the GITWEB_HOME_LINK_STR variable. By default it is set to
           &quot;projects&quot;, as this link leads to the list of projects. Other popular
           choice it to set it to the name of site.

       $logo_url, $logo_label
           URI and label (title) for the Git logo link (or your site logo, if
           you chose to use different logo image). By default, these both refer
           to git homepage, http://git-scm.com; in the past, they pointed to git
           documentation at http://www.kernel.org.

   Changing gitweb&#8217;s look
       You can adjust how pages generated by gitweb look using the variables
       described below. You can change the site name, add common headers and
       footers for all pages, and add a description of this gitweb installation
       on its main page (which is the projects list page), etc.

       $site_name
           Name of your site or organization, to appear in page titles. Set it
           to something descriptive for clearer bookmarks etc. If this variable
           is not set or is, then gitweb uses the value of the SERVER_NAME CGI
           environment variable, setting site name to &quot;$SERVER_NAME Git&quot;, or
           &quot;Untitled Git&quot; if this variable is not set (e.g. if running gitweb as
           standalone script).

           Can be set using the GITWEB_SITENAME at build time. Unset by default.

       $site_html_head_string
           HTML snippet to be included in the &lt;head&gt; section of each page. Can
           be set using GITWEB_SITE_HTML_HEAD_STRING at build time. No default
           value.

       $site_header
           Name of a file with HTML to be included at the top of each page.
           Relative to the directory containing the gitweb.cgi script. Can be
           set using GITWEB_SITE_HEADER at build time. No default value.

       $site_footer
           Name of a file with HTML to be included at the bottom of each page.
           Relative to the directory containing the gitweb.cgi script. Can be
           set using GITWEB_SITE_FOOTER at build time. No default value.

       $home_text
           Name of a HTML file which, if it exists, is included on the gitweb
           projects overview page (&quot;projects_list&quot; view). Relative to the
           directory containing the gitweb.cgi script. Default value can be
           adjusted during build time using GITWEB_HOMETEXT variable. By default
           set to indextext.html.

       $projects_list_description_width
           The width (in characters) of the &quot;Description&quot; column of the projects
           list. Longer descriptions will be truncated (trying to cut at word
           boundary); the full description is available in the title attribute
           (usually shown on mouseover). The default is 25, which might be too
           small if you use long project descriptions.

       $default_projects_order
           Default value of ordering of projects on projects list page, which
           means the ordering used if you don&#8217;t explicitly sort projects list
           (if there is no &quot;o&quot; CGI query parameter in the URL). Valid values are
           &quot;none&quot; (unsorted), &quot;project&quot; (projects are by project name, i.e. path
           to repository relative to $projectroot), &quot;descr&quot; (project
           description), &quot;owner&quot;, and &quot;age&quot; (by date of most current commit).

           Default value is &quot;project&quot;. Unknown value means unsorted.

   Changing gitweb&#8217;s behavior
       These configuration variables control internal gitweb behavior.

       $default_blob_plain_mimetype
           Default mimetype for the blob_plain (raw) view, if mimetype checking
           doesn&#8217;t result in some other type; by default &quot;text/plain&quot;. Gitweb
           guesses mimetype of a file to display based on extension of its
           filename, using $mimetypes_file (if set and file exists) and
           /etc/mime.types files (see mime.types(5) manpage; only filename
           extension rules are supported by gitweb).

       $default_text_plain_charset
           Default charset for text files. If this is not set, the web server
           configuration will be used. Unset by default.

       $fallback_encoding
           Gitweb assumes this charset when a line contains non-UTF-8
           characters. The fallback decoding is used without error checking, so
           it can be even &quot;utf-8&quot;. The value must be a valid encoding; see the
           Encoding::Supported(3pm) man page for a list. The default is
           &quot;latin1&quot;, aka. &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;.

       @diff_opts
           Rename detection options for git-diff and git-diff-tree. The default
           is (&apos;-M&apos;); set it to (&apos;-C&apos;) or (&apos;-C&apos;, &apos;-C&apos;) to also detect copies, or
           set it to () i.e. empty list if you don&#8217;t want to have renames
           detection.

           Note that rename and especially copy detection can be quite
           CPU-intensive. Note also that non git tools can have problems with
           patches generated with options mentioned above, especially when they
           involve file copies (&apos;-C&apos;) or criss-cross renames (&apos;-B&apos;).

   Some optional features and policies
       Most of features are configured via %feature hash; however some of extra
       gitweb features can be turned on and configured using variables described
       below. This list beside configuration variables that control how gitweb
       looks does contain variables configuring administrative side of gitweb
       (e.g. cross-site scripting prevention; admittedly this as side effect
       affects how &quot;summary&quot; pages look like, or load limiting).

       @git_base_url_list
           List of git base URLs. These URLs are used to generate URLs
           describing from where to fetch a project, which are shown on project
           summary page. The full fetch URL is &quot;$git_base_url/$project&quot;, for
           each element of this list. You can set up multiple base URLs (for
           example one for git:// protocol, and one for http:// protocol).

           Note that per repository configuration can be set in
           $GIT_DIR/cloneurl file, or as values of multi-value gitweb.url
           configuration variable in project config. Per-repository
           configuration takes precedence over value composed from
           @git_base_url_list elements and project name.

           You can setup one single value (single entry/item in this list) at
           build time by setting the GITWEB_BASE_URL built-time configuration
           variable. By default it is set to (), i.e. an empty list. This means
           that gitweb would not try to create project URL (to fetch) from
           project name.

       $projects_list_group_categories
           Whether to enables the grouping of projects by category on the
           project list page. The category of a project is determined by the
           $GIT_DIR/category file or the gitweb.category variable in each
           repository&#8217;s configuration. Disabled by default (set to 0).

       $project_list_default_category
           Default category for projects for which none is specified. If this is
           set to the empty string, such projects will remain uncategorized and
           listed at the top, above categorized projects. Used only if project
           categories are enabled, which means if
           $projects_list_group_categories is true. By default set to &quot;&quot; (empty
           string).

       $prevent_xss
           If true, some gitweb features are disabled to prevent content in
           repositories from launching cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Set
           this to true if you don&#8217;t trust the content of your repositories.
           False by default (set to 0).

       $maxload
           Used to set the maximum load that we will still respond to gitweb
           queries. If the server load exceeds this value then gitweb will
           return &quot;503 Service Unavailable&quot; error. The server load is taken to
           be 0 if gitweb cannot determine its value. Currently it works only on
           Linux, where it uses /proc/loadavg; the load there is the number of
           active tasks on the system &#8212; processes that are actually running &#8212;
           averaged over the last minute.

           Set $maxload to undefined value (undef) to turn this feature off. The
           default value is 300.

       $per_request_config
           If this is set to code reference, it will be run once for each
           request. You can set parts of configuration that change per session
           this way. For example, one might use the following code in a gitweb
           configuration file

               our $per_request_config = sub {
                       $ENV{GL_USER} = $cgi-&gt;remote_user || &quot;gitweb&quot;;
               };

           If $per_request_config is not a code reference, it is interpreted as
           boolean value. If it is true gitweb will process config files once
           per request, and if it is false gitweb will process config files only
           once, each time it is executed. True by default (set to 1).

           NOTE: $my_url, $my_uri, and $base_url are overwritten with their
           default values before every request, so if you want to change them,
           be sure to set this variable to true or a code reference effecting
           the desired changes.

           This variable matters only when using persistent web environments
           that serve multiple requests using single gitweb instance, like
           mod_perl, FastCGI or Plackup.

   Other variables
       Usually you should not need to change (adjust) any of configuration
       variables described below; they should be automatically set by gitweb to
       correct value.

       $version
           Gitweb version, set automatically when creating gitweb.cgi from
           gitweb.perl. You might want to modify it if you are running modified
           gitweb, for example

               our $version .= &quot; with caching&quot;;

           if you run modified version of gitweb with caching support. This
           variable is purely informational, used e.g. in the &quot;generator&quot; meta
           header in HTML header.

       $my_url, $my_uri
           Full URL and absolute URL of the gitweb script; in earlier versions
           of gitweb you might have need to set those variables, but now there
           should be no need to do it. See $per_request_config if you need to
           set them still.

       $base_url
           Base URL for relative URLs in pages generated by gitweb, (e.g.
           $logo, $favicon, @stylesheets if they are relative URLs), needed and
           used &lt;base href=&quot;$base_url&quot;&gt; only for URLs with nonempty PATH_INFO.
           Usually gitweb sets its value correctly, and there is no need to set
           this variable, e.g. to $my_uri or &quot;/&quot;. See $per_request_config if you
           need to override it anyway.

CONFIGURING GITWEB FEATURES
       Many gitweb features can be enabled (or disabled) and configured using
       the %feature hash. Names of gitweb features are keys of this hash.

       Each %feature hash element is a hash reference and has the following
       structure:

           &quot;&lt;feature_name&gt;&quot; =&gt; {
                   &quot;sub&quot; =&gt; &lt;feature-sub (subroutine)&gt;,
                   &quot;override&quot; =&gt; &lt;allow-override (boolean)&gt;,
                   &quot;default&quot; =&gt; [ &lt;options&gt;... ]
           },


       Some features cannot be overridden per project. For those features the
       structure of appropriate %feature hash element has a simpler form:

           &quot;&lt;feature_name&gt;&quot; =&gt; {
                   &quot;override&quot; =&gt; 0,
                   &quot;default&quot; =&gt; [ &lt;options&gt;... ]
           },


       As one can see it lacks the &apos;sub&apos; element.

       The meaning of each part of feature configuration is described below:

       default
           List (array reference) of feature parameters (if there are any), used
           also to toggle (enable or disable) given feature.

           Note that it is currently always an array reference, even if feature
           doesn&#8217;t accept any configuration parameters, and &apos;default&apos; is used
           only to turn it on or off. In such case you turn feature on by
           setting this element to [1], and torn it off by setting it to [0].
           See also the passage about the &quot;blame&quot; feature in the &quot;Examples&quot;
           section.

           To disable features that accept parameters (are configurable), you
           need to set this element to empty list i.e.  [].

       override
           If this field has a true value then the given feature is
           overriddable, which means that it can be configured (or
           enabled/disabled) on a per-repository basis.

           Usually given &quot;&lt;feature&gt;&quot; is configurable via the gitweb.&lt;feature&gt;
           config variable in the per-repository git configuration file.

           Note that no feature is overriddable by default.

       sub
           Internal detail of implementation. What is important is that if this
           field is not present then per-repository override for given feature
           is not supported.

           You wouldn&#8217;t need to ever change it in gitweb config file.

   Features in %feature
       The gitweb features that are configurable via %feature hash are listed
       below. This should be a complete list, but ultimately the authoritative
       and complete list is in gitweb.cgi source code, with features described
       in the comments.

       blame
           Enable the &quot;blame&quot; and &quot;blame_incremental&quot; blob views, showing for
           each line the last commit that modified it; see git-blame(1). This
           can be very CPU-intensive and is therefore disabled by default.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.blame configuration variable (boolean).

       snapshot
           Enable and configure the &quot;snapshot&quot; action, which allows user to
           download a compressed archive of any tree or commit, as produced by
           git-archive(1) and possibly additionally compressed. This can
           potentially generate high traffic if you have large project.

           The value of &apos;default&apos; is a list of names of snapshot formats,
           defined in %known_snapshot_formats hash, that you wish to offer.
           Supported formats include &quot;tgz&quot;, &quot;tbz2&quot;, &quot;txz&quot; (gzip/bzip2/xz
           compressed tar archive) and &quot;zip&quot;; please consult gitweb sources for
           a definitive list. By default only &quot;tgz&quot; is offered.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.blame configuration variable, which contains a
           comma separated list of formats or &quot;none&quot; to disable snapshots.
           Unknown values are ignored.

       grep
           Enable grep search, which lists the files in currently selected tree
           (directory) containing the given string; see git-grep(1). This can be
           potentially CPU-intensive, of course. Enabled by default.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.grep configuration variable (boolean).

       pickaxe
           Enable the so called pickaxe search, which will list the commits that
           introduced or removed a given string in a file. This can be practical
           and quite faster alternative to &quot;blame&quot; action, but it is still
           potentially CPU-intensive. Enabled by default.

           The pickaxe search is described in git-log(1) (the description of
           -S&lt;string&gt; option, which refers to pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore(7)
           for more details).

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis by setting
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.pickaxe configuration variable (boolean).

       show-sizes
           Enable showing size of blobs (ordinary files) in a &quot;tree&quot; view, in a
           separate column, similar to what ls -l does; see description of -l
           option in git-ls-tree(1) manpage. This costs a bit of I/O. Enabled by
           default.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.showsizes configuration variable (boolean).

       patches
           Enable and configure &quot;patches&quot; view, which displays list of commits
           in email (plain text) output format; see also git-format-patch(1).
           The value is the maximum number of patches in a patchset generated in
           &quot;patches&quot; view. Set the default field to a list containing single
           item of or to an empty list to disable patch view, or to a list
           containing a single negative number to remove any limit. Default
           value is 16.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.patches configuration variable (integer).

       avatar
           Avatar support. When this feature is enabled, views such as
           &quot;shortlog&quot; or &quot;commit&quot; will display an avatar associated with the
           email of each committer and author.

           Currently available providers are &quot;gravatar&quot; and &quot;picon&quot;. Only one
           provider at a time can be selected (default is one element list). If
           an unknown provider is specified, the feature is disabled.  Note that
           some providers might require extra Perl packages to be installed; see
           gitweb/INSTALL for more details.
&#12;           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.avatar configuration variable.

           See also %avatar_size with pixel sizes for icons and avatars
           (&quot;default&quot; is used for one-line like &quot;log&quot; and &quot;shortlog&quot;, &quot;double&quot;
           is used for two-line like &quot;commit&quot;, &quot;commitdiff&quot; or &quot;tag&quot;). If the
           default font sizes or lineheights are changed (e.g. via adding extra
           CSS stylesheet in @stylesheets), it may be appropriate to change
           these values.

       highlight
           Server-side syntax highlight support in &quot;blob&quot; view. It requires
           $highlight_bin program to be available (see the description of this
           variable in the &quot;Configuration variables&quot; section above), and
           therefore is disabled by default.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.highlight configuration variable (boolean).

       remote_heads
           Enable displaying remote heads (remote-tracking branches) in the
           &quot;heads&quot; list. In most cases the list of remote-tracking branches is
           an unnecessary internal private detail, and this feature is therefore
           disabled by default.  git-instaweb(1), which is usually used to
           browse local repositories, enables and uses this feature.

           This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
           repository&#8217;s gitweb.remote_heads configuration variable (boolean).

       The remaining features cannot be overridden on a per project basis.

       search
           Enable text search, which will list the commits which match author,
           committer or commit text to a given string; see the description of
           --author, --committer and --grep options in git-log(1) manpage.
           Enabled by default.

           Project specific override is not supported.

       forks
           If this feature is enabled, gitweb considers projects in
           subdirectories of project root (basename) to be forks of existing
           projects. For each project $projname.git, projects in the $projname/
           directory and its subdirectories will not be shown in the main
           projects list. Instead, a &apos;+&apos; mark is shown next to $projname, which
           links to a &quot;forks&quot; view that lists all the forks (all projects in
           $projname/ subdirectory). Additionally a &quot;forks&quot; view for a project
           is linked from project summary page.

           If the project list is taken from a file ($projects_list points to a
           file), forks are only recognized if they are listed after the main
           project in that file.

           Project specific override is not supported.

       actions
           Insert custom links to the action bar of all project pages. This
           allows you to link to third-party scripts integrating into gitweb.

           The &quot;default&quot; value consists of a list of triplets in the form
           &#8216;(&quot;&lt;label&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;link&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;position&gt;&quot;)` where &quot;position&quot; is the label
           after which to insert the link, &quot;link&quot; is a format string where %n
           expands to the project name, %f to the project path within the
           filesystem (i.e. &quot;$projectroot/$project&quot;), %h to the current hash
           (&apos;h&#8217; gitweb parameter) and &#8216;%b` to the current hash base (&apos;hb&#8217; gitweb
           parameter); &#8216;%%` expands to &apos;%&#8217;.

           For example, at the time this page was written, the http://repo.or.cz
           git hosting site set it to the following to enable graphical log
           (using the third party tool git-browser):

               $feature{&apos;actions&apos;}{&apos;default&apos;} =
                       [ (&apos;graphiclog&apos;, &apos;/git-browser/by-commit.html?r=%n&apos;, &apos;summary&apos;)];

           This adds a link titled &quot;graphiclog&quot; after the &quot;summary&quot; link,
           leading to git-browser script, passing r=&lt;project&gt; as a query
           parameter.

           Project specific override is not supported.

       timed
           Enable displaying how much time and how many git commands it took to
           generate and display each page in the page footer (at the bottom of
           page). For example the footer might contain: &quot;This page took 6.53325
           seconds and 13 git commands to generate.&quot; Disabled by default.

           Project specific override is not supported.

       javascript-timezone
           Enable and configure the ability to change a common timezone for
           dates in gitweb output via JavaScript. Dates in gitweb output include
           authordate and committerdate in &quot;commit&quot;, &quot;commitdiff&quot; and &quot;log&quot;
           views, and taggerdate in &quot;tag&quot; view. Enabled by default.

           The value is a list of three values: a default timezone (for if the
           client hasn&#8217;t selected some other timezone and saved it in a cookie),
           a name of cookie where to store selected timezone, and a CSS class
           used to mark up dates for manipulation. If you want to turn this
           feature off, set &quot;default&quot; to empty list: [].

           Typical gitweb config files will only change starting (default)
           timezone, and leave other elements at their default values:

               $feature{&apos;javascript-timezone&apos;}{&apos;default&apos;}[0] = &quot;utc&quot;;

           The example configuration presented here is guaranteed to be
           backwards and forward compatible.

           Timezone values can be &quot;local&quot; (for local timezone that browser
           uses), &quot;utc&quot; (what gitweb uses when JavaScript or this feature is
           disabled), or numerical timezones in the form of &quot;+/-HHMM&quot;, such as
           &quot;+0200&quot;.

           Project specific override is not supported.

EXAMPLES
       To enable blame, pickaxe search, and snapshot support (allowing &quot;tar.gz&quot;
       and &quot;zip&quot; snapshots), while allowing individual projects to turn them
       off, put the following in your GITWEB_CONFIG file:

           $feature{&apos;blame&apos;}{&apos;default&apos;} = [1];
           $feature{&apos;blame&apos;}{&apos;override&apos;} = 1;

           $feature{&apos;pickaxe&apos;}{&apos;default&apos;} = [1];
           $feature{&apos;pickaxe&apos;}{&apos;override&apos;} = 1;

           $feature{&apos;snapshot&apos;}{&apos;default&apos;} = [&apos;zip&apos;, &apos;tgz&apos;];
           $feature{&apos;snapshot&apos;}{&apos;override&apos;} = 1;

       If you allow overriding for the snapshot feature, you can specify which
       snapshot formats are globally disabled. You can also add any command line
       options you want (such as setting the compression level). For instance,
       you can disable Zip compressed snapshots and set gzip(1) to run at level
       6 by adding the following lines to your gitweb configuration file:

           $known_snapshot_formats{&apos;zip&apos;}{&apos;disabled&apos;} = 1;
           $known_snapshot_formats{&apos;tgz&apos;}{&apos;compressor&apos;} = [&apos;gzip&apos;,&apos;-6&apos;];

ENVIRONMENT
       The location of per-instance and system-wide configuration files can be
       overridden using the following environment variables:

       GITWEB_CONFIG
           Sets location of per-instance configuration file.

       GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM
           Sets location of fallback system-wide configuration file. This file
           is read only if per-instance one does not exist.

       GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON
           Sets location of common system-wide configuration file.

FILES
       gitweb_config.perl
           This is default name of per-instance configuration file. The format
           of this file is described above.

       /etc/gitweb.conf
           This is default name of fallback system-wide configuration file. This
           file is used only if per-instance configuration variable is not
           found.

       /etc/gitweb-common.conf
           This is default name of common system-wide configuration file.
