GKSU(1)                           User Commands                          GKSU(1)



NAME
       gksu - GTK+ frontend for su and sudo

SYNOPSIS
       gksu

       gksu [-u &lt;user&gt;] [options] &lt;command&gt;

       gksudo [-u &lt;user&gt;] [options] &lt;command&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly gksu and gksudo

       gksu is a frontend to su and gksudo is a frontend to sudo.  Their primary
       purpose is to run graphical commands that need root without the  need  to
       run an X terminal emulator and using su directly.

       Notice  that  all  the  magic is done by the underlying library, libgksu.
       Also notice that the library will decide if it should use su or  sudo  as
       backend  using  the  /apps/gksu/sudo-mode gconf key, if you call the gksu
       command. You can force the backend by using the  gksudo  command,  or  by
       using the --sudo-mode and --su-mode options.

       If no command is given, the gksu program will display a small window that
       allows you to type in a command to be run, and to select  what  user  the
       program  should  be run as. The other options are disregarded, right now,
       in this mode.

OPTIONS
       --debug, -d

              Print information on the screen that might be useful for  diagnos&#8208;
              ing and/or solving problems.

       --user &lt;user&gt;, -u &lt;user&gt;

              Call &lt;command&gt; as the specified user.

       --disable-grab, -g

              Disable  the  &quot;locking&quot;  of the keyboard, mouse, and focus done by
              the program when asking for password.

       --prompt, -P

              Ask the user if they want to have their keyboard and mouse grabbed
              before doing so.

       --preserve-env, -k

              Preserve  the  current environments, does not set $HOME nor $PATH,
              for example.

       --login, -l

              Make this a login shell. Beware this may cause problems  with  the
              Xauthority  magic. Run xhost to allow the target user to open win&#8208;
              dows on your display!

       --description &lt;description|file&gt;, -D &lt;description|file&gt;

              Provide a descriptive name for the  command  to  be  used  in  the
              default  message, making it nicer.  You can also provide the abso&#8208;
              lute path for a .desktop file. The Name key for will  be  used  in
              this case.

       --message &lt;message&gt;, -m &lt;message&gt;

              Replace  the  standard  message  shown to ask for password for the
              argument passed to the option.  Only  use  this  if  --description
              does not suffice.

       --print-pass, -p

              Ask  gksu  to print the password to stdout, just like ssh-askpass.
              Useful to use in scripts with programs that accept  receiving  the
              password on stdin.

       --su-mode, -w

              Force gksu to use su(1) as its backend for running the programs.

       --sudo-mode, -S

              Force gksu to use sudo(1) as its backend for running the programs.
