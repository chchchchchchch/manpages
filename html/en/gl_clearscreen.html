AUTHOR
       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. The exact source of the referenced demo  as  well  as  of  the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
