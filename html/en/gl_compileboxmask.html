gl_compileboxmask(3)           Svgalib User Manual          gl_compileboxmask(3)



NAME
       gl_compileboxmask - compress a masked bitmap


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_compileboxmask(int w, int h, void *sdp, void *ddp);


DESCRIPTION
       Convert  the  rectangular  masked  bitmap of size (w, h) at sdp to a com&#8208;
       pressed format that allows faster drawing, which is stored at ddp.  Allo&#8208;
       cating  w  * h bytes for the compiled version is usually enough; an upper
       limit should be (w + 2) * h.

       Compiled bitmaps are only supported in linear 256 color modes.
