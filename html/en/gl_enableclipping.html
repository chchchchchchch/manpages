gl_enableclipping(3)           Svgalib User Manual          gl_enableclipping(3)



NAME
       gl_enableclipping - enables clipping


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_enableclipping(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Enable automatic clipping in most functions. No, I don&apos;t know which ones.
       However, it works for most.  gl_copybox(3) is report to do no clipping.

       Go figure.
