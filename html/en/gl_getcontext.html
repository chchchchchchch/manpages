gl_getcontext(3)               Svgalib User Manual              gl_getcontext(3)



NAME
       gl_getcontext, currentcontext - get the current graphics contents.


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_getcontext(GraphicsContext *gc);

       extern GraphicsContext currentcontext; /* this is already in vgagl.h */


DESCRIPTION
       Save the current context in the structure variable gc.

       You can also get the current context from the global variable currentcon&#8208;
       text;

       However, simply access single elements in this structure with the  macros
       given  in  vgagl(7)  but do not copy currentcontext in another structure.
       This is because the size of the structure might change and  your  program
       does  not  know  it  when it will be linked dynamically to future svgalib
       versions.

       Instead use gl_allocatecontext(3) to allocate such a structure,  fill  it
       with gl_getcontext and release it with free(3) after usage.
