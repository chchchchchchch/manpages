gl_line(3)                     Svgalib User Manual                    gl_line(3)



NAME
       gl_line - draw a line


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_line(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int c);


DESCRIPTION
       Draw a line from point (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) inclusively in color c.

       You  should  not assume that the same drawing trajectory is used when you
       exchange start and end points.

       To use this program one first sets up a mode with a  regular  vga_setmode
       call  and  vga_setpage(0),  with possibly a vga_setlinearaddressing call.
       Then a call to gl_setcontextvga(mode) is made.  This makes  the  informa&#8208;
       tion about the mode available to gl_line.

       The  pixels are placed directly into video memory using inline coded com&#8208;
       mands.
