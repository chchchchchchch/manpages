gl_setcontextvga(3)            Svgalib User Manual           gl_setcontextvga(3)



NAME
       gl_setcontextvga - set the context to the physical screen


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       int gl_setcontextvga(int mode);


DESCRIPTION
       Set the graphics context to the physical screen of a vga mode (as defined
       in vga_setmode(3)).  The mode must be set with  vga_setmode(3)  prior  to
       using any of the drawing functions.  vgagl does not take care of that.

       The  function  returns 0 for success and non-zero if the mode is not sup&#8208;
       ported by the hardware.

       The only thing you can do with a planar (mode X-like) 256 color  mode  is
       aligned gl_putbox, and use it as a target for gl_copyscreen.

       In all of the svga modes this program makes a description of the vga mode
       available to the vgagl functions.  The 256 color  svgamodes  are  handled
       properly by this program.
