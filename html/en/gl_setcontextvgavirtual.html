gl_setcontextvgavirtual(3)     Svgalib User Manual    gl_setcontextvgavirtual(3)



NAME
       gl_setcontextvgavirtual - set the context to a virtual mode


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       int gl_setcontextvgavirtual(int mode);


DESCRIPTION
       Allocate a virtual screen in system memory identical to the graphics mode
       (as defined in vga_setmode(3)), and make that the current  graphics  con&#8208;
       text.

       The  function  returns 0 for success and non-zero if the mode is not sup&#8208;
       ported by the hardware.

       The only thing you can do with a planar (mode X-like) 256 color  mode  is
       aligned gl_putbox, and use it as a target for gl_copyscreen.
