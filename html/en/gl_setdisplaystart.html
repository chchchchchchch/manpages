gl_setdisplaystart(3)          Svgalib User Manual         gl_setdisplaystart(3)



NAME
       gl_setdisplaystart - set the start of the screen are displayed


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       vga gl_setdisplaystart(int x, int y);


DESCRIPTION
       Set the physical display start address to the pixel at (x, y).

       Can  be  used for hardware scrolling, or for page flipping (e.g.  setdis&#8208;
       playstart(0, HEIGHT) displays from the second page). Make sure the  scan&#8208;
       line  width  (BYTEWIDTH) in bytes of the current context corresponds with
       the physical screen.

       Note also that the display start cannot be set  to  completely  arbitrary
       points, see vga_setdisplaystart(3).
