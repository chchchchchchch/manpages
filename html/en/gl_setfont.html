gl_setfont(3)                  Svgalib User Manual                 gl_setfont(3)



NAME
       gl_setfont - set the text font to be used


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_setfont(int fw, int fh, void *fp);


DESCRIPTION
       Use  the  font stored as character bitmaps at fp, with characters of size
       (fw, fh), as the basic font for write  operations.  Note  that  the  font
       included in the library must be expanded first, because it is stored bit-
       per-pixel; this is not required if the FONT_COMPRESSED gl_setwritemode(3)
       flag is set.

       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
