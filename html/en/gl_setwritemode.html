gl_setwritemode(3)             Svgalib User Manual            gl_setwritemode(3)



NAME
       gl_setwritemode - set the font writemode flags


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_setwritemode(int m);


DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  writemode  flags  for the font routines. It must be the sum of
       exactly one choice out of the following two groups:

       WRITEMODE_MASKED
       WRITEMODE_OVERWRITE (default)
              If WRITEMODE_MASKED is set, only foreground pixels of the font are
              used for write operations; the screen background is not erased.


       FONT_COMPRESSED
       FONT_EXPANDED (default)
              If  FONT_COMPRESSED  is  set,  text writes will use the compressed
              bit-per-pixel font rather than the expanded font (which  would  be
              slightly faster).

AUTHOR
       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-

       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
