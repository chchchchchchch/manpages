gl_write(3)                    Svgalib User Manual                   gl_write(3)



NAME
       gl_write, gl_writen - write a text string


SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

       void gl_write(int x, int y, char *s);
       void gl_writen(int x, int y, int n ,char *s);


DESCRIPTION
       gl_write writes the zero terminated string s to position (x, y) using the
       currently selected font.

       gl_writen works similarly, but writes exactly n characters, thus allowing
       to use the character 0.

       The kind of text draw operation is set with gl_setwritemode(3).

       BEWARE!  Prior to the of use of gl_write(3) and gl_writen(3) you must set
       a font.

       A good default initialization sequence is:

       gl_setfont(8, 8, gl_font8x8);
       gl_setwritemode(FONT_COMPRESSED + WRITEMODE_OVERWRITE);
       gl_setfontcolors(0, vga_white());
