glblur(6x)                     XScreenSaver manual                    glblur(6x)



NAME
       glblur - 3D radial blur texture fields

SYNOPSIS
       glblur  [-display host:display.screen] [-visual visual] [-window] [-root]
       [-delay number] [-blursize number] [-no-wander] [-no-spin] [-spin  [XYZ]]
       [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program draws a box and a few line segments, and generates a radial
       blur outward from it.  This creates flowing field effects.

       This is done by rendering the scene into a small texture, then repeatedly
       rendering  increasingly-enlarged and increasingly-transparent versions of
       that texture onto the frame buffer.  As such, it&apos;s quite graphics  inten&#8208;
       sive: don&apos;t bother trying to run this if you don&apos;t have hardware-acceler&#8208;
       ated texture support.  It will hurt your machine bad.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  10000  (0.01  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -blursize number
               How  many  copies  of  the  scene should be laid down to make the
               vapor  trail.   Default:  15.   Larger  numbers  create  smoother
               fields, but are slower.

       -wander | -no-wander
               Whether the object should wander around the screen.

       -spin [XYZ]
               Around which axes should the object spin?

       -no-spin
               None.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
