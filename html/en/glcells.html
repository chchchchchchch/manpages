DESCRIPTION
       The glcells program draws cells that divide exponentially, eat and  even&#8208;
       tually die.

OPTIONS
       glcells accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -pause num
               Specifies  the  pause at the end of the animation (all cells dead
               or maximum amount of cells reached). Unit is in  frames,  default
               20.

       -maxcells num
               Specifies  the maximum number of cells on screen (dead cells also
               count, even if invisible). Default is 800.

       -radius num
               Specifies the radius of the cells. Default is 40.

       -seeds num
               Specifies the number of cells when animation starts.  Default  is
               1.

       -quality num
               Specifies  subdivision  quality  of  the spheres used to draw the
               cells [0...5]. Default is 3.

       -minfood num
               Food is ditributed randomly on the screen (Yes, the cells need to
               eat).  This  parameter  specifies  the minimum amount of food per
               pixel. Default is 5.

       -maxfood num
               Food is ditributed randomly on the screen (Yes, the cells need to
               eat).  This  parameter  specifies  the maximum amount of food per
               pixel. Default is 20.

       -divideage num
               Specifies the minimum age in frames a cell needs to  have  before
               beeing able to divide. Default is 20
&#12;       -mindist num
               Specifies the minimum distance between cells. Default 1.4

       -delay num
               How long to pause between frames.  Default is 20000, or 0.02 sec&#8208;
               ond.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -wireframe
               Draw wireframe only.

       -keepold
               Dead cells stay on screen.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
