GLIB-COMPILE-RESOU(1)             User Commands            GLIB-COMPILE-RESOU(1)



NAME
       glib-compile-resources - GLib resource compiler

SYNOPSIS
       glib-compile-resources [option...] {file}

DESCRIPTION
       glib-compile-resources reads the resource description from file and the
       files that it references and creates a binary resource bundle that is
       suitable for use with the GResource API. The resulting bundle is then
       written out as-is, or as C source for linking into an application.

       The XML resource files normally have the filename extension
       .gresource.xml. For a detailed description of the XML file format, see
       the GResource documentation.

   Options
       -h, --help
           Print help and exit

       --target=TARGETFILE
           Store the compiled resources in TARGETFILE. If not specified a
           filename based on the file basename is used.

       --sourcedir
           The files references in file are loaded from this directory. If not
           specified the current directory is used.

       --generate
           Write the output file in the format selected for by its filename
           extension:

           .c
               C source

           .h
               C header

           .gresource
               resource bundle


       --generate-source
           Instead of a writing the resource bundle in binary form create a C
           source file that contains the resource bundle. This can then be
           compiled into an application for easy access.

       --generate-header
           Generate a header file for use with C code generated by
           --generate-source.

       --generate-dependencies
           Prints the list of files that the resource bundle references to
           standard output. This can be used to track dependencies in the build
           system. For example, the following make rule would mark
           test.gresource as depending on all the files that test.gresource.xml
           includes, so that is is automatically rebuilt if any of them change:

               test.gresource: test.gresource.xml $(shell $(GLIB_COMPILE_RESOURCES) --generate-dependencies test.gresource.xml)

           Note that this may or may not be portable to non-GNU make.
&#12;       --c-name
           Specify the prefix used for the C identifiers in the code generated
           by --generate-source and --generate-headers.

       --manual-register
           By default code generated by --generate-source uses automatic
           initialization of the resource. This works on most systems by using
           the compiler support for constructors. However, some (uncommon)
           compilers may not support this, you can then specify
           --manual-register, which will generate custom register and unregister
           functions that your code can manually call at initialization and
           uninitialization time.

   Environment Variables
       XMLLINT
           The full path to the xmllint executable. This is used to preprocess
           resources with the xml-stripblanks preprocessing option. If this
           environment variable is not set, xmllint is searched in the PATH.

       GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA
           The full path to the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata executable. This is used to
           preprocess resources with the to-pixdata preprocessing option. If
           this environment variable is not set, gdk-pixbuf-pixdata is searched
           in the PATH.
