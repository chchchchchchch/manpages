GLIB-COMPILE-SCHEM(1)             User Commands            GLIB-COMPILE-SCHEM(1)



NAME
       glib-compile-schemas - GSettings schema compiler

SYNOPSIS
       glib-compile-schemas [option...] {directory}

DESCRIPTION
       glib-compile-schemas compiles all the GSettings XML schema files in
       directory into a binary file with the name gschemas.compiled that can be
       used by GSettings. The XML schema files must have the filename extension
       .gschema.xml. For a detailed description of the XML file format, see the
       GSettings documentation.

       At runtime, GSettings looks for schemas in the glib-2.0/schemas
       subdirectories of all directories specified in the XDG_DATA_DIRS
       environment variable. The usual location to install schema files is
       /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas.

       In addition to schema files, glib-compile-schemas reads &apos;vendor override&apos;
       files, which are key files that can override default values for keys in
       the schemas. The group names in the key files are the schema id, and the
       values are written in serialized GVariant form. Vendor override files
       must have the filename extension .gschema.override.

       By convention, vendor override files begin with nn_ where nn is a number
       from 00 to 99. Higher numbered files have higher priority (eg: if the
       same override is made in a file numbered 10 and then again in a file
       numbered 20, the override from 20 will take precedence).

   Options
       -h, --help
           Print help and exit

       --targetdir=TARGETDIR
           Store gschemas.compiled in TARGETDIR instead of directory.

       --dry-run
           Don&apos;t write gschemas.compiled. This option can be used to check
           .gschema.xml sources for errors.

       --allow-any-name
           Do not enforce restrictions on key names. Note that this option is
           purely to facility the transition from GConf, and will be removed at
           some time in the future.
