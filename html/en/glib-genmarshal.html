NAME
       glib-genmarshal - C code marshaller generation utility for GLib closures

SYNOPSIS
       glib-genmarshal [options...] [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       glib-genmarshal is a small utility that generates C code marshallers for
       callback functions of the GClosure mechanism in the GObject sublibrary of
       GLib. The marshaller functions have a standard signature, they get passed
       in the invoking closure, an array of value structures holding the
       callback function parameters and a value structure for the return value
       of the callback. The marshaller is then responsible to call the
       respective C code function of the closure with all the parameters on the
       stack and to collect its return value.

INVOCATION
       glib-genmarshal takes a list of marshallers to generate as input. The
       marshaller list is either read from standard input or from files passed
       as additional arguments on the command line.

   Options
       --header
           Generate header file contents of the marshallers.

       --body
           Generate C code file contents of the marshallers.

       --prefix=string, --prefix string
           Specify marshaller prefix. The default prefix is
           `g_cclosure_marshal&apos;.

       --skip-source
           Skip source location remarks in generated comments.

       --nostdinc
           Do not use the standard marshallers of the GObject library, and skip
           gmarshal.h include directive in generated header files.

       --internal
           Mark generated functions as internal, using G_GNUC_INTERNAL.

       --valist-marshallers
           Generate valist marshallers, for use with
           g_signal_set_va_marshaller().

       -v, --version
           Print version information.

       --g-fatal-warnings
           Make warnings fatal, that is, exit immediately once a warning occurs.

       -h, --help
           Print brief help and exit.

       -v, --version
           Print version and exit.

   Marshaller list format
       The marshaller lists are processed line by line, a line can contain a
       comment in the form of
&#12;           # this is a comment

       or a marshaller specification of the form

           RTYPE:PTYPE
           RTYPE:PTYPE,PTYPE
           RTYPE:PTYPE,PTYPE,PTYPE

       (up to 16 PTYPEs may be present).

       The RTYPE part specifies the callback&apos;s return type and the PTYPEs right
       to the colon specify the callback&apos;s parameter list, except for the first
       and the last arguments which are always pointers.

   Parameter types
       Currently, the following types are supported:

       VOID
           indicates no return type, or no extra parameters. If VOID is used as
           the parameter list, no additional parameters may be present.

       BOOLEAN
           for boolean types (gboolean)

       CHAR
           for signed char types (gchar)

       UCHAR
           for unsigned char types (guchar)

       INT
           for signed integer types (gint)

       UINT
           for unsigned integer types (guint)

       LONG
           for signed long integer types (glong)

       ULONG
           for unsigned long integer types (gulong)

       INT64
           for signed 64bit integer types (gint64)

       UINT64
           for unsigned 64bit integer types (guint64)

       ENUM
           for enumeration types (gint)

       FLAGS
           for flag enumeration types (guint)

       FLOAT
           for single-precision float types (gfloat)

       DOUBLE
           for double-precision float types (gdouble)

       STRING
           for string types (gchar*)

       BOXED
           for boxed (anonymous but reference counted) types (GBoxed*)
&#12;       PARAM
           for GParamSpec or derived types (GParamSpec*)

       POINTER
           for anonymous pointer types (gpointer)

       OBJECT
           for GObject or derived types (GObject*)

       VARIANT
           for GVariant types (GVariant*)

       NONE
           deprecated alias for VOID

       BOOL
           deprecated alias for BOOLEAN

EXAMPLE
       To generate marshallers for the following callback functions:

           void   foo (gpointer data1,
                       gpointer data2);
           void   bar (gpointer data1,
                       gint     param1,
                       gpointer data2);
           gfloat baz (gpointer data1,
                       gboolean param1,
                       guchar   param2,
                       gpointer data2);

       The marshaller list has to look like this:

           VOID:VOID
           VOID:INT
           FLOAT:BOOLEAN,UCHAR

       The generated marshallers have the arguments encoded in their function
       name. For this particular list, they are

           g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__VOID(),
           g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__INT(),
           g_cclosure_marshal_FLOAT__BOOLEAN_UCHAR().

       They can be used directly for GClosures or be passed in as the
       GSignalCMarshaller c_marshaller; argument upon creation of signals:

           GClosure *cc_foo, *cc_bar, *cc_baz;

           cc_foo = g_cclosure_new (NULL, foo, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_foo, g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__VOID);
           cc_bar = g_cclosure_new (NULL, bar, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_bar, g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__INT);
           cc_baz = g_cclosure_new (NULL, baz, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_baz, g_cclosure_marshal_FLOAT__BOOLEAN_UCHAR);
