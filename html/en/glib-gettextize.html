GLIB-GETTEXTIZE(1)                User Commands               GLIB-GETTEXTIZE(1)



NAME
       glib-gettextize - gettext internationalization utility

SYNOPSIS
       glib-gettextize [option...] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       glib-gettextize helps to prepare a source package for being
       internationalized through gettext. It is a variant of the gettextize that
       ships with gettext.

       glib-gettextize differs from gettextize in that it doesn&apos;t create an
       intl/ subdirectory and doesn&apos;t modify po/ChangeLog (note that newer
       versions of gettextize behave like this when called with the
       --no-changelog option).

   Options
       --help
           print help and exit

       --version
           print version information and exit

       -c, --copy
           copy files instead of making symlinks

       -f, --force
           force writing of new files even if old ones exist
