GLIB-MKENUMS(1)                   User Commands                  GLIB-MKENUMS(1)



NAME
       glib-mkenums - C language enum description generation utility

SYNOPSIS
       glib-mkenums [options...] [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       glib-mkenums is a small perl-script utility that parses C code to extract
       enum definitions and produces enum descriptions based on text templates
       specified by the user. Most frequently this script is used to produce C
       code that contains enum values as strings so programs can provide value
       name strings for introspection.

INVOCATION
       glib-mkenums takes a list of valid C code files as input. The options
       specified control the text that is output, certain substitutions are
       performed on the text templates for keywords enclosed in @ characters.

   Options
       --fhead text
           Put out text prior to processing input files.

       --fprod text
           Put out text everytime a new input file is being processed.

       --ftail text
           Put out text after all input files have been processed.

       --eprod text
           Put out text everytime an enum is encountered in the input files.

       --vhead text
           Put out text before iterating over the set of values of an enum.

       --vprod text
           Put out text for every value of an enum.

       --vtail text
           Put out text after iterating over all values of an enum.

       --comments text
           Template for auto-generated comments, the default (for C code
           generations) is &quot;/* @comment@ */&quot;.

       --template file
           Read templates from the given file. The templates are enclosed in
           specially-formatted C comments

               /*** BEGIN section ***/
               /*** END section ***/

           where section may be file-header, file-production, file-tail,
           enumeration-production, value-header, value-production, value-tail or
           comment.

       --identifier-prefix prefix
           Indicates what portion of the enum name should be intepreted as the
           prefix (eg, the &quot;Gtk&quot; in &quot;GtkDirectionType&quot;). Normally this will be
           figured out automatically, but you may need to override the default
           if your namespace is capitalized oddly.

       --symbol-prefix prefix
           Indicates what prefix should be used to correspond to the identifier
           prefix in related C function names (eg, the &quot;gtk&quot; in
           &quot;gtk_direction_type_get_type&quot;. Equivalently, this is the lowercase
           version of the prefix component of the enum value names (eg, the
           &quot;GTK&quot; in &quot;GTK_DIR_UP&quot;. The default value is the identifier prefix,
           converted to lowercase.

       --help
           Print brief help and exit.

       --version
           Print version and exit.

   Production text substitutions
       Certain keywords enclosed in @ characters will be substituted in the
       emitted text. For the substitution examples of the keywords below, the
       following example enum definition is assumed:

           typedef enum
           {
             PREFIX_THE_XVALUE    = 1 &lt;&lt; 3,
             PREFIX_ANOTHER_VALUE = 1 &lt;&lt; 4
           } PrefixTheXEnum;

       @EnumName@
           The name of the enum currently being processed, enum names are
           assumed to be properly namespaced and to use mixed capitalization to
           separate words (e.g. PrefixTheXEnum).

       @enum_name@
           The enum name with words lowercase and word-separated by underscores
           (e.g. prefix_the_xenum).

       @ENUMNAME@
           The enum name with words uppercase and word-separated by underscores
           (e.g. PREFIX_THE_XENUM).

       @ENUMSHORT@
           The enum name with words uppercase and word-separated by underscores,
           prefix stripped (e.g. THE_XENUM).

       @VALUENAME@
           The enum value name currently being processed with words uppercase
           and word-separated by underscores, this is the assumed literal
           notation of enum values in the C sources (e.g. PREFIX_THE_XVALUE).

       @valuenick@
           A nick name for the enum value currently being processed, this is
           usually generated by stripping common prefix words of all the enum
           values of the current enum, the words are lowercase and underscores
           are substituted by a minus (e.g. the-xvalue).

       @valuenum@
           The integer value for the enum value currently being processed. This
           is calculated by using perl to attempt to evaluate the expression as
           it appears in the C source code. If evaluation fails then
           glib-mkenums will exit with an error status, but this only happens if
           @valuenum@ appears in your value production template. (Since: 2.26)

       @type@
           This is substituted either by &quot;enum&quot; or &quot;flags&quot;, depending on whether
           the enum value definitions contained bit-shift operators or not (e.g.
           flags).

       @Type@
           The same as @type@ with the first letter capitalized (e.g. Flags).

       @TYPE@
           The same as @type@ with all letters uppercased (e.g. FLAGS).

       @filename@
           The name of the input file currently being processed (e.g. foo.h).

       @basename@
           The base name of the input file currently being processed (e.g.
           foo.h). (Since: 2.22)

   Trigraph extensions
       Some C comments are treated specially in the parsed enum definitions,
       such comments start out with the trigraph sequence /*&lt; and end with the
       trigraph sequence &gt;*/. Per enum definition, the options &quot;skip&quot; and
       &quot;flags&quot; can be specified, to indicate this enum definition to be skipped,
       or for it to be treated as a flags definition, or to specify the common
       prefix to be stripped from all values to generate value nicknames,
       respectively. The &quot;underscore_name&quot; option can be used to specify the
       word separation used in the *_get_type() function. For instance, /*&lt;
       underscore_name=gnome_vfs_uri_hide_options &gt;*/.

       Per value definition, the options &quot;skip&quot; and &quot;nick&quot; are supported. The
       former causes the value to be skipped, and the latter can be used to
       specify the otherwise auto-generated nickname. Examples:

           typedef enum /*&lt; skip &gt;*/
           {
             PREFIX_FOO
           } PrefixThisEnumWillBeSkipped;
           typedef enum /*&lt; flags,prefix=PREFIX &gt;*/
           {
             PREFIX_THE_ZEROTH_VALUE,    /*&lt; skip &gt;*/
             PREFIX_THE_FIRST_VALUE,
             PREFIX_THE_SECOND_VALUE,
             PREFIX_THE_THIRD_VALUE,     /*&lt; nick=the-last-value &gt;*/
           } PrefixTheFlagsEnum;
