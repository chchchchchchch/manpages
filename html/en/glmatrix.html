NAME
       glmatrix - simulates the title sequence effect of the movie

SYNOPSIS
       glmatrix  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-window]  [-root]  [-install]
       [-visual visual] [-delay usecs] [-speed ratio] [-density  pct]  [-no-fog]
       [-no-waves]   [-no-rotate]   [-binary]   [-hexadecimal]  [-dna]  [-clock]
       [-timefmt fmt] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The glmatrix program draws the 3D &quot;digital rain&quot; effect, as seen  in  the
       title sequence of the Wachowski brothers&apos; film, &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

       Also  see  xmatrix(6x)  for  a  2D  rendering  of the similar effect that
       appeared on the computer monitors actually in the movie.

OPTIONS
       glmatrix accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -delay usecs
               The delay between  frames  of  the  animation,  in  microseconds:
               default 30000.

       -speed ratio
               How fast the glyphs should move; default 1.0.  2.0 means twice as
               fast, 0.5 means half as fast.

       -density percentage
               The approximate percentage of the screen that  should  be  filled
               with characters at any given time.  Default 20%.

       -no-fog By  default,  glyphs  are dimmer the farther away they are.  This
               argument disables that.

       -no-waves
               By default, waves of color roll down the columns of glyphs.  This
               argument disables that.

       -no-rotate
               By  default,  the  scene slowly tilts and rotates.  This argument
               disables that.

       -binary Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, only display ones and zeros.

       -hexadecimal
               Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, display hexadecimal digits.

       -dna    Instead of displaying Matrix glyphs, display genetic  code  (gua&#8208;
               nine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine.)
&#12;       -clock  Hide a clock displaying the current time somewhere in the glyphs.

       -timefmt strftime-string
               How  to  format  the  clock  when  -clock  is specified.  Default
               &quot; %l%M%p &quot;.

       -speed ratio
               Less than 1 for slower, greater than 1 for faster.  Default 1.

       -wireframe
               Just draw boxes instead of textured characters.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
