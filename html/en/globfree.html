GLOB(3)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    GLOB(3)



NAME
       glob,  globfree  -  find  pathnames  matching a pattern, free memory from
       glob()

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;glob.h&gt;

       int glob(const char *pattern, int flags,
                int (*errfunc) (const char *epath, int eerrno),
                glob_t *pglob);
       void globfree(glob_t *pglob);

DESCRIPTION
       The glob() function searches  for  all  the  pathnames  matching  pattern
       according  to the rules used by the shell (see glob(7)).  No tilde expan&#8208;
       sion or parameter substitution is done; if  you  want  these,  use  word&#8208;
       exp(3).

       The  globfree()  function frees the dynamically allocated storage from an
       earlier call to glob().

       The results of a glob() call are stored in the structure  pointed  to  by
       pglob.   This  structure  is  of  type  glob_t (declared in &lt;glob.h&gt;) and
       includes the following elements defined by POSIX.2 (more may  be  present
       as an extension):

           typedef struct {
               size_t   gl_pathc;    /* Count of paths matched so far  */
               char   **gl_pathv;    /* List of matched pathnames.  */
               size_t   gl_offs;     /* Slots to reserve in gl_pathv.  */
           } glob_t;

       Results are stored in dynamically allocated storage.

       The  argument flags is made up of the bitwise OR of zero or more the fol&#8208;
       lowing symbolic constants, which modify the behavior of glob():

       GLOB_ERR
              Return upon a read error (because a directory does not  have  read
              permission,  for  example).   By default, glob() attempts carry on
              despite errors, reading all of the directories that it can.

       GLOB_MARK
              Append a slash to each path which corresponds to a directory.

       GLOB_NOSORT
              Don&apos;t sort the returned pathnames.  The only reason to do this  is
              to  save  processing time.  By default, the returned pathnames are
              sorted.

       GLOB_DOOFFS
              Reserve pglob-&gt;gl_offs slots at  the  beginning  of  the  list  of
              strings  in  pglob-&gt;pathv.  The reserved slots contain NULL point&#8208;
              ers.

       GLOB_NOCHECK
              If no pattern matches, return the original pattern.   By  default,
              glob() returns GLOB_NOMATCH if there are no matches.

       GLOB_APPEND
              Append  the results of this call to the vector of results returned
              by a previous call to glob().  Do not set this flag on  the  first
              invocation of glob().

       GLOB_NOESCAPE
              Don&apos;t  allow  backslash  (&apos;\&apos;)  to be used as an escape character.
              Normally, a backslash can be used to quote the  following  charac&#8208;
              ter,  providing  a  mechanism  to  turn  off  the  special meaning
              metacharacters.

       flags may also include any of the following, which are GNU extensions and
       not defined by POSIX.2:

       GLOB_PERIOD
              Allow  a  leading  period  to  be  matched  by metacharacters.  By
              default, metacharacters can&apos;t match a leading period.

       GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC
              Use alternative functions  pglob-&gt;gl_closedir,  pglob-&gt;gl_readdir,
              pglob-&gt;gl_opendir,  pglob-&gt;gl_lstat,  and  pglob-&gt;gl_stat for file
              system access instead of the normal library functions.

       GLOB_BRACE
              Expand csh(1) style brace expressions of the  form  {a,b}.   Brace
              expressions can be nested.  Thus, for example, specifying the pat&#8208;
              tern &quot;{foo/{,cat,dog},bar}&quot; would return the same results as  four
              separate  glob()  calls  using  the  strings:  &quot;foo/&quot;,  &quot;foo/cat&quot;,
              &quot;foo/dog&quot;, and &quot;bar&quot;.

       GLOB_NOMAGIC
              If the pattern  contains  no  metacharacters  then  it  should  be
              returned  as the sole matching word, even if there is no file with
              that name.

       GLOB_TILDE
              Carry out tilde expansion.  If a tilde (&apos;~&apos;) is the only character
              in  the  pattern, or an initial tilde is followed immediately by a
              slash (&apos;/&apos;), then the home directory of the caller is  substituted
              for  the  tilde.   If  an  initial tilde is followed by a username
              (e.g., &quot;~andrea/bin&quot;), then the tilde and username are substituted
              by  the  home directory of that user.  If the username is invalid,
              or the home directory cannot be determined, then  no  substitution
              is performed.

       GLOB_TILDE_CHECK
              This provides behavior similar to that of GLOB_TILDE.  The differ&#8208;
              ence is that if the username is invalid,  or  the  home  directory
              cannot  be determined, then instead of using the pattern itself as
              the name, glob() returns GLOB_NOMATCH to indicate an error.

       GLOB_ONLYDIR
              This is a hint to glob() that the caller  is  interested  only  in
              directories  that  match  the  pattern.  If the implementation can
              easily determine file-type information,  then  nondirectory  files
              are  not  returned  to the caller.  However, the caller must still
              check that returned files are directories.  (The purpose  of  this
              flag  is  merely to optimize performance when the caller is inter&#8208;
              ested only in directories.)

       If errfunc is not NULL, it will be called in case of an  error  with  the
       arguments  epath,  a  pointer  to  the path which failed, and eerrno, the
       value of errno as returned from one of the  calls  to  opendir(3),  read&#8208;
       dir(3),  or  stat(2).  If errfunc returns nonzero, or if GLOB_ERR is set,
       glob() will terminate after the call to errfunc.

       Upon successful return, pglob-&gt;gl_pathc contains the  number  of  matched
       pathnames  and pglob-&gt;gl_pathv contains a pointer to the list of pointers
       to matched pathnames.  The list of  pointers  is  terminated  by  a  NULL
       pointer.

       It  is  possible  to  call  glob()  several  times.   In  that  case, the
       GLOB_APPEND flag has to be set in flags on the second and  later  invoca&#8208;
       tions.

       As  a  GNU extension, pglob-&gt;gl_flags is set to the flags specified, ored
       with GLOB_MAGCHAR if any metacharacters were found.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, glob() returns zero.   Other  possible  returns
       are:

       GLOB_NOSPACE
              for running out of memory,

       GLOB_ABORTED
              for a read error, and

       GLOB_NOMATCH
              for no found matches.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  structure  elements  gl_pathc  and gl_offs are declared as size_t in
       glibc 2.1, as they should be according to POSIX.2, but  are  declared  as
       int in libc4, libc5 and glibc 2.0.

BUGS
       The glob() function may fail due to failure of underlying function calls,
       such as malloc(3) or opendir(3).  These will store their  error  code  in
       errno.

EXAMPLE
       One example of use is the following code, which simulates typing

           ls -l *.c ../*.c

       in the shell:

           glob_t globbuf;

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob(&quot;*.c&quot;, GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &amp;globbuf);
           glob(&quot;../*.c&quot;, GLOB_DOOFFS | GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &amp;globbuf);
           globbuf.gl_pathv[0] = &quot;ls&quot;;
           globbuf.gl_pathv[1] = &quot;-l&quot;;
           execvp(&quot;ls&quot;, &amp;globbuf.gl_pathv[0]);
