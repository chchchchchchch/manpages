NAME
       glschool - a 3D schooling simulation

SYNOPSIS
       glschool   [-display   host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual]  [-window]
       [-root] [-wireframe] [-fps] [-delay number] [-nfish number] [-maxvel num&#8208;
       ber]  [-minvel number] [-acclimit number] [-avoidfact number] [-matchfact
       number] [-centerfact number]  [-targetfact  number]  [-minradius  number]
       [-momentum  number]  [-distexp  number] [-goalchgf number] [-fog] [-draw&#8208;
       goal] [-drawbbox]

DESCRIPTION
       Uses Craig Reynolds Boids algorithm to simulate a 3d school of fish.  See
       &lt;http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids&gt;  for  a description of the algorithm and
       the original paper.  This is a lightly modified version of the  algorithm
       that supports goal attraction.

       Many  different  behaviors  are  possible by tweaking the parameters.  No
       sanity checking is performed on the command line params, so if  you  want
       to  use  negative  accelerations  or minimum velocity that is larger than
       maximum velocity or that sort of thing, the simulation will try to digest
       it.

       It  looks  best with the highest number of fish that will give you an FPS
       of &gt; 25 or so.


OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in microseconds.   Default:  20000  (0.020  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -wireframe | -no-wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -fog | -no-fog
                Whether to show foggy (cloudy) water.

       -drawgoal | -no-drawgoal
                Whether to show the school&apos;s attraction goal.

       -drawbbox | -no-drawbbox
                Whether to show the bounding box.

       -fog | -no-fog
                Whether to show foggy (cloudy) water.

       -nfish number
               Number of fish.  Defaults to 100

       -acclimit number
               Acceleration limit.  Defaults to 8.0
&#12;       -minvel number
               Minimum velocity.  Defaults to 1.0

       -maxvel number
               Minimum velocity.  Defaults to 7.0

       -goalchgf number
               Goal change frequency.  Defaults to 50 (frames)

       -avoidfact number
               Avoidance acceleration factor.  Defaults to 1.5

       -matchfact number
               Match avg velocity acceleration factor.  Defaults to 0.15

       -centerfact number
               School centering acceleration factor.  Defaults to 0.1

       -targetfact number
               Target attraction acceleration factor.  Defaults to 80

       -distexp number
               Distance weighting exponent.  Defaults to 2.2

       -momentum number
               Momentum.  Defaults to 0.9

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
