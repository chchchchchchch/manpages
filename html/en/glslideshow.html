NAME
       glslideshow - slideshow of images using smooth zooming and fades

SYNOPSIS
       glslideshow  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual] [-window]
       [-root] [-duration seconds] [-zoom percent] [-pan  seconds]  [-fade  sec&#8208;
       onds]  [-titles]  [-letterbox  |  -clip]  [-delay  usecs] [-fps] [-debug]
       [-wireframe] [-cutoff int]

DESCRIPTION
       Loads a random sequence of images and smoothly scans and zooms around  in
       each, fading from pan to pan.

       This  program requires a good video card capable of supporting large tex&#8208;
       tures.

       To specify the directory that images are loaded from,  run  xscreensaver-
       demo(1) and click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -duration seconds
               How  long  each image will be displayed before loading a new one.
               Default 30 seconds.

       -pan seconds
               How long each pan-and-zoom should last.  Default 6 seconds.

               With the default settings of -pan 6 -duration 30, each image will
               be  displayed  five  times  (30/6),  and then a new image will be
               loaded.  If you want a new image to be loaded at each fade,  then
               set -pan and -duration to the same value.

       -fade seconds
               How  long  each cross-fade between images should last.  Default 2
               seconds.  If set to 0, then no cross-fading  will  be  done  (all
               transitions will be jump-cuts.)

               Note  that fades are included in the pan time, so -fade cannot be
               larger than -pan.

       -zoom number
               Amount to zoom and pan as a percentage. Default: 75, meaning that
               75%  or  more  of  each  image will always be visible.  If set to
               100%, then the images will always fill the screen, and no panning
               or zooming will occur.  (Images will still smoothly fade from one
               to another if -fade is non-zero.)

       -titles Whether to print the file name of the current image in the  upper
               left corner.

       -letterbox
               In  &quot;letterbox&quot;  mode, when an image is not the same aspect ratio
               as the screen, black  bars  will  appear  at  the  top/bottom  or
               left/right so that the whole image can be displayed.  This is the
               default.

       -clip   In &quot;clip&quot; mode, when an image is not the same aspect ratio as the
               screen,  we  will  zoom  in  further until the image takes up the
               whole screen.  This is the opposite of -letterbox.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  20000  (0.02  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -cutoff number
               If  the frame rate we are achieving is lower than this, then pan&#8208;
               ning, fading, and zooming will be disabled.  Default 5 FPS.

               The idea here is that if your machine  can&apos;t  maintain  a  decent
               frame  rate,  then it must not have fast 3D hardware, so we might
               as well behave in a simpler manner.  Set this  to  0  to  disable
               this check.

       -debug  Prints debugging info to stderr.

       -wireframe
               Another debug mode.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
