NAME
       glsnake - OpenGL enhanced Rubik&apos;s Snake cyclewaster.

SYNOPSIS
       glsnake [-display host:display.screen] [-window] [-root] [-visual visual]
       [-delay microseconds] [-fps] [-wireframe] [-altcolour] [-angvel  angular]
       [-explode distance] [-statictime milliseconds] [-yangvel angle] [-zangvel
       angle]

DESCRIPTION
       glsnake is an imitation of Rubiks&#180; Snake, using OpenGL.

OPTIONS
       glsnake accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -wireframe
               Display the snake in wireframe  mode,  rather  than  the  default
               solid mode.

       -altcolour
               Use the alternate colour scheme for the snake.  Shape identifica&#8208;
               tion using colour will be disabled.

       -angvel angular
               Change the speed at which the snake morphs to a new shape.

       -explode distance
               Change the distance between the nodes of a snake.

       -statictime milliseconds
               Change the time between morphs.

       -yangvel angle
               Change the angle of rotation around the Y axis per frame.

       -zangvel angle
               Change the angle of rotation around the Z axis per frame.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

FILES
       /usr/share/glsnake/*.glsnake
              This  XScreenSaver will attempt to read model files installed with
              the interactive glsnake.

BUGS
       The snake will happily intersect itself while morphing  (this  is  not  a
       bug).

       The rotation/camera position sucks.
