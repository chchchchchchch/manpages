NAME
       gltext - draws text spinning around in 3D

SYNOPSIS
       gltext  [-display host:display.screen] [-window] [-root] [-visual visual]
       [-delay microseconds] [-text string] [-program command]  [-wander]  [-no-
       wander] [-spin axes] [-no-spin] [-front] [-no-front] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gltext  program  draws some text spinning around in 3D, using a font
       that appears to be made of solid tubes.

OPTIONS
       gltext accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -text string
               The text to display.  This may contain newlines, but it shouldn&apos;t
               be  very long.  The default is to display the machine name and OS
               version.

               This may also be a format string acceptable to date(1) and  strf&#8208;
               time(3),  in which case, it will be updated once a second.  So to
               make this program display a spinning digital clock, you could  do
               this:
               gltext -text &quot;%A%n%d %b %Y%n%l:%M:%S %p&quot;
               To include a literal `%&apos;, you must double it: `%%&apos;.

               See the man page for strftime(3) for more details.

       -program command
               The given program is run, and its output is displayed.  If speci&#8208;
               fied, this overrides -text.  The program will be re-run  every  5
               seconds  to  re-generate  the  text.   It should run quickly, and
               shouldn&apos;t generate too much text.

       -wander Move the text around the screen.  This is the default.

       -no-wander
               Keep the text centered on the screen.

       -spin   Which axes around which the text should  spin.   The  default  is
               &quot;XYZ&quot;, meaning rotate it freely in space.  &quot;-spin Z&quot; would rotate
               the text in the plane of the screen while not rotating it into or
               out of the screen; etc.

       -no-spin
               Don&apos;t spin the text at all: the same as -spin &quot;&quot;.

       -front  When  spinning,  never  spin  all  the way around or upside down:
               always face mostly forward so that the text is easily readable.

       -no-front
               Allow spins to go all the way around or upside down.  This is the
               default.

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
