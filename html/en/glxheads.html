NAME
       glxheads - exercise multiple GLX connections

SYNOPSIS
       glxheads [display ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  glxheads program will try to open GLX connections on multiple X dis&#8208;
       plays as specified on the command-line. If a connection can  be  made  it
       will  try  to create a direct GLX context (and fallback to using indirect
       contexts if that fails) and open a window  displaying  a  spinning  green
       triangle.

       If  no  display  names  are specified, glxheads will default to opening a
       single local connection on display 0.

EXAMPLE
       To open a local connection on display 0 and two remote connections to the
       hosts  mars (display 0) and venus (display 1), run glxheads with the fol&#8208;
       lowing command-line:

          $ glxheads :0 mars:0 venus:1
