GML2GV(1)                                                              GML2GV(1)



NAME
       gml2gv - GML-DOT converter

SYNOPSIS
       gml2gv [ -?  ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       gml2gv  converts a graph specified in the GML format to a graph in the GV
       (formerly DOT) format.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -?     Prints usage information and exits.

       -ooutfile
              Prints output to the file outfile. If not given, gml2gv uses  std&#8208;
              out.


       OPERANDS
              The following operand is supported:

       files   Names  of  files containing 1 or more graphs in GML.  If no files
               operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

RETURN CODES
       Return 0 if there were no problems during conversion; and non-zero if any
       error occurred.

LIMITATIONS
       As both the graph and graphics models of GV and GML differ significantly,
       the conversion is at best approximate. In particular, it is not clear how
       multiedges  are  differentiated  in  GML, so multiedges are created in GV
       with no user-available key. Also, no attribute information  is  lost,  in
       that  any  GML  attributes  that  aren&apos;t  converted to GV equivalents are
       retained as attributes in the output graph.
