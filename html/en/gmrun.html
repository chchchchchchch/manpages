gmrun(1)                                                                gmrun(1)



NAME
       gmrun - Featureful CLI-like GTK+ application launcher

SYNOPSIS
       gmrun [TEXT]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the gmrun command.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution  because  the  original
       program does not have a manual page.

       gmrun  is  a  program  that  allows a user to use a CLI-like interface to
       launch applications from within the  X11  windowing  environment.  It  is
       based on the GTK+ toolkit.

OPTIONS
       If  gmrun is invoked with a command-line parameter, that will be the ini&#8208;
       tial content of the dialog box.

       gmrun can be customized using a configuration file, ~/.gmrunrc . The sys&#8208;
       tem-wide configuration file is /etc/gmrunrc .

       The  format  of  the configuration file is simple; &quot;variable = value&quot;. To
       refer to a variable as opposed to setting it,  enclose  the  variable  in
       ${}.

       Example:
              variable1 = foobar
              newvariable = ${variable1} foobaz

       Were  this placed within the configuration file, the gmrun variable &quot;new&#8208;
       variable&quot; would contain the text &quot;foobar foobaz&quot;. Some variables that are
       understood by gmrun, by default. These are:

       Terminal
              The  command  to  run  when  Ctrl+Enter is pressed with no command
              entered; used to start a new terminal.

       TermExec
              The command to run when  Ctrl+Enter  is  pressed  with  a  command
              entered.  The  entered  command is supplied as an argument to Ter&#8208;
              mExec.

       Width  Initial width of gmrun window.

       Top, Left
              Initial placement of gmrun window -  specify  both  Top  and  Left
              variables such that the gmrun window is placed at pixel (Top,Left)
              of your desktop.

       History
              Number of entered commands which should be kept  in  gmrun&apos;s  his&#8208;
              tory(~/.gmrun_history).  Using  the  Up and Down arrow keys within
              the gmrun window will cycle through the history.  You  can  search
              backwards  through the history with Ctrl+R or by writing ! (excla&#8208;
              mation mark), and forward with Ctrl+S. To  cancel  a  search,  hit
              Ctrl+G or the ESC key. Otherwise, after you have found the history
              item you wish to run, hit Enter.

       ShowLast
              Whether to show the last command as  initial  text,  or  an  empty
              textarea (1 or 0).

       Selected
              Whether the initial text should be selected or not (1 or 0).

URL HANDLING
       As  opposed  to  entering a command, gmrun supports the entering of URLs.
       The included configuration file(/etc/gmrunrc) gives some examples. To set
       up your own url, create a variable in /etc/gmrunrc or ~/.gmrunrc with the
       format of &quot;URL_protocol&quot;. For instance, URL_http. Here is an example:

       URL_http = /usr/bin/mozilla %u
              Using   this,   entering   &quot;http://www.slashdot.org&quot;   will    run
              &apos;/usr/bin/mozilla http://slashdot.org&apos;.

       gmrun  may  also  strip  the protocol and colon away from the entered URL
       before passing it to the defined program. For example:

       URL_mailto = mutt %s
              Using this, entering  &quot;mailto:david@eelf.ddts.net&quot;  will  run  the
              command &apos;mutt david@eelf.ddts.net&apos;

       The  included  configuration  files has a few examples which you can work
       with. You should also note that the protocol part of URL_protocol can  be
       *anything*.  You  can  set  up  &quot;URL_foobarbazcustom&quot;, and so long as you
       enter in &quot;foobarbazcustom:&lt;whatever&gt;&quot;, it will  use  the  given  program.
       Have fun :)
