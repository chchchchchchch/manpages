NAME
       gnome-search-tool - the GNOME Search Tool

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-search-tool [options]

       or  select  Search for Files...  from a Main Menu or from the Places menu
       in a Menu Bar

DESCRIPTION
       GNOME Search Tool is a utility for finding files on your system. To  per&#8208;
       form  a basic search, you can type a filename or a partial filename, with
       or without wildcards. To refine your search,  you  can  apply  additional
       search options.

       GNOME Search Tool uses the find, grep, and locate UNIX commands. The case
       sensitivity of the search depends on your operating system. For  example,
       on  Linux,  the find, grep, and locate commands support the -i option, so
       all searches are case-insensitive.

       For full documentation see the GNOME Search Tool online help.
