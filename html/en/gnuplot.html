GNUPLOT(1)                                                            GNUPLOT(1)



NAME
       gnuplot - an interactive plotting program

SYNOPSIS
       gnuplot [X11 options] [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program.

       If file names are given on the command line, gnuplot loads each file with
       the load command, in the order specified, and exits after the  last  file
       is  processed.   If  no  files are given, gnuplot prompts for interactive
       commands.

       Here are some of its features:

       Plots any number of functions, built up of C operators, C  library  func&#8208;
       tions, and some things C doesn&apos;t have like **, sgn(), etc.

       User-defined constants and functions.

       All  computations performed in the complex domain.  Just the real part is
       plotted by default, but functions like imag() and  abs()  and  arg()  are
       available to override this.

       Also support for plotting data files, to compare actual data to theoreti&#8208;
       cal curves.

       Nonlinear least-squares fitting.

       2D plots with mouse-controlled zooming.

       3D plots with mouse-controlled point of view.

       User-defined X and Y ranges (optional auto-ranging), smart axes  scaling,
       smart tic marks.

       Labelling of X and Y axes.

       Shell escapes and command line substitution.

       Load and save capability.

       Support for many output devices and file formats.

       Output redirection.

OPTIONS
       -p, --persist lets plot windows survive after main gnuplot program exits.

       -e &quot;command list&quot; executes the requested commands before loading the next
       input file.

       -h, --help print summary of usage

       -V show current version

X11 OPTIONS
       Gnuplot provides the x11 terminal type for use with X servers. This  ter&#8208;
       minal  type  is  set  automatically at startup if the DISPLAY environment
       variable is set, if the TERM environment variable is set to xterm, or  if
       the -display command line option is used.  For terminal type x11, gnuplot
       accepts the standard X Toolkit options and resources  such  as  geometry,
       font,  and  background.  See  the  X(1) man page for a description of the
       options.  In addition to the X Toolkit options:

       -clear requests that the window be cleared momentarily before a new  plot
       is displayed.

       -gray  requests  grayscale  rendering  on  grayscale  or  color displays.
       (Grayscale displays receive monochrome rendering by default.)

       -mono forces monochrome rendering on color displays.

       -raise raises the plot window after each plot.

       -noraise does not raise the plot window after each plot.

       -tvtwm requests that geometry specifications for position of  the  window
       be made relative to the currently displayed portion of the virtual root.

       These  options  may  also be controlled with resources in your .Xdefaults
       file.  For example: gnuplot*gray: on .

       Gnuplot provides a command line option  (-pointsize  v)  and  a  resource
       (gnuplot*pointsize:  v)  to  control  the size of points plotted with the
       &quot;points&quot; plotting style. The value v is a real number (greater than 0 and
       less  than or equal to ten) used as a scaling factor for point sizes. For
       example, -pointsize 2 uses points twice the default size, and  -pointsize
       0.5 uses points half the normal size.

       For  monochrome displays, gnuplot does not honor foreground or background
       colors. The default is black-on-white. -rv  or  gnuplot*reverseVideo:  on
       requests white-on-black.

       For  color  displays  gnuplot  honors the following resources (shown here
       with default values). The values may be color names in  the  X11  rgb.txt
       file  on your system, hexadecimal RGB color specifications (see X11 docu&#8208;
       mentation), or a color name followed by a comma and  an  intensity  value
       from 0 to 1. For example, blue,.5 means a half intensity blue.

       gnuplot*background: white
       gnuplot*textColor: black
       gnuplot*borderColor: black
       gnuplot*axisColor: black
       gnuplot*line1Color: red
       gnuplot*line2Color: green
       gnuplot*line3Color: blue
       gnuplot*line4Color: magenta
       gnuplot*line5Color: cyan
       gnuplot*line6Color: sienna
       gnuplot*line7Color: orange
       gnuplot*line8Color: coral

       When  -gray  is  selected,  gnuplot  honors  the  following resources for
       grayscale or color displays (shown here with default values).  Note  that
       the default background is black.

       gnuplot*background: black
       gnuplot*textGray: white
       gnuplot*borderGray: gray50
       gnuplot*axisGray: gray50
       gnuplot*line1Gray: gray100
       gnuplot*line2Gray: gray60
       gnuplot*line3Gray: gray80
       gnuplot*line4Gray: gray40
       gnuplot*line5Gray: gray90
       gnuplot*line6Gray: gray50
       gnuplot*line7Gray: gray70
       gnuplot*line8Gray: gray30

       Gnuplot honors the following resources for setting the width in pixels of
       plot lines (shown here with default values.) 0 or 1 means a minimal width
       line  of  1 pixel width. A value of 2 or 3 may improve the  appearance of
       some plots.

       gnuplot*borderWidth: 2
       gnuplot*axisWidth: 0
       gnuplot*line1Width: 0
       gnuplot*line2Width: 0
       gnuplot*line3Width: 0
       gnuplot*line4Width: 0
       gnuplot*line5Width: 0
       gnuplot*line6Width: 0
       gnuplot*line7Width: 0
       gnuplot*line8Width: 0

       Gnuplot honors the following resources for setting the  dash  style  used
       for  plotting  lines.  0 means a solid line. A 2 digit number jk (j and k
       are &gt;= 1  and &lt;= 9) means a dashed line with a repeated pattern of j pix&#8208;
       els  on  followed  by k pixels off.  For example, &apos;16&apos; is a &quot;dotted&quot; line
       with 1 pixel on followed by 6 pixels off.  More elaborate on/off patterns
       can  be  specified  with a 4 digit value.  For example, &apos;4441&apos; is 4 on, 4
       off, 4 on, 1 off. The default values shown below are for monochrome  dis&#8208;
       plays  or  monochrome rendering on color or grayscale displays. For color
       displays, the defaults for all are 0 (solid line) except  for  axisDashes
       which defaults to a &apos;16&apos; dotted line.

       gnuplot*borderDashes: 0
       gnuplot*axisDashes: 16
       gnuplot*line1Dashes: 0
       gnuplot*line2Dashes: 42
       gnuplot*line3Dashes: 13
       gnuplot*line4Dashes: 44
       gnuplot*line5Dashes: 15
       gnuplot*line6Dashes: 4441
       gnuplot*line7Dashes: 42
       gnuplot*line8Dashes: 13

       The size or aspect ratio of a plot may be changed by resizing the gnuplot
       window.

ENVIRONMENT
       A number of shell environment variables are understood by gnuplot.   None
       of these are required.

       GNUTERM
              The name of the terminal type to be used.  This overrides any ter&#8208;
              minal type sensed by gnuplot on start-up, but is itself overridden
              by the .gnuplot (or equivalent) start-up file (see FILES and &quot;help
              start-up&quot;) and, of course, by later explicit changes.

       GNUHELP
              The pathname of the HELP file (gnuplot.gih).

       HOME   The name of a directory to search for a .gnuplot file if  none  is
              found in the current directory.

       PAGER  An output filter for help messages.

       SHELL  The program used for the &quot;shell&quot; command.

       FIT_SCRIPT
              Specifies  a  gnuplot  command to be executed when a fit is inter&#8208;
              rupted---see &quot;help fit&quot;.

       FIT_LOG
              The name of the logfile maintained by fit.

       GNUPLOT_LIB
              Additional search directories for  data  and  command  files.  The
              variable  may contain a single directory name, or a list of direc&#8208;
              tories separated by &apos;:&apos;. The contents of GNUPLOT_LIB are  appended
              to  the  &quot;loadpath&quot;  variable,  but  not saved with the &quot;save&quot; and
              &quot;save set&quot; commands.

       GDFONTPATH
              Several gnuplot terminal drivers access TrueType fonts via the  gd
              library.  This variable gives the font search path for these driv&#8208;
              ers.

       GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT
              The default font for the terminal  drivers  that  access  TrueType
              fonts via the gd library.

       GNUPLOT_FONTPATH
              The  font  search path used by the postscript terminal. The format
              is the same as for GNUPLOT_LIB. The contents  of  GNUPLOT_FONTPATH
              are  appended  to  the &quot;fontpath&quot; variable, but not saved with the
              &quot;save&quot; and &quot;save set&quot; commands.

       GNUPLOT_PS_DIR
              Used by the postscript driver to locate external  prologue  files.
              Depending  on the build process, gnuplot contains either a builtin
              copy of those files or simply a default hardcoded path.  Use  this
              variable  to  test  the  postscript  terminal with custom prologue
              files. See &quot;help postscript prologue&quot;.

FILES
       .gnuplot
              Gnuplot looks for this initialization file, first in  the  current
              directory,  then  in the HOME directory.  It may contain any legal
              gnuplot commands, but typically they are limited  to  setting  the
              terminal and defining frequently-used functions or variables.

       fit.log
              The default name of the logfile maintained by fit.
