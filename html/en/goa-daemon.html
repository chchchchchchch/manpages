GOA-DAEMON(8)                      goa-daemon                      GOA-DAEMON(8)



NAME
       goa-daemon - GNOME Online Accounts Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       goa-daemon [--help] [--replace]

DESCRIPTION
       The goa-daemon program provides the org.gnome.OnlineAccounts name on the
       session message bus. Users or administrators should never need to start
       this daemon as it will be automatically started by dbus-daemon(1)
       whenever an application sends a D-Bus message to the
       org.gnome.OnlineAccounts name on the session bus.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The goa-daemon program stores configuration in the
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goa-1.0/accounts.conf (typically
       ~/.config/goa-1.0/accounts.conf) file. The format of this file is private
       and 3rd party programs or libraries should never read it. This file does
       not contain any passwords or secrets.

       See the XDG Base Directory Specification[1] for more information about
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

SECRETS
       The goa-daemon program stores secrets (such as OAuth tokens) in GNOME
       Keyring[2]. The format of the stored secrets is private and 3rd party
       programs or libraries should never read, modify or delete these secrets.

OPTIONS
       --replace
           Replace existing instance.

       --help
           Show help options.
