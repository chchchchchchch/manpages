GOCR(1)                           User&apos;s Manual                          GOCR(1)



NAME
       gocr - command line text recognition tool

SYNOPSIS
       gocr [OPTION] [-i] pnm-file

DESCRIPTION
       gocr  is  an  optical character recognition program that can be used from
       the command line.  It takes input in PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, or  PCX  format,
       and  writes recognized text to stdout.  If the pnm file is a single dash,
       PNM data is read  from  stdin.   If  gzip,  bzip2  and  netpbm-progs  are
       installed  and  your  system supports popen(3) also pnm.gz, pnm.bz2, png,
       jpg, jpeg, tiff, gif, bmp, ps (only single pages) and eps  are  supported
       as input files (not as input stream), where pnm can be replaced by one of
       ppm, pgm and pbm.

OPTIONS
       -h     show usage information

       -i file
              read input from file (or stdin if file is a single dash)

       -o file
              send output to file instead of stdout

       -e file
              send errors to file instead of stderr or to stdout if  file  is  a
              dash

       -x file
              progress output to file (file can be a file name, a fifo name or a
              file descriptor 1...255), this is useful for  GUI  developpers  to
              show the OCR progress, the file descriptor argument is only avail&#8208;
              able, if compiled with __USE_POSIX defined

       -p path
              database path, a final slash must be included, default  is  ./db/,
              this path will be populated with images of learned characters

       -f format
              output  format of the recognized text (ISO8859_1 TeX HTML XML UTF8
              ASCII), XML will also output position and probability data

       -l level
              set grey level to level (0&lt;160&lt;=255, default: 0  for  autodetect),
              darker  pixels  belong  to  characters, brighter pixels are inter&#8208;
              preted as background of the input image

       -d size
              set dust size in pixels (clusters smaller than this are  removed),
              0 means no clusters are removed, the default is -1 for auto detec&#8208;
              tion

       -s num set spacewidth between words in units  of  dots  (default:  0  for
              autodetect),  wider widths are interpreted as word spaces, smaller
              as character spaces

       -v verbosity
              be verbose to stderr; verbosity is a bitfield

       -c string
              only verbose output of characters from string to stderr, more out&#8208;
              put  is generated for all characters within the string, the under&#8208;
              score stands for unknown chars, this function is usefull to  limit
              debug information to the necessary one

       -C string
              only  recognise  characters from string, this is a filter function
              in cases where the interest is only to a  part  of  the  character
              alphabet,  you  can  use  0-9  or a-z to specify ranges, use -- to
              detect the minus sign

       -a certainty
              set value for certainty  of  recognition  (0..100;  default:  95),
              characters with a higher certainty are accepted, characters with a
              lower certainty are  treated  as  unknown  (not  recognized);  set
              higher  values,  if  you want to have only more certain recognized
              characters

       -u string
              output this string for every unrecognized  character  (default  is
              &quot;_&quot;)

       -m mode
              set oprational mode; mode is a bitfield (default: 0)

       -n bool
              if bool is non-zero, only recognise numbers (this is now obsolete,
              use -C &quot;0123456789&quot;)

       The verbosity is specified as a bitfield:

       1         print more info

       2         list shapes of boxes (see -c) to stderr

       4         list pattern of boxes (see -c) to stderr

       8         print pattern after recognition for debugging

       16        print debug information about recognition of lines to stderr

       32        create outXX.png with boxes and lines marked  on  each  general
                 OCR-step

       The operation modes are:

       2         use  database  to recognize characters which are not recognized
                 by other algorithms, (early development)

       4         switching on layout analysis or zoning (development)

       8         don&apos;t compare unrecognized characters to recognized one

       16        don&apos;t try to divide overlapping characters to two or three sin&#8208;
                 gle characters

       32        don&apos;t do context correction

       64        character  packing,  before recognition starts, similar charac&#8208;
                 ters are searched and only one of this characters will be  send
                 to the recognition engine (development)

       130       extend  database,  prompts user for unidentified characters and
                 extends the database with users answer (128+2,  early  develop&#8208;
                 ment)

       256       switch off the recognition engine (makes sense together with -m
                 2)
&#12;
