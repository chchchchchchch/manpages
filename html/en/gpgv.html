GPGV(1)                         GNU Privacy Guard                        GPGV(1)



NAME
       gpgv - Verify OpenPGP signatures

SYNOPSIS
       gpgv [options] signed_files





DESCRIPTION
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is  actually  a stripped-down version of gpg which is only
       able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
       and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used
       to make the signature are valid. There are  no  configuration  files  and
       only a few options are implemented.

       gpgv assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  By default it
       uses a keyring named &#8216;trustedkeys.gpg&#8217; which is assumed to be in the home
       directory as defined by GnuPG or set by an option or an environment vari&#8208;
       able. An option may be used to specify another keyring or  even  multiple
       keyrings.



RETURN VALUE
       The  program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least one signature
       was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.


OPTIONS
       gpgv recognizes these options:



       --verbose

       -v     Gives more information during processing. If used twice, the input
              data is listed in detail.


       --quiet

       -q     Try to be as quiet as possible.


       --keyring file
              Add file to the list of keyrings.  If file begins with a tilde and
              a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory. If the filename
              does  not  contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the home-direc&#8208;
              tory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir is not used).


       --status-fd n
              Write special status strings to the file descriptor  n.   See  the
              file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.


       --logger-fd n
              Write log output to file descriptor n and not to stderr.
&#12;
       --ignore-time-conflict
              GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
              signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes  a  signature
              seems  to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
              turns these checks into warnings.


       --homedir dir
              Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option  is  not
              used,  the home directory defaults to &#8216;~/.gnupg&#8217;.  It is only rec&#8208;
              ognized when given on the command line.   It  also  overrides  any
              home directory stated through the environment variable &#8216;GNUPGHOME&#8217;
              or (on W32 systems) by means  of  the  Registry  entry  HKCU\Soft&#8208;
              ware\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir.




EXAMPLES
       gpgv pgpfile

       gpgv sigfile [datafile]
              Verify  the  signature  of  the  file. The second form is used for
              detached signatures,  where  sigfile  is  the  detached  signature
              (either  ASCII-armored or binary) and datafile contains the signed
              data; if datafile is &quot;-&quot; the signed data is expected on stdin;  if
              datafile is not given the name of the file holding the signed data
              is constructed by cutting off the  extension  (&quot;.asc&quot;,  &quot;.sig&quot;  or
              &quot;.sign&quot;) from sigfile.



FILES
       ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
              The default keyring with the allowed keys.



ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   Used to locate the default home directory.


       GNUPGHOME
              If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.

       The  full  documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at  your  site,  the
       command

         info gnupg

       should  give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure
       and an index.
