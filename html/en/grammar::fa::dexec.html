DESCRIPTION
       This  package provides a class for executors constructed from determinis&#8208;
       tic finite automatons (DFA). Executors are  objects  which  are  given  a
       string  of  symbols  in a piecemal fashion, perform state transitions and
       report back when they enter a final state, or find an error in the input.
       For  the  actual  creation of the DFAs the executors are based on we have
       the packages grammar::fa and grammar::fa::op.

       The objects follow a push model. Symbols are pushed  into  the  executor,
       and  when something important happens, i.e. error occurs, a state transi&#8208;
       tion, or a final state is entered this will be reported via the  callback
       specified  via  the  option -command. Note that conversion of this into a
       pull model where the environment retrieves messages from the  object  and
       the object uses a callback to ask for more symbols is a trivial thing.

       Side  note: The acceptor objects provided by grammar::fa::dacceptor could
       have been implemented on top of the executors  provided  here,  but  were
       not, to get a bit more performance (we avoid a number of method calls and
       the time required for their dispatch).

API
       The package exports the API described here.

       ::grammar::fa::dexec daName fa ?-any any? ?-command cmdprefix?
              Creates a new deterministic executor with an associated global Tcl
              command  whose  name is daName. This command may be used to invoke
              various operations on the executor. It has the  following  general
              form:

              daName option ?arg arg ...?
                     Option  and  the  args  determine the exact behavior of the
                     command. See section EXECUTOR  METHODS  for  more  explana&#8208;
                     tions.

                     The  executor will be based on the deterministic finite au&#8208;
                     tomaton stored in the object fa. It will keep a copy of the
                     relevant  data of the FA in its own storage, in a form easy
                     to use for its purposes. This also means that changes  made
                     to  the  fa after the construction of the executor will not
                     influence the executor.

                     If any has been specified, then the executor  will  convert
                     all  symbols  in the input which are unknown to the base FA
                     to that symbol before proceeding with the processing.

EXECUTOR METHODS
       All executors provide the following methods for their manipulation:

       daName destroy
              Destroys the automaton, including its storage space and associated
              command.

       daName put symbol
              Takes  the  current  state of the executor and the symbol and per&#8208;
              forms the appropriate state transition. Reports any errors encoun&#8208;
              tered  via the command callback, as well as entering a final state
              of the underlying FA.

              When an error is reported all further invokations of put  will  do
              nothing, until the error condition has been cleared via an invoka&#8208;
              tion of method reset.

       daName reset
              Unconditionally sets the executor into  the  start  state  of  the
              underlying  FA. This also clears any error condition  put may have
              encountered.

       daName state
              Returns the current state of the underlying  FA.  This  allow  for
              introspection without the need to pass data from the callback com&#8208;
              mand.

EXECUTOR CALLBACK
       The callback command cmdprefix given to an executor via the option  -com&#8208;
       mand will be executed by the object at the global level, using the syntax
       described below. Note that cmdprefix is not simply the name of a command,
       but a full command prefix. In other words it may contain additional fixed
       argument words beyond the command word.

       cmdprefix error code message
              The executor has encountered an  error,  and  message  contains  a
              human-readable  text  explaining  the  nature of the problem.  The
              code on the other hand is a fixed machine-readable text.  The fol&#8208;
              lowing error codes can be generated by executor objects.

              BADSYM An  unknown  symbol was found in the input. This can happen
                     if and only if no -any symbol was specified.

              BADTRANS
                     The underlying FA has no transition for the current  combi&#8208;
                     nation  of  input  symbol  and  state.  In other words, the
                     executor was not able to compute a new state for this  com&#8208;
                     bination.
&#12;       cmdprefix final stateid
              The executor has entered the final state stateid.

       cmdprefix reset
              The executor was reset.

       cmdprefix state stateid
              The  FA  changed  state  due  to  a transition. stateid is the new
              state.
