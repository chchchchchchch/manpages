NAME
       grammar::me_intro  -  Introduction  to virtual machines for parsing token
       streams

DESCRIPTION
       This document is an introduction to and overview of the basic  facilities
       for  the  parsing and/or matching of token streams. One possibility often
       used for the token domain are characters.

       The packages themselves all provide  variants  of  one  virtual  machine,
       called a match engine (short ME), which has all the facilities needed for
       the matching and parsing of a stream, and  which  are  either  controlled
       directly,  or are customized with a match program. The virtual machine is
       basically a pushdown automaton, with additional elements for backtracking
       and/or  handling  of  semantic  data  and construction of abstract syntax
       trees (AST).

       Because of the high degree of similarity in the actual implementations of
       the  aforementioned  virtual machine and the data structures they receive
       and generate these common parts are  specified  in  a  separate  document
       which  will  be  referenced  by  the  documentation for packages actually
       implementing it.

       The relevant documents are:

       grammar::me_vm
              Virtual machine specification.

       grammar::me_ast
              Specification of various representations used for abstract  syntax
              trees.

       grammar::me::util
              Utility commands.

       grammar::me::tcl
              Singleton  ME  virtual machine implementation tied to Tcl for con&#8208;
              trol flow and stacks. Hardwired for pull operation. Uninteruptible
              during processing.

       grammar::me::cpu
              Object-based  ME virtual machine implementation with explicit con&#8208;
              trol  flow,  and  stacks,  using   bytecodes.   Suspend/Resumable.
              Push/pull operation.

       grammar::me::cpu::core
              Core functionality for state manipulation and stepping used in the
              bytecode based implementation of ME virtual machines.

BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK
       This document, and the package it  describes,  will  undoubtedly  contain
       bugs  and  other problems.  Please report such in the category grammar_me
       of       the       Tcllib       SF        Trackers        [http://source&#8208;
       forge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].   Please  also  report  any ideas for
       enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.
