GRANTPT(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 GRANTPT(3)



NAME
       grantpt - grant access to the slave pseudoterminal

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int grantpt(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       The grantpt() function changes the mode and owner of the slave pseudoter&#8208;
       minal device corresponding to the master pseudoterminal  referred  to  by
       fd.   The  user  ID  of  the  slave is set to the real UID of the calling
       process.  The group ID is set to an unspecified value (e.g.,  tty).   The
       mode of the slave is set to 0620 (crw--w----).

       The behavior of grantpt() is unspecified if a signal handler is installed
       to catch SIGCHLD signals.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, grantpt() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and  sets
       errno appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES The corresponding slave pseudoterminal could not be accessed.

       EBADF  The fd argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EINVAL The  fd  argument  is valid but not associated with a master pseu&#8208;
              doterminal.

VERSIONS
       grantpt() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       This is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal  support,  see  pts(4).   Many
       systems  implement  this  function via a set-user-ID helper binary called
       &quot;pt_chown&quot;.  With Linux devpts no such helper binary is required.
