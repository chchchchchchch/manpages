GRAP2GRAPH(1)                                                      GRAP2GRAPH(1)



NAME
       grap2graph - convert a grap diagram into a cropped bitmap image

SYNOPSIS
       grap2graph [ -unsafe ] [ -resolution M|MxN ] [ -format fmt ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a grap program as input; produces an image file (by default in Por&#8208;
       table Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web  as  output.   For  a
       description of the grap language, see grap(1).

       Your  graph  specification  should  not  be  wrapped with the .G1 and .G2
       macros that normally guard it within groff(1) macros.

       The output image will be a black-on-white graphic clipped to the smallest
       possible  bounding box that contains all the black pixels.  By specifying
       command-line options to be passed to convert(1) you can give it a border,
       set the background transparent, set the image&apos;s pixel density, or perform
       other useful transformations.

       This program uses grap(1), pic(1), groff(1),  and  the  ImageMagick  con&#8208;
       vert(1)  program.   These  programs  must be installed on your system and
       accessible on your $PATH for grap2graph to work.

OPTIONS
       -unsafe
              Run pic(1) and groff(1) in the  `unsafe&apos;  mode  enabling  the  PIC
              macro  sh to execute arbitrary commands.  The default is to forbid
              this.

       -format fmt
              Specify an output format; the default  is  PNG  (Portable  Network
              Graphics).  Any format that convert(1) can emit is supported.

       Command-line  switches  and arguments not listed above are passed to con&#8208;
       vert(1).

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TMPDIR
              The directory in which temporary files will be created.   If  this
              is  not  set grap2graph searches the environment variables TMPDIR,
              TMP, and TEMP (in that order).  Otherwise, temporary files will be
              created in /tmp.
