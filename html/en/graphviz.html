NAME
       graphviz - rich set of graph drawing tools


SYNOPSIS
       This  manpage  has been written to fulfil the need of a centralized docu&#8208;
       mentation presenting all available tools in the graphviz package.


AVAILABLE TOOLS
   Graph layout programs
       dot    filter for hierarchical layouts of graphs

       neato  filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

       twopi  filter for radial layouts of graphs

       circo  filter for circular layout of graphs

       fdp    filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

       All of the filters work with either directed or undirected graphs, though
       dot  is  typically  used  for  directed  graphs  and neato for undirected
       graphs.  Note also that neato -n[2] can be used to  render  layouts  pro&#8208;
       duced by the other filters.

   Graph drawing programs
       lefty  A Programmable Graphics Editor

       lneato lefty + neato

       dotty  lefty + dot



   Graph layout enhancement
       gvcolor
              flow colors through a ranked digraph

       unflatten
              adjust directed graphs to improve layout aspect ratio

       gvpack merge and pack disjoint graphs


   Graph information and transformation
       gc     count graph components

       acyclic
              make directed graph acyclic

       nop    pretty-print graph file

       ccomps connected components filter for graphs

       sccmap extract strongly connected components of directed graphs

       tred   transitive reduction filter for directed graphs

       dijkstra
              single-source distance filter
&#12;       bcomps biconnected components filter for graphs

       gvpr   graph pattern scanning and processing language

       prune  prune directed graphs


   Other
       gxl2dot, dot2gxl
              GXL-DOT converters

       This   manual   page   was   written  by  Cyril  Brulebois  &lt;cyril.brule&#8208;
       bois@enst-bretagne.fr&gt; in november 2006, based on an  initial  documenta&#8208;
       tion  effort  by  Joachim Berdal Haga &lt;jbh@lupus.ig3.net&gt;. It can be dis&#8208;
       tributed under the same terms as the graphviz package.
