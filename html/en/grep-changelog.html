NAME
       grep-changelog - print ChangeLog entries matching criteria

SYNOPSIS
       grep-changelog [options] [CHANGELOG...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep-changelog  searches  the named CHANGELOGs (by default files matching

       matching  the  specified  criteria.   At least one option or file must be
       specified.  This program is distributed with GNU Emacs.
