NAME
       grep-excuses - search the testing excuses files for a specific maintainer

SYNOPSIS
       grep-excuses [options] [maintainer|package]

DESCRIPTION
       grep-excuses  downloads the update_excuses.html file and greps it for the
       specified maintainer name.  The libwww-perl package is required for  this
       script.   If  no name is given on the command line, first the environment
       variable DEBFULLNAME is used if it is defined, and failing that, the con&#8208;
       figuration variable described below is used.

OPTIONS
       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
              first option given on the command-line.

       --wipnity, -w
              Get information  from  &lt;http://release.debian.org/migration/&gt;.   A
              package name must be given when using this option.

       --help Show a brief usage message.

       --version
              Show version and copyright information.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The  two  configuration  files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
       sourced in that order  to  set  configuration  variables.   Command  line
       options can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised
       variable is:

       GREP_EXCUSES_MAINTAINER
              The  default  maintainer,  email or package to grep for if none is
              specified on the command line.
