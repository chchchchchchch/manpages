GRN(1)                                                                    GRN(1)



NAME
       grn - groff preprocessor for gremlin files

SYNOPSIS
       grn [ -Cv ] [ -Tdev ] [ -Mdir ] [ -Fdir ] [ file... ]

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grn is a preprocessor for including gremlin pictures in groff input.  grn
       writes  to  standard output, processing only input lines between two that
       start with .GS and .GE.  Those  lines  must  contain  grn  commands  (see
       below).   These  commands request a gremlin file, and the picture in that
       file is converted and placed in the troff input stream.  The .GS  request
       may  be  followed  by  a C, L, or R to center, left, or right justify the
       whole gremlin picture (default justification is center).  If no  file  is
       mentioned,  the  standard  input is read.  At the end of the picture, the
       position on the page is the bottom of the gremlin picture.   If  the  grn
       entry  is  ended with .GF instead of .GE, the position is left at the top
       of the picture.

       Please note that currently only the -me macro  package  has  support  for
       .GS, .GE, and .GF.

       The following command-line options are understood:

       -Tdev  Prepare  output  for  printer dev.  The default device is ps.  See
              groff(1) for acceptable devices.

       -Mdir  Prepend dir to the default search path  for  gremlin  files.   The
              default  path  is  (in that order) the current directory, the home
              directory,  /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac,  /usr/share/groff/site-tmac,
              and /usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac.

       -Fdir  Search  dir  for  subdirectories  devname (name is the name of the
              device) for the DESC file  before  the  default  font  directories
              /usr/share/groff/site-font,     /usr/share/groff/1.21/font,    and
              /usr/lib/font.

       -C     Recognize .GS and .GE (and .GF) even when followed by a  character
              other than space or newline.

       -v     Print the version number.

GRN COMMANDS
       Each  input  line between .GS and .GE may have one grn command.  Commands
       consist of one or two strings separated by white space, the first  string
       being  the  command and the second its operand.  Commands may be upper or
       lower case and abbreviated down to one character.

       Commands  that  affect  a  picture&apos;s  environment  (those  listed  before
       default, see below) are only in effect for the current picture: The envi&#8208;
       ronment is reinitialized to the defaults at the start of  the  next  pic&#8208;
       ture.  The commands are as follows:

       1 N
       2 N
       3 N
       4 N    Set  gremlin&apos;s  text  size number 1 (2, 3, or 4) to N points.  The
              default is 12 (16, 24, and 36, respectively).
&#12;       roman f
       italics f
       bold f
       special f
              Set the roman (italics, bold, or special) font to troff&apos;s  font  f
              (either a name or number).  The default is R (I, B, and S, respec&#8208;
              tively).

       l f
       stipple f
              Set the stipple font to troff&apos;s stipple font f (name  or  number).
              The  command  stipple  may  be abbreviated down as far as `st&apos; (to
              avoid confusion with special).  There is no default  for  stipples
              (unless  one  is set by the default command), and it is invalid to
              include a gremlin picture with polygons without specifying a stip&#8208;
              ple font.

       x N
       scale N
              Magnify  the picture (in addition to any default magnification) by
              N, a floating point number larger than zero.   The  command  scale
              may be abbreviated down to `sc&apos;.

       narrow N
       medium N
       thick N
              Set  the  thickness of gremlin&apos;s narrow (medium and thick, respec&#8208;
              tively) lines to N times 0.15pt (this value can be changed at com&#8208;
              pile time).  The default is 1.0 (3.0 and 5.0, respectively), which
              corresponds to 0.15pt (0.45pt and 0.75pt, respectively).  A thick&#8208;
              ness  value of zero selects the smallest available line thickness.
              Negative values cause the line thickness to be proportional to the
              current point size.

       pointscale &lt;off/on&gt;
              Scale  text to match the picture.  Gremlin text is usually printed
              in the point size specified with the  commands  1,  2,  3,  or  4,
              regardless  of  any  scaling  factors  in  the  picture.   Setting
              pointscale will cause the point sizes to scale  with  the  picture
              (within  troff&apos;s  limitations, of course).  An operand of anything
              but off will turn text scaling on.

       default
              Reset the picture environment defaults to the settings in the cur&#8208;
              rent picture.  This is meant to be used as a global parameter set&#8208;
              ting mechanism at the beginning of the troff input file,  but  can
              be used at any time to reset the default settings.

       width N
              Forces  the picture to be N inches wide.  This overrides any scal&#8208;
              ing factors present in the same picture.  `width 0&apos; is ignored.

       height N
              Forces picture to be N inches high, overriding other scaling  fac&#8208;
              tors.  If both `width&apos; and `height&apos; are specified the tighter con&#8208;
              straint will determine the scale of the picture.  Height and width
              commands  are  not  saved with a default command.  They will, how&#8208;
              ever, affect point size scaling if that option is set.

       file name
              Get picture from gremlin file name located the  current  directory
              (or  in  the  library directory; see the -M option above).  If two
              file commands are given, the second one overrides the  first.   If
              name  doesn&apos;t  exist,  an error message is reported and processing
              continues from the .GE line.
&#12;NOTES ABOUT GROFF
       Since grn is a preprocessor, it doesn&apos;t know about current indents, point
       sizes,  margins, number registers, etc.  Consequently, no troff input can
       be placed between the .GS and .GE requests.  However, gremlin text is now
       processed  by troff, so anything valid in a single line of troff input is
       valid in a line of gremlin text (barring `.&apos; directives at the  beginning
       of a line).  Thus, it is possible to have equations within a gremlin fig&#8208;
       ure by including in the gremlin file eqn expressions enclosed  by  previ&#8208;
       ously defined delimiters (e.g.  $$).

       When  using  grn  along  with  other preprocessors, it is best to run tbl
       before grn, pic, and/or ideal  to  avoid  overworking  tbl.   Eqn  should
       always be run last.

       A  picture is considered an entity, but that doesn&apos;t stop troff from try&#8208;
       ing to break it up if it falls off the end of a page.  Placing  the  pic&#8208;
       ture between `keeps&apos; in -me macros will ensure proper placement.

       grn uses troff&apos;s number registers g1 through g9 and sets registers g1 and
       g2 to the width and height of the gremlin figure (in device units) before
       entering  the  .GS  request  (this is for those who want to rewrite these
       macros).

GREMLIN FILE FORMAT
       There exist two distinct gremlin file formats, the original  format  from
       the  AED graphic terminal version, and the SUN or X11 version.  An exten&#8208;
       sion to the SUN/X11 version allowing reference points with negative coor&#8208;
       dinates  is  not  compatible  with the AED version.  As long as a gremlin
       file does not contain negative coordinates, either format  will  be  read
       correctly  by  either version of gremlin or grn.  The other difference to
       the SUN/X11 format is the use of names for picture objects  (e.g.,  POLY&#8208;
       GON,  CURVE) instead of numbers.  Files representing the same picture are
       shown in Table 1 in each format.

       Table 1. File examples


       &#183;      The  first  line  of  each gremlin file contains either the string
              gremlinfile (AED version) or sungremlinfile (SUN/X11)

       &#183;      The second line of the file contains an orientation, and x  and  y
              values for a positioning point, separated by spaces.  The orienta&#8208;
              tion, either 0 or 1, is ignored by the SUN/X11 version.   0  means
              that  gremlin  will  display  things in horizontal format (drawing
              area wider than it is tall, with menu across top).  1  means  that
              gremlin  will  display  things  in  vertical  format (drawing area
              taller than it is wide, with menu on left  side).   x  and  y  are
              floating  point  values giving a positioning point to be used when
              this file is read into another  file.   The  stuff  on  this  line
              really  isn&apos;t  all  that  important; a value of ``1 0.00 0.00&apos;&apos; is
              suggested.

       &#183;      The rest of the file consists of zero or more  element  specifica&#8208;
              tions.   After the last element specification is a line containing
              the string ``-1&apos;&apos;.

       &#183;      Lines longer than 127 characters are chopped to this limit.
&#12;ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS
       &#183;      The first line of each element contains a  single  decimal  number
              giving  the  type  of  the element (AED version) or its ASCII name
              (SUN/X11 version).  See Table 2.

       &#183;      After the object type comes a variable number of lines, each spec&#8208;
              ifying a point used to display the element.  Each line contains an
              x-coordinate and a y-coordinate in floating  point  format,  sepa&#8208;
              rated  by spaces.  The list of points is terminated by a line con&#8208;
              taining the string ``-1.0 -1.0&apos;&apos; (AED version) or a single  aster&#8208;
              isk, ``*&apos;&apos; (SUN/X11 version).

       &#183;      After  the points comes a line containing two decimal values, giv&#8208;
              ing the brush and size for the element.  The brush determines  the
              style  in  which  things are drawn.  For vectors, arcs, and curves
              there are six valid brush values:


              center, tab(@); ncw(0.1i)l.  1 &#8722;@@thin dotted lines 2 &#8722;@@thin dot-
              dashed  lines  3  &#8722;@@thick  solid  lines  4 &#8722;@@thin dashed lines 5
              &#8722;@@thin solid lines 6 &#8722;@@medium solid lines

              For polygons, one more value, 0, is valid.  It specifies a polygon
              with  an  invisible border.  For text, the brush selects a font as
              follows:


              center, tab(@); ncw(0.1i)l.   1  &#8722;@@roman  (R  font  in  groff)  2
              &#8722;@@italics (I font in groff) 3 &#8722;@@bold (B font in groff) 4 &#8722;@@spe&#8208;
              cial (S font in groff)

              If you&apos;re using grn to run your pictures through groff,  the  font
              is  really  just a starting font: The text string can contain for&#8208;
              matting sequences like ``\fI&apos;&apos; or ``\d&apos;&apos; which may change the font
              (as  well as do many other things).  For text, the size field is a
              decimal value between 1 and 4.  It selects the size of the font in
              which  the  text  will be drawn.  For polygons, this size field is
              interpreted as a stipple number to fill  the  polygon  with.   The
              number is used to index into a stipple font at print time.

       &#183;      The  last  line  of  each  element contains a decimal number and a
              string of characters, separated by a single space.  The number  is
              a  count of the number of characters in the string.  This informa&#8208;
              tion is only used for text elements, and contains the text string.
              There  can  be spaces inside the text.  For arcs, curves, and vec&#8208;
              tors, this line of the element contains the string ``0&apos;&apos;.

NOTES ON COORDINATES
       gremlin was designed for AEDs, and its coordinates reflect the AED  coor&#8208;
       dinate  space.   For vertical pictures, x-values range 116 to 511, and y-
       values from 0 to 483.  For horizontal pictures, x-values range from 0  to
       511  and  y-values  range from 0 to 367.  Although you needn&apos;t absolutely
       stick to this range, you&apos;ll get best results if you at least stay in this
       vicinity.   Also,  point  lists are terminated by a point of (-1, -1), so
       you shouldn&apos;t ever use negative coordinates.  gremlin writes out  coordi&#8208;
       nates  using  format ``%f1.2&apos;&apos;; it&apos;s probably a good idea to use the same
       format if you want to modify the grn code.

NOTES ON SUN/X11 COORDINATES
       There is no longer a restriction on the range of coordinates used to cre&#8208;
       ate objects in the SUN/X11 version of gremlin.  However, files with nega&#8208;
       tive coordinates will cause problems if displayed on the AED.
