GROFF_MAN(7)                                                        GROFF_MAN(7)



NAME
       groff_man - groff `man&apos; macros to support generation of man pages

SYNOPSIS
       groff -man [options ...] [files ...]
       groff -m man [options ...] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  man  macros  used  to  generate man pages with groff were written by
       James Clark.  This document provides a brief summary of the use  of  each
       macro in that package.

OPTIONS
       The  man  macros  understand  the  following  command line options (which
       define various registers).

       -rcR=1 This option (the default if in nroff mode) creates a single,  very
              long page instead of multiple pages.  Say -rcR=0 to disable it.

       -rC1   If  more than one manual page is given on the command line, number
              the pages continuously, rather than starting each at 1.

       -rD1   Double-sided printing.  Footers for even and odd pages are format&#8208;
              ted differently.

       -rFT=dist
              Set  distance  of the footer relative to the bottom of the page if
              negative or relative to the  top  if  positive.   The  default  is
              -0.5i.

       -rHY=flags
              Set hyphenation flags.  Possible values are 1 to hyphenate without
              restrictions, 2 to not hyphenate the last word on a page, 4 to not
              hyphenate  the last two characters of a word, and 8 to not hyphen&#8208;
              ate the first two characters of a word.  These  values  are  addi&#8208;
              tive; the default is 14.

       -rIN=width
              Set  body text indentation to width.  The default is 7n for nroff,
              7.2n for troff.  For nroff, this value should always be an integer
              multiple of unit `n&apos; to get consistent indentation.

       -rLL=line-length
              Set  line length.  If this option is not given, the line length is
              set to respect any value set by a prior `.ll&apos; request, (which must
              be  in  effect  when  the `.TH&apos; macro is invoked), if this differs
              from the built-in default for the formatter; otherwise it defaults
              to 78n in nroff mode and 6.5i in troff mode.

              Note that the use of a `.ll&apos; request to initialize the line length
              is supported for backward compatibility with some versions of  the
              man  program;  direct  initialization  of the `LL&apos; register should
              always be preferred to the use of such a request.  In  particular,
              note  that  a `.ll 65n&apos; request does not preserve the normal nroff
              default line length, (the man default initialization to  78n  pre&#8208;
              vails),   whereas,   the   `-rLL=65n&apos;  option,  or  an  equivalent
              `.nr LL 65n&apos; request preceding the use of the `TH&apos; macro, does set
              a line length of 65n.

       -rLT=title-length
              Set  title  length.  If this option is not given, the title length
              defaults to the line length.

       -rPnnn Enumeration of pages start with nnn rather than with 1.

       -rSxx  Base document font size is xx points (xx can be  10,  11,  or  12)
              rather than 10 points.

       -rSN=width
              Set sub-subheading indentation to width.  The default is 3n.

       -rXnnn After  page nnn, number pages as nnna, nnnb, nnnc, etc.  For exam&#8208;
              ple, the option `-rX2&apos; produces the following page numbers: 1,  2,
              2a, 2b, 2c, etc.

USAGE
       This  section  describes the available macros for manual pages.  For fur&#8208;
       ther customization, put additional macros  and  requests  into  the  file
       man.local which is loaded immediately after the man package.

       .TH title section [extra1] [extra2] [extra3]
              Set the title of the man page to title and the section to section,
              which must take on a value between 1 and 8.  The value section may
              also  have  a  string appended, e.g. `.pm&apos;, to indicate a specific
              subsection of the man pages.  Both title  and  section  are  posi&#8208;
              tioned  at  the left and right in the header line (with section in
              parentheses immediately appended to title.  extra1  is  positioned
              in  the  middle  of  the footer line.  extra2 is positioned at the
              left in the footer line (or at the left on even pages and  at  the
              right on odd pages if double-sided printing is active).  extra3 is
              centered in the header line.

              For HTML output, headers and footers are completely suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the  new  line  number
              is  1  again  (except if the `-rC1&apos; option is given on the command
              line) -- this feature is intended  only  for  formatting  multiple
              man  pages;  a single man page should contain exactly one TH macro
              at the beginning of the file.

       .SH [text for a heading]
              Set up an unnumbered section heading sticking  out  to  the  left.
              Prints out all the text following SH up to the end of the line (or
              the text in the next input line if there is no argument to SH)  in
              bold  face  (or  the  font  specified  by the string HF), one size
              larger than the base document size.  Additionally, the left margin
              and the indentation for the following text is reset to the default
              values.

       .SS [text for a heading]
              Set up a secondary, unnumbered section heading.   Prints  out  all
              the  text  following  SS up to the end of the line (or the text in
              the next input line if there is no argument to SS)  in  bold  face
              (or  the font specified by the string HF), at the same size as the
              base document size.  Additionally, the left margin and the  inden&#8208;
              tation for the following text is reset to the default values.

       .TP [nnn]
              Set  up  an indented paragraph with label.  The indentation is set
              to nnn if that argument is supplied (the default unit  is  `n&apos;  if
              omitted),  otherwise  it  is set to the previous indentation value
              specified with TP, IP, or HP (or to the default value if  none  of
              them have been used yet).

              The  first  input line of text following this macro is interpreted
              as a string to be printed flush-left, as it is appropriate  for  a
              label.   It is not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is
              no attempt to fill the first line with  text  from  the  following
              input  lines.   Nevertheless,  if  the label is not as wide as the
              indentation the paragraph starts at the same line (but  indented),
              continuing on the following lines.  If the label is wider than the
              indentation the descriptive part of the paragraph  begins  on  the
              line  following  the  label, entirely indented.  Note that neither
              font shape nor font size of the label is set to a  default  value;
              on the other hand, the rest of the text has default font settings.

              The  TP  macro is the macro used for the explanations you are just
              reading.

       .TQ    The TQ macro sets up header continuation for a  .TP  macro.   With
              it,  you can stack up any number of labels (such as in a glossary,
              or list of commands) before beginning the indented paragraph.  For
              an example, look just past the next paragraph.

              This  macro  is not defined on legacy Unix systems running classic
              troff.  To be certain your page will be portable to those systems,
              copy its definition from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installa&#8208;
              tion.

       .LP
       .PP
       .P     These macros are mutual aliases.  Any of them causes a line  break
              at the current position, followed by a vertical space downwards by
              the amount specified by the PD macro.  The font size and shape are
              reset  to  the  default value (normally 10pt Roman).  Finally, the
              current left margin and the indentation is reset  to  the  default
              values.

       .IP [designator] [nnn]
              Set  up  an  indented paragraph, using designator as a tag to mark
              its beginning.  The indentation is set to nnn if that argument  is
              supplied (the default unit is `n&apos; if omitted), otherwise it is set
              to the previous indentation value specified with TP, IP, or HP (or
              to  the  default  value if none of them have been used yet).  Font
              size and face of the paragraph (but not the designator) are  reset
              to its default values.

              To  start  an indented paragraph with a particular indentation but
              without a designator, use `&quot;&quot;&apos; (two doublequotes)  as  the  second
              argument.

              For example, the following paragraphs were all set up with bullets
              as the designator, using `.IP \(bu 4&apos;.  The whole block  has  been
              enclosed  with  `.RS&apos; and `.RE&apos; to set the left margin temporarily
              to the current indentation value.

              &#183;   IP is one of the three macros used in the man package to  for&#8208;
                  mat lists.

              &#183;   HP  is  another.   This macro produces a paragraph with a left
                  hanging indentation.

              &#183;   TP is another.  This macro produces an unindented  label  fol&#8208;
                  lowed by an indented paragraph.

       .HP [nnn]
              Set up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.  The indentation
              is set to nnn if that argument is supplied (the  default  unit  is
              `n&apos;  if  omitted), otherwise it is set to the previous indentation
              value specified with TP, IP, or HP (or to  the  default  value  if
              none of them have been used yet).  Font size and face are reset to
              its default  values.   The  following  paragraph  illustrates  the
              effect  of  this macro with hanging indentation set to 4 (enclosed
              by .RS and .RE to set the left margin temporarily to  the  current
              indentation):

              This  is  a paragraph following an invocation of the HP macro.  As
                  you can see, it produces a paragraph where all lines  but  the
                  first are indented.

              Use  of  this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  While it is
              universally portable to legacy Unix systems, a hanging indentation
              cannot be expressed naturally under HTML, and many HTML-based man&#8208;
              ual viewers simply interpret it as a starter for  a  normal  para&#8208;
              graph.   Thus, any information or distinction you tried to express
              with the indentation may be lost.

       .RS [nnn]
              This macro moves the left margin to the right by the value nnn  if
              specified (default unit is `n&apos;); otherwise it is set to the previ&#8208;
              ous indentation value specified with TP, IP,  or  HP  (or  to  the
              default  value  if none of them have been used yet).  The indenta&#8208;
              tion value is then set to the default.

              Calls to the RS macro can be nested.

       .RE [nnn]
              This macro moves the left margin back to level nnn, restoring  the
              previous left margin.  If no argument is given, it moves one level
              back.  The first level (i.e., no call to RS yet) has number 1, and
              each call to RS increases the level by 1.

       .EX
       .EE    Example/End  Example.   After EX, filling is disabled and the font
              is set to constant-width.  This is  useful  for  formatting  code,
              command,  and  configuration-file examples.  The EE macro restores
              the previous font.

              These macros are defined on many (but not all) legacy Unix systems
              running  classic  troff.  To be certain your page will be portable
              to those systems, copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac file
              of a groff installation.

       To  summarize, the following macros cause a line break with the insertion
       of vertical space (which amount can be changed with the  PD  macro):  SH,
       SS,  TP,  TQ, LP (PP, P), IP, and HP.  The macros RS, RE, EX, and EE also
       cause a break but no insertion of vertical space.

MACROS TO SET FONTS
       The standard font is Roman; the default text size is 10 point.

       .SM [text]
              Causes the text on the same line or the text  on  the  next  input
              line  to  appear in a font that is one point size smaller than the
              default font.

       .SB [text]
              Causes the text on the same line or the text  on  the  next  input
              line  to  appear in boldface font, one point size smaller than the
              default font.

       .BI text
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately  in  bold  face
              and  italic.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
              Thus

                     .BI this &quot;word and&quot; that

              would cause `this&apos; and `that&apos; to appear in bold face, while  `word
              and&apos; appears in italics.

       .IB text
              Causes  text  to  appear alternately in italic and bold face.  The
              text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       .RI text
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately  in  roman  and
              italic.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       .IR text
              Causes  text  on the same line to appear alternately in italic and
              roman.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       .BR text
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately  in  bold  face
              and roman.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       .RB text
              Causes  text  on  the same line to appear alternately in roman and
              bold face.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       .B [text]
              Causes text to appear in bold face.  If no text is present on  the
              line  where  the  macro  is called the text of the next input line
              appears in bold face.

       .I [text]
              Causes text to appear in italic.  If no text  is  present  on  the
              line  where  the  macro  is called the text of the next input line
              appears in italic.

MACROS TO DESCRIBE HYPERLINKS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES
       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running clas&#8208;
       sic  troff.   To  be certain your page will be portable to those systems,
       copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.

       Using these macros helps ensure that you get hyperlinks when your  manual
       page is rendered in a browser or other program that is Web-enabled.

       .UR URL
       .UE [punctuation]
              Wrap  a  World Wide Web hyperlink.  The argument to UR is the URL;
              thereafter, lines until UE are collected  and  used  as  the  link
              text.   Any  argument  to the UE macro is pasted to the end of the
              text.  On a device that is not a browser,

                     this is a link to
                     .UR http://\:randomsite.org/\:fubar
                     some random site
                     .UE ,
                     given as an example

              usually displays like this: &#8220;this is a link to  some  random  site
              &lt;http://randomsite.org/fubar&gt;, given as an example&#8221;.

              The  use  of \: to insert hyphenless breakpoints is a groff exten&#8208;
              sion and can be omitted.

       .MT address
       .ME [punctuation]
              Wrap an email address.  The argument of MT is  the  address;  text
              following,  until ME, is a name to be associated with the address.
              Any argument to the ME macro is pasted to  the  end  of  the  link
              text.  On a device that is not a browser,

                     contact
                     .UR fred.foonly@\:fubar.net
                     Fred Foonly
                     .UE
                     for more information

              usually  displays  like  this:  &#8220;contact Fred Foonly &lt;fred.foonly@
              fubar.net&gt; for more information&#8221;.

              The use of \: to insert hyphenless breakpoints is a  groff  exten&#8208;
              sion and can be omitted.

MACROS TO DESCRIBE COMMAND SYNOPSES
       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running clas&#8208;
       sic troff.  To be certain your page will be portable  to  those  systems,
       copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.

       These  macros  are a convenience for authors.  They also assist automated
       translation tools and help browsers in recognizing command  synopses  and
       treating them differently from running text.

       .SY command
              Begin  synopsis.   Takes a single argument, the name of a command.
              Text following, until closed by YS, is set with a hanging indenta&#8208;
              tion  with  the  width of command plus a space.  This produces the
              traditional look of a Unix command synopsis.

       .OP key value
              Describe an optional command  argument.   The  arguments  of  this
              macro  are  set  surrounded  by option braces in the default Roman
              font; the first argument is printed with a bold  face,  while  the
              second argument is typeset as italic.

       .YS    This  macro  restores  normal  indentation at the end of a command
              synopsis.

       Here is a real example:

              .SY groff
              .OP \-abcegiklpstzCEGNRSUVXZ
              .OP \-d cs
              .OP \-f fam
              .OP \-F dir
              .OP \-I dir
              .OP \-K arg
              .OP \-L arg
              .OP \-m name
              .OP \-M dir

                    [-P arg] [-r cn] [-T dev] [-w name] [-W name] [file ...]

       If necessary, you might use br requests to control  line  breaking.   You
       can  insert  plain text as well; this looks like the traditional (unorna&#8208;
       mented) syntax for a required command argument or filename.
&#12;MISCELLANEOUS
       The default indentation is 7.2n in troff mode and 7n in nroff mode except
       for grohtml which ignores indentation.

       .DT    Set tabs every 0.5 inches.  Since this macro is always called dur&#8208;
              ing a TH request, it makes sense to call it only if the tab  posi&#8208;
              tions have been changed.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It translates
              poorly to HTML, under which exact whitespace control  and  tabbing
              are not readily available.  Thus, information or distinctions that
              you use DT to express are likely to be lost.  If you feel  tempted
              to  use  it,  you  should  probably  be  composing  a  table using
              tbl(@MAN1DIR@) markup instead.

       .PD [nnn]
              Adjust the empty space before a new  paragraph  or  section.   The
              optional argument gives the amount of space (default unit is `v&apos;);
              without parameter, the value is reset to its default value (1 line
              in  nroff  mode, 0.4v otherwise).  This affects the macros SH, SS,
              TP, LP (resp. PP and P), IP, and HP.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It translates
              poorly to HTML, under which exact control of inter-paragraph spac&#8208;
              ing is not readily available.  Thus, information  or  distinctions
              that you use PD to express are likely to be lost.

       .AT [system [release]]
              Alter the footer for use with AT&amp;T man pages.  This command exists
              only for compatibility; don&apos;t use it.  See the groff  info  manual
              for more.

       .UC [version]
              Alter  the footer for use with BSD man pages.  This command exists
              only for compatibility; don&apos;t use it.  See the groff  info  manual
              for more.

       .PT    Print  the  header  string.  Redefine this macro to get control of
              the header.

       .BT    Print the footer string.  Redefine this macro to  get  control  of
              the footer.

       The following strings are defined:

       \*S    Switch back to the default font size.

       \*R    The `registered&apos; sign.

       \*(Tm  The `trademark&apos; sign.

       \*(lq
       \*(rq  Left and right quote.  This is equal to `\(lq&apos; and `\(rq&apos;, respec&#8208;
              tively.

       \*(HF  The typeface used to print headings and subheadings.  The  default
              is `B&apos;.

       If a preprocessor like tbl or eqn is needed, it has become common to make
       the first line of the man page look like this:

              &apos;\&quot; word

       Note the single space character after the double quote.  word consists of
       letters for the needed preprocessors: `e&apos; for eqn, `r&apos; for refer, and `t&apos;
       for tbl.  Modern implementations of the man program read this first  line
       and automatically call the right preprocessor(s).

PORTABILITY AND TROFF REQUESTS
       Since  the  man  macros  consist of groups of groff requests, one can, in
       principle, supplement the functionality of the man macros with individual
       groff  requests where necessary.  See the groff info pages for a complete
       reference of all requests.

       Note, however, that using raw troff requests is likely to make your  page
       render  poorly  on the (increasingly common) class of viewers that render
       it to HTML.  Troff requests make implicit assumptions about  things  like
       character  and  page  sizes  that may break in an HTML environment; also,
       many of these viewers don&apos;t interpret the full troff vocabulary, a  prob&#8208;
       lem which can lead to portions of your text being silently dropped.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page entirely
       in the requests described on this page.  Further,  it  is  best  to  com&#8208;
       pletely  avoid  those  we have described as `presentation-level&apos; (HP, PD,
       and DT).

       The  macros  we  have  described  as  extensions  (.EX/.EE,  .SY/.OP/.YS,
       .UR/.UE, and .MT/.ME) should be used with caution, as they may not yet be
       built in to some viewer that is important to your audience.  If in doubt,
       copy the implementation onto your page.

FILES
       man.tmac
       an.tmac
              These are wrapper files to call andoc.tmac.

       andoc.tmac
              Use this file in case you don&apos;t know whether the man macros or the
              mdoc package should be used.  Multiple man pages (in  either  for&#8208;
              mat) can be handled.

       an-old.tmac
              Most man macros are contained in this file.

       an-ext.tmac
              The  extension  macro definitions for .SY, .OP, .YS, .TQ, .EX/.EE,
              .UR/.UE, and .MT/.ME are contained in this file.  It is written in
              classic  troff,  and released for free re-use, and not copylefted;
              manual page authors concerned about  portability  to  legacy  Unix
              systems are encouraged to copy these definitions into their pages,
              and maintainers of troff or its workalikes are encouraged  to  re-
              use them.

       man.local
              Local changes and customizations should be put into this file.
