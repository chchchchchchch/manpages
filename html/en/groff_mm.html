GROFF_MM(7)                                                          GROFF_MM(7)



NAME
       groff_mm - groff mm macros

SYNOPSIS
       groff -mm [ options... ] [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  groff mm macros are intended to be compatible with the DWB mm macros
       with the following limitations:

       &#183;      No Bell Labs localisms are implemented.

       &#183;      The macros OK and PM are not implemented.

       &#183;      groff mm does not support cut marks.

       mm is intended to support easy localization.  Use mmse as an example  how
       to adapt the output format to a national standard.  Localized strings are
       collected in  the  file  `/usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac/xx.tmac&apos;,  where  xx
       denotes  the  two-letter code for the language, as defined in the ISO 639
       standard.  For Swedish, this is `sv.tmac&apos; &#8211; not `se&apos;, which  is  the  ISO
       3166  two-letter  code  for  the  country  (as used for the output format
       localization).

       A file called locale or country_locale is read after  the  initialization
       of the global variables.  It is therefore possible to localize the macros
       with a different company name and so on.

       In this manual, square brackets are used to show optional arguments.

   Number registers and strings
       Many macros can be controlled by number registers and strings.  A  number
       register is assigned with the nr command:

              .nr XXX [&#177;]n [i]

       XXX  is the name of the register, n is the value to be assigned, and i is
       the increment value for auto-increment.  n can have a plus or minus  sign
       as  a prefix if an increment or decrement of the current value is wanted.
       (Auto-increment or auto-decrement occurs if the number register  is  used
       with a plus or minus sign, \n+[XXX] or \n-[XXX].)

       Strings are defined with ds.

              .ds YYY string

       The  string  is  assigned everything to the end of the line, even blanks.
       Initial  blanks  in  string  should  be  prefixed  with  a  double-quote.
       (Strings are used in the text as \*[YYY].)

   Special formatting of number registers
       A  number  register  is  printed with normal digits if no format has been
       given.  Set the format with af:

              .af R c

       R is the name of the register, c is the format.

              tab(@); lb lb l l.  Form@Sequence 1@0, 1, 2, 3, ...  001@000, 001,
              002,  003, ...  i@0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...  I@0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a@0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...  A@0, A, B, C, ..., Z,  AA,  AB,
              ...

   Fonts
       In  mm,  the  fonts  (or rather, font styles) R (normal), I (italic), and
       B (bold) are hardwired to font  positions  1,  2,  and  3,  respectively.
       Internally,  font positions are used for backwards compatibility.  From a
       practical point of view it doesn&apos;t make a big difference  &#8211;  a  different
       font  family  can  still  be  selected with a call to the .fam request or
       using groff&apos;s -f command line option.  On the other hand, if you want  to
       replace  just,  say,  font  B, you have to replace the font at position 2
       (with a call to `.fp 2 ...&apos;).

   Macros
       )E level text
              Add heading text text to the table of contents with  level,  which
              is  either  0 or in the range 1 to 7.  See also .H.  This macro is
              used for customized tables of contents.

       1C [1] Begin one-column processing.  A 1 as an argument disables the page
              break.  Use wide footnotes, small footnotes may be overprinted.

       2C     Begin  two-column processing.  Splits the page in two columns.  It
              is a special case of MC.  See also 1C.

       AE     Abstract end, see AS.

       AF [name-of-firm]
              Author&apos;s firm, should be called before AU, see also COVER.

       AL [type [text-indent [1]]]
              Start auto-increment list.  Items are numbered beginning with one.
              The type argument controls the format of numbers.

                     tab(@);  lb lb l l.  Arg@Description 1@Arabic (the default)
                     A@Upper-case  letters  (A-Z)  a@Lower-case  letters   (a-z)
                     I@Upper-case roman i@Lower-case roman

              text-indent  sets the indentation and overrides Li.  A third argu&#8208;
              ment prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       APP name text
              Begin an appendix with name name.  Automatic naming occurs if name
              is  &quot;&quot;.   The appendices start with A if automatic naming is used.
              A new page is ejected, and a header is also produced if the number
              variable  Aph  is  non-zero.   This  is the default.  The appendix
              always appears in the `List of contents&apos; with  correct  page  num&#8208;
              bers.   The  name  `APPENDIX&apos; can be changed by setting the string
              App to the desired text.  The string Apptxt contains  the  current
              appendix text.

       APPSK name pages text
              Same as .APP, but the page number is incremented with pages.  This
              is  used  when  diagrams  or  other  non-formatted  documents  are
              included as appendices.

       AS [arg [indent]]
              Abstract start.  Indentation is specified in `ens&apos;, but scaling is
              allowed.  Argument arg controls where the abstract is printed.

              tab(@); lb lb l lx.  Arg@Placement 0@T{  Abstract  is  printed  on
              page  1 and on the cover sheet if used in the released-paper style
              (MT 4), otherwise it is printed on page 1 without a  cover  sheet.
              T}  1@Abstract  is  only  printed  on the cover sheet (MT 4 only).
              2@T{ Abstract is printed only on the cover sheet (other than MT  4
              only).  The cover sheet is printed without a need for CS.  T}

              An abstract is not printed at all in external letters (MT 5).  The
              indent parameter controls the indentation of both margins,  other&#8208;
              wise normal text indentation is used.

       AST [title]
              Abstract  title.   Default is `ABSTRACT&apos;.  Sets the text above the
              abstract text.

       AT title1 [title2 [...]]
              Author&apos;s title.  AT must appear just after  each  AU.   The  title
              shows up after the name in the signature block.

       AU [name [initials [loc [dept [ext [room [arg [arg [arg]]]]]]]]]
              Author  information.   Specifies  the author of the memo or paper,
              and is printed on the cover sheet and on other similar places.  AU
              must  not  appear  before  TL.  The author information can contain
              initials, location, department, telephone extension,  room  number
              or name and up to three extra arguments.

       AV [name [1]]
              Approval  signature.   Generates  an  approval line with place for
              signature and date.  The string `APPROVED:&apos; can  be  changed  with
              variable  Letapp;  it  is replaced with an empty lin if there is a
              second argument.  The string `Date&apos; can be changed  with  variable
              Letdate.

       AVL [name]
              Letter signature.  Generates a line with place for signature.

       B [bold-text [prev-font-text [bold [...]]]]
              Begin  boldface.   No limit on the number of arguments.  All argu&#8208;
              ments are concatenated to one word; the first, third and so on  is
              printed in boldface.

       B1     Begin  box  (as  the ms macro).  Draws a box around the text.  The
              text is indented one character, and the right margin is one  char&#8208;
              acter shorter.

       B2     End box.  Finishes the box started with B1.

       BE     End bottom block, see BS.

       BI [bold-text [italic-text [bold-text [...]]]]
              Bold-italic.  No limit on the number of arguments, see B.

       BL [text-indent [1]]
              Start  bullet  list.  Initializes a list with a bullet and a space
              in the beginning of each list item (see  LI).   text-indent  over&#8208;
              rides the default indentation of the list items set by number reg&#8208;
              ister Pi.  A third argument prohibits printing  of  a  blank  line
              before each item.

       BR [bold-text [roman-text [bold-text [...]]]]
              Bold-roman.  No limit on the number of arguments.

       BS     Bottom  block  start.  Begins the definition of a text block which
              is printed at the bottom of each page.  The block ends with BE.

       BVL text-indent [mark-indent [1]]
              Start of broken variable-item list.  Broken variable-item list has
              no  fixed  mark, it assumes that every LI has a mark instead.  The
              text always begins at the next line after the  mark.   text-indent
              sets  the  indentation  to  the text, and mark-indent the distance
              from the current indentation to the mark.  A third  argument  pro&#8208;
              hibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       COVER [arg]
              Begin  a  coversheet  definition.   It  is  important  that .COVER
              appears before any normal text.  This macro uses arg to build  the
              filename `/usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac/mm/arg.cov&apos;.  Therefore it is
              possible to create unlimited types of cover sheets.   `ms.cov&apos;  is
              supposed  to  look  like  the  ms  cover sheet.  .COVER requires a
              .COVEND at the end of the cover definition.  Always use this order
              of the cover macros:

                     .COVER
                     .TL
                     .AF
                     .AU
                     .AT
                     .AS
                     .AE
                     .COVEND

              However, only .TL and .AU are required.

       COVEND Finish  the  cover  description  and  print the cover page.  It is
              defined in the cover file.

       DE     Display end.  Ends a block of text or display that begins with  DS
              or DF.

       DF [format [fill [rindent]]]
              Begin  floating  display (no nesting allowed).  A floating display
              is saved in a queue and is printed in the order entered.   Format,
              fill,  and  rindent  are the same as in DS.  Floating displays are
              controlled by the two number registers De and Df.

              De register

                     tab(@); l lx.  0@T{ Nothing special, this is  the  default.
                     T}  1@T{  A  page  eject occurs after each printed display,
                     giving only one display per page and no text following  it.
                     T}

              Df register

                     tab(@); l lx.  0@T{ Displays are printed at the end of each
                     section (when section-page numbering is active) or  at  the
                     end  of  the document.  T} 1@T{ A new display is printed on
                     the current page if there is enough space, otherwise it  is
                     printed at the end of the document.  T} 2@T{ One display is
                     printed at the top of each page or column (in  multi-column
                     mode).   T} 3@T{ Print one display if there is enough space
                     for it, otherwise it is printed at the top of the next page
                     or column.  T} 4@T{ Print as many displays as possible in a
                     new page or column.  A page break occurs between each  dis&#8208;
                     play if De is not zero.  T} 5@T{ Fill the current page with
                     displays and the rest beginning at a new  page  or  column.
                     (This  is  the  default.)  A page break occurs between each
                     display if De is not zero.  T}

       DL [text-indent [1 [1]]]
              Dash list start.  Begins a list where each item is printed after a
              dash.   text-indent  changes  the  default indentation of the list
              items set by number register Pi.  A second  argument  prevents  an
              empty line between each list item.  See LI.  A third argument pro&#8208;
              hibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       DS [format [fill [rindent]]]
              Static display start.  Begins collection of text  until  DE.   The
              text  is  printed  together  on the same page, unless it is longer
              than the height of the page.  DS can be nested arbitrarily.

              format
&#12;                     tab(@); l lx.   &quot;&quot;@No  indentation.   none@No  indentation.

                     whole  display  as  a  block.   R@Right-adjust  the  lines.
                     RB@Right-adjust the whole display as a block.

              The values `L&apos;, `I&apos;, `C&apos;, and `CB&apos; can also be specified  as  `0&apos;,
              `1&apos;, `2&apos;, and `3&apos;, respectively, for compatibility reasons.

              fill

                     tab(@);  l l.  &quot;&quot;@Line-filling turned off.  none@Line-fill&#8208;
                     ing turned off.  N@Line-filling turned off.  F@Line-filling
                     turned on.

              `N&apos; and `F&apos; can also be specified as `0&apos; and `1&apos;, respectively.

              By default, an empty line is printed before and after the display.
              Setting number register Ds to 0 prevents this.   rindent  shortens
              the line length by that amount.

       EC [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Equation title.  Sets a title for an equation.  The override argu&#8208;
              ment changes the numbering.

              flag

                     tab(@); l lx.  none@T{ override is a prefix to the  number.
                     T}  0@T{ override is a prefix to the number.  T} 1@T{ over&#8208;
                     ride is a suffix to the number.  T} 2@T{ override  replaces
                     the number.  T}

              EC  uses  the  number register Ec as a counter.  It is possible to
              use .af to change the format of the number.  If number register Of
              is  1,  the format of title uses a dash instead of a dot after the
              number.

              The string Le controls the title of the List of Equations; default
              is  `LIST OF EQUATIONS&apos;.  The List of Equations is only printed if
              number register Le is 1.  The default is 0.  The string Liec  con&#8208;
              tains the word `Equation&apos;, which is printed before the number.  If
              refname is used, then the equation number is saved with .SETR, and
              can be retrieved with `.GETST refname&apos;.

              Special  handling  of the title occurs if EC is used inside DS/DE;
              it is not affected by the format of DS.

       EF [arg]
              Even-page footer, printed just above the  normal  page  footer  on
              even pages.  See PF.

              This macro defines string EOPef.

       EH [arg]
              Even-page  header,  printed  just  below the normal page header on
              even pages.  See PH.

              This macro defines string TPeh.

       EN     Equation end, see EQ.

       EOP    End-of-page user-defined macro.  This macro is called  instead  of
              the  normal  printing  of  the footer.  The macro is executed in a
              separate environment, without any trap active.  See TP.

              strings available to EOP
&#12;              tab(@); l l.  EOPf@argument of PF EOPef@argument of EF EOPof@argu&#8208;
              ment of OF

       EPIC [-L] width height [name]
              Draw  a  box  with the given width and height.  It also prints the
              text name or a default string if name is not specified.   This  is
              used  to include external pictures; just give the size of the pic&#8208;
              ture.  -L left-adjusts the picture; the default is to center.  See
              PIC.

       EQ [label]
              Equation  start.   EQ/EN  are the delimiters for equations written
              for eqn(1).  EQ/EN must be inside of a DS/DE pair, except if EQ is
              used  to  set options for eqn only.  The label argument appears at
              the right margin of the equation, centered vertically  within  the
              DS/DE  block,  unless  number  register  Eq  is 1.  Then the label
              appears at the left margin.

              If there are multiple EQ/EN blocks within  a  single  DS/DE  pair,
              only the last equation label (if any) is printed.

       EX [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Exhibit title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  EX uses the
              number register Ex as a counter.  The string Lx controls the title
              of  the List of Exhibits; default is `LIST OF EXHIBITS&apos;.  The List
              of Exhibits is only printed if number register Lx is 1,  which  is
              the  default.   The string Liex contains the word `Exhibit&apos;, which
              is printed before the number.  If refname  is  used,  the  exhibit
              number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved with `.GETST ref&#8208;
              name&apos;.

              Special handling of the title occurs if EX is used  inside  DS/DE;
              it is not affected by the format of DS.

       FC [closing]
              Print `Yours very truly,&apos; as a formal closing of a letter or memo&#8208;
              randum.  The argument replaces the default string.  The default is
              stored in string variable Letfc.

       FD [arg [1]]
              Footnote default format.  Controls the hyphenation (hyphen), right
              margin justification (adjust), and indentation  of  footnote  text
              (indent).  It can also change the label justification (ljust).

       FG [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Figure  title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  FG uses the
              number register Fg as a counter.  The string Lf controls the title
              of the List of Figures; default is `LIST OF FIGURES&apos;.  The List of
              Figures is only printed if number register Lf is 1, which  is  the
              default.   The  string  Lifg  contains the word `Figure&apos;, which is
              printed before the number.  If refname is used,  then  the  figure
              number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved with `.GETST ref&#8208;
              name&apos;.

              Special handling of the title occurs if FG is used  inside  DS/DE,
              it is not affected by the format of DS.

       FS [label]
              Footnote  start.   The footnote is ended by FE.  By default, foot&#8208;
              notes are automatically  numbered;  the  number  is  available  in
              string  F.  Just add \*F in the text.  By adding label, it is pos&#8208;
              sible to have other number or names on the  footnotes.   Footnotes
              in  displays are now possible.  An empty line separates footnotes;
              the height of the  line  is  controlled  by  number  register  Fs,
              default value is 1.

       GETHN refname [varname]
              Include  the  header number where the corresponding `SETR refname&apos;
              was placed.  This is displayed as `X.X.X.&apos; in pass 1.  See  INITR.
              If  varname is used, GETHN sets the string variable varname to the
              header number.

       GETPN refname [varname]
              Include the page number where the corresponding `SETR refname&apos; was
              placed.   This  is  displayed as `9999&apos; in pass 1.  See INITR.  If
              varname is used, GETPN sets the stringvariable varname to the page
              number.

       GETR refname
              Combine GETHN and GETPN with the text `chapter&apos; and `, page&apos;.  The
              string Qrf contains the text for the reference:

                     .ds Qrf See chapter \\*[Qrfh], page \\*[Qrfp].

              Qrf may be changed to support other languages.  Strings  Qrfh  and
              Qrfp  are  set  by  GETR  and  contain the page and header number,
              respectively.

       GETST refname [varname]
              Include the string saved with the second argument to .SETR.   This
              is a dummy string in pass 1.  If varname is used, GETST sets it to
              the saved string.  See INITR.

       H level [heading-text [heading-suffix]]
              Numbered section  heading.   Section  headers  can  have  a  level
              between  1 and 14; level 1 is the top level.  The text is given in
              heading-text, and must be surrounded by double quotes if  it  con&#8208;
              tains  spaces.   heading-suffix is added to the header in the text
              but not in the table of contents.  This is normally used for foot&#8208;
              note  marks  and similar things.  Don&apos;t use \*F in heading-suffix,
              it doesn&apos;t work.  A manual label must be used, see FS.

              A call to the paragraph macro  P  directly  after  H  is  ignored.
              H takes care of spacing and indentation.

              Page ejection before heading

                     Number  register Ej controls page ejection before the head&#8208;
                     ing.  By default, a level-one heading gets two blank  lines
                     before  it;  higher  levels  only  get  one.  A new page is
                     ejected before each first-level heading if number  register
                     Ej  is  1.  All levels below or equal the value of Ej get a
                     new page.  Default value for Ej is 0.

              Heading break level

                     A line break occurs after the heading if the heading  level
                     is  less  or  equal  to  number register Hb.  Default value
                     is 2.

              Heading space level

                     A blank line is inserted after the heading if  the  heading
                     level  is  less  or  equal  to number register Hs.  Default
                     value is 2.

                     Text follows the heading on the same line if the  level  is
                     greater than both Hb and Hs.

              Post-heading indent

                     Indentation  of the text after the heading is controlled by
                     number register Hi.  Default value is 0.

                     Hi

                     tab(@); l lx.  0@The text is left-justified.  1@T{ Indenta&#8208;
                     tion  of the text follows the value of number register Pt ,
                     see P.  T} 2@T{ The text is lined up with the first word of
                     the heading.  T}

              Centered section headings

                     All  headings whose level is equal or below number register
                     Hc and also less than or equal to Hb or Hs are centerered.

              Font control of the heading

                     The font of each heading level is controlled by string  HF.
                     It  contains  a  font  number  or font name for each level.
                     Default value is

                            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

                     (all headings in italic).  This could also be written as

                            I I I I I I I I I I I I I I

                     Note that some other implementations use 3 3 2 2 2 2  2  as
                     the default value.  All omitted values are presumed to have
                     value 1.

              Point size control

                     String HP controls the point size of each heading,  in  the
                     same way as HF controls the font.  A value of 0 selects the
                     default point size.  Default value is

                            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

                     Beware that only the point size changes, not  the  vertical
                     size.   The  latter can be controlled by the user-specified
                     macros HX and/or HZ.

              Heading counters

                     Fourteen number registers named H1 up to  H14  contain  the
                     counter  for  each  heading  level.  The values are printed
                     using arabic numerals; this can be changed with  the  macro
                     HM  (see  below).  All marks are concatenated before print&#8208;
                     ing.  To avoid this, set number register  Ht  to  1.   This
                     only prints the current heading counter at each heading.

              Automatic table of contents

                     All  headings whose level is equal or below number register
                     Cl are saved to  be  printed  in  the  table  of  contents.
                     Default value is 2.

              Special control of the heading, user-defined macros

                     The  following  macros  can be defined by the user to get a
                     finer control of vertical spacing,  fonts,  or  other  fea&#8208;
                     tures.   Argument  level  is the level-argument to H, but 0
                     for unnumbered headings (see HU).  Argument rlevel  is  the
                     real  level; it is set to number register Hu for unnumbered
                     headings.  Argument heading-text is the text argument to  H
                     and HU.

                     HX level rlevel heading-text
                            This macro is called just before the printing of the
                            heading.  The following registers are available  for
                            HX.  Note that HX may alter }0, }2, and ;3.

                            }0 (string)
                                   Contains  the heading mark plus two spaces if
                                   rlevel is non-zero, otherwise empty.

                            ;0 (register)
                                   Contains the position of the text  after  the
                                   heading.  0 means that the text should follow
                                   the heading on the same line, 1 means that  a
                                   line  break should occur before the text, and
                                   2 means that a blank line should separate the
                                   heading and the text.

                            }2 (string)
                                   Contains  two spaces if register ;0 is 0.  It
                                   is used to  separate  the  heading  from  the
                                   text.  The string is empty if ;0 is non-zero.

                            ;3 (register)
                                   Contains  the needed space in units after the
                                   heading.  Default is  2v.   Can  be  used  to
                                   change  things  like numbering (}0), vertical
                                   spacing (}2), and the needed space after  the
                                   heading.

                     HY dlevel rlevel heading-text
                            This  macro  is  called after size and font calcula&#8208;
                            tions and might be used to change indentation.

                     HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text
                            This macro is called after the printing of the head&#8208;
                            ing,  just  before  H  or  HU exits.  Can be used to
                            change the page  header  according  to  the  section
                            heading.

       HC [hyphenation-character]
              Set  hyphenation character.  Default value is `\%&apos;.  Resets to the
              default if called without argument.  Hyphenation can be turned off
              by setting number register Hy to 0 at the beginning of the file.

       HM [arg1 [arg2 [... [arg14]]]]
              Heading  mark style.  Controls the type of marking for printing of
              the heading counters.  Default is 1 for all levels.

              Argument

              tab(@); l l.  1@Arabic numerals.  0001@Arabic numerals with  lead&#8208;
              ing  zeroes,  one  or  more.  A@upper-case alphabetic a@lower-case
              alphabetic I@upper-case roman numerals i@lower-case roman numerals
              &quot;&quot;@Arabic numerals.

       HU heading-text
              Unnumbered section header.  HU behaves like H at the level in num&#8208;
              ber register Hu.  See H.

       HX dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined  heading  exit.   Called  just  before  printing  the
              header.  See H.
&#12;       HY dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined  heading  exit.   Called  just  before  printing  the
              header.  See H.

       HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined heading exit.  Called just after printing the header.
              See H.

       I [italic-text [prev-font-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic.   Changes  the font to italic if called without arguments.
              With one argument it sets the word in italic.  With two  arguments
              it  concatenates  them  and  sets the first word in italic and the
              second in the previous font.  There is no limit on the  number  of
              argument; all are concatenated.

       IA [addressee-name [title]]
              Begin  specification  of  the addressee and addressee&apos;s address in
              letter style.  Several names can be specified  with  empty  IA/IE-
              pairs, but only one address.  See LT.

       IB [italic-text [bold-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic-bold.   Even  arguments are printed in italic, odd in bold&#8208;
              face.  See I.

       IE     End the address specification after IA.

       INITI type filename [macro]
              Initialize the new index system and set the  filename  to  collect
              index lines in with IND.  Argument type selects the type of index:
              page number, header marks or both.  The default is page numbers.

              It is also possible to create a macro that is responsible for for&#8208;
              matting  each row; just add the name of the macro as a third argu&#8208;
              ment.  The macro is then called with the index as argument(s).

              type

              tab(@); l lx.  N@Page numbers H@Header marks B@T{ Both  page  num&#8208;
              bers and header marks, separated with a tab character.  T}

       INITR filename
              Initialize  the  refence macros.  References are written to stderr
              and are supposed to be written to  `filename.qrf&apos;.   Requires  two
              passes  with  groff;  this is handled by a separate program called
              mmroff(1).  This program exists because groff(1) by default  deac&#8208;
              tivates  the  unsafe  operations  that are required by INITR.  The
              first pass looks for references, and the second one includes them.
              INITR  can  be used several times, but it is only the first occur&#8208;
              rence of INITR that is active.

              See also SETR, GETPN, and GETHN.

       IND arg1 [arg2 [...]]
              Write a line in the index file selected by INITI  with  all  argu&#8208;
              ments and the page number or header mark separated by tabs.

                     Examples

                     arg1\tpage number
                     arg1\targ2\tpage number
                     arg1\theader mark
                     arg1\tpage number\theader mark

       INDP   Print  the  index by running the command specified by string vari&#8208;
              able Indcmd, which has `sort -t\t&apos; as  the  default  value.   INDP
              reads the output from the command to form the index, by default in
              two columns (this can be changed by defining TYIND).  The index is
              printed  with string variable Index as header, default is `INDEX&apos;.
              One-column processing is reactivated after the list.   INDP  calls
              the user-defined macros TXIND, TYIND, and TZIND if defined.  TXIND
              is called before printing the  string  `INDEX&apos;,  TYIND  is  called
              instead  of printing `INDEX&apos;, and TZIND is called after the print&#8208;
              ing and should take care of restoring to normal operation again.

       ISODATE [0]
              Change the predefined date string in DT to  ISO-format,  this  is,
              `YYYY-MM-DD&apos;.  This can also be done by adding -rIso=1 on the com&#8208;
              mand line.  Reverts to old date format if argument is 0.

       IR [italic-text [roman-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic-roman.  Even arguments are printed in italic, odd in roman.
              See I.

       LB text-indent mark-indent pad type [mark [LI-space [LB-space]]]
              List-begin  macro.   This  is the common macro used for all lists.
              text-indent is the number of spaces to indent the  text  from  the
              current indentation.

              pad  and  mark-indent  control where to put the mark.  The mark is
              placed within the mark area, and mark-indent sets  the  number  of
              spaces  before this area.  By default it is 0.  The mark area ends
              where the text begins.  The start of the text is still  controlled
              by text-indent.

              The  mark  is left-justified whitin the mark area if pad is 0.  If
              pad is greater than 0, mark-indent is ignored,  and  the  mark  is
              placed pad spaces before the text.  This right-justifies the mark.

              If  type  is  0  the  list either has a hanging indentation or, if
              argument mark is given, the string mark as a mark.

              If type is greater than 0 automatic numbering occurs, using arabic
              numbers  if mark is empty.  mark can then be any of `1&apos;, `A&apos;, `a&apos;,
              `I&apos;, or `i&apos;.

              type selects one of six possible ways to display the mark.

              type

                     tab(@); l l.  1@x.  2@x) 3@(x) 4@[x] 5@&lt;x&gt; 6@{x}

              Every item in the list gets LI-space number of blank lines  before
              them.  Default is 1.

              LB itself prints LB-space blank lines.  Default is 0.

       LC [list-level]
              List-status  clear.   Terminates  all current active lists down to
              list-level, or 0 if no argmuent is given.  This is used  by  H  to
              clear any active list.

       LE [1] List  end.   Terminates the current list.  LE outputs a blank line
              if an argument is given.

       LI [mark [1|2]]
              List item preceding every item in a list.   Without  argument,  LI
              prints the mark determined by the current list type.  By giving LI
              one argument, it uses that as the mark instead.  Two arguments  to
              LI  makes mark a prefix to the current mark.  There is no separat&#8208;
              ing space between the prefix and the mark if the  second  argument
              is  `2&apos;  instead  of  `1&apos;.  This behaviour can also be achieved by
              setting number register Limsp to zero.  A zero length mark makes a
              hanging indentation instead.

              A blank line is printed before the list item by default.  This be&#8208;
              haviour can be controlled  by  number  register  Ls.   Pre-spacing
              occurs  for  each  list  level  less than or equal to Ls.  Default
              value is 99.  There is no nesting limit.

              The  indentation  can  be  changed  through  number  register  Li.
              Default is 6.

              All  lists begin with a list initialization macro, LB.  There are,
              however, seven predefined list types to make lists easier to  use.
              They all call LB with different default values.

       LO type [arg]
              Specify  options in letter (see .LT).  This is a list of the stan&#8208;
              dard options:

                     T}

       MC column-size [column-separation]
              Begin  multiple columns.  Return to normal with 1C.  MC creates as
              many columns as the current line length permits.   column-size  is
              the  width  of  each  column,  and  column-separation is the space
              between two columns.  Default separation is  column-size/15.   See
              also 1C.

       ML mark [text-indent [1]]
              Marked  list start.  The mark argument is printed before each list
              item.  text-indent sets the indent  and  overrides  Li.   A  third
              argument prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       MT [arg [addressee]]
              Memorandum  type.   The  argument  arg  is  part  of a filename in
              `/usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac/mm/*.MT&apos;.  Memorandum types 0 to 5 are
              supported,  including  type `string&apos; (which gets internally mapped
              to type 6).  addressee just sets a  variable,  used  in  the  AT&amp;T
              macros.

              See also COVER/COVEND, a more flexible type of front page.

       MOVE y-pos [x-pos [line-length]]
              Move  to a position, setting page offset to x-pos.  If line-length
              is not given, the difference between current and new  page  offset
              is used.  Use PGFORM without arguments to return to normal.

       MULB cw1 space1 [cw2 space2 [cw3 ...]]
              Begin  a  special  multi-column  mode.  All columns widths must be
              specified.  The space between the columns must be specified  also.
              The last column does not need any space definition.  MULB starts a
              diversion, and MULE ends the diversion  and  prints  the  columns.
              The  unit  for  the  width  and  space  arguments is `n&apos;, but MULB
              accepts all normal unit specifications like  `c&apos;  and  `i&apos;.   MULB
              operates in a separate environment.

       MULN   Begin the next column.  This is the only way to switch the column.

       MULE   End the multi-column mode and print the columns.

       nP [type]
              Print numbered paragraph with header level two.  See .P.

       NCOL   Force  printing  to the next column.  Don&apos;t use this together with
              the MUL* macros, see 2C.

       NS [arg [1]]
              Print different types of notations.  The argument selects  between
              the  predefined  type  of  notations.   If  the second argument is
              available, then the argument becomes the entire notation.  If  the
              argument  doesn&apos;t select a predefined type, it is printed as `Copy
              (arg) to&apos;.  It is possible to add more standard notations, see the
              string variables Letns and Letnsdef.

       ND new-date
              New date.  Overrides the current date.  Date  is  not  printed  if
              new-date is an empty string.

       OF [arg]
              Odd-page footer, a line printed just above the normal footer.  See
              EF and PF.

              This macro defines string EOPof.

       OH [arg]
              Odd-page header, a line printed just below the normal header.  See
              EH and PH.

              This macro defines string TPoh.

       OP     Make sure that the following text is printed at the top of an odd-
              numbered page.  Does not output an empty page if currently at  the
              top of an odd page.
&#12;       P [type]
              Begin  new  paragraph.  P without argument produces left-justified
              text, even the first line of the paragraph.  This is the  same  as
              setting  type  to 0.  If the argument is 1, the first line of text
              following P is indented by the number of spaces in number register
              Pi, by default 5.

              Instead of giving an argument to P it is possible to set the para&#8208;
              graph type in number register Pt.  Using 0 and 1 is  the  same  as
              adding  that  value  to  P.   A value of 2 indents all paragraphs,
              except after headings, lists, and displays (this  value  can&apos;t  be
              used as an argument to P itself).

              The  space between two paragraphs is controlled by number register
              Ps, and is 1 by default (one blank line).

       PGFORM [linelength [pagelength [pageoffset [1]]]]
              Set line length, page length, and/or page offset.  This macro  can
              be  used  for special formatting, like letter heads and other.  It
              is normally the first command in a file, though it is  not  neces&#8208;
              sary.   PGFORM  can  be used without arguments to reset everything
              after a MOVE call.  A line break is done unless the  fourth  argu&#8208;
              ment  is  given.  This can be used to avoid the page number on the
              first page while setting new width and length.  (It  seems  as  if
              this  macro sometimes doesn&apos;t work too well.  Use the command line
              arguments to change line length,  page  length,  and  page  offset
              instead.)

       PGNH   No  header  is  printed  on the next page.  Used to get rid of the
              header in letters or other special texts.  This macro must be used
              before any text to inhibit the page header on the first page.

       PIC [-L] [-C] [-R] [-I n] filename [width [height]]
              Include  a  PostScript file in the document.  The macro depends on
              mmroff(1) and INITR.  The arguments -L, -C, -R,  and  -I n  adjust
              the  picture or indent it.  The optional width and height can also
              be given to resize the picture.

       PE     Picture end.  Ends a picture for pic(@MAN1EXT).

       PF [arg]
              Page footer.  PF sets the line to be printed at the bottom of each
              page.  Empty by default.  See PH for the argument specification.

              This macro defines string EOPf.

       PH [arg]
              Page header, a line printed at the top of each page.  The argument
              should be specified as

                     &quot;&apos;left-part&apos;center-part&apos;right-part&apos;&quot;

              where left-part, center-part, and right-part are printed left-jus&#8208;
              tified,  centered,  and right justified, respectively.  Within the
              argument to PH, the character `%&apos; is changed to the  current  page
              number.  The default argument is

                     &quot;&apos;&apos;- % -&apos;&apos;&quot;

              which gives the page number between two dashes.

              This macro defines string TPh.

       PS     Picture start (from pic).  Begins a picture for pic(1).

       PX     Page  header  user-defined  exit.  This macro is called just after
              the printing of the page header in no-space mode.

       R      Roman.  Return to roman font, see also I.
&#12;       RB [roman-text [bold-text [roman-text [...]]]]
              Roman-bold.  Even arguments are printed in roman, odd in boldface.
              See I.

       RD [prompt [diversion [string]]]
              Read  from standard input to diversion and/or string.  The text is
              saved in a diversion named diversion.  Recall the text by  writing
              the  name of the diversion after a dot on an empty line.  A string
              is also defined if string is given.  Diversion and/or  prompt  can
              be empty (&quot;&quot;).

       RF     Reference  end.  Ends a reference definition and returns to normal
              processing.  See RS.

       RI [roman-text [italic-text [roman-text [...]]]]
              Print even arguments in roman, odd in italic.  See I.

       RL [text-indent[1]]
              Reference list start.  Begins a list where each item  is  preceded
              with  an automatically incremented number between square brackets.
              text-indent changes the default indentation.

       RP [arg1 [arg2]]
              Produce reference page.  This macro can be  used  if  a  reference
              page  is wanted somewhere in the document.  It is not needed if TC
              is used to produce a table of contents.   The  reference  page  is
              then printed automatically.

              The reference counter is not reset if arg1 is 1.

              arg2 tells RP whether to eject a page or not.

              arg2

                     tab(@); l lx.  0@T{ The reference page is printed on a sep&#8208;
                     arate page.  This is the default.  T} 1@Do not  eject  page
                     after the list.  2@Do not eject page before the list.  3@Do
                     not eject page before and after the list.

              The reference items are separated by a blank line.  Setting number
              register Ls to 0 suppresses the line.

              The  string  Rp  contains  the  reference page title and is set to
              `REFERENCES&apos; by default.

       RS [string-name]
              Begin an automatically numbered  reference  definition.   Put  the
              string \*(Rf where the reference mark should be and write the ref&#8208;
              erence between RS/RF at next new line after  the  reference  mark.
              The  reference number is stored in number register :R.  If string-
              name is given, a string with that name is defined and contains the
              current   reference   mark.   The  string  can  be  referenced  as
              \*[string-name] later in the text.

       S [size [spacing]]
              Set point size and vertical spacing.  If any argument is equal  to
              `P&apos;,  the  previous value is used.  A `C&apos; means current value, and
              `D&apos; the default value.  If `+&apos; or `-&apos; is used  before  the  value,
              the current value is incremented or decremented, respectively.

       SA [arg]
              Set  right-margin  justification.   Justification  is turned on by
              default.  No argument or value `0&apos; turns  off  justification,  and
              `1&apos; turns on justification.

       SETR refname [string]
              Remember  the  current  header  and page number as refname.  Saves
              string if string is defined.  string  is  retrieved  with  .GETST.
              See INITR.
&#12;       SG [arg [1]]
              Signature line.  Prints the authors name(s) after the formal clos&#8208;
              ing.  The argument is appended to the reference data,  printed  at
              either  the first or last author.  The reference data is the loca&#8208;
              tion, department, and initials specified with .AU.  It is  printed
              at  the first author if the second argument is given, otherwise at
              the last.  No reference data is printed if the author(s) is speci&#8208;
              fied through .WA/.WE.  See section INTERNALS.

       SK [pages]
              Skip  pages.   If  pages  is 0 or omitted, a skip to the next page
              occurs unless it is already at the top of a  page.   Otherwise  it
              skips pages pages.

       SM string1 [string2 [string3]]
              Make  a  string  smaller.   If  string2  is given, string1 is made
              smaller and  string2  stays  at  normal  size,  concatenated  with
              string1.   With  three  arguments, everything is concatenated, but
              only string2 is made smaller.

       SP [lines]
              Space vertically.  lines can have any scaling factor, like `3i&apos; or
              `8v&apos;.  Several SP calls in a line only produces the maximum number
              of lines, not the sum.  SP is ignored also until  the  first  text
              line in a page.  Add \&amp; before a call to SP to avoid this.

       TAB    Reset  tabs  to every 5n.  Normally used to reset any previous tab
              positions.

       TB [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Table title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  TB  uses  the
              number register Tb as a counter.  The string Lt controls the title
              of the List of Tables; default value is  `LIST  OF  TABLES&apos;.   The
              List  of  Tables is only printed if number register Lt is 1, which
              is the default.  The string Litb contains the word `TABLE&apos;,  which
              is printed before the number.

              Special  handling  of the title occurs if TB is used inside DS/DE,
              it is not affected by the format of DS.

       TC [slevel [spacing [tlevel [tab [h1 [h2 [h3 [h4 [h5]]]]]]]]]
              Table of contents.  This macro is normally used as the  last  line
              of  the  document.  It generates a table of contents with headings
              up to the level controlled by number register Cl.   Note  that  Cl
              controls  the  saving  of  headings, it has nothing to do with TC.
              Headings with a level less than or equal  to  slevel  get  spacing
              number  of  lines before them.  Headings with a level less than or
              equal to tlevel have their page numbers right-justified with  dots
              or  spaces  separating  the  text and the page number.  Spaces are
              used if tab is greater than zero, dots otherwise.  Other  headings
              have  the  page  number  directly  at  the end of the heading text
              (ragged-right).

              The rest of the arguments is printed, centered, before  the  table
              of contents.

              The user-defined macros TX and TY are used if TC is called with at
              most four arguments.  TX is called  before  the  printing  of  the
              string  `CONTENTS&apos;,  and  TY  is  called instead of printing `CON&#8208;
              TENTS&apos;.

              Equivalent macros can be defined  for  list  of  figures,  tables,
              equations and exhibits by defining TXxx or TYxx, where xx is `Fg&apos;,
              `TB&apos;, `EC&apos;, or `EX&apos;, respectively.

              String Ci can be set to control the indentations for each heading-
              level.  It must be scaled, like

                     .ds Ci .25i .5i .75i 1i 1i
&#12;              By default, the indentation is controlled by the maximum length of
              headings in each level.

              The string variables Lifg, Litb, Liex,  Liec,  and  Licon  contain
              `Figure&apos;,  `TABLE&apos;, `Exhibit&apos;, `Equation&apos;, and `CONTENTS&apos;, respec&#8208;
              tively.  These can be redefined to other languages.

       TE     Table end.  See TS.

       TH [N] Table header.  See TS.  TH ends the header  of  the  table.   This
              header  is  printed  again  if  a page break occurs.  Argument `N&apos;
              isn&apos;t implemented yet.

       TL [charging-case-number [filing-case-number]]
              Begin title of memorandum.  All text up to the next AU is included
              in  the  title.   charging-case-number  and filing-case-number are
              saved for use in the front page processing.

       TM [num1 [num2 [...]]]
              Technical memorandum numbers used in .MT.  An unlimited number  of
              arguments may be given.

       TP     Top-of-page  user-defined  macro.  This macro is called instead of
              the normal page header.  It is possible to  get  complete  control
              over  the header.  Note that the header and the footer are printed
              in a separate environment.  Line length is preserved, though.  See
              EOP.

       TS [H] Table start.  This is  the  start  of  a  table  specification  to
              tbl(1).   TS  ends  with TE.  Argument `H&apos; tells mm that the table
              has a header.  See TH.

       TX     User-defined table of contents exit.  This macro  is  called  just
              before TC prints the word `CONTENTS&apos;.  See TC.

       TY     User-defined table of contents exit.  This macro is called instead
              of printing `CONTENTS&apos;.  See TC.

       VERBON [flag [point-size [font]]]
              Begin verbatim output using Courier font.   Usually  for  printing
              programs.  All characters have equal width.  The point size can be
              changed with the second argument.  By specifying a third  argument
              it  is possible to use another font instead of Courier.  flag con&#8208;
              trols several special features.  Its  value  is  the  sum  of  all
              wanted features.

                     control  is  available with the string variable Verbnm.  It
                     contains all arguments to the troff(1)  command  .nm,  nor&#8208;

              End verbatim output.

       VL text-indent [mark-indent [1]]
              Variable-item list.  It has no fixed mark, it assumes  that  every
              LI  has  a mark instead.  text-indent sets the indent to the text,
              and mark-indent the distance from the current indentation  to  the
              mark.   A third argument prohibits printing of a blank line before
              each item.

       VM [-T] [top [bottom]]
              Vertical margin.  Increase the top and bottom margin  by  top  and
              bottom,  respectively.   If option -T is specified, set those mar&#8208;
              gins to top and bottom.  If no argument is given, reset the margin
              to  zero, or to the default (`7v 5v&apos;) if -T is used.  It is highly
              recommended that macros TP and/or EOP are defined if using -T  and
              setting top and/or bottom margin to less than the default.

       WA [writer-name [title]]
              Begin  specification  of the writer and writer&apos;s address.  Several
              names can be specified  with  empty  WA/WE  pairs,  but  only  one
              address.

INTERNALS
       The letter macros are using different submacros depending on  the  letter
       type.   The  name  of  the submacro has the letter type as suffix.  It is
       therefore possible to define other letter types, either in  the  national
       macro-file,  or as local additions.  .LT sets the number variables Pt and
       Pi to 0 and 5, respectively.  The following strings and  macros  must  be
       defined for a new letter type.

       let@init_type
              This  macro is called directly by .LT.  It is supposed to initial&#8208;
              ize variables and other stuff.

       let@head_type
              This macro prints the letter head, and is called  instead  of  the
              normal   page   header.   It  is  supposed  to  remove  the  alias
              let@header, otherwise it is called for all pages.

       let@sg_type name title n flag [arg1 [arg2 [...]]]
              .SG is calling this macro only for letters; memorandums  have  its
              own  processing.   name  and  title are specified through .WA/.WB.
              n is the counter, 1-max, and flag is true for the last name.   Any
              other argument to .SG is appended.

       let@fc_type closing
              This  macro  is  called  by .FC, and has the formal closing as the
              argument.

       .LO is implemented as a general option-macro.  It demands that  a  string
       named  Lettype  is  defined,  where  type  is  the letter type.  .LO then
       assigns the argument to the string variable let*lo-type.
