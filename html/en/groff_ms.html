GROFF_MS(7)                                                          GROFF_MS(7)



NAME
       groff_ms - groff ms macros

SYNOPSIS
       groff -ms [ options... ] [ files... ]
       groff -m ms [ options... ] [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page describes the GNU version of the ms macros, part of the
       groff typesetting system.  The ms macros are mostly compatible  with  the
       documented  behavior  of the 4.3 BSD Unix ms macros (see Differences from
       troff ms below for details).  The ms macros  are  suitable  for  reports,
       letters, books, and technical documentation.

USAGE
       The ms macro package expects files to have a certain amount of structure.
       The simplest documents can begin with a paragraph macro  and  consist  of
       text separated by paragraph macros or even blank lines.  Longer documents
       have a structure as follows:

       Document type
              If you use the RP (report) macro at the beginning of the document,
              groff prints the cover page information on its own page; otherwise
              it prints the information on the first  page  with  your  document
              text  immediately following.  Other document formats found in AT&amp;T
              troff are specific to AT&amp;T or Berkeley, and are not  supported  in
              groff ms.

       Format and layout
              By  setting  number registers, you can change your document&apos;s type
              (font and size), margins, spacing, headers and footers, and  foot&#8208;
              notes.  See Document control registers below for more details.

       Cover page
              A cover page consists of a title, and optionally the author&apos;s name
              and institution, an abstract, and the date.  See Cover page macros
              below for more details.

       Body   Following  the  cover page is your document.  It consists of para&#8208;
              graphs, headings, and lists.

       Table of contents
              Longer documents usually include a table of  contents,  which  you
              can add by placing the TC macro at the end of your document.

   Document control registers
       The following table lists the document control number registers.  For the
       sake of consistency, set registers related to margins at the beginning of
       your document, or just after the RP macro.

   Cover page macros
       Use  the following macros to create a cover page for your document in the
       order shown.

       .RP [no]
              Specifies the report format for your document.  The report  format
              creates  a  separate cover page.  With no RP macro, groff prints a
              subset of the cover page on page 1 of your document.

              If you use the optional no argument, groff prints a title page but
              does  not repeat any of the title page information (title, author,
              abstract, etc.) on page 1 of the document.

       .P1    (P-one) Prints the header on page 1.  The default is  to  suppress
              the header.

       .DA [xxx]
              (optional)  Print  the current date, or the arguments to the macro
              if any, on the title page (if specified) and in the footers.  This
              is the default for nroff.

       .ND [xxx]
              (optional)  Print  the current date, or the arguments to the macro
              if any, on the title page (if specified) but not in  the  footers.
              This is the default for troff.

       .TL    Specifies  the  document title.  Groff collects text following the
              TL macro into  the  title,  until  reaching  the  author  name  or
              abstract.

       .AU    Specifies  the author&apos;s name.  You can specify multiple authors by
              using an AU macro for each author.

       .AI    Specifies the author&apos;s  institution.   You  can  specify  multiple
              institutions.

       .AB [no]
              Begins  the  abstract.  The default is to print the word ABSTRACT,
              centered and in italics, above the  text  of  the  abstract.   The
              option no suppresses this heading.

       .AE    End the abstract.

   Paragraphs
       Use  the PP macro to create indented paragraphs, and the LP macro to cre&#8208;
       ate paragraphs with no initial indent.

       The QP macro indents all text at both left and right margins.  The effect
       is  identical  to  the  HTML &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; element.  The next paragraph or
       heading returns margins to normal.

       The XP macro produces an exdented paragraph.  The first line of the para&#8208;
       graph  begins  at the left margin, and subsequent lines are indented (the
       opposite of PP).

       For each of the above paragraph types, and also for any list entry intro&#8208;
       duced  by  the  IP macro (described later), the document control register
       PORPHANS, sets the minimum number of lines which must be  printed,  after
       the  start  of the paragraph, and before any page break occurs.  If there
       is insufficient space remaining on the current page to  accommodate  this
       number of lines, then a page break is forced before the first line of the
       paragraph is printed.

       Similarly, when a section heading (see subsection  Headings  below)  pre&#8208;
       ceeds  any of these paragraph types, the HORPHANS document control regis&#8208;
       ter specifies the minimum number of lines of the paragraph which must  be
       kept  on  the same page as the heading.  If insufficient space remains on
       the current page to accommodate the heading and this number of  lines  of
       paragraph  text,  then  a  page  break  is  forced  before the heading is
       printed.

   Headings
       Use headings to create a hierarchical structure for  your  document.   By
       default,  the ms macros print headings in bold using the same font family
       and point size as the body text.  For output devices which support  scal&#8208;
       able fonts, this behaviour may be modified, by defining the document con&#8208;
       trol registers, GROWPS and PSINCR.

       The following heading macros are available:

       .NH xx Numbered heading.  The argument xx is either a numeric argument to
              indicate  the  level  of the heading, or S xx xx &quot;...&quot;  to set the
              section number explicitly.  If you specify heading levels  out  of
              sequence, such as invoking .NH 3 after .NH 1, groff prints a warn&#8208;
              ing on standard error.

              If the GROWPS register is set to a value greater than the level of
              the  heading, then the point size of the heading will be increased
              by PSINCR units over the text size specified by the  PS  register,
              for  each  level by which the heading level is less than the value
              of GROWPS.  For example, the sequence:

                     .nr PS 10
                     .nr GROWPS 3
                     .nr PSINCR 1.5p
                     .
                     .NH 1
                     Top Level Heading
                     .
                     .NH 2
                     Second Level Heading
                     .
                     .NH 3
                     Third Level Heading

              will cause &#8220;1. Top Level Heading&#8221; to be printed in 13pt bold text,
              followed by &#8220;1.1. Second Level Heading&#8221; in 11.5pt bold text, while
              &#8220;1.1.1. Third Level Heading&#8221;, and all more deeply  nested  heading
              levels,  will  remain  in the 10pt bold text which is specified by
              the PS register.

              Note that the value stored in PSINCR is interpreted in groff basic
              units;  the  p scaling factor should be employed, when assigning a
              value specified in points.

              The style used to represent the section number, within a  numbered
              heading,  is controlled by the SN-STYLE string; this may be set to
              either the SN-DOT or the SN-NO-DOT style,  (described  below),  by
              aliasing  SN-STYLE  accordingly.   By  default,  SN-STYLE  is ini&#8208;
              tialised by defining the alias

                     .als SN-STYLE SN-DOT

              it may be changed to the SN-NO-DOT style, if preferred, by  defin&#8208;
              ing the alternative alias

                     .als SN-STYLE SN-NO-DOT

              Any such change becomes effective with the first use of .NH, after
              the new alias is defined.

              After invoking .NH, the assigned heading number  is  available  in
              the  strings SN-DOT (as it appears in the default formatting style
              for numbered headings, with a  terminating  period  following  the
              number),  and  SN-NO-DOT  (with  this terminating period omitted).
              The string SN is also defined, as an alias  for  SN-DOT;  if  pre&#8208;
              ferred,  the  user  may  redefine it as an alias for SN-NO-DOT, by
              including the initialisation:

                     .als SN SN-NO-DOT

              at any time; the change becomes effective with  the  next  use  of
              .NH, after the new alias is defined.

       .SH [xx]
              Unnumbered  subheading.   The use of the optional xx argument is a
              GNU extension, which adjusts the point size of the unnumbered sub&#8208;
              heading  to  match  that  of  a numbered heading, introduced using
              .NH xx with the same value of xx.  For  example,  given  the  same
              settings  for PS, GROWPS and PSINCR, as used in the preceeding .NH
              example, the sequence:

                     .SH 2
                     An Unnumbered Subheading

              will print &#8220;An Unnumbered Subheading&#8221; in 11.5pt bold text.

   Highlighting
       The ms macros provide a variety of  methods  to  highlight  or  emphasize
       text:

       .B [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets  its  first  argument  in bold type.  If you specify a second
              argument, groff prints it in the  previous  font  after  the  bold
              text,  with  no intervening space (this allows you to set punctua&#8208;
              tion after the highlighted text without highlighting the  punctua&#8208;
              tion).   Similarly,  it  prints the third argument (if any) in the
              previous font before the first argument.  For example,

                     .B foo ) (
&#12;              prints (foo).

              If you give this macro no arguments, groff prints all text follow&#8208;
              ing  in  bold  until  the next highlighting, paragraph, or heading
              macro.

       .R [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument in roman (or regular) type.   It  operates
              similarly to the B macro otherwise.

       .I [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets  its first argument in italic type.  It operates similarly to
              the B macro otherwise.

       .CW [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets its first argument in a constant  width  face.   It  operates
              similarly to the B macro otherwise.

       .BI [txt [post [pre]]]
              Sets  its  first  argument in bold italic type.  It operates simi&#8208;
              larly to the B macro otherwise.

       .BX [txt]
              Prints its argument and draws a box around it.  If you want to box
              a string that contains spaces, use a digit-width space (\0).

       .UL [txt [post]]
              Prints  its  first  argument  with an underline.  If you specify a
              second argument, groff prints it in the previous  font  after  the
              underlined text, with no intervening space.

       .LG    Prints all text following in larger type (2 points larger than the
              current point size) until the next font size, highlighting,  para&#8208;
              graph,  or  heading  macro.   You  can specify this macro multiple
              times to enlarge the point size as needed.

       .SM    Prints all text following in smaller type (2 points  smaller  than
              the  current  point  size) until the next type size, highlighting,
              paragraph, or heading macro.  You can specify this macro  multiple
              times to reduce the point size as needed.

       .NL    Prints  all  text following in the normal point size (that is, the
              value of the PS register).

       \*{text\*}
              Print the enclosed text as a superscript.

   Indents
       You may need to indent sections of text.  A typical use for indents is to
       create nested lists and sublists.

       Use  the  RS  and  RE macros to start and end a section of indented text,
       respectively.  The PI register controls the amount of indent.

       You can nest indented sections as deeply as  needed  by  using  multiple,
       nested pairs of RS and RE.

   Lists
       The IP macro handles duties for all lists.  Its syntax is as follows:

       .IP [marker [width]]

              The marker is usually a bullet character \(bu for unordered lists,
              a number  (or  auto-incrementing  number  register)  for  numbered
              lists, or a word or phrase for indented (glossary-style) lists.

              The  width  specifies  the  indent for the body of each list item.
              Once specified, the indent remains the same for all list items  in
              the document until specified again.

   Tab stops
       Use the ta request to set tab stops as needed.  Use the TA macro to reset
       tabs to the default (every 5n).  You can redefine the TA macro to  create
       a different set of default tab stops.

   Displays and keeps
       Use  displays  to show text-based examples or figures (such as code list&#8208;
       ings).  Displays turn off filling, so lines of code can be displayed  as-
       is  without  inserting br requests in between each line.  Displays can be
       kept on a single page, or allowed to break across pages.   The  following
       table shows the display types available.

              cb   s    cbt cb   cb   ^ lfCW lfCW lx.  Display macro  Type of
              display With keep No keep _ .DS L     .LD  Left-justified.  .DS I
              [indent] .ID  T{ Indented (default indent in the DI register).  T}
              .DS B .BD  T{ Block-centered (left-justified, longest line cen&#8208;
              tered).  T} .DS C     .CD  Centered.  .DS R     .RD  Right-justi&#8208;
              fied.  _

       Use the DE macro to end any display type.  The macros Ds and De were for&#8208;
       merly provided as aliases for DS and DE, respectively, but they have been
       removed, and should no longer be used.  X11 documents which actually  use
       Ds  and  De  always  load a specific macro file from the X11 distribution
       (macros.t) which provides proper definitions for the two macros.

       To keep text together on a page, such as a paragraph that refers to a ta&#8208;
       ble  (or  list,  or  other item) immediately following, use the KS and KE
       macros.  The KS macro begins a block of text to be kept on a single page,
       and the KE macro ends the block.

       You  can specify a floating keep using the KF and KE macros.  If the keep
       cannot fit on the current page, groff holds the contents of the keep  and
       allows  text  following  the  keep  (in  the  source file) to fill in the
       remainder of the current page.  When  the  page  breaks,  whether  by  an
       explicit  bp request or by reaching the end of the page, groff prints the
       floating keep at the top of the new page.  This is  useful  for  printing
       large  graphics or tables that do not need to appear exactly where speci&#8208;
       fied.

       The macros B1 and B2 can be used to enclose a  text  within  a  box;  .B1
       begins the box, and .B2 ends it.  Text in the box is automatically placed
       in a diversion (keep).

   Tables, figures, equations, and references
       The -ms macros support the standard groff preprocessors: tbl,  pic,  eqn,
       and refer.  Mark text meant for preprocessors by enclosing it in pairs of
       tags as follows:

       .TS [H] and .TE
              Denotes a table, to be processed by  the  tbl  preprocessor.   The
              optional  H  argument  instructs  groff to create a running header
              with the information up to the TH macro.  Groff prints the  header
              at  the  beginning  of  the  table; if the table runs onto another
              page, groff prints the header on the next page as well.

       .PS and .PE
              Denotes a graphic, to be processed by the pic  preprocessor.   You
              can create a pic file by hand, using the AT&amp;T pic manual available
              on the Web as a reference, or by using a graphics program such  as
              xfig.

       .EQ [align] and .EN
              Denotes an equation, to be processed by the eqn preprocessor.  The
              optional align argument can be C, L, or I to center (the default),
              left-justify, or indent the equation.

       .[ and .]
              Denotes  a  reference,  to be processed by the refer preprocessor.
              The GNU refer(1) manual page provides a comprehensive reference to
              the preprocessor and the format of the bibliographic database.

   Footnotes
       The ms macros provide a flexible footnote system.  You can specify a num&#8208;
       bered footnote by using the \** escape, followed by the text of the foot&#8208;
       note enclosed by FS and FE macros.

       You can specify symbolic footnotes by placing the mark character (such as
       \(dg for the dagger character) in the body text, followed by the text  of
       the footnote enclosed by FS \(dg and FE macros.

       You  can  control how groff prints footnote numbers by changing the value
       of the FF register as follows:

              0      Prints the footnote number as a  superscript;  indents  the
                     footnote (default).

              1      Prints  the  number  followed  by  a  period  (like 1.) and
                     indents the footnote.

              2      Like 1, without an indent.

              3      Like 1, but prints the footnote number as a  hanging  para&#8208;
                     graph.

       You  can  use footnotes safely within keeps and displays, but avoid using
       numbered footnotes within floating keeps.   You  can  set  a  second  \**
       between a \** and its corresponding .FS; as long as each .FS occurs after
       the corresponding \** and the occurrences of .FS are in the same order as
       the corresponding occurrences of \**.

   Headers and footers
       There are three ways to define headers and footers:

       &#183;  Use  the  strings  LH,  CH,  and RH to set the left, center, and right
          headers; use LF, CF, and RF to set the left, center, and  right  foot&#8208;
          ers.   This  works  best for documents that do not distinguish between
          odd and even pages.

       &#183;  Use the OH and EH macros to define headers for the odd and even pages;
          and  OF  and  EF  macros to define footers for the odd and even pages.
          This is more flexible than defining the individual strings.  The  syn&#8208;
          tax for these macros is as follows:

                 .OH &apos;left&apos;center&apos;right&apos;

          You  can  replace the quote (&apos;) marks with any character not appearing
          in the header or footer text.

       You can also redefine the PT and BT macros to change the behavior of  the
       header  and  footer,  respectively.   The  header  process also calls the
       (undefined) HD macro after PT ; you can define this  macro  if  you  need
       additional  processing  after printing the header (for example, to draw a
       line below the header).

   Margins
       You control margins using a set of number registers.  The following table
       lists the register names and defaults:

              cb   cb cb cb lfCW l  l  l.  Reg. Definition     Effective Default
              _ PO   Page offset (left margin)     next page 1i LL   Line
              length    next paragraph  6i LT   Header/footer length     next
              paragraph 6i HM   Top (header) margin next page 1i FM   Bottom
              (footer) margin    next page 1i _

       Note that there is no right margin setting.  The combination of page off&#8208;
       set and line length provide the information necessary to derive the right
       margin.

   Multiple columns
       The  ms  macros can set text in as many columns as will reasonably fit on
       the page.  The following macros are available.  All of them force a  page
       break  if  a  multi-column  mode is already set.  However, if the current
       mode is single-column, starting a multi-column mode does not force a page
       break.

       .1C    Single-column mode.

       .2C    Two-column mode.

       .MC [width [gutter]]
              Multi-column  mode.  If you specify no arguments, it is equivalent
              to the 2C macro.  Otherwise, width is the width of each column and
              gutter is the space between columns.  The MINGW number register is
              the default gutter width.

   Creating a table of contents
       Wrap text that you want to appear in the table of contents in XS  and  XE
       macros.   Use  the  TC macro to print the table of contents at the end of
       the document, resetting the page number to i (Roman numeral 1).

       You can manually create a table of contents by specifying a  page  number
       as  the first argument to XS.  Add subsequent entries using the XA macro.
       For example:

              .XS 1
              Introduction
              .XA 2
              A Brief History of the Universe
              .XA 729
              Details of Galactic Formation
              ...
              .XE

       Use the PX macro to print a manually-generated table of contents  without
       resetting the page number.

       If you give the argument no to either PX or TC, groff suppresses printing
       the title specified by the \*[TOC] string.

   Fractional point sizes
       Traditionally, the ms macros only support integer values  for  the  docu&#8208;
       ment&apos;s  font  size  and  vertical spacing.  To overcome this restriction,
       values larger than or equal to 1000 are taken as fractional values,  mul&#8208;
       tiplied by 1000.  For example, `.nr PS 10250&apos; sets the font size to 10.25
       points.

       The following four registers accept fractional point sizes: PS, VS,  FPS,
       and FVS.

       Due  to  backwards  compatibility,  the  value of VS must be smaller than
       40000 (this is 40.0 points).

DIFFERENCES FROM troff ms
       The groff ms macros are a complete re-implementation, using  no  original
       AT&amp;T  code.  Since they take advantage of the extended features in groff,
       they cannot be used with AT&amp;T troff.  Other differences include:

       &#183;  The internals of groff ms differ from the internals of Unix ms.  Docu&#8208;
          ments  that depend upon implementation details of Unix ms may not for&#8208;
          mat properly with groff ms.

       &#183;  The error-handling policy of groff ms is to detect and report  errors,
          rather than silently to ignore them.

       &#183;  Some  Bell Labs localisms are not implemented by default.  However, if
          you call the otherwise undocumented SC section-header macro, you  will
          enable  implementations  of  three other archaic Bell Labs macros: UC,
          P1, and P2.  These are not enabled by default because  (a)  they  were
          not  documented,  in  the  original  ms  manual, and (b) the P1 and UC
          macros both collide with different macros in the Berkeley  version  of
          ms.

          These  emulations  are  sufficient  to  give back the 1976 Kernighan &amp;
          Cherry paper Typsetting Mathematics &#8211; User&apos;s Guide its  section  head&#8208;
          ings,  and  restore  some  text  that had gone missing as arguments of
          undefined macros.  No warranty express or implied is given as  to  how
          well  the  typographic  details  these produce match the original Bell
          Labs macros.

       &#183;  Berkeley localisms, in particular the TM and CT macros, are not imple&#8208;
          mented.

       &#183;  Groff  ms  does  not  work  in  compatibility  mode (e.g., with the -C
          option).

       &#183;  There is no support for typewriter-like devices.

       &#183;  Groff ms does not provide cut marks.

       &#183;  Multiple line spacing is not supported (use a larger vertical  spacing
          instead).

       &#183;  Some  Unix  ms  documentation says that the CW and GW number registers
          can be used to control the column  width  and  gutter  width,  respec&#8208;
          tively.  These number registers are not used in groff ms.

       &#183;  Macros  that cause a reset (paragraphs, headings, etc.) may change the
          indent.  Macros that change the indent do not increment  or  decrement
          the indent, but rather set it absolutely.  This can cause problems for
          documents that define additional macros of their own.  The solution is
          to use not the in request but instead the RS and RE macros.

       &#183;  The  number register GS is set to 1 by the groff ms macros, but is not
          used by the Unix ms macros.  Documents that need to determine  whether
          they are being formatted with Unix ms or groff ms should use this num&#8208;
          ber register.

       &#183;  To make groff ms use the default page offset (which also specifies the
          left  margin),  the  PO  number register must stay undefined until the
          first ms macro is evaluated.  This implies that PO should not be  used
          early  in  the  document,  unless  it  is  changed also: Remember that
          accessing an undefined register automatically defines it.

   Strings
       You can redefine the following strings to adapt the groff  ms  macros  to
       languages other than English:

       center;  cb   cb lfCW l.  String    Default Value _ REFERENCES     Refer&#8208;
       ences  ABSTRACT  ABSTRACT  TOC  Table   of   Contents   MONTH1    January
       MONTH2    February    MONTH3    March    MONTH4    April    MONTH5    May
       MONTH6    June   MONTH7    July   MONTH8    August    MONTH9    September
       MONTH10   October MONTH11   November MONTH12   December _

       The \*- string produces an em dash &#8212; like this.

       Use  \*Q  and  \*U  to  get a left and right typographer&apos;s quote, respec&#8208;
       tively, in troff (and plain quotes in nroff).


   Text Settings
       The FAM string sets the default font family.  If this string is undefined
       at initialization, it is set to Times.

       The  point  size, vertical spacing, and inter-paragraph spacing for foot&#8208;
       notes are controlled by the number registers FPS, FVS, and FPD;  at  ini&#8208;
       tialization  these  are  set  to \n(PS-2, \n[FPS]+2, and \n(PD/2, respec&#8208;
       tively.  If any of these registers are defined before initialization, the
       initialization macro does not change them.

       The hyphenation flags (as set by the hy request) are set from the HY reg&#8208;
       ister; the default is 14.

       Improved accent marks (as originally defined in  Berkeley&apos;s  ms  version)
       are  available  by specifying the AM macro at the beginning of your docu&#8208;
       ment.  You can place an accent over most  characters  by  specifying  the
       string  defining  the  accent directly after the character.  For example,
       n\*~ produces an n with a tilde over it.

NAMING CONVENTIONS
       The following conventions are used for names of macros, strings and  num&#8208;
       ber  registers.  External names available to documents that use the groff
       ms macros contain only uppercase letters and digits.

       Internally the macros are divided into modules; naming conventions are as
       follows:

       &#183;  Names used only within one module are of the form module*name.

       &#183;  Names  used  outside  the  module in which they are defined are of the
          form module@name.

       &#183;  Names associated  with  a  particular  environment  are  of  the  form
          environment:name; these are used only within the par module.

       &#183;  name does not have a module prefix.
&#12;       &#183;  Constructed   names   used   to  implement  arrays  are  of  the  form
          array!index.

       Thus the groff ms macros reserve the following names:

       &#183;  Names containing the characters *, @, and :.

       &#183;  Names containing only uppercase letters and digits.
