GROFF_OUT(5)                                                        GROFF_OUT(5)



NAME
       groff_out - groff intermediate output format

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the  intermediate output format of the GNU
       roff(7) text processing system groff(1).  This output is  produced  by  a
       run of the GNU troff(1) program.  It contains already all device-specific
       information, but it is not yet fed into a device postprocessor program.

       As the GNU roff processor groff(1) is a wrapper program around troff that
       automatically  calls  a  postprocessor, this output does not show up nor&#8208;
       mally.  This is why it is called intermediate within  the  groff  system.
       The  groff program provides the option -Z to inhibit postprocessing, such
       that the produced intermediate output is sent  to  standard  output  just
       like calling troff manually.

       In  this  document, the term troff output describes what is output by the
       GNU troff program, while intermediate output refers to the language  that
       is  accepted  by the parser that prepares this output for the postproces&#8208;
       sors.  This parser is smarter on whitespace and implements obsolete  ele&#8208;
       ments  for compatibility, otherwise both formats are the same.  Both for&#8208;
       mats can be viewed directly with gxditview(1).

       The main purpose of the intermediate output concept is to facilitate  the
       development of postprocessors by providing a common programming interface
       for all devices.  It has a language of its own that is completely differ&#8208;
       ent from the groff(7) language.  While the groff language is a high-level
       programming language for text processing, the  intermediate  output  lan&#8208;
       guage  is  a kind of low-level assembler language by specifying all posi&#8208;
       tions on the page for writing and drawing.

       The pre-groff roff versions are denoted as classical troff.  The interme&#8208;
       diate  output produced by groff is fairly readable, while classical troff
       output was hard to understand because of strange habits  that  are  still
       supported, but not used any longer by GNU troff.

LANGUAGE CONCEPTS
       During  the  run of troff, the roff input is cracked down to the informa&#8208;
       tion on what has to be printed at what position on the  intended  device.
       So  the  language  of  the intermediate output format can be quite small.
       Its only elements are commands with or without arguments.  In this  docu&#8208;
       ment,  the  term  &#8220;command&#8221; always refers to the intermediate output lan&#8208;
       guage, never to the roff language used for  document  formatting.   There
       are  commands  for  positioning  and  text  writing, for drawing, and for
       device controlling.

   Separation
       Classical troff output had strange requirements on whitespace.  The groff
       output  parser, however, is smart about whitespace by making it maximally
       optional.  The whitespace characters, i.e., the tab, space,  and  newline
       characters,  always have a syntactical meaning.  They are never printable
       because spacing within the output is always done by positioning commands.

       Any sequence of space or tab characters is treated as a single  syntacti&#8208;
       cal  space.   It  separates  commands and arguments, but is only required
       when there would occur a clashing between the command code and the  argu&#8208;
       ments  without  the space.  Most often, this happens when variable length
       command names, arguments, argument lists, or command clusters meet.  Com&#8208;
       mands  and  arguments with a known, fixed length need not be separated by
       syntactical space.

       A line break is a syntactical element, too.  Every command  argument  can
       be  followed  by  whitespace,  a comment, or a newline character.  Thus a
       syntactical line break is defined  to  consist  of  optional  syntactical
       space that is optionally followed by a comment, and a newline character.

       The  normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a single
       letter taking a fixed number of arguments.  For historical  reasons,  the
       parser  allows  to stack such commands on the same line, but fortunately,
       in groff intermediate output, every command with at least one argument is
       followed by a line break, thus providing excellent readability.

       The  other  commands  &#8212; those for drawing and device controlling &#8212; have a
       more complicated structure; some recognize long command names,  and  some
       take  a  variable  number  of  arguments.   So  all D and x commands were
       designed to request a syntactical line break after their  last  argument.
       Only  one  command,  `x X&apos;  has an argument that can stretch over several
       lines, all other commands must have all of their arguments  on  the  same
       line  as  the  command,  i.e.,  the  arguments may not be split by a line
       break.

       Empty lines, i.e., lines containing only  space  and/or  a  comment,  can
       occur everywhere.  They are just ignored.

   Argument Units
       Some commands take integer arguments that are assumed to represent values
       in a measurement unit, but the letter for the corresponding scale indica&#8208;
       tor  is  not  written with the output command arguments; see groff(7) and
       the groff info file for more on this topic.   Most  commands  assume  the
       scale  indicator  u, the basic unit of the device, some use z, the scaled
       point unit of the device, while others, such as the color commands expect
       plain  integers.   Note  that  these scale indicators are relative to the
       chosen device.  They are defined  by  the  parameters  specified  in  the
       device&apos;s DESC file; see groff_font(5).

       Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the names
       of fonts and special characters (this is, glyphs).  The names  of  glyphs
       and fonts can be of arbitrary length.  A glyph that is to be printed will
       always be in the current font.

       A string argument is always terminated by the next  whitespace  character
       (space,  tab, or newline); an embedded # character is regarded as part of
       the argument, not as the beginning of  a  comment  command.   An  integer
       argument  is  already  terminated  by the next non-digit character, which
       then is regarded as the first character of the next argument or command.

   Document Parts
       A correct intermediate output document consists of two  parts,  the  pro&#8208;
       logue and the body.

       The  task  of  the prologue is to set the general device parameters using
       three exactly specified commands.  The groff prologue  is  guaranteed  to
       consist of the following three lines (in that order):

              x T device
              x res n h v
              x init

       with  the  arguments  set  as outlined in the section Device Control Com&#8208;
       mands.  However, the parser for the intermediate output format is able to
       swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.

       The body is the main section for processing the document data.  Syntacti&#8208;
       cally, it is a sequence of any commands different from the ones  used  in
       the  prologue.  Processing is terminated as soon as the first x stop com&#8208;
       mand is encountered; the last  line  of  any  groff  intermediate  output
       always contains such a command.
&#12;       Semantically,  the  body  is  page  oriented.  A new page is started by a
       p command.  Positioning, writing, and drawing commands  are  always  done
       within the current page, so they cannot occur before the first p command.
       Absolute positioning (by the H and V commands) is done  relative  to  the
       current page, all other positioning is done relative to the current loca&#8208;
       tion within this page.

COMMAND REFERENCE
       This section describes all intermediate output  commands,  the  classical
       commands as well as the groff extensions.

   Comment Command
       #anything&#10216;end-of-line&#10217;
              A  comment.   Ignore any characters from the # character up to the
              next newline character.

       This command is the only possibility for commenting in  the  intermediate
       output.   Each  comment  can  be preceded by arbitrary syntactical space;
       every command can be terminated by a comment.

   Simple Commands
       The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a  sin&#8208;
       gle character, taking a fixed number of arguments.  Most of them are com&#8208;
       mands for positioning and text writing.  These commands are  smart  about
       whitespace.  Optionally, syntactical space can be inserted before, after,
       and between the command letter and its arguments.  All of these  commands
       are  stackable,  i.e.,  they  can be preceded by other simple commands or
       followed by arbitrary other commands on the same line.  A separating syn&#8208;
       tactical  space  is only necessary when two integer arguments would clash
       or if the preceding argument ends with a string argument.

       C xxx&#10216;white-space&#10217;
              Print a glyph (special character) named xxx.  The trailing syntac&#8208;
              tical  space  or  line  break is necessary to allow glyph names of
              arbitrary length.  The glyph is printed at the current print posi&#8208;
              tion;  the  glyph&apos;s  size  is  read from the font file.  The print
              position is not changed.

       c c    Print glyph with single-letter name c at the current  print  posi&#8208;
              tion;  the  glyph&apos;s  size  is  read from the font file.  The print
              position is not changed.

       f n    Set font to font number n (a non-negative integer).

       H n    Move right to the absolute vertical  position  n  (a  non-negative
              integer in basic units u) relative to left edge of current page.

       h n    Move  n (a non-negative integer) basic units u horizontally to the
              right.  [CSTR #54] allows negative values for n  also,  but  groff
              doesn&apos;t use this.

       m color-scheme [component ...]
              Set  the color for text (glyphs), line drawing, and the outline of
              graphic objects using different color schemes; the analoguous com&#8208;
              mand  for  the  filling color of graphic objects is DF.  The color
              components are specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65536.
              The number of color components and their meaning vary for the dif&#8208;
              ferent color schemes.  These commands are generated by  the  groff
              escape  sequence  \m.  No position changing.  These commands are a
              groff extension.

              mc cyan magenta yellow
                     Set color using the CMY color scheme, having  the  3  color
                     components cyan, magenta, and yellow.

              md     Set color to the default color value (black in most cases).
                     No component arguments.

              mg gray
                     Set color to the shade of gray given by  the  argument,  an
                     integer between 0 (black) and 65536 (white).

              mk cyan magenta yellow black
                     Set  color  using the CMYK color scheme, having the 4 color
                     components cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

              mr red green blue
                     Set color using the RGB color scheme, having  the  3  color
                     components red, green, and blue.

       N n    Print  glyph  with  index n (an integer, normally non-negative) of
              the current font.  The print position is not changed.  If -T  html
              or  -T xhtml is used, negative values are emitted also to indicate
              an unbreakable space with given width.  For example, N -193 repre&#8208;
              sents  an  unbreakable space which has a width of 193u.  This com&#8208;
              mand is a groff extension.

       n b a  Inform the device about a line break, but no positioning  is  done
              by  this  command.   In  classical  troff, the integer arguments b
              and a informed about the space before and after the  current  line
              to  make  the intermediate output more human readable without per&#8208;
              forming any action.  In groff, they are  just  ignored,  but  they
              must be provided for compatibility reasons.

       p n    Begin  a  new  page in the outprint.  The page number is set to n.
              This page is completely independent of  pages  formerly  processed
              even if those have the same page number.  The vertical position on
              the outprint is automatically set to 0.  All positioning, writing,
              and drawing is always done relative to a page, so a p command must
              be issued before any of these commands.

       s n    Set point size to n scaled points (this is unit z in  GNU  troff).
              Classical troff used the unit points (p) instead; see section COM&#8208;
              PATIBILITY.

       t xyz...&#10216;white-space&#10217;
       t xyz... dummy-arg&#10216;white-space&#10217;
              Print a word, i.e., a sequence of glyphs with single-letter  names
              x, y, z, etc., terminated by a space character or a line break; an
              optional second integer argument is ignored (this allows the  for&#8208;
              matter  to generate an even number of arguments).  The first glyph
              should be printed at the current position, the current  horizontal
              position should then be increased by the width of the first glyph,
              and so on for each glyph.  The widths of the glyph are  read  from
              the font file, scaled for the current point size, and rounded to a
              multiple of the horizontal resolution.  Special characters (glyphs
              with  names  longer  than a single letter) cannot be printed using
              this command; use the C command for those glyphs.  This command is
              a  groff  extension;  it  is only used for devices whose DESC file
              contains the tcommand keyword; see groff_font(5).

       u n xyz...&#10216;white-space&#10217;
              Print word with track kerning.  This is the same as the t  command
              except  that  after  printing  each  glyph, the current horizontal
              position is increased by the sum of the width of that glyph and  n
              (an integer in basic units u).  This command is a groff extension;
              it is only used for devices whose DESC file contains the  tcommand
              keyword; see groff_font(5).

       V n    Move  down  to  the  absolute  vertical position n (a non-negative
              integer in basic units u) relative to upper edge of current page.

       v n    Move  n  basic  units  u  down  (n  is  a  non-negative  integer).
              [CSTR  #54]  allows  negative values for n also, but groff doesn&apos;t
              use this.

       w      Informs about a paddable whitespace to increase readability.   The
              spacing itself must be performed explicitly by a move command.

   Graphics Commands
       Each  graphics  or drawing command in the intermediate output starts with
       the letter D followed by one or two characters that specify a subcommand;
       this  is followed by a fixed or variable number of integer arguments that
       are separated by a single space character.  A D command may not  be  fol&#8208;
       lowed by another command on the same line (apart from a comment), so each
       D command is terminated by a syntactical line break.

       troff output follows the classical spacing rules (no space  between  com&#8208;
       mand and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single space charac&#8208;
       ter), but the parser allows optional space between  the  command  letters
       and  makes  the space before the first argument optional.  As usual, each
       space can be any sequence of tab and space characters.

       Some graphics commands can take a variable number of arguments.  In  this
       case,  they  are  integers representing a size measured in basic units u.
       The h arguments stand  for  horizontal  distances  where  positive  means
       right, negative left.  The v arguments stand for vertical distances where
       positive means down, negative up.  All these distances are offsets  rela&#8208;
       tive to the current location.

       Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly corresponds to
       a similar groff \D escape sequence; see groff(7).

       Unknown D commands are assumed to be device-specific.  Its arguments  are
       parsed  as strings; the whole information is then sent to the postproces&#8208;
       sor.

       In the following command reference, the syntax element &#10216;line-break&#10217; means
       a syntactical line break as defined in section Separation.

       D~ h1 v1  h2 v2 ... hn vn&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw  B-spline  from  current position to offset (h1, v1), then to
              offset (h2, v2) if given, etc.,  up  to  (hn, vn).   This  command
              takes a variable number of argument pairs; the current position is
              moved to the terminal point of the drawn curve.

       Da h1 v1  h2 v2&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw arc from current position to (h1, v1)+(h2, v2) with center at
              (h1, v1); then move the current position to the final point of the
              arc.

       DC d&#10216;line-break&#10217;
       DC d dummy-arg&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw a solid circle using the current fill color with  diameter  d
              (integer  in  basic  units  u)  with leftmost point at the current
              position; then move the current position to the rightmost point of
              the  circle.  An optional second integer argument is ignored (this
              allows to the formatter to generate an even number of  arguments).
              This command is a groff extension.

       Dc d&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw  circle  line with diameter d (integer in basic units u) with
              leftmost point at the current  position;  then  move  the  current
              position to the rightmost point of the circle.

       DE h v&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw  a  solid ellipse in the current fill color with a horizontal
              diameter of h and a vertical diameter of v (both integers in basic
              units  u)  with  the  leftmost point at the current position; then
              move to the rightmost point of the ellipse.   This  command  is  a
              groff extension.

       De h v&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw  an  outlined  ellipse  with a horizontal diameter of h and a
              vertical diameter of v (both integers in basic units u)  with  the
              leftmost  point  at  current  position; then move to the rightmost
              point of the ellipse.

       DF color-scheme [component ...]&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Set fill color for solid drawing  objects  using  different  color
              schemes;  the  analoguous  command  for setting the color of text,
              line graphics, and the outline of graphic objects is m.  The color
              components are specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65536.
              The number of color components and their meaning vary for the dif&#8208;
              ferent  color  schemes.  These commands are generated by the groff
              escape sequences \D&apos;F ...&apos;  and \M (with  no  other  corresponding
              graphics  commands).   No  position  changing.   This command is a
              groff extension.

              DFc cyan magenta yellow&#10216;line-break&#10217;
                     Set fill color for solid  drawing  objects  using  the  CMY
                     color  scheme, having the 3 color components cyan, magenta,
                     and yellow.

              DFd &#10216;line-break&#10217;
                     Set fill color for solid drawing  objects  to  the  default
                     fill color value (black in most cases).  No component argu&#8208;
                     ments.

              DFg gray&#10216;line-break&#10217;
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects to  the  shade  of
                     gray  given  by  the argument, an integer between 0 (black)
                     and 65536 (white).

              DFk cyan magenta yellow black&#10216;line-break&#10217;
                     Set fill color for solid drawing  objects  using  the  CMYK
                     color  scheme, having the 4 color components cyan, magenta,
                     yellow, and black.

              DFr red green blue&#10216;line-break&#10217;
                     Set fill color for solid  drawing  objects  using  the  RGB
                     color scheme, having the 3 color components red, green, and
                     blue.

       Df n&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              The argument n must be an integer in the range -32767 to 32767.

              0&#8804;n&#8804;1000
                     Set the color for filling solid drawing objects to a  shade
                     of  gray,  where  0  corresponds  to solid white, 1000 (the
                     default) to solid black, and values inbetween to intermedi&#8208;
                     ate shades of gray; this is obsoleted by command DFg.

              n&lt;0 or n&gt;1000
                     Set  the filling color to the color that is currently being
                     used for the text and the  outline,  see  command  m.   For
                     example, the command sequence

                            mg 0 0 65536
                            Df -1

                     sets all colors to blue.

              No position changing.  This command is a groff extension.

       Dl h v&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw  line  from  current  position  to offset (h, v) (integers in
              basic units u); then set current position to the end of the  drawn
              line.

       Dp h1 v1  h2 v2 ... hn vn&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Draw a polygon line from current position to offset (h1, v1), from
              there to offset (h2, v2), etc., up to offset  (hn, vn),  and  from
              there  back to the starting position.  For historical reasons, the
              position is changed by adding the sum of all  arguments  with  odd
              index  to  the actual horizontal position and the even ones to the
              vertical position.  Although this doesn&apos;t make sense  it  is  kept
              for compatibility.  This command is a groff extension.

       DP h1 v1  h2 v2 ... hn vn&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              The same macro as the corresponding Dp command with the same argu&#8208;
              ments, but draws a solid polygon in the current fill color  rather
              than an outlined polygon.  The position is changed in the same way
              as with Dp.  This command is a groff extension.

       Dt n&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              Set the current line thickness to n (an integer in basic units  u)
              if  n&gt;0;  if  n=0 select the smallest available line thickness; if
              n&lt;0 set the line thickness proportional to the point size (this is
              the  default before the first Dt command was specified).  For his&#8208;
              torical reasons, the horizontal position is changed by adding  the
              argument  to  the  actual  horizontal position, while the vertical
              position is not changed.  Although this doesn&apos;t make sense  it  is
              kept for compatibility.  This command is a groff extension.

   Device Control Commands
       Each  device control command starts with the letter x followed by a space
       character (optional or arbitrary space/tab in  groff)  and  a  subcommand
       letter  or word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a syntactical
       space.  All x commands are terminated by a  syntactical  line  break;  no
       device  control  command  can  be followed by another command on the same
       line (except a comment).

       The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase readability,
       it  can  be  written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of characters
       terminated by the next tab, space, or newline character.  All  characters
       of  the  subcommand  word but the first are simply ignored.  For example,
       troff outputs the initialization command x i as x init and the resolution
       command   x r   as   x res.    But   writings   like  x i_like_groff  and
       x roff_is_groff are accepted as well to mean the same commands.

       In the following, the syntax element  &#10216;line-break&#10217;  means  a  syntactical
       line break as defined in section Separation.

       xF name&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (Filename control command)
              Use  name  as  the  intended  name  for  the current file in error
              reports.  This is useful for remembering the  original  file  name
              when  groff  uses an internal piping mechanism.  The input file is
              not changed by this command.  This command is a groff extension.

       xf n s&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (font control command)
              Mount font position n (a non-negative integer) with font  named  s
              (a text word), cf.  groff_font(5).

       xH n&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (Height control command)
              Set character height to n (a positive integer in scaled points z).
              Classical troff used the unit points (p) instead; see section COM&#8208;
              PATIBILITY.

       xi &#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (init control command)
              Initialize device.  This is the third command of the prologue.

       xp &#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (pause control command)
              Parsed  but  ignored.   The  classical  documentation  reads pause
              device, can be restarted.

       xr n h v&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (resolution control command)
              Resolution is n, while h is the minimal horizontal motion,  and  v
              the  minimal  vertical motion possible with this device; all argu&#8208;
              ments are positive integers in basic units u per  inch.   This  is
              the second command of the prologue.

       xS n&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (Slant control command)
              Set slant to n degrees (an integer in basic units u).

       xs &#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (stop control command)
              Terminates  the processing of the current file; issued as the last
              command of any intermediate troff output.

       xt &#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (trailer control command)
              Generate trailer information, if any.  In groff, this is  actually
              just ignored.

       xT xxx&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (Typesetter control command)
              Set  name of device to word xxx, a sequence of characters ended by
              the next whitespace character.  The possible device names coincide
              with those from the groff -T option.  This is the first command of
              the prologue.

       xu n&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (underline control command)
              Configure underlining of spaces.  If n is 1, start underlining  of
              spaces; if n is 0, stop underlining of spaces.  This is needed for
              the cu request in nroff mode and is ignored otherwise.  This  com&#8208;
              mand is a groff extension.

       xX anything&#10216;line-break&#10217;
              (X-escape control command)
              Send  string  anything  uninterpreted  to the device.  If the line
              following this command starts with a  +  character  this  line  is
              interpreted  as a continuation line in the following sense.  The +
              is ignored, but a newline character is sent instead to the device,
              the  rest  of the line is sent uninterpreted.  The same applies to
              all following lines until the first character of a line is not a +
              character.  This command is generated by the groff escape sequence
              \X.  The line-continuing feature is a groff extension.

   Obsolete Command
       In classical troff output, emitting a single glyph was mostly done  by  a
       very  strange command that combined a horizontal move and the printing of
       a glyph.  It didn&apos;t have a command code, but is represented by a  3-char&#8208;
       acter argument consisting of exactly 2 digits and a character.

       ddc    Move  right  dd  (exactly  two decimal digits) basic units u, then
              print glyph with single-letter name c.

              In groff, arbitrary syntactical space around and within this  com&#8208;
              mand is allowed to be added.  Only when a preceding command on the
              same line ends with an argument of variable  length  a  separating
              space  is obligatory.  In classical troff, large clusters of these
              and other commands were used, mostly  without  spaces;  this  made
              such output almost unreadable.

       For  modern  high-resolution  devices,  this  command does not make sense
       because the width of the glyphs can become much larger than  two  decimal
       digits.   In  groff, this is only used for the devices X75, X75-12, X100,
       and X100-12.  For other devices, the commands t and u  provide  a  better
       functionality.

POSTPROCESSING
       The  roff postprocessors are programs that have the task to translate the
       intermediate output into actions that are sent to a device.  A device can
       be  some  piece  of hardware such as a printer, or a software file format
       suitable for graphical or text processing.   The  groff  system  provides
       powerful  means  that make the programming of such postprocessors an easy
       task.

       There is a library function that parses the intermediate output and sends
       the information obtained to the device via methods of a class with a com&#8208;
       mon interface for each device.  So a groff postprocessor must only  rede&#8208;
       fine  the  methods of this class.  For details, see the reference in sec&#8208;
       tion FILES.

EXAMPLES
       This section presents the intermediate output  generated  from  the  same
       input  for three different devices.  The input is the sentence hell world
       fed into groff on the command line.

       &#183; High-resolution device ps

         shell&gt; echo &quot;hell world&quot; | groff -Z -T ps

         x T ps
         x res 72000 1 1
         x init
         p1
         x font 5 TR
         f5
         s10000
         V12000
         H72000
         thell
         wh2500
         tw
         H96620
         torld
         n12000 0
         x trailer
         V792000
         x stop

       This output can be fed into the postprocessor grops(1) to get its  repre&#8208;
       sentation as a PostScript file.

       &#183; Low-resolution device latin1

         This is similar to the high-resolution device except that the position&#8208;
         ing is done at a minor scale.  Some comments (lines  starting  with  #)
         were added for clarification; they were not generated by the formatter.

         shell&gt; &quot;hell world&quot; | groff -Z -T latin1

         # prologue
         x T latin1
         x res 240 24 40
         x init
         # begin a new page
         p1
         # font setup
         x font 1 R
         f1
         s10
         # initial positioning on the page
         V40
         H0
         # write text `hell&apos;
         thell
         # inform about a space, and do it by a horizontal jump
         wh24
         # write text `world&apos;
         tworld
         # announce line break, but do nothing because ...
         n40 0
         # ... the end of the document has been reached
         x trailer
         V2640
         x stop

       This  output can be fed into the postprocessor grotty(1) to get a format&#8208;
       ted text document.

       &#183; Classical style output

         As a computer monitor has a very  low  resolution  compared  to  modern
         printers  the  intermediate  output for the X devices can use the jump-
         and-write command with its 2-digit displacements.

         shell&gt; &quot;hell world&quot; | groff -Z -T X100

         x T X100
         x res 100 1 1
         x init
         p1
         x font 5 TR
         f5
         s10
         V16
         H100
         # write text with old-style jump-and-write command
         ch07e07l03lw06w11o07r05l03dh7
         n16 0
         x trailer
         V1100
         x stop

       This  output  can  be  fed  into  the   postprocessor   xditview(1x)   or
       gxditview(1) for displaying in X.

       Due  to  the  obsolete  jump-and-write  command, the text clusters in the
       classical output are almost unreadable.

COMPATIBILITY
       The intermediate output language of the classical troff was  first  docu&#8208;
       mented in [CSTR #97].  The groff intermediate output format is compatible
       with this specification except for the following features.

       &#183; The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.

       &#183; The old hardware was very different from what we  use  today.   So  the
         groff devices are also fundamentally different from the ones in classi&#8208;
         cal troff.  For example, the classical  PostScript  device  was  called
         post  and  had  a  resolution  of  720 units per inch, while groff&apos;s ps
         device has a resolution of 72000 units per inch.  Maybe, by  implement&#8208;
         ing  some  rescaling  mechanism  similar  to the classical quasi device
         independence, these could be integrated into modern groff.
&#12;       &#183; The B-spline command D~ is correctly handled by the intermediate output
         parser,  but  the  drawing  routines  aren&apos;t implemented in some of the
         postprocessor programs.

       &#183; The argument of the commands s and x H has  the  implicit  unit  scaled
         point  z  in groff, while classical troff had point (p).  This isn&apos;t an
         incompatibility, but a compatible extension, for  both  units  coincide
         for  all devices without a sizescale parameter, including all classical
         and the groff text devices.  The few groff  devices  with  a  sizescale
         parameter  either  did not exist, had a different name, or seem to have
         had a different resolution.  So conflicts with  classical  devices  are
         very unlikely.

       &#183; The  position  changing after the commands Dp, DP, and Dt is illogical,
         but as old versions of groff used this feature it is kept for  compati&#8208;
         bility reasons.

       The  differences  between  groff  and  classical  troff are documented in
       groff_diff(7).
