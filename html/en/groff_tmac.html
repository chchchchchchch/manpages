GROFF_TMAC(5)                                                      GROFF_TMAC(5)



NAME
       groff_tmac - macro files in the roff typesetting system

DESCRIPTION
       The roff(7) type-setting system provides a set of macro packages suitable
       for special kinds of documents.  Each macro package stores its macros and
       definitions  in  a  file  called  the  package&apos;s  tmac file.  The name is
       deduced from `TroffMACros&apos;.

       The tmac files are normal roff source documents, except that they usually
       contain only definitions and setup commands, but no text.  All tmac files
       are kept in a single or a small number of directories, the tmac  directo&#8208;
       ries.

GROFF MACRO PACKAGES
       groff provides all classical macro packages, some more full packages, and
       some secondary packages for special purposes.  Note that it is not possi&#8208;
       ble to use multiple primary macro packages at the same time; saying e.g.

              sh# groff -m man -m ms foo

       or

              sh# groff -m man foo -m ms bar

       fails.  Exception to this is the use of man pages written with either the
       mdoc or the  man  macro  package.   See  below  the  description  of  the
       andoc.tmac file.

   Man Pages
       man    This  is  the  classical  macro  package  for  UNIX  manual  pages
              (man pages); it is quite handy and easy to use; see groff_man(7).

       doc
       mdoc   An alternative macro package for man pages mainly used in BSD sys&#8208;
              tems;  it  provides  many new features, but it is not the standard
              for man pages; see groff_mdoc(7).

       andoc
       mandoc Use this file in case you don&apos;t know whether the man macros or the
              mdoc  package  should be used.  Multiple man pages (in either for&#8208;
              mat) can be handled.

   Full Packages
       The packages in this section provide a complete set of macros for writing
       documents  of any kind, up to whole books.  They are similar in function&#8208;
       ality; it is a matter of taste which one to use.

       me     The classical me macro package; see groff_me(7).

       mm     The semi-classical mm macro package; see groff_mm(7).

       mom    The new mom macro package, only available in groff.   As  this  is
              not  based on other packages, it can be freely designed.  So it is
              expected to become  quite  a  nice,  modern  macro  package.   See
              groff_mom(7).

       ms     The classical ms macro package; see groff_ms(7).

   Language-specific Packages
       cs     This  file adds support for Czech localization, including the main
              macro packages (me, mom, mm, and ms).

              Note that cs.tmac sets the input encoding to latin-2.

       de
       den    German localization support, including  the  main  macro  packages
              (me, mom, mm, and ms).

              de.tmac  selects hyphenation patterns for traditional orthography,
              and den.tmac does the same for the new orthography (`Rechtschreib&#8208;
              reform&apos;).  It should be used as the last macro package on the com&#8208;
              mand line.

       fr     This file adds support for French localization, including the main
              macro packages (me, mom, mm, and ms).  Example:

                     sh# groff -ms -mfr foo.ms &gt; foo.ps

              Note that fr.tmac sets the input encoding to latin-9 to get proper
              support of the `oe&apos; ligature.

       sv     Swedish localization support, including the me, mom, and ms  macro
              packages.   Note  that  Swedish for the mm macros is handled sepa&#8208;
              rately; see groff_mmse(7).  It should be used as  the  last  macro
              package on the command line.

   Input Encodings
       latin1
       latin2
       latin5
       latin9 Various  input  encodings  supported directly by groff.  Normally,
              this macro is loaded at the very beginning of a document or speci&#8208;
              fied  as the first macro argument on the command line.  roff loads
              latin1 by default at start-up.  Note  that  these  macro  packages
              don&apos;t work on EBCDIC hosts.

       cp1047 Encoding  support  for  EBCDIC.   On  those platforms it is loaded
              automatically at start-up.  Due to different character ranges used
              in roff it doesn&apos;t work on architectures which are based on ASCII.

       Note  that  it  can  happen  that  some input encoding characters are not
       available for a particular output device.  For example, saying

       groff -Tlatin1 -mlatin9 ...

       fails if you use the Euro character in the input.  Usually, this  limita&#8208;
       tion  is  present  only  for  devices  which have a limited set of output
       glyphs (-Tascii, -Tlatin1); for other devices it is usually sufficient to
       install proper fonts which contain the necessary glyphs.

   Special Packages
       The  macro  packages  in  this  section  are not intended for stand-alone
       usage, but can be used to add special functionality to  any  other  macro
       package or to plain groff.

       60bit  Provide  some macros for addition, multiplication, and division of
              60bit integers (allowing safe multiplication  of  30bit  integers,
              for example).

       ec     Switch  to the EC and TC font families.  To be used with grodvi(1)
              &#8211; this man page also gives more details of how to use it.

       papersize
              This macro file is already loaded at start-up by troff so it isn&apos;t
              necessary  to call it explicitly.  It provides an interface to set
              the paper size on the command line with the  option  -dpaper=size.
              Possible  values for size are the same as the predefined papersize
              values in the DESC file (only  lowercase;  see  groff_font(5)  for
              more)  except  a7-d7.  An appended l (ell) character denotes land&#8208;
              scape orientation.  Examples: a4, c3l, letterl.

              Most output drivers need additional command line switches  -p  and
              -l  to override the default paper length and orientation as set in
              the driver specific DESC file.  For example, use the following for
              PS output on A4 paper in landscape orientation:

              sh# groff -Tps -dpaper=a4l -P-pa4 -P-l -ms foo.ms &gt; foo.ps

       pic    This  file  provides  proper definitions for the macros PS and PE,
              needed for the pic(1) preprocessor.   They  center  each  picture.
              Use  it  only if your macro package doesn&apos;t provide proper defini&#8208;
              tions for those two macros (actually, most of them already do).

       pspic  A single macro is provided in this file, PSPIC, to include a Post&#8208;
              Script  graphic  in a document.  The following output devices sup&#8208;
              port inclusion of PS images: -Tps, -Tdvi, -Thtml, and -Txhtml; for
              all other devices the image is replaced with a hollow rectangle of
              the same size.  This macro file is already loaded at  start-up  by
              troff so it isn&apos;t necessary to call it explicitly.

              Syntax:

                     .PSPIC [-L|-R|-C|-I n] file [width [height]]

              file is the name of the PostScript file; width and height give the
              desired width and height of the image.  If neither a width  nor  a
              height  argument is specified, the image&apos;s natural width (as given
              in the file&apos;s bounding box) or the current line length is used  as
              the  width,  whatever  is smaller.  The width and height arguments
              may have scaling indicators attached; the default scaling  indica&#8208;
              tor  is  i.   This macro scales the graphic uniformly in the x and
              y directions so that it is no more  than  width  wide  and  height
              high.   Option  -C  centers the graphic horizontally, which is the
              default.  The -L and -R options cause  the  graphic  to  be  left-
              aligned and right-aligned, respectively.  The -I option causes the
              graphic to be indented by n (default scaling indicator is m).

              For use of .PSPIC within a diversion it is recommended  to  extend
              it  with  the  following code, assuring that the diversion&apos;s width
              completely covers the image&apos;s width.

                     .am PSPIC
                     .  vpt 0
                     \h&apos;(\\n[ps-offset]u + \\n[ps-deswid]u)&apos;
                     .  sp -1
                     .  vpt 1
                     ..

       ptx    A single macro is provided in this file, xx, for  formatting  per&#8208;
              muted  index  entries  as  produces by the GNU ptx(1) program.  In
              case you need a different formatting, copy  the  macro  into  your
              document and adapt it to your needs.

       trace  Use  this  for  tracing macro calls.  It is only useful for debug&#8208;
              ging.  See groff_trace(7).

       tty-char
              Overrides the definition of standard  troff  characters  and  some
              groff  characters  for  TTY  devices.   The  optical appearance is
              intentionally inferior compared to that of normal  TTY  formatting
              to allow processing with critical equipment.

       www    Additions  of  elements known from the HTML format, as used in the
              internet (World Wide Web) pages; this includes URL links and  mail
              addresses; see groff_www(7).

NAMING
       Classical roff systems were designed before the conventions of the modern
       C getopt(3) call evolved, and used a naming  scheme  for  macro  packages
       that  looks  odd to modern eyes. Macro packages were always included with
       the option -m; when this option was directly  followed  by  its  argument
       without  an intervening space, this looked like a long option preceded by
       a single minus &#8212; a sensation in the computer stone  age.   To  make  this
       invocation  form  work,  classical  troff  macro packages used names that
       started with the letter `m&apos;, which was omitted in the naming of the macro
       file.

       For  example,  the  macro package for the man pages was called man, while
       its macro file tmac.an.  So it could be activated by the argument  an  to
       option -m, or -man for short.

       For  similar reasons, macro packages that did not start with an `m&apos; had a
       leading `m&apos; added in the documentation and in speech;  for  example,  the
       package  corresponding  to tmac.doc was called mdoc in the documentation,
       although a more suitable name would be doc.  For, when omitting the space
       between the option and its argument, the command line option for activat&#8208;
       ing this package reads -mdoc.

       To cope with all situations, actual versions of groff(1) are smart  about
       both  naming schemes by providing two macro files for the inflicted macro
       packages; one with a leading `m&apos; the other one without it.  So in  groff,
       the  man macro package may be specified as on of the following four meth&#8208;
       ods:

              sh# groff -m man
              sh# groff -man
              sh# groff -mman
              sh# groff -m an

       Recent packages that do not start with `m&apos; do not use an  additional  `m&apos;
       in  the  documentation.  For example, the www macro package may be speci&#8208;
       fied only as one of the two methods:

              sh# groff -m www
              sh# groff -mwww

       Obviously, variants like -mmwww would not make much sense.

       A second strange feature of classical troff was to name  macro  files  in
       the  form  tmac.name.  In modern operating systems, the type of a file is
       specified as a postfix, the file name extension.  Again, groff copes with
       this  situation by searching both anything.tmac and tmac.anything if only
       anything is specified.

       The easiest way to find out which macro packages are available on a  sys&#8208;
       tem is to check the man page groff(1), or the contents of the tmac direc&#8208;
       tories.

       In  groff,  most  macro  packages  are  described  in  man  pages  called
       groff_name(7), with a leading `m&apos; for the classical packages.

INCLUSION
       There are several ways to use a macro package in a document.  The classi&#8208;
       cal way is to specify the troff/groff option -m name  at  run-time;  this
       makes  the  contents  of the macro package name available.  In groff, the
       file name.tmac is searched within the tmac path; if not found,  tmac.name
       is searched for instead.

       Alternatively,  it is also possible to include a macro file by adding the
       request .so filename into the document; the argument  must  be  the  full
       file  name  of  an existing file, possibly with the directory where it is
       kept.  In groff, this was improved by the similar request  .mso  package,
       which added searching in the tmac path, just like option -m does.

       Note  that  in  order to resolve the .so and .mso requests, the roff pre&#8208;
       processor soelim(1) must be called if the files to be included need  pre&#8208;
       processing.   This  can be done either directly by a pipeline on the com&#8208;
       mand line or by using the troff/groff option -s.  man calls soelim  auto&#8208;
       matically.

       For example, suppose a macro file is stored as

              /usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac/macros.tmac

       and is used in some document called docu.roff.

       At run-time, the formatter call for this is

              sh# groff -m macros docu.roff

       To include the macro file directly in the document either

              .mso macros.tmac

       is used or

              .so /usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac/macros.tmac

       In  both  cases,  the formatter should be called with option -s to invoke
       soelim.

              sh# groff -s docu.roff

       If you want to write your own groff macro file, call it whatever.tmac and
       put it in some directory of the tmac path, see section FILES.  Then docu&#8208;
       ments can include it with the .mso request or the option -m.

WRITING MACROS
       A roff(7) document is a text file that is enriched by predefined  format&#8208;
       ting  constructs,  such  as  requests, escape sequences, strings, numeric
       registers, and macros from a macro package.  These elements are described
       in roff(7).

       To  give  a  document  a  personal style, it is most useful to extend the
       existing elements by defining some macros for repeating tasks;  the  best
       place  for  this  is  near the beginning of the document or in a separate
       file.

       Macros without arguments are just like strings.  But the  full  power  of
       macros  reveals  when arguments are passed with a macro call.  Within the
       macro definition, the arguments are available  as  the  escape  sequences
       \$1,  ..., \$9, \$[...], \$*, and \$@, the name under which the macro was
       called is in \$0, and the number of arguments is in register \n[.$];  see
       groff(7).

   Copy-in Mode
       The phase when groff reads a macro is called copy-in mode or copy mode in
       roff-talk.  This is comparable to the C preprocessing  phase  during  the
       development of a program written in the C language.

       In  this  phase,  groff  interprets  all backslashes; that means that all
       escape sequences in the macro body are interpreted and replaced by  their
       value.   For constant expressions, this is wanted, but strings and regis&#8208;
       ters that might change between calls of the macro must be protected  from
       being evaluated.  This is most easily done by doubling the backslash that
       introduces the escape sequence.  This doubling is most important for  the
       positional  parameters.   For  example, to print information on the argu&#8208;
       ments that were passed to the macro to the terminal, define a macro named
       `.print_args&apos;, say.

              .ds midpart was called with
              .de print_args
              .  tm \f[I]\\$0\f[] \*[midpart] \\n[.$] arguments:
              .  tm \\$*
              ..

       When calling this macro by

              .print_args arg1 arg2

       the following text is printed to the terminal:

              print_args was called with the following 2 arguments:
              arg1 arg2

       Let&apos;s  analyze each backslash in the macro definition.  As the positional
       parameters and the number of arguments change with each call of the macro
       their  leading  backslash  must  be  doubled,  which  results in \\$* and
       \\[.$].  The same applies to the macro name because it  could  be  called
       with an alias name, so \\$0.

       On  the  other hand, midpart is a constant string, it does not change, so
       no doubling for \*[midpart].  The  \f  escape  sequences  are  predefined
       groff  elements  for  setting  the font within the text.  Of course, this
       behavior does not change, so no doubling with \f[I] and \f[].

   Draft Mode
       Writing groff macros is easy when the escaping mechanism  is  temporarily
       disabled.   In  groff,  this is done by enclosing the macro definition(s)
       into a pair of .eo and .ec requests.  Then the body in the macro  defini&#8208;
       tion  is just like a normal part of the document &#8212; text enhanced by calls
       of requests, macros, strings, registers,  etc.   For  example,  the  code
       above can be written in a simpler way by

              .eo
              .ds midpart was called with
              .de print_args
              .  tm \f[I]\$0\f[] \*[midpart] \n[.$] arguments:
              .  tm \$*
              ..
              .ec

       Unfortunately,  draft  mode  cannot  be used universally.  Although it is
       good enough for defining normal macros, draft mode  fails  with  advanced
       applications,  such  as  indirectly  defined strings, registers, etc.  An
       optimal way is to define and test all macros in draft mode  and  then  do
       the  backslash  doubling as a final step; do not forget to remove the .eo
       request.

   Tips for Macro Definitions
       &#183;      Start every line with a dot,  for  example,  by  using  the  groff
              request  .nop for text lines, or write your own macro that handles
              also text lines with a leading dot.

                     .de Text
                     .  if (\\n[.$] == 0) \
                     .    return
                     .  nop \)\\$*\)
                     ..

       &#183;      Write a comment macro that works both for copy-in and draft  mode;
              for  as  escaping  is  off in draft mode, trouble might occur when
              normal comments are used.  For example, the following  macro  just
              ignores its arguments, so it acts like a comment line:
&#12;                     .de c
                     ..
                     .c This is like a comment line.

       &#183;      In  long  macro  definitions,  make  ample use of comment lines or
              almost-empty lines (this is, lines which have a  leading  dot  and
              nothing else) for a better structuring.

       &#183;      To  increase  readability,  use  groff&apos;s  indentation facility for
              requests and macro calls (arbitrary whitespace after  the  leading
              dot).

   Diversions
       Diversions  can  be  used  to  implement  quite advanced programming con&#8208;
       structs.  They are comparable to pointers to large data structures in the
       C programming language, but their usage is quite different.

       In  their  simplest form, diversions are multi-line strings, but they get
       their power when diversions are  used  dynamically  within  macros.   The
       (formatted) information stored in a diversion can be retrieved by calling
       the diversion just like a macro.

       Most of the problems arising with diversions can be avoided if you remain
       aware of the fact that diversions always store complete lines.  If diver&#8208;
       sions are used when the line buffer has not been flushed, strange results
       are  produced;  not  knowing this, many people get desperate about diver&#8208;
       sions.  To ensure that a diversion works, line breaks should be added  at
       the  right places.  To be on the secure side, enclose everything that has
       to do with diversions into a pair of line breaks; for example, by explic&#8208;
       itly  using .br requests.  This rule should be applied to diversion defi&#8208;
       nition, both inside and outside, and to all calls of diversions.  This is
       a bit of overkill, but it works nicely.

       [If  you  really  need diversions which should ignore the current partial
       line, use environments to save the current partial line  and/or  use  the
       .box request.]

       The most powerful feature using diversions is to start a diversion within
       a macro definition and end it  within  another  macro.   Then  everything
       between  each  call of this macro pair is stored within the diversion and
       can be manipulated from within the macros.

FILES
       All macro names must be named name.tmac to fully use the tmac  mechanism.
       tmac.name as with classical packages is possible as well, but deprecated.

       The  macro files are kept in the tmac directories; a colon separated list
       of these constitutes the tmac path.

       The search sequence for macro files is (in that order):

       &#183;      the directories  specified  with  troff/groff&apos;s  -M  command  line
              option

       &#183;      the directories given in the $GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment variable

       &#183;      the current directory (only if in unsafe mode, which is enabled by
              the -U command line switch)

       &#183;      the home directory

       &#183;      a platform-specific directory, being

                     /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac

              in this installation
&#12;       &#183;      a site-specific (platform-independent) directory, being

                     /usr/share/groff/site-tmac

              in this installation

       &#183;      the main tmac directory, being

                     /usr/share/groff/1.21/tmac

              in this installation

ENVIRONMENT
       $GROFF_TMAC_PATH
              A colon separated list of additional tmac directories in which  to
              search  for  macro files.  See the previous section for a detailed
              description.
