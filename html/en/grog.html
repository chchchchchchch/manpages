GROG(1)                                                                  GROG(1)



NAME
       grog - guess options for groff command

SYNOPSIS
       grog [-C] [groff-option ...] [--] [filespec ...]
       grog -h | --help
       grog -v | --version

DESCRIPTION
       grog  reads the input (file names or standard input) and guesses which of
       the groff(1) options are needed to perform the input with the groff  pro&#8208;
       gram.  The corresponding groff command is output.

OPTIONS
       The  only  grog  options  recognized  are -C (which is also passed on) to
       enable compatibility mode; -v and --version print information on the ver&#8208;
       sion  number;  and -h and --help print usage information.  -v, --version,
       -h, and --help stop the program directly without printing a groff command
       to standard output.

       All  other specified short options (words starting with one minus charac&#8208;
       ter -) are interpreted as groff options or option clusters with or  with&#8208;
       out  argument.   No  space is allowed between options and their argument.
       Except from the -marg options, all options will be passed on,  i.e.  they
       are  included  unchanged  in the command for the output without effecting
       the work of grog.

       A filespec argument can either be the name of an existing file or a  sin&#8208;
       gle minus - to mean standard input.  If no filespec is specified standard
       input is read automatically.

DETAILS
       grog reads all filespec parameters as a whole.  It tries to  guess  which
       of  the  following groff options are required for running the input under
       groff: -e, -man, -me, -mm, -mom, -ms, -mdoc, -mdoc-old, -p, -R,  -g,  -G,
       -s,  and  -t.   The guessed groff command including those options and the
       found filespec parameters is put on the standard output.

       It is possible to specify arbitrary groff options on  the  command  line.
       These  are  passed  on  the  output  without change, except for the -marg
       options.

       The groff program has trouble when the wrong -marg option or  several  of
       these  options  are  specified.  In these cases, grog will print an error
       message and exit with an error code.  It is better to  specify  no  -marg
       option.   Because  such  an  option is only accepted and passed when grog
       does not find any of these options or the same option is found.

       If several different -marg options are found by grog an error message  is
       produced  and the program is terminated with an error code.  But the out&#8208;
       put is written with the wrong options nevertheless.

       Remember that it is not necessary to determine a macro package.   A  roff
       file can also be written in the groff language without any macro package.
       grog will produce an output without an -marg option.

       As groff also works with pure text files without any roff requests,  grog
       cannot be used to identify a file to be a roff file.

       The groffer(1) program heavily depends on a working grog.

       The  grog source contains two files written in different programming lan&#8208;
       guages: grog.pl is the Perl version, while  grog.sh  is  a  shell  script
       using  BR  awk  (1).  During the run of make(1), it is determined whether
       the system contains a suitable version of perl(1).   If  so,  grog.pl  is
       transformed into grog; otherwise grog.sh is used instead.

EXAMPLES
       &#183;      Calling

                     grog meintro.me

              results in

                     groff -me meintro.me

              So  grog  recognized  that the file meintro.me is written with the
              -me macro package.

       &#183;      On the other hand,

                     grog pic.ms

              outputs

                     groff -pte -ms pic.ms

              Besides determining the macro package -ms,  grog  recognized  that
              the file pic.ms additionally needs -pte, the combination of -p for
              pic, -t for tbl, and -e for eqn.

       &#183;      If both files are combined by the command

                     grog meintro.me pic.ms

              an error message is sent to standard error  because  groff  cannot
              work with two different macro packages:

                     grog: error: there are several macro packages: -me -ms

              Additionally  the  corresponding  output with the wrong options is
              printed to standard output:

                     groff -pte -me -ms meintro.me pic.ms

              But the program is terminated with an error code.

       &#183;      The call of

                     grog -ksS -Tdvi grnexmpl.g

              contains several groff options that are just passed on the  output
              without  any interface to grog.  These are the option cluster -ksS
              consisting of -k, -s, and -S; and the option -T with argument dvi.
              The output is

                     groff -ksS -Tdvi grnexmpl.g

              so no additional option was added by grog.  As no option -marg was
              found by grog this file does not use a macro package.

       &#183;      grog can also handle files using the chem language.  The example

                     grog chAh_brackets.chem

              outputs

                     chem chAh_brackets.chem | groff -pe
&#12;              So chem is run first and groff is appended.  The option -p for pic
              is implied automatically by chem.  Additionally, the file uses eqn
              with -e.
