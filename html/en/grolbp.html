DESCRIPTION
       grolbp is a driver for groff that produces output in CAPSL and VDM format
       suitable for Canon LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers.

       For  compatibility  with  grolj4  there  is an additional drawing command
       available:

       \D&apos;R dh dv&apos;
              Draw a rule (i.e. a solid black rectangle), with one corner at the
              current  position,  and the diagonally opposite corner at the cur&#8208;
              rent position +(dh,dv).

OPTIONS
       Note that there can be whitespace between a one-letter option and its ar&#8208;
       gument;  on the other hand, there must be whitespace and/or an equal sign
       (`=&apos;) between a long-name option and its argument.

       -cnumcopies
       --copies=numcopies
              Print numcopies copies of each page.

       -l
       --landscape
              Print the document with a landscape orientation.

       -ppaper_size
       --papersize=paper_size
              Set the paper size to paper_size, which must be a valid paper size
              description as indicated in the section PAPER SIZES.

       -oorientation
       --orientation=orientation
              Print  the  document  with  orientation orientation, which must be
              `portrait&apos; or `landscape&apos;.

       -wwidth
       --linewidth=width
              Set the default line thickness to width thousandths of an em.   If
              this  option  isn&apos;t  specified,  the  line  thickness  defaults to
              0.04 em.

       -v
       --version
              Print the version number.

       -Fdir
       --fontdir=dir
              Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path for font and  de&#8208;
              vice  description  files;  name is the name of the device, usually
              lbp.
&#12;       -h
       --help Print a short help text.

TYPEFACES
       The driver supports the Dutch, Swiss and Swiss-Narrow scalable typefaces,
       each  one in the Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic styles.  Addition&#8208;
       ally, the Courier and Elite monospaced typefaces at the sizes  8  and  12
       points  (for  Courier)  resp.  8 and 10 points (for Elite) are supported,
       each one in the Regular, Bold and Italic styles.

       The following chart summarizes the font names you can use to access these
       fonts:

       tab(|)  allbox  center;  c c c c c ab c c c c Typeface | Regular | Bold |
       Italic | Bold-Italic Dutch | TR | TB | TI | TBI Swiss | HR | HB  |  HI  |
       HBI  Swiss Narrow | HNR | HNB | HNI | HNBI Courier | CR | CB | CI | Elite
       | ER | EB | EI |

PAPER SIZES
       The paper size can be set in the DESC file or with command  line  options
       to  grolbp.   If  the paper size is specified both ways, the command line
       options take precedence over the contents of the DESC file (this  applies
       to the page orientation too).

       See groff_font(5) how to set the paper dimensions in the DESC file.

       To set the paper size in the command line, add

         -p paper-size

       or

         --papersize=paper-size

       to the other grolbp options, where paper-size is in the same format as in
       the DESC file.

       If no paper size is specified in the DESC file or the command line, a de&#8208;
       fault size of A4 is used.

PAGE ORIENTATION
       As  with  the page size, the orientation of the printed page (portrait or
       landscape) can be set in the DESC file or with command line options.   It
       is also case insensitive.

       To set the orientation in the DESC file, insert a line with the following
       content:

         orientation [portrait|landscape]

       Only the first valid orientation command in the DESC file is used.

       To set the page orientation with command line options you can use the  -o
       or  --orientation option with the same parameters (portrait or landscape)
       as in the DESC file.  Or you can use the -l option to force the pages  to
       be printed in landscape.

FONT FILE FORMAT
       In addition to the usual commands described in groff_font(5), grolbp pro&#8208;
       vides the command lbpname which sets the font name sent  to  the  printer
       when requesting this font.  The syntax of this command is:

         lbpname printer_font_name

       &#183;      For bitmapped fonts, printer_font_name has the form
&#12;                N&#10216;base_fontname&#10217;&#10216;font_style&#10217;

              base_fontname  is the font name as it appears in the printers font
              listings without the first letter, up to (but not  including)  the
              font size.  font_style can be one of the letters R, I, or B, indi&#8208;
              cating the font styles Roman, Italic and Bold respectively.

              For  instance,  if  the  printer&apos;s  font  listing  A  shows   font
              `Nelite12I.ISO_USA&apos;,  the corresponding entry in the font descrip&#8208;
              tion file is

                lbpname NeliteI

              Note that you may need to modify grolbp to  add  support  for  new
              bitmapped  fonts, since the available font names and font sizes of
              bitmapped fonts (as documented above) are hard-coded into the pro&#8208;
              gram.

       &#183;      For  scalable  fonts,  printer_font_name  is identical to the font
              name as it appears in the printer&apos;s font listing A.

              For instance, to select the `Swiss&apos; font in bold style, which  ap&#8208;
              pears  in  the  printer&apos;s  font listing A as `Swiss-Bold&apos;, the re&#8208;
              quired lbpname command line is

                lbpname Swiss-Bold


       The argument of lbpname is case sensitive.
