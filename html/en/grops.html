GROPS(1)                                                                GROPS(1)



NAME
       grops - PostScript driver for groff

SYNOPSIS
       grops [-glmv] [-b n] [-c n] [-F dir] [-I dir] [-p papersize]
             [-P prologue] [-w n] [files ...]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option  and  its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grops  translates  the output of GNU troff to PostScript.  Normally grops
       should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tps option.   (Actu&#8208;
       ally, this is the default for groff.)  If no files are given, grops reads
       the standard input.  A filename of - also causes grops to read the  stan&#8208;
       dard  input.   PostScript output is written to the standard output.  When
       grops is run by groff options can be passed to  grops  using  groff&apos;s  -P
       option.

       Note that grops doesn&apos;t produce a valid document structure (conforming to
       the Document Structuring Convention) if called with multiple  file  argu&#8208;
       ments.   To  print such concatenated output it is necessary to deactivate
       DSC handling in the printing program  or  previewer.   See  section  FONT
       INSTALLATION below for a guide how to install fonts for grops.

OPTIONS
       -bn    Provide  workarounds for older printers, broken spoolers, and pre&#8208;
              viewers.   Normally  grops  produces  output  at  PostScript  Lan&#8208;
              guageLevel 2 that conforms to the Document Structuring Conventions
              version 3.0.  Some older printers, spoolers, and previewers  can&apos;t
              handle  such  output.   The value of n controls what grops does to
              make its output acceptable to such programs.  A value of 0  causes
              grops not to employ any workarounds.

              Add  1  if no %%BeginDocumentSetup and %%EndDocumentSetup comments
              should be generated; this is needed for early  versions  of  Tran&#8208;
              Script  that get confused by anything between the %%EndProlog com&#8208;
              ment and the first %%Page comment.

              Add 2 if lines in included  files  beginning  with  %!  should  be
              stripped out; this is needed for Sun&apos;s pageview previewer.

              Add  4  if  %%Page,  %%Trailer  and %%EndProlog comments should be
              stripped out of included files; this is needed for  spoolers  that
              don&apos;t understand the %%BeginDocument and %%EndDocument comments.

              Add  8  if the first line of the PostScript output should be %!PS-
              Adobe-2.0 rather than %!PS-Adobe-3.0; this is  needed  when  using
              Sun&apos;s Newsprint with a printer that requires page reversal.

              Add 16 if no media size information should be included in the doc&#8208;
              ument (this is, neither use %%DocumentMedia nor the  setpagedevice
              PostScript  command).   This  was  the  behaviour of groff version
              1.18.1 and earlier; it is needed for older  printers  which  don&apos;t
              understand  PostScript  LanguageLevel  2.  It is also necessary if
              the output is further processed to get an  encapsulated  PS  (EPS)
              file &#8211; see below.

              The default value can be specified by a

                     broken n
&#12;              command in the DESC file.  Otherwise the default value is 0.

       -cn    Print n copies of each page.

       -Fdir  Prepend  directory  dir/devname  to  the search path for prologue,
              font, and device description  files;  name  is  the  name  of  the
              device, usually ps.

       -g     Guess  the  page  length.   This  generates  PostScript  code that
              guesses the page length.  The guess is correct only if the  image&#8208;
              able  area is vertically centered on the page.  This option allows
              you to generate documents that  can  be  printed  both  on  letter
              (8.5&#215;11) paper and on A4 paper without change.

       -Idir  This  option may be used to add a directory to the search path for
              files on the command line and files named in  \X&apos;ps:  import&apos;  and
              \X&apos;ps:  file&apos;  escapes.   The  search path is initialized with the
              current directory.  This option may be specified more  than  once;
              the  directories  are  then  searched  in the order specified (but
              before the current directory).  If you want to  make  the  current
              directory  be read before other directories, add -I. at the appro&#8208;
              priate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an  absolute  file
              name.

       -l     Print the document in landscape format.

       -m     Turn manual feed on for the document.

       -ppaper-size
              Set  physical  dimension  of  output  medium.   This overrides the
              papersize, paperlength, and paperwidth commands in the DESC  file;
              it  accepts  the  same  arguments  as  the papersize command.  See
              groff_font (5) for details.

       -Pprologue-file
              Use the file prologue-file (in the  font  path)  as  the  prologue
              instead  of the default prologue file prologue.  This option over&#8208;
              rides the environment variable GROPS_PROLOGUE.

       -wn    Lines should be drawn using a thickness of n thousandths of an em.
              If  this  option  is  not  given,  the  line thickness defaults to
              0.04 em.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The input to grops must be in the format output  by  troff(1).   This  is
       described in groff_out(5).

       In  addition,  the  device and font description files for the device used
       must meet certain requirements: The resolution must be an integer  multi&#8208;
       ple  of 72 times the sizescale.  The ps device uses a resolution of 72000
       and a sizescale of 1000.

       The device  description  file  must  contain  a  valid  paper  size;  see
       groff_font(5) for more information.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              internalname psname

       which  says  that the PostScript name of the font is psname.  It may also
       contain a command
&#12;              encoding enc_file

       which says that the PostScript font should be reencoded using the  encod&#8208;
       ing  described  in  enc_file;  this  file should consist of a sequence of
       lines of the form:

              pschar code

       where pschar is the PostScript name of the character,  and  code  is  its
       position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer; valid values are
       in the range 0 to 255.   Lines  starting  with  #  and  blank  lines  are
       ignored.   The code for each character given in the font file must corre&#8208;
       spond to the code for the character in encoding file, or to the  code  in
       the  default  encoding  for  the font if the PostScript font is not to be
       reencoded.  This code can be used with the \N escape sequence in troff to
       select  the  character, even if the character does not have a groff name.
       Every character in the font file must exist in the PostScript  font,  and
       the widths given in the font file must match the widths used in the Post&#8208;
       Script font.  grops assumes that a character with a groff name  of  space
       is  blank (makes no marks on the page); it can make use of such a charac&#8208;
       ter to generate more efficient and compact PostScript output.

       Note that grops is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript  font,  not
       only  256.   enc_file (or the default encoding if no encoding file speci&#8208;
       fied) just defines the order of glyphs for the first 256 characters;  all
       other  glyphs  are  accessed with additional encoding vectors which grops
       produces on the fly.

       grops can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary to print
       the  document.  Such fonts must be in PFA format.  Use pfbtops(1) to con&#8208;
       vert a Type 1 font in PFB format.  Any downloadable fonts  which  should,
       when  required,  be  included  by  grops  must  be  listed  in  the  file
       /usr/share/groff/1.21/font/devps/download; this should consist  of  lines
       of the form

              font filename

       where  font  is the PostScript name of the font, and filename is the name
       of the file containing the font; lines beginning with # and  blank  lines
       are  ignored;  fields  may  be  separated  by tabs or spaces; filename is
       searched for using the same mechanism that is used for groff font  metric
       files.   The  download file itself is also searched for using this mecha&#8208;
       nism; currently, only the first found file in the font path is used.

       If the file containing a downloadable font or imported document  conforms
       to  the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions, then grops interprets any
       comments in the files sufficiently to ensure that its own output is  con&#8208;
       forming.   It  also supplies any needed font resources that are listed in
       the download file as well as any needed file resources.  It is also  able
       to  handle  inter-resource  dependencies.   For example, suppose that you
       have a downloadable font called Garamond, and also  a  downloadable  font
       called  Garamond-Outline which depends on Garamond (typically it would be
       defined to copy Garamond&apos;s font dictionary, and  change  the  PaintType),
       then  it  is  necessary for Garamond to appear before Garamond-Outline in
       the PostScript document.  grops handles this automatically provided  that
       the  downloadable font file for Garamond-Outline indicates its dependence
       on Garamond by means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example
       by beginning with the following lines

              %!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
              %%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
              %%EndComments
              %%IncludeResource: font Garamond

       In  this  case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed
       in the download file.  A downloadable font should  not  include  its  own
       name in a %%DocumentSuppliedResources comment.

       grops does not interpret %%DocumentFonts comments.  The %%DocumentNeeded&#8208;
       Resources,   %%DocumentSuppliedResources,   %%IncludeResource,   %%Begin&#8208;
       Resource,  and  %%EndResource  comments  (or possibly the old %%Document&#8208;
       NeededFonts,  %%DocumentSuppliedFonts,  %%IncludeFont,  %%BeginFont,  and
       %%EndFont comments) should be used.

       In  the  default setup there are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at
       font positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families A, BM, C,  H,
       HN, N, P, and T having members in each of these styles:

              AR     AvantGarde-Book
              AI     AvantGarde-BookOblique
              AB     AvantGarde-Demi
              ABI    AvantGarde-DemiOblique
              BMR    Bookman-Light
              BMI    Bookman-LightItalic
              BMB    Bookman-Demi

              NI     NewCenturySchlbk-Italic
              NB     NewCenturySchlbk-Bold
              NBI    NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic

              PI     Palatino-Italic
              PB     Palatino-Bold
              PBI    Palatino-BoldItalic
              TR     Times-Roman
              TI     Times-Italic
              TB     Times-Bold
              TBI    Times-BoldItalic

       There is also the following font which is not a member of a family:

              ZCMI   ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       There  are  also  some special fonts called S for the PS Symbol font, and
       SS, containing slanted lowercase Greek  letters  taken  from  PS  Symbol.
       Zapf  Dingbats is available as ZD, and a reversed version of ZapfDingbats
       (with symbols pointing in the opposite direction) is  available  as  ZDR;
       most characters in these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using \N.

       The default color for \m and \M is black; for colors defined in the `rgb&apos;
       color space setrgbcolor is used, for `cmy&apos; and `cmyk&apos;  setcmykcolor,  and
       for  `gray&apos;  setgray.   Note  that  setcmykcolor  is  a  PostScript  Lan&#8208;
       guageLevel 2 command and thus not available on some older printers.

       grops understands  various  X  commands  produced  using  the  \X  escape
       sequence; grops only interprets commands that begin with a ps: tag.

       \X&apos;ps: exec code&apos;
              This  executes  the  arbitrary  PostScript  commands in code.  The
              PostScript currentpoint is set to the position of the  \X  command
              before  executing  code.   The origin is at the top left corner of
              the page, and y coordinates increase down the page.  A procedure u
              is  defined  that converts groff units to the coordinate system in
              effect (provided the user doesn&apos;t change the scale).  For example,

                     .nr x 1i
                     \X&apos;ps: exec \nx u 0 rlineto stroke&apos;

              draws a horizontal line one inch long.  code may make  changes  to
              the graphics state, but any changes persist only to the end of the
              page.  A dictionary containing the definitions  specified  by  the
              def and mdef is on top of the dictionary stack.  If your code adds
              definitions to this dictionary, you should allocate space for them
              using  \X&apos;ps mdef n&apos;.   Any definitions persist only until the end
              of the page.  If you use the \Y escape sequence with  an  argument
              that  names  a  macro,  code  can extend over multiple lines.  For
              example,

                     .nr x 1i
                     .de y
                     ps: exec
                     \nx u 0 rlineto
                     stroke
                     ..
                     \Yy

              is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch long.  Note  the
              single  backslash  before  `nx&apos;  &#8211; the only reason to use a number
              register while defining the macro `y&apos; is to convert a  user-speci&#8208;
              fied dimension `1i&apos; to internal groff units which are in turn con&#8208;
              verted to PS units with the u procedure.

              grops wraps user-specified  PostScript  code  into  a  dictionary,
              nothing  more.   In  particular,  it  doesn&apos;t  start  and  end the
              inserted code with save and restore, respectively.  This  must  be
              supplied by the user, if necessary.

       \X&apos;ps: file name&apos;
              This  is  the  same as the exec command except that the PostScript
              code is read from file name.

       \X&apos;ps: def code&apos;
              Place a PostScript definition contained in code in  the  prologue.
              There should be at most one definition per \X command.  Long defi&#8208;
              nitions can be split over several \X commands; all the code  argu&#8208;
              ments are simply joined together separated by newlines.  The defi&#8208;
              nitions are placed in a dictionary which is  automatically  pushed
              on  the dictionary stack when an exec command is executed.  If you
              use the \Y escape sequence with an argument that  names  a  macro,
              code can extend over multiple lines.

       \X&apos;ps: mdef n code&apos;
              Like def, except that code may contain up to n definitions.  grops
              needs to know how many definitions code contains so  that  it  can
              create  an  appropriately  sized  PostScript dictionary to contain
              them.

       \X&apos;ps: import file llx lly urx ury width [ height ]&apos;
              Import a PostScript graphic from file.  The  arguments  llx,  lly,
              urx,  and  ury give the bounding box of the graphic in the default
              PostScript coordinate system; they should all be integers; llx and
              lly  are  the  x and y coordinates of the lower left corner of the
              graphic; urx and ury are the x and  y  coordinates  of  the  upper
              right  corner  of  the graphic; width and height are integers that
              give the desired width and height in groff units of the graphic.
&#12;              The graphic is scaled so that it has this  width  and  height  and
              translated so that the lower left corner of the graphic is located
              at the position associated with \X command.  If the  height  argu&#8208;
              ment  is  omitted it is scaled uniformly in the x and y directions
              so that it has the specified width.

              Note that the contents of the \X command are  not  interpreted  by
              troff;  so  vertical  space  for  the graphic is not automatically
              added, and the width and height arguments are not allowed to  have
              attached scaling indicators.

              If  the PostScript file complies with the Adobe Document Structur&#8208;
              ing Conventions and contains a  %%BoundingBox  comment,  then  the
              bounding  box  can be automatically extracted from within groff by
              using the psbb request.

              See groff_tmac(5) for a description of the PSPIC macro which  pro&#8208;
              vides  a  convenient  high-level  interface for inclusion of Post&#8208;
              Script graphics.

       \X&apos;ps: invis&apos;
       \X&apos;ps: endinvis&apos;
              No output is generated for text  and  drawing  commands  that  are
              bracketed with these \X commands.  These commands are intended for
              use when output from troff is  previewed  before  being  processed
              with  grops; if the previewer is unable to display certain charac&#8208;
              ters or other constructs, then other substitute characters or con&#8208;
              structs  can  be used for previewing by bracketing them with these
              \X commands.

              For example, gxditview is not able to display a proper \(em  char&#8208;
              acter because the standard X11 fonts do not provide it; this prob&#8208;
              lem can be overcome by executing the following request

                     .char \(em \X&apos;ps: invis&apos;\
                     \Z&apos;\v&apos;-.25m&apos;\h&apos;.05m&apos;\D&apos;l .9m 0&apos;\h&apos;.05m&apos;&apos;\
                     \X&apos;ps: endinvis&apos;\(em

              In this case, gxditview is unable to display  the  \(em  character
              and  draws  the  line, whereas grops prints the \(em character and
              ignores the line (this code is already in file Xps.tmac  which  is
              loaded  if  a  document  intended  for  grops  is  previewed  with
              gxditview).

       If a PostScript procedure BPhook has been  defined  via  a  `ps: def&apos;  or
       `ps: mdef&apos;  device command, it is executed at the beginning of every page
       (before anything is drawn or written by groff).  For example, to underlay
       the page contents with the word `DRAFT&apos; in light gray, you might use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook
              { gsave .9 setgray clippath pathbbox exch 2 copy
                .5 mul exch .5 mul translate atan rotate pop pop
                /NewCenturySchlbk-Roman findfont 200 scalefont setfont
                (DRAFT) dup stringwidth pop -.5 mul -70 moveto show
                grestore }
              def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       Or,  to  cause  lines  and  polygons to be drawn with square linecaps and
       mitered linejoins instead of the round linecaps  and  linejoins  normally
       used by grops, use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook { 2 setlinecap 0 setlinejoin } def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       (square  linecaps,  as opposed to butt linecaps (0 setlinecap), give true
       corners in boxed tables even though the lines are drawn unconnected).

   Encapsulated PostScript
       grops itself doesn&apos;t emit bounding box information.   With  the  help  of
       Ghostscript  the following simple script, groff2eps, produces an encapsu&#8208;
       lated PS file.

              #! /bin/sh
              groff -P-b16 $1 &gt;$1.ps
              gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox -- $1.ps 2&gt;$1.bbox
              cat $1.ps \
              | sed -e &quot;/^%%Orientation/r$1.bbox&quot; \
                    -e &quot;/^%!PS-Adobe-3.0/s/$/ EPSF-3.0/&quot; &gt;$1.eps
              rm $1.ps $1.bbox

       Just say

              groff2eps foo

       to convert file foo to foo.eps.

   TrueType and other font formats
       TrueType fonts can be used with grops if converted first to Type 42  for&#8208;
       mat,  a special PostScript wrapper equivalent to the PFA format mentioned
       in pfbtops(1).  There are several different methods to generate a  type42
       wrapper and most of them involve the use of a PostScript interpreter such
       as Ghostscript &#8211; see gs(1).

       Yet, the easiest method involves the use of the application  ttftot42(1).
       This  program  uses  freetype(3)  (version 1.3.1) to generate type42 font
       wrappers and well-formed AFM files that can be  fed  to  the  afmtodit(1)
       script  to  create appropriate metric files.  The resulting font wrappers
       should be added to the download file.  ttftot42 source code can be  down&#8208;
       loaded from ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/ &#10216;ftp://www.giga.or.at/
       pub/nih/ttftot42/&#10217;.

       Another solution for creating type42 wrappers is to use FontForge, avail&#8208;
       able  from  http://fontforge.sf.net &#10216;http://fontforge.sf.net&#10217;.  This font
       editor can convert most outline font formats.

FONT INSTALLATION
       This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it can serve as a
       step-by-step font installation guide for grops.

        &#183;  Convert  your  font to something groff understands.  This is either a
           PostScript Type 1 font in PFA format or a PostScript  Type  42  font,
           together with an AFM file.

           The very first characters in a PFA file look like this:

                  %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:

           A  PFB  file  has this also in the first line, but the string is pre&#8208;
           ceded with some binary bytes.

           The very first characters in a Type 42 font file look like this:

                  %!PS-TrueTypeFont

           This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.  Old PS  printers  might
           not  support  it  (this  is, they don&apos;t have a built-in TrueType font
           interpreter).

           If your font is in PFB format (such fonts normally have `.pfb&apos; as the
           file  extension), you might use groff&apos;s pfbtops(1) program to convert
           it to PFA.  For TrueType fonts, try ttftot42 or fontforge.   For  all
           other  font formats use fontforge which can convert most outline font
           formats.

        &#183;  Convert the AFM file to  a  groff  font  description  file  with  the
           afmtodit(1) program.  An example call is

                  afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm textmap FBB

           which  converts  the metric file `Foo-Bar-Bold.afm&apos; to the groff font
           `FBB&apos;.  If you have a font family  which  comes  with  normal,  bold,
           italic,  and  bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters
           R, B, I, and BI, respectively, as postfixes in the groff  font  names
           to  make groff&apos;s `.fam&apos; request work.  An example is groff&apos;s built-in
           Times-Roman font: The font family name is T, and the groff font names
           are TR, TB, TI, and TBI.

        &#183;  Install  both  the  groff  font  description files and the fonts in a
           `devps&apos; subdirectory of the font path which  groff  finds.   See  the
           ENVIRONMENT  section  in the troff(1) man page which lists the actual
           value of the font path.  Note that groff doesn&apos;t use  the  AFM  files
           (but it is a good idea to store them anyway).

        &#183;  Register  all  fonts  which  must be downloaded to the printer in the
           `devps/download&apos; file.  Only the first occurrence of this file in the
           font  path  is  read.   This  means  that you should copy the default
           `download&apos; file to the first directory in your font path and add your
           fonts  there.   To  continue  the above example we assume that the PS
           font name for Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is `XY-Foo-Bar-Bold&apos; (the PS font name
           is stored in the internalname field in the `FBB&apos; file), thus the fol&#8208;
           lowing line should be added to `download&apos;.

                  XY-Foo-Bar-Bold Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa

OLD FONTS
       groff versions 1.19.2 and earlier contain a slightly different set of the
       35  Adobe  core  fonts;  the  difference is mainly the lack of the `Euro&apos;
       glyph and a reduced set of kerning pairs.  For  backwards  compatibility,
       these old fonts are installed also in the

              /usr/share/groff/1.21/oldfont/devps

       directory.

       To use them, make sure that grops finds the fonts before the default sys&#8208;
       tem fonts (with the same names): Either add command  line  option  -F  to
       grops

              groff -Tps -P-F -P/usr/share/groff/1.21/oldfont ...

       or add the directory to groff&apos;s font path environment variable

              GROFF_FONT_PATH=/usr/share/groff/1.21/oldfont

ENVIRONMENT
       GROPS_PROLOGUE
              If  this  is set to foo, then grops uses the file foo (in the font
              path) instead of the default prologue file prologue.   The  option
              -P overrides this environment variable.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A list of directories in which to search for the devname directory
              in addition to the default ones.  See troff(1)  and  groff_font(5)
              for more details.
