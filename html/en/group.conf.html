GROUP.CONF(5)                   Linux-PAM Manual                   GROUP.CONF(5)



NAME
       group.conf - configuration file for the pam_group module

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it
       grants group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the
       authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the
       service they are applying for.

       For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly formatted
       /etc/security/group.conf file present. White spaces are ignored and lines
       maybe extended with &apos;\&apos; (escaped newlines). Text following a &apos;#&apos; is
       ignored to the end of the line.

       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       services;ttys;users;times;groups

       The first field, the services field, is a logic list of PAM service names
       that the rule applies to.

       The second field, the tty field, is a logic list of terminal names that
       this rule applies to.

       The third field, the users field, is a logic list of users, or a UNIX
       group, or a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies. Group names are
       preceded by a &apos;%&apos; symbol, while netgroup names are preceded by a &apos;@&apos;
       symbol.

       For these items the simple wildcard &apos;*&apos; may be used only once. With UNIX
       groups or netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are allowed.

       The times field is used to indicate &quot;when&quot; these groups are to be given
       to the user. The format here is a logic list of day/time-range entries.
       The days are specified by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for
       example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset
       MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all weekdays bar Monday. The two character
       combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two
       being week-end days and all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final
       example, AlFr means all days except Friday.

       Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a &apos;!&apos; to indicate &quot;anything
       but&quot;. The time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM, separated by a
       hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if the finish time is
       smaller than the start time it is deemed to apply on the following day).

       The groups field is a comma or space separated list of groups that the
       user inherits membership of. These groups are added if the previous
       fields are satisfied by the user&apos;s request.

       For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied by
       the applying process.

EXAMPLES
       These are some example lines which might be specified in
       /etc/security/group.conf.

       Running &apos;xsh&apos; on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user &apos;us&apos; is given access
       to the floppy (through membership of the floppy group)

           xsh;tty*&amp;!ttyp*;us;Al0000-2400;floppy
&#12;       Running &apos;xsh&apos; on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user &apos;sword&apos; is given
       access to games (through membership of the floppy group) after work
       hours.

           xsh; tty* ;sword;!Wk0900-1800;games, sound
           xsh; tty* ;*;Al0900-1800;floppy


       Any member of the group &apos;admin&apos; running &apos;xsh&apos; on tty*, is granted access
       (at any time) to the group &apos;plugdev&apos;

           xsh; tty* ;%admin;Al0000-2400;plugdev
