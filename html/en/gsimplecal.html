GSIMPLECAL(1)                                                      GSIMPLECAL(1)



NAME
       gsimplecal - lightweight calendar applet



SYNOPSIS
       gsimplecal [-h|--help|-v|--version|next_month|prev_month]



DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the usage of the gsimplecal command.


       gsimplecal is a lightweight calendar applet. When it is started, it first
       shows up, when you run it again, it closes the running instance.  It  was
       intentionally  made  for  use  with tint2 panel to be launched upon clock
       click, but of course it will work without it, you can  bind  it  to  some
       hotkey in you window manager, for example.


       Also,  you  may configure gsimplecal to display different world timezones
       clocks.  See the CONFIGURATION section to get to know how to.



COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
       -v, --version
            Print the program name and version to stdout, then exit with code 0.


       -h, --help
            Print the short usage help to stderr, then exit with error code 2.


       prev_month, next_month
            If the program is not running, simply run it.   If  the  program  is
            running, change currently displayed month.


       If  no options and commands are given, the program is toggled, i.e. if it
       is running it stops, otherwise it starts.



CONFIGURATION
       To  configure  the  application  you  should  manually  create  the  file
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gsimplecal/config      (usually      it      will     be
       ~/.config/gsimplecal/config) with contents like this:


              show_calendar = 1
              show_timezones = 1
              mark_today = 1
              show_week_numbers = 0
              close_on_unfocus = 0
              external_viewer = sunbird -showdate &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;
              clock_format = %a %d %b %H:%M
              mainwindow_decorated = 0
              mainwindow_keep_above = 1
              mainwindow_sticky = 0
              mainwindow_skip_taskbar = 1
              mainwindow_resizable = 0
              mainwindow_position = none
              mainwindow_xoffset = 0
              mainwindow_yoffset = 0
              clock_label = UTC
              clock_tz = :UTC
              clock_label = Local
              clock_tz =


       The  options  are  pretty  self  explanatory,  but   here   is   detailed
       description:


       show_calendar: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
            Sets  whether  the  calendar  should  be shown. Most users want this
            option to be 1.


       show_timezones: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
            Sets whether the different timezone clocks should be shown.


       mark_today: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
            Sets whether today&apos;s date will be marked in  the  calendar  (besides
            the  default  selection, i.e. when you click on the other day, today
            will remain marked somehow, e.g. in bold print).


       show_week_numbers: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
            Sets whether week numbers are shown in the calendar.


       close_on_unfocus: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
            Sets whether the calendar will close if the window loses focus. Note
            that if mainwindow_skip_taskbar is set to 1 then the calendar window
            may not be given focus upon creation


       external_viewer: string, defaults to empty string.
            Command line to run when  doubleclicking  a  date.  This  string  is
            strftime&apos;d  (see  man  strftime  for the possible substitutions) and
            passed to the shell. Thus  you  can  use  pipes,  redirections,  and
            whatever, I hope.
            Currently the shell is hardcoded to /bin/sh though. I hope that will
            do for all the users, but if you&apos;ve got a  trouble,  please  file  a
            ticket (see REPORTING BUGS).


       clock_format: string
            Sets the clocks format. Look man strftime for the possible formats.


       mainwindow_decorated: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
            Tells  your  window  manager to decorate or not to decorate the main
            window.


       mainwindow_keep_above: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
            Sets whether the main window  should  be  placed  on  top  of  other
            windows by your window manager.


       mainwindow_sticky: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
            Tells your window manager to show gsimplecal on all desktops.
&#12;
       mainwindow_skip_taskbar: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
            Sets  whether  the  main  window should be shown in the task list by
            your panel or window manager.


       mainwindow_resizable: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
            Sets whether your window manager should allow the main window to  be
            resized.   If  you  are using a tiling window manager which supports
            floating windows, setting this options to 0 will  most  likely  tell
            your WM not to tile the window.  (Tested with XMonad and Awesome).


       mainwindow_position: mouse|center|none, defaults to mouse.
            Tells your window manager where to place the gsimplecal window:

            mouse
                 close to the mouse cursor position (this one is useful when you
                 bind gsimplecal on some mouse click command);

            center
                 in the center of the screen;

            none
                 it&apos;s up to your window manager to decide, where  to  place  the
                 window  (this one is useful when you bind gsimplecal invocation
                 on some hotkey, so you can configure  your  window  manager  to
                 place gsimplecal in some predefined position).


       mainwindow_xoffset and mainwindow_yoffset: integer, default to 0.
            Allow  for  main  window  position  fine tuning. Throw an integer at
            these, and it&apos;ll move the window by that number of pixels.


       clock_label and clock_tz: string
            These two options should go in pairs and must be in the order given.
            Each pair creates new  clock.  The  clock_label  variable  sets  the
            string  to  be  displayed  near  the  clock,  the  clock_tz sets the
            timezone.
            If you omit the value for clock_tz, local time will be shown.
            For a list of timezones see man timezone, or ls /usr/share/zoneinfo



KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS
       You may use the following keyboard accelerators while  gsimplecal  window
       has a focus:


              Escape, Ctrl+w, Ctrl+q: close the window
              j: switch to the next month
              k: switch to the previous month
              J: jump one year forward
              K: jump one year backward
              g, Home: jump to the current date


       These are not yet configurable, but I&apos;m working on it.
