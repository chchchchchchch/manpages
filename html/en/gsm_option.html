GSM_OPTION(3)                                                      GSM_OPTION(3)



NAME
       gsm_option &#8212; customizing the GSM 06.10 implementation

SYNOPSIS
       #include &quot;gsm.h&quot;

       int gsm_option(handle, option, valueP);
       gsm handle;
       int option;
       int * valueP;

DESCRIPTION
       The  gsm  library is an implementation of the final draft GSM 06.10 stan&#8208;
       dard for full-rate speech transcoding, a lossy speech  compression  algo&#8208;
       rithm.

       The gsm_option() function can be used to set and query various options or
       flags that are not needed for regular GSM 06.10 encoding or decoding, but
       might be of interest in special cases.

       The  second  argument  to  gsm_option  specifies what parameter should be
       changed or queried.  The third argument is  either  a  null  pointer,  in
       which  case  the  current value of that parameter is returned; or it is a
       pointer to an integer containing the value you want to set, in which case
       the previous value will be returned.

       The following options are defined:

       GSM_OPT_VERBOSE Verbosity level.
              This  option  is  only  supported if the library was compiled with
              debugging turned on, and may be used by developers of  compression
              algorithms to aid debugging.
              The  verbosity level can be changed at any time during encoding or
              decoding.


       GSM_OPT_FAST Faster compression algorithm.
              This implementation offers a not strictly standard-compliant,  but
              faster  compression  algorithm that is compatible with the regular
              method and does not noticably degrade audio quality.
              The value passed to
                   gsm_option(handle, GSM_OPT_FAST, &amp; value)
              functions as a boolean flag; if it is zero, the regular  algorithm
              will be used, if not, the faster version will be used.
              The  availability  of this option depends on the hardware used; if
              it is not available, gsm_option will return -1 on  an  attempt  to
              set or query it.
              This option can be set any time during encoding or decoding.


       GSM_OPT_LTP_CUT Enable, disable, or query the LTP cut-off optimization.
              During  encoding,  the  search  for  the long-term correlation lag
              forms the bottleneck of the algorithm.  The ltp-cut option enables
              an  approximation that disregards most of the samples for purposes
              of finding that correlation, and hence speeds up the encoding at a
              noticable loss in quality.
              The value passed to
                   gsm_option(handle, GSM_OPT_LTP_CUT, &amp; value)
              turns the optimization on if nonzero, and off if zero.
              This  option  can  be set any time during encoding or decoding; it
              will only affect the encoding pass, not the decoding.
&#12;
       GSM_OPT_WAV49 WAV-style byte ordering.
              A WAV file of type #49 contains GSM 06.10-encoded frames.   Unfor&#8208;
              tunately,  the  framing  and  code ordering of the WAV version are
              incompatible with the native ones of this GSM 06.10 library.   The
              GSM_OPT_WAV49  option  turns on a different packing algorithm that
              produces alternating frames of 32 and 33 bytes (or makes  it  con&#8208;
              sume  alternating  frames  of  33  and 32 bytes, note the opposite
              order of the two numbers) which, when concatenated, can be used in
              the  body  of  a  WAV  #49 frame.  It is up to the user program to
              write a WAV header, if any; neither the  library  itself  nor  the
              toast program produce complete WAV files.
              The value passed to
                   gsm_option(handle, GSM_OPT_WAV49, &amp; value)
              functions  as  a boolean flag; if it is zero, the library&apos;s native
              framing algorithm will be used, if nonzero, WAV-type packing is in
              effect.
              This option should be used before any frames are encoded.  Whether
              or not it is supported at all depends on  a  compile-time  switch,
              WAV49.  Both option and compile time switch are new to the library
              as of patchlevel 9, and are  considerably  less  tested  than  the
              well-worn rest of the it.
              Thanks  to  Jeff  Chilton  for  the  detective work and first free
              implementation of this version of the GSM 06.10 encoding.


       GSM_OPT_FRAME_CHAIN Query or set the chaining byte.
              Between the two frames of a  WAV-style  encoding,  the  GSM  06.10
              library  must keep track of one half-byte that is technically part
              of the first frame, but will be written as the first four bits  of
              the  second.  This half-byte are the lowest four bits of the value
              returned by, and optionally set by,
                   gsm_option(handle, GSM_OPT_FRAME_CHAIN, &amp; value)
              This option can be queried and set at any time.


       GSM_OPT_FRAME_INDEX Query or set the current frame&apos;s index in a  format&apos;s
       alternating list of frames.
              The  WAV  #49 framing uses two alternating types of frames.  Which
              type the next GSM-coded frame belongs to can be queried, or,  when
              decoding, announced, using
                   gsm_option(handle, GSM_OPT_FRAME_INDEX, &amp; value)
              For WAV-style framing, the value should be 0 or 1; the first frame
              of an encoding has an index of 0.  At library initialization,  the
              index is set to zero.
              The  frame index can be queried and set at any time.  Used in com&#8208;
              bination with the GSM_OPT_FRAME_CHAIN, option, it can be  used  to
              position on arbitrary GSM frames within a format like WAV #49 (not
              accounting for the lost internal GSM state).

RETURN VALUE
       gsm_option() returns -1 if an option is not supported, the previous value
       of the option otherwise.
