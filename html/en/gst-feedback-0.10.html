GStreamer(1)                                                        GStreamer(1)



NAME
       gst-feedback - generate debug info for GStreamer bug reports

SYNOPSIS
       gst-feedback-0.10

DESCRIPTION
       gst-feedback  is  a utility that scans the system for various information
       that is useful to GStreamer developers to help diagnose user problem.

       Depending on the type of bug report, it may be useful to attach the  out&#8208;
       put of gst-feedback when you contact the developers.

       NOTE:  The  current  version  of  this  script  scans many dirs: /usr/lib
       /usr/local/lib /home /usr/include /usr/local/include  /home  (again)  for
       various  GStreamer  installations.   Depending on your system you may not
       want to do this.  Improvements to the script are welcome.

USAGE
       Generate the feedback information by running gst-feedback:

       gst-feedback

       Possibly redirect output and errors to a file:

       gst-feedback &amp;&gt; myfeedback

WARNING
       The gst-feedback dumps a lot of information about a system, some of which
       may  be  considered sensitive.  If this is a concern, review the informa&#8208;
       tion before posting to a public forum, such as the GStreamer bug tracking
       system.
