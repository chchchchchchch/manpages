GStreamer(1)                                                        GStreamer(1)



NAME
       gst-xmllaunch - build and run a GStreamer pipeline from an XML serializa&#8208;
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       gst-xmllaunch [OPTION...] XML-FILE [ ELEMENT.PROPERTY=VALUE ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       gst-xmllaunch is a tool that is used to build and run a  basic  GStreamer
       pipeline,  loading  it  from  an XML description. You can produce the XML
       description using gst-launch-0.10(1) with the -o  option  or  by  calling
       gst_xml_write_file() in your own app.

       A simple commandline looks like:

        gst-xmllaunch my-pipeline.xml filesrc0.location=music.mp3

       This  sets  the  location  property  of the element named filesrc0 to the
       value &quot;music.mp3&quot;. See gst-launch(1) for syntax on setting element names,
       and gst-inspect to see what properties various elements have.

       You can pass &quot;-&quot; as the XML-FILE to read from stdin.

       XML-FILE  can be a URI as well, thanks to the wizardry of libxml. I&apos;m not
       really sure what all is supported, it seems http works just fine though.


WARNING
       gst-xmllaunch is deprecated and broken for all but the most simple  pipe&#8208;
       lines. It will most likely be removed in future. Don&apos;t use it.
