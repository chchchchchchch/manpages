gtk-options(7)                 GTK+ User&#180;s Manual                 gtk-options(7)



NAME
       gtk-options - Standard Command Line Options for GTK+ Programs

SYNOPSIS
       program [standard options] [specific options] arguments

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page describes the command line options, which are common to
       all GTK+ based applications.

OPTIONS
   GTK+ OPTIONS
       --gtk-module=MODULE
              Load an additional Gtk module.

       --gtk-debug=FLAGS
              A colon separated list of GTK+  debugging  flags  to  set.   Valid
              flags  are  objects, misc, signals, dnd, and plugsocket.  The spe&#8208;
              cial value all enables all flags.

       --gtk-no-debug=FLAGS
              GTK+ debugging flags to unset.  Use this options to  override  the
              GTK_DEBUG environment variable.

       --g-fatal-warnings
              Make all warnings fatal.

   GDK OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Set the X display to use.  Use this option to override the DISPLAY
              environment variable.

       --screen=SCREEN
              X screen to use.  Use this options to override the screen part  of
              the DISPLAY environment variable (see the DISPLAY NAMES section of
              the X(7x) manual page).

       --sync Make X calls synchronous.  This slows down the  program  consider&#8208;
              ably, but may be useful for debugging purposes.

       --no-xshm
              Do  not  use  the  X  server&#180;s XSHM shared memory extension.  This
              slows down the program.

       --name=NAME
              Program name as used by the window manager.

       --class=CLASS
              Program class as used by the window manager.

       --gxid_host=HOST

       --gxid_port=PORT

       --xim-preedit

       --xim-status
              Control the X input method.

       --gdk-debug=FLAGS
              A colon-separated list of GDK debugging flags to set.   This  only
              works  if  your  GDK  library  was compile with debugging support.
              Valid flags are events, misc, dnd, color-context,  and  xim.   The
              special value all enables all valid flags.

       --gdk-no-debug=FLAGS
              A  colon-separated list of GDK debugging flags to unset.  Use this
              options to override the GDK_DEBUG environment variable.

SEE ALSO
       X(7x), the GTK+ documentation, and the GDK documentation.

       For most GTK+ programs there will be  additional  command  line  options,
       which are specific to the program.  These will be explained in the appli&#8208;
       cation&#180;s documentation.
