GTKPOD(1)                         gtkpod Manual                        GTKPOD(1)



NAME
       gtkpod - GTK2 based software for managing songs and playlists on an Apple
       iPod

SYNOPSIS
       gtkpod [-h] [-m path] [-p filename] [--hash filename]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly describes the gtkpod command.

OPTIONS
       gtkpod supports the following options:

       -h, --help
           Displays the help message.

       -m, --mountpoint path
           Define the mountpoint of your iPod.

       -p filename
           Increment playcount for file filename by one.

       --hash filename
           Print gtkpod hash for file filename.

FILES
       ~/.gtkpod/prefs
           Per user configuration file. Should normally only updated through the
           program itself.

       /etc/gtkpod/prefs
           Global configuration file. Used if no configuration file exist for
           the user starting gtkpod.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.in
           If this file exists, gtkpod will try to execute it at startup This is
           done before attempting to mount the iPod directory (optional) or read
           the iTunesDB (optional).

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.out
           If this file exists, gtkpod will try to execute it while exiting the
           program. This is done after attempting to unmount the iPod directory
           (optional) and sending the &quot;eject&quot; command to the iPod (optional).

       /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in, /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.out
           Used instead of the per user scripts if the former ones don&apos;t exist
           and these do.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.load
           If this file exists, gtkpod will execute it before loading the
           contents of an iPod with the iPod&apos;s mountpoint as the only command
           line argument. Put any commands needed to access the iPod here, for
           example if you need to mount the iPod manually.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.eject
           If this file exists, gtkpod will execute it when ejecting an iPod
           with the the iPod&apos;s mountpoint as the only command line argument. Put
           any commands you want to execute after gtkpod has written the changes
           to the iPod here.  For example:

           sudo eject $1
&#12;           gtkpod will not attempt to do any magic of it&apos;s own to
           mount/unmount/eject the iPod.
