NAME
       guile - a Scheme interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       guile  [-q]  [-ds] [--help] [--version] [--emacs] [--debug] [-l FILE] [-e
       FUNCTION] [] [-c EXPR] [-s SCRIPT] [--]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Guile is an interpreter for  the  Scheme  programming  language.   It
       implements  R5RS,  providing additional features necessary for real-world
       use.  It is extremely simple to embed guile into a C program,  calling  C
       from Scheme and Scheme from C.  Guile&apos;s design makes it very suitable for
       use as an &quot;extension&quot; or &quot;glue&quot; language, but it also  works  well  as  a
       stand-alone scheme development environment.

       The guile executable itself provides a stand-alone interpreter for scheme
       programs, for either interactive use or executing scripts.

       This manpage provides only brief instruction in invoking guile  from  the
       command  line.   Please  consult  the guile info documentation (type info
       guile at a command prompt) for more information.  There is also  a  tuto&#8208;
       rial (info guile-tut) available.


OPTIONS
       -l     Load scheme source code from file.

       -e     After reading script, apply FUNCTION to command-line arguments

       -ds    do  -s  SCRIPT at this point (note that this argument must be used
              in conjuction with -s)

       --help Describe command line options and exit

       --debug
              Start guile with debugging evaluator and backtraces enabled  (use&#8208;
              ful for debugging guile scripts)

       --version
              Display guile version and exit.

       --emacs
              Enable emacs protocol for use from within emacs (experimental)

       --     Stop argument processing, start guile in interactive mode.

       -c     Stop argument processing, evaluate EXPR as a scheme expression.

       -s     Load Scheme source from SCRIPT-FILE and execute as a script.


ENVIRONMENT
       GUILE_LOAD_PATH
              If  $GUILE_LOAD_PATH is set, its value is used to agument the path
              to search for scheme files when loading.  It  should  be  a  colon
              separated  list  of  directories  which  will  be prepended to the
              default %load-path.


FILES
       ~/.guile is a guile script that is executed before any  other  processing
       occurs.   For  example,  the  following .guile activates guile&apos;s readline
       interface:

           (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
           (activate-readline)


SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for guile is maintained as a Texinfo  manual.   If
       the info and guile programs are properly installed at your site, the com&#8208;
       mand

              info guile

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       http://www.schemers.org provides a general  introduction  to  the  Scheme
       language.

       guile is GNU software.  Guile is originally based on Aubrey Jaffer&apos;s  SCM
       interpreter, and is the work of many individuals.
