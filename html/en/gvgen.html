NAME
       gvgen - generate graphs

SYNOPSIS
       gvgen  [ -d?  ] [ -cn ] [ -Cx,y ] [ -g[f]x,y ] [ -G[f]x,y ] [ -hn ] [ -kn
       ] [ -bx,y ] [ -pn ] [ -sn ] [ -Sn ] [ -tn ] [ -Tx,y ] [ -wn ] [ -ooutfile
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       gvgen  generates  a  variety  of  simple,  regularly-structured  abstract
       graphs.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -c n   Generate a cycle with n vertices and edges.

       -C x,y Generate an x by y cylinder.  This  will  have  x*y  vertices  and
              2*x*y - y edges.

       -g [f]x,y
              Generate  an x by y grid.  If f is given, the grid is folded, with
              an edge attaching each pair of  opposing  corner  vertices.   This
              will  have  x*y  vertices  and 2*x*y - y - x edges if unfolded and
              2*x*y - y - x + 2 edges if folded.

       -G [f]x,y
              Generate an x by y partial grid.  If  f  is  given,  the  grid  is
              folded,  with  an edge attaching each pair of opposing corner ver&#8208;
              tices.  This will have x*y vertices.

       -h n   Generate a hypercube of degree n.  This will have 2^n vertices and
              n*2^(n-1) edges.

       -k n   Generate a complete graph on n vertices with n*(n-1)/2 edges.

       -b x,y Generate  a  complete  x by y bipartite graph.  This will have x+y
              vertices and x*y edges.

       -p n   Generate a path on n vertices.  This will have n-1 edges.

       -s n   Generate a star on n vertices.  This will have n-1 edges.

       -S n   Generate a Sierpinski graph of order n.  This will have 3*(3^(n-1)
              - 1)/2 vertices and 3^n edges.

       -t n   Generate a binary tree of height n.  This will have 2^n-1 vertices
              and 2^n-2 edges.

       -T x,y Generate an x by y torus.  This will have x*y vertices  and  2*x*y
              edges.

       -w n   Generate a path on n vertices.  This will have n-1 edges.

       -o outfile
              If  specified,  the  generated graph is written into the file out&#8208;
              file.  Otherwise, the graph is written to standard out.

       -d     Make the generated graph directed.

       -?     Print usage information.
&#12;EXIT STATUS
       gvgen exits with 0 on successful completion, and exits with 1 if given an
       ill-formed  or  incorrect flag, or if the specified output file could not
       be opened.
