VIMDIFF(1)                                                            VIMDIFF(1)



NAME
       vimdiff  -  edit  two, three or four versions of a file with Vim and show
       differences

SYNOPSIS
       vimdiff [options] file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]

       gvimdiff

DESCRIPTION
       Vimdiff starts Vim on two (or three or four) files.  Each file  gets  its
       own  window.  The differences between the files are highlighted.  This is
       a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes  from  one  version  to
       another version of the same file.

       See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.

       When started as gvimdiff the GUI will be started, if available.

       In  each  window  the &apos;diff&apos; option will be set, which causes the differ&#8208;
       ences to be highlighted.
       The &apos;wrap&apos; and &apos;scrollbind&apos; options are set to make the text look good.
       The &apos;foldmethod&apos; option is set to &quot;diff&quot;,  which  puts  ranges  of  lines
       without changes in a fold.  &apos;foldcolumn&apos; is set to two to make it easy to
       spot the folds and open or close them.

OPTIONS
       Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if the &quot;-O&quot; argument  was
       used.  To use horizontal splits instead, use the &quot;-o&quot; argument.

       For all other arguments see vim(1).
