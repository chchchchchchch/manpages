GVPACK(1)                                                              GVPACK(1)



NAME
       gvpack - merge and pack disjoint graphs

SYNOPSIS
       gvpack [ -nguv?  ] [ -mmargin ] [ -ooutfile ] [ -Gname=value ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       gvpack  reads  in  a  stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a single
       layout, and produces a single graph serving as the  union  of  the  input
       graphs.  The input graphs must be in dot format, and must have all neces&#8208;
       sary layout information. Acceptable  input  is  produced  by  applying  a
       Graphviz layout program, such as dot or neato, with no -T flag.

       By  default, the packing is done at the cluster level. Thus, parts of one
       graph will not intrude into any top&#8208;level clusters or overlap  any  nodes
       or edges of another.

       The  output  of gvpack can be used to produce concrete output by applying
       neato -s -n2 with the desired -T flag.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -g     Combines the graphs at the graph level. This uses more space,  but
              prevents  parts  of  one  graph  from  occurring  between parts of
              another.

       -Gname=value
              Specifies attributes to be added to the resulting union graph. For
              example, this can be used to specify a graph label.

       -mmargin
              Packs  the  graphs  allowing  a margin of output points around the
              parts.

       -n     Combines the graphs at the node level. Clusters are ignored in the
              packing.

       -ooutput
              Prints  output  to the file output. If not given, gvpack uses std&#8208;
              out.

       -u     Don&apos;t pack the graphs. Just combine them into a single graph.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -?     Prints usage information and exit.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If  no
               files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

RETURN CODES
       gvpack returns 0 if there were no problems, and non&#8208;zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       ccomps -x abc.dot | dot | gvpack | neato -s -n2 -Tps
       This  pipeline  decomposes the graph in abc.dot into its connected compo&#8208;
       nents, lays out each using dot, packs them all together again,  and  pro&#8208;
       duces  the  final  drawing  in PostScript. Of course, there is nothing to
       prevent one from using different layouts for each component.

BUGS
       All the input graphs must be directed or undirected.

       An input graph should not have a label, since this will be  used  in  its
       layout. Since gvpack ignores root graph labels, resulting layout may con&#8208;
       tain some extra space.

       gvpack unsets the bounding box attribute of all non&#8208;cluster subgraphs.
