GVPR(1)                                                                  GVPR(1)



NAME
       gvpr - graph pattern scanning and processing language
       ( previously known as gpr )

SYNOPSIS
       gvpr  [-icqV?]   [  -o  outfile  ] [ -a args ] [ &apos;prog&apos; | -f progfile ] [
       files ]

DESCRIPTION
       gvpr is a graph stream editor inspired by awk.  It copies input graphs to
       its  output, possibly transforming their structure and attributes, creat&#8208;
       ing new graphs, or printing arbitrary information.  The  graph  model  is
       that  provided  by  libcgraph(3).   In  particular, gvpr reads and writes
       graphs using the dot language.

       Basically, gvpr traverses each input graph, denoted by $G, visiting  each
       node  and  edge,  matching it with the predicate&#8208;action rules supplied in
       the input program.  The rules are evaluated in order.  For each predicate
       evaluating  to  true,  the corresponding action is performed.  During the
       traversal, the current node or edge being visited is denoted by $.

       For each input graph, there is a target subgraph,  denoted  by  $T,  ini&#8208;
       tially empty and used to accumulate chosen entities, and an output graph,
       $O, used for final processing and then written to  output.   By  default,
       the output graph is the target graph.  The output graph can be set in the
       program or, in a limited sense, on the command line.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -a args
              The string args is split into  whitespace&#8208;separated  tokens,  with
              the  individual tokens available as strings in the gvpr program as
              ARGV[0],...,ARGV[ARGC-1].  Whitespace characters within single  or
              double  quoted substrings, or preceded by a backslash, are ignored
              as separators.  In general, a backslash character  turns  off  any
              special  meaning of the following character.  Note that the tokens
              derived from multiple -a flags are concatenated.

       -c     Use the source graph as the output graph.

       -i     Derive the node&#8208;induced subgraph extension of the output graph  in
              the context of its root graph.

       -o outfile
              Causes  the  output stream to be written to the specified file; by
              default, output is written to stdout.

       -f progfile
              Use the contents of the specified file as the program  to  execute
              on  the input. If progfile contains a slash character, the name is
              taken as the pathname of the file. Otherwise, gvpr  will  use  the
              directories  specified in the environment variable GPRPATH to look
              for the file. If -f is not given, gvpr will  use  the  first  non&#8208;
              option argument as the program.

       -q     Turns off warning messages.

       -V     Causes the program to print version information and exit.

       -?     Causes the program to print usage information and exit.
&#12;OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names  of  files containing 1 or more graphs in the dot language.
               If no -f option is given, the first name is removed from the list
               and  used  as  the  input program. If the list of files is empty,
               stdin will be used.

PROGRAMS
       A gvpr program consists of a list of predicate&#8208;action clauses, having one
       of the forms:

              BEGIN { action }

              BEG_G { action }

              N [ predicate ] { action }

              E [ predicate ] { action }

              END_G { action }

              END { action }

       A  program  can  contain  at most one of each of the BEGIN, END_G and END
       clauses.  There can be any number of BEG_G, N and E statements, the first
       applied  to  graphs,  the second to nodes, the third to edges.  These are
       separated into blocks, a block consisting of an optional BEG_G  statement
       and  all  N and E statements up to the next BEG_G statement, if any.  The
       top&#8208;level semantics of a gvpr program are:

              Evaluate the BEGIN clause, if any.
              For each input graph G {
                  For each block {
                      Set G as the current graph and current object.
                      Evaluate the BEG_G clause, if any.
                      For each node and edge in G {
                          Set the node or edge as the current object.
                          Evaluate the N or E clauses, as appropriate.
                      }
                  }
                  Set G as the current object.
                  Evaluate the END_G clause, if any.
              }
              Evaluate the END clause, if any.

       The actions of the BEGIN, BEG_G, END_G and END clauses are performed when
       the  clauses  are evaluated.  For N or E clauses, either the predicate or
       action may be omitted.  If there is no  predicate  with  an  action,  the
       action  is  performed on every node or edge, as appropriate.  If there is
       no action and the predicate evaluates to true,  the  associated  node  or
       edge is added to the target graph.

       The  blocks  are  evaluated  in  the order in which they occur.  Within a
       block, the N clauses (E clauses, respectively) are evaluated in the order
       in which the occur. Note, though, that within a block, N or E clauses may
       be interlaced, depending on the traversal order.

       Predicates and actions are sequences of statements in the C dialect  sup&#8208;
       ported by the libexpr(3) library.  The only difference between predicates
       and actions is that the former must have a type that may  interpreted  as
       either  true or false.  Here the usual C convention is followed, in which
       a non&#8208;zero value is considered true. This would include non&#8208;empty strings
       and  non&#8208;empty  references to nodes, edges, etc. However, if a string can
       be converted to an integer, this value is used.
&#12;       In addition to the usual C base types  (void,  int,  char,  float,  long,
       unsigned  and  double),  gvpr provides string as a synonym for char*, and
       the graph&#8208;based types node_t, edge_t, graph_t and obj_t.  The obj_t  type
       can  be  viewed as a supertype of the other 3 concrete types; the correct
       base type is maintained dynamically.  Besides these base types, the  only
       other supported type expressions are (associative) arrays.

       Constants follow C syntax, but strings may be quoted with either &quot;...&quot; or
       &apos;...&apos;. In certain contexts, string values are interpreted as patterns for
       the  purpose  of  regular  expression matching.  Patterns use ksh(1) file
       match pattern syntax.  gvpr accepts C++ comments as well as cpp&#8208;type com&#8208;
       ments.   For  the latter, if a line begins with a &apos;#&apos; character, the rest
       of the line is ignored.

       A statement can be a declaration of a function, a variable or  an  array,
       or  an  executable  statement. For declarations, there is a single scope.
       Array declarations have the form:

               type array [ type0 ]

       where  type0  is optional. If it is supplied,  the  parser  will  enforce
       that all array subscripts have the specified type. If it is not supplied,
       objects of all types can be used as subscripts.  As in C,  variables  and
       arrays  must  be  declared. In particular, an undeclared variable will be
       interpreted as the name of an attribute of a node, edge or graph, depend&#8208;
       ing on the context.

       Executable statements can be one of the following:
              { [ statement ... ] }
              expression              // commonly var = expression
              if( expression ) statement [ else statement ]
              for( expression ; expression ; expression ) statement
              for( array [ var ]) statement
              forr( array [ var ]) statement
              while( expression ) statement
              switch( expression ) case statements
              break [ expression ]
              continue [ expression ]
              return [ expression ]
       Items in brackets are optional.

       In the second form of the for statement and the forr statement, the vari&#8208;
       able var is set to each value used as an index in the specified array and
       then  the  associated  statement  is  evaluated.  For  numeric and string
       indices, the indices are returned in increasing (decreasing)  numeric  or
       lexicographic  order  for  for (forr, respectively). This can be used for
       sorting.

       Function definitions can only appear in the BEGIN clause.

       Expressions include the usual C expressions.  String comparisons using ==
       and  !=  treat the right hand operand as a pattern.  gvpr will attempt to
       use an expression as a string or numeric value as appropriate.

       Expressions of graphical type (i.e., graph_t, node_t, edge_t, obj_t)  may
       be  followed  by  a  field  reference in the form of .name. The resulting
       value is the value of the attribute named name of the given  object.   In
       addition,  in  certain  contexts  an undeclared, unmodified identifier is
       taken to be an attribute  name.  Specifically,  such  identifiers  denote
       attributes of the current node or edge, respectively, in N and E clauses,
       and the current graph in BEG_G and END_G clauses.

       As usual in the libcgraph(3) model,  attributes  are  string&#8208;valued.   In
       addition,  gvpr  supports certain pseudo&#8208;attributes of graph objects, not
       necessarily string&#8208;valued. These  reflect  intrinsic  properties  of  the
       graph objects and cannot be set by the user.

       head : node_t
              the head of an edge.

       tail : node_t
              the tail of an edge.

       name : string
              the  name  of  an edge, node or graph. The name of an edge has the
              form &quot;&lt;tail&#8208;name&gt;&lt;edge&#8208;op&gt;&lt;head&#8208;name&gt;[&lt;key&gt;]&quot;, where &lt;edge&#8208;op&gt;  is
              &quot;-&gt;&quot;  or  &quot;--&quot;  depending on whether the graph is directed or not.
              The bracket part [&lt;key&gt;] only appears if the edge has a  non&#8208;triv&#8208;
              ial key.

       indegree : int
              the indegree of a node.

       outdegree : int
              the outdegree of a node.

       degree : int
              the degree of a node.

       root : graph_t
              the root graph of an object. The root of a root graph is itself.

       parent : graph_t
              the parent graph of a subgraph. The parent of a root graph is NULL

       n_edges : int
              the number of edges in the graph

       n_nodes : int
              the number of nodes in the graph

       directed : int
              true (non&#8208;zero) if the graph is directed

       strict : int
              true (non&#8208;zero) if the graph is strict

BUILT&#8208;IN FUNCTIONS
       The  following  functions  are built into gvpr. Those functions returning
       references to graph objects return NULL in case of failure.

   Graphs and subgraph
       graph(s : string, t : string) : graph_t
              creates a graph whose name is s and whose type is specified by the
              string t. Ignoring case, the characters U, D, S, N have the inter&#8208;
              pretation undirected, directed, strict,  and  non&#8208;strict,  respec&#8208;
              tively. If t is empty, a directed, non&#8208;strict graph is generated.

       subg(g : graph_t, s : string) : graph_t
              creates a subgraph in graph g with name s. If the subgraph already
              exists, it is returned.

       isSubg(g : graph_t, s : string) : graph_t
              returns the subgraph in graph g with name s, if it exists, or NULL
              otherwise.

       nxtsubg(sg : graph_t) : graph_t
              returns the next subgraph after sg, or NULL.
&#12;       isDirect(g : graph_t) : int
              returns true if and only if g is directed.

       isStrict(g : graph_t) : int
              returns true if and only if g is strict.

              returns the number of nodes in g.

       nEdges(g : graph_t) : int
              returns the number of edges in g.

   Nodes
       node(sg : graph_t, s : string) : node_t
              creates  a  node  in  graph  g  of  name s. If such a node already
              exists, it is returned.

       subnode(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : node_t
              inserts the node n into the subgraph g. Returns the node.

       fstnode(g : graph_t) : node_t
              returns the first node in graph g, or NULL if none exists.

       nxtnode(n : node_t) : node_t
              returns the next node after n in the root graph, or NULL.

       nxtnode_sg(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : node_t
              returns the next node after n in sg, or NULL.

       isNode(sg : graph_t, s : string) : node_t
              looks for a node in (sub)graph sg  of  name  s.  If  such  a  node
              exists, it is returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned.

       isSubnode(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : int
              returns non-zero if node n is in (sub)graph sg, or zero otherwise.

              creates  an  edge  with tail node t, head node h and name s in the
              root graph. If the graph is undirected,  the  distinction  between
              head  and  tail  nodes  is  unimportant.   If such an edge already
              exists, it is returned.

       edge_sg(sg : graph_t, t : node_t, h : node_t, s : string) : edge_t
              creates an edge with tail node t,  head  node  h  and  name  s  in
              (sub)graph sg (and all parent graphs). If the graph is undirected,
              the distinction between head and tail nodes  is  unimportant.   If
              such an edge already exists, it is returned.

       subedge(g : graph_t, e : edge_t) : edge_t
              inserts the edge e into the subgraph g. Returns the edge.

       isEdge(t : node_t, h : node_t, s : string) : edge_t

              looks for an edge with tail node t, head node  h  and  name  s  in
              (sub)graph sg. If the graph is undirected, the distinction between
              head and tail nodes is unimportant.  If such an edge exists, it is
              returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned.

       isSubedge(g : graph_t, e : edge_t) : int
              returns non-zero if edge e is in (sub)graph sg, or zero otherwise.

              returns the first outedge of node n in the root graph.

       fstout_sg(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : edge_t
              returns the first outedge of node n in (sub)graph sg.

       nxtout(e : edge_t) : edge_t

       fstin(n : node_t) : edge_t
              returns the first inedge of node n in the root graph.

       fstin_sg(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : edge_t

       nxtin(e : edge_t) : edge_t
              returns the next inedge after e in the root graph.

       nxtin_sg(sg : graph_t, e : edge_t) : edge_t
              returns the next inedge after e in graph sg.

       fstedge(n : node_t) : edge_t
              returns the first edge of node n in the root graph.

       fstedge_sg(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : edge_t
              returns the first edge of node n in graph sg.

              returns the next edge after e in the graph sg.

   Graph I/O
       write(g : graph_t) : void
              prints g in dot format onto the output stream.

       writeG(g : graph_t, fname : string) : void
              prints g in dot format into the file fname.

       fwriteG(g : graph_t, fd : int) : void
              prints g in dot format onto the open stream denoted by the integer
              fd.

       readG(fname : string) : graph_t
              returns a graph read from the file fname. The graph should  be  in
              dot format. If no graph can be read, NULL is returned.

       freadG(fd : int) : graph_t
              returns the next graph read from the open stream fd.  Returns NULL
              at end of file.

   Graph miscellany
       delete(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : void
              deletes object x from graph g.  If g is NULL,  the  function  uses
              the  root  graph  of x.  If x is a graph or subgraph, it is closed
              unless x is locked.

       isIn(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : int
              returns true if x is in subgraph g.

       clone(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : obj_t
              creates a clone of object x in graph g.  In  particular,  the  new
              object  has  the  same  name/value attributes and structure as the
              original object.  If an object with the  same  key  as  x  already
              exists,  its  attributes are overlaid by those of x and the object
              is returned.  If an edge is cloned, both endpoints are  implicitly
              cloned.   If a graph is cloned, all nodes, edges and subgraphs are
              implicitly cloned.  If x is a graph, g may be NULL, in which  case
              the cloned object will be a new root graph.

       copy(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : obj_t
              creates  a  copy  of object x in graph g, where the new object has
              the same name/value attributes as  the  original  object.   If  an
              object  with  the same key as x already exists, its attributes are
              overlaid by those of x and the object is returned.  Note that this
              is  a  shallow  copy. If x is a graph, none of its nodes, edges or
              subgraphs are copied into the new graph. If x is an edge, the end&#8208;
              points are created if necessary, but they are not cloned.  If x is
              a graph, g may be NULL, in which case the cloned object will be  a
              new root graph.

       copyA(src : obj_t, tgt : obj_t) : int
              copies the attributes of object src to object tgt, overwriting any
              attribute values tgt may initially have.

       induce(g : graph_t) : void
              extends g to its  node&#8208;induced  subgraph  extension  in  its  root
              graph.

       hasAttr(src : obj_t, name : string) : int
              returns  non-zero  if  object  src  has an attribute whose name is
              name. It returns 0 otherwise.

       isAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) : int
              returns non-zero if an attribute name has been defined  in  g  for
              objects  of  the  given  kind.  For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind
              should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;, respectively.  It  returns  0  other&#8208;
              wise.

       aget(src : obj_t, name : string) : string
              returns  the value of attribute name in object src. This is useful
              for those cases when name conflicts with one of the keywords  such
              as  &quot;head&quot;  or  &quot;root&quot;.  If the attribute has not been declared in
              the graph, the function will initialize it with a default value of
              &quot;&quot;.  To  avoid this, one should use the hasAttr or isAttr function
              to check that the attribute exists.

       aset(src : obj_t, name : string, value : string) : int
              sets the value of attribute name in object src to value.   Returns
              0 on success, non&#8208;zero on failure. See aget above.

       getDflt(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) : string
              returns the default value of attribute name in objects in g of the
              given kind. For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;,
              and  &quot;G&quot;, respectively.  If the attribute has not been declared in
              the graph, the function will initialize it with a default value of
              &quot;&quot;.  To  avoid  this,  one should use the isAttr function to check
              that the attribute exists.

       setDflt(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string, value : string) : int
              sets the default value of attribute name to value in objects in  g
              of  the  given  kind. For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind should be
              &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;, respectively.  Returns 0 on  success,  non&#8208;zero
              on failure. See getDflt above.

       fstAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string) : string
              returns  the  name  of  the first attribute of objects in g of the
              given kind. For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;,
              and  &quot;G&quot;, respectively.  If there are no attributes, the string &quot;&quot;
              is returned.

       nxtAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) : string
              returns the name of the next attribute of  objects  in  g  of  the
              given  kind  after  the attribute name.  The argument name must be
              the name of an existing attribute; it will typically be the return
              value  of  an  previous  call  to  fstAttr or nxtAttr.  For nodes,
              edges, and graphs, kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;, respectively.
              If there are no attributes left, the string &quot;&quot; is returned.

       compOf(g : graph_t, n : node_t) : graph_t
              returns  the connected component of the graph g containing node n,
              as a subgraph of g. The subgraph only contains the nodes. One  can
              use  induce  to add the edges. The function fails and returns NULL
              if n is not in g. Connectivity is based on  the  underlying  undi&#8208;
              rected graph of g.

       kindOf(obj : obj_t) : string
              returns  an  indication  of what kind of graph object is the argu&#8208;
              ment.  For nodes, edges, and graphs, it  returns  should  be  &quot;N&quot;,
              &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;, respectively.

       lock(g : graph_t, v : int) : int
              implements graph locking on root graphs. If the integer v is posi&#8208;
              tive, the graph is set so that future  calls  to  delete  have  no
              immediate  effect.   If v is zero, the graph is unlocked. If there
              has been a call to delete the graph while it was locked, the graph
              is  closed.  If v is negative, nothing is done.  In all cases, the
              previous lock value is returned.

   Strings
       sprintf(fmt : string, ...) : string
              returns the string resulting from formatting  the  values  of  the
              expressions  occurring after fmt according to the printf(3) format
              fmt

       gsub(str : string, pat : string) : string

       gsub(str : string, pat : string, repl : string) : string
              returns str with all substrings matching pat deleted  or  replaced
              by repl, respectively.

       sub(str : string, pat : string) : string

       sub(str : string, pat : string, repl : string) : string
              returns  str  with  the leftmost substring matching pat deleted or
              replaced by repl, respectively. The characters &apos;^&apos; and &apos;$&apos; may  be
              used  at the beginning and end, respectively, of pat to anchor the
              pattern to the beginning or end of str.

       substr(str : string, idx : int) : string

       substr(str : string, idx : int, len : int) : string
              returns the substring of str starting at position idx to  the  end
              of  the string or of length len, respectively.  Indexing starts at
              0. If idx is negative or idx is greater than the length of str,  a
              fatal error occurs. Similarly, in the second case, if len is nega&#8208;
              tive or idx + len is greater than the length of str, a fatal error
              occurs.

       length(s : string) : int
              returns the length of the string s.

       index(s : string, t : string) : int

       rindex(s : string, t : string) : int
              returns  the index of the character in string s where the leftmost
              (rightmost) copy of string t can be found, or -1 if  t  is  not  a
              substring of s.

       match(s : string, p : string) : int
              returns  the index of the character in string s where the leftmost
              match of pattern p can be found,  or  -1  if  no  substring  of  s
              matches p.

       toupper(s : string) : string
              returns a version of s with the alphabetic characters converted to
              upper-case.

       tolower(s : string) : string
              returns a version of s with the alphabetic characters converted to
              lower-case.

       canon(s : string) : string
              returns  a version of s appropriate to be used as an identifier in
              a dot file.

       xOf(s : string) : string
              returns the string &quot;x&quot; if s has the form &quot;x,y&quot;, where both x and y
              are numeric.

       yOf(s : string) : string
              returns the string &quot;y&quot; if s has the form &quot;x,y&quot;, where both x and y
              are numeric.

       llOf(s : string) : string
              returns the string &quot;llx,lly&quot; if s has the form  &quot;llx,lly,urx,ury&quot;,
              where all of llx, lly, urx, and ury are numeric.

       urOf(s)
              urOf(s  :  string)  : string returns the string &quot;urx,ury&quot; if s has
              the form &quot;llx,lly,urx,ury&quot;, where all of llx, lly,  urx,  and  ury
              are numeric.

       sscanf(s : string, fmt : string, ...) : int
              scans  the  string s, extracting values according to the sscanf(3)
              format fmt.  The values are stored in the addresses following fmt,
              addresses having the form &amp;v, where v is some declared variable of
              the correct  type.   Returns  the  number  of  items  successfully
              scanned.

       split(s : string, arr : array, seps : string) : int

       split(s : string, arr : array) : int

       tokens(s : string, arr : array, seps : string) : int

       tokens(s : string, arr : array) : int
              The  split  function  breaks  the  string s into fields, while the
              tokens function breaks the string into tokens.  A  field  consists
              of  all  non-separator characters between two separator characters
              or the beginning or end of the string. Thus, a field  may  be  the
              empty  string.  A token is a maximal, non-empty substring not con&#8208;
              taining a separator character.  The separator characters are those
              given  in the seps argument.  If seps is not provided, the default
              value is &quot; \t\n&quot;.  The functions return the number  of  fields  or
              tokens.

              The  fields and tokens are stored in the argument array. The array
              must be string-valued and, if an index type is specified, it  must
              be  int. The entries are indexed by consecutive integers, starting
              at 0. Any values already stored in the array will be either  over&#8208;
              written, or still be present after the function returns.

   I/O
       print(...) : void
              print( expr, ... ) prints a string representation of each argument
              in turn onto stdout, followed by a newline.

       printf(fmt : string, ...) : int

       printf(fd : int, fmt : string, ...) : int
              prints the string resulting from  formatting  the  values  of  the
              expressions  following  fmt according to the printf(3) format fmt.
              Returns 0 on success.  By default, it prints on  stdout.   If  the
              optional integer fd is given, output is written on the open stream
              associated with fd.

       scanf(fmt : string, ...) : int

       scanf(fd : int, fmt : string, ...) : int
              scans in values from an input stream  according  to  the  scanf(3)
              format fmt.  The values are stored in the addresses following fmt,
              addresses having the form &amp;v, where v is some declared variable of
              the  correct  type.   By  default,  it  reads  from stdin.  If the
              optional integer fd is given, input is read from the  open  stream
              associated  with  fd.   Returns  the  number of items successfully
              scanned.

       openF(s : string, t : string) : int
              opens the file s as an I/O stream. The string argument t specifies
              how  the  file  is opened. The arguments are the same as for the C
              function fopen(3).  It returns an integer denoting the stream,  or
              -1 on error.

              As  usual,  streams  0, 1 and 2 are already open as stdin, stdout,
              and stderr, respectively. Since gvpr may use  stdin  to  read  the
              input graphs, the user should avoid using this stream.

       closeF(fd : int) : int
              closes  the  open stream denoted by the integer fd.  Streams  0, 1
              and 2 cannot be closed.  Returns 0 on success.

       readL(fd : int) : string
              returns the next line read from the input stream  fd.  It  returns
              the  empty string &quot;&quot; on end of file. Note that the newline charac&#8208;
              ter is left in the returned string.

   Math
       exp(d : double) : double
              returns e to the dth power.

       log(d : double) : double
              returns the natural log of d.

       sqrt(d : double) : double
              returns the square root of the double d.

       pow(d : double, x : double) : double
              returns d raised to the xth power.

       cos(d : double) : double
              returns the cosine of d.

       sin(d : double) : double
              returns the sine of d.

       atan2(y : double, x : double) : double
              returns the arctangent of y/x in the range -pi to pi.

       MIN(y : double, x : double) : double
              returns the minimum of y and x.

       MAX(y : double, x : double) : double
              returns the maximum of y and x.

   Associative Arrays
       # arr : int
              returns the number of elements in the array arr.

       idx in arr : int
              returns 1 if a value has been set for index idx in the array  arr.
              It returns 0 otherwise.

       unset(v : array, IidxP) : int
              removes the item indexed by idx. It returns 1 if the item existed,
              0 otherwise.

       unset(v : array) : void
              re-initializes the array.
&#12;   Miscellaneous
       exit(v : int) : void
              causes gvpr to exit with the exit code v.

       system(cmd : string) : int
              provides the standard C function system(3).  It  executes  cmd  if
              the  user&apos;s  shell environment, and returns the exit status of the
              shell.

       rand() : double
              returns a pseudo&#8208;random double between 0 and 1.

       srand() : int

       srand(v : int) : int
              sets a seed for the random number generator. The optional argument
              gives  the  seed;  if it is omitted, the current time is used. The
              previous seed value is returned. srand should be called before any
              calls to rand.

       colorx(color : string, fmt : string) : string
              translates  a color from one format to another. The color argument
              should be a color in one of the recognized string representations.
              The  fmt  value  should be one of &quot;RGB&quot;, &quot;RGBA&quot;, &quot;HSV&quot;, &quot;HSVA&quot;, or
              &quot;CMYK&quot;.  An empty string is returned on error.

BUILT&#8208;IN VARIABLES
       gvpr provides certain special, built&#8208;in variables, whose values  are  set
       automatically by gvpr depending on the context. Except as noted, the user
       cannot modify their values.

       $ : obj_t
              denotes the current object (node, edge, graph)  depending  on  the
              context.  It is not available in BEGIN or END clauses.

       $F : string
              is the name of the current input file.

       $G : graph_t
              denotes  the current graph being processed. It is not available in
              BEGIN or END clauses.

       $O : graph_t
              denotes the output graph. Before graph traversal, it  is  initial&#8208;
              ized  to  the target graph. After traversal and any END_G actions,
              if it refers to a non&#8208;empty graph, that graph is printed onto  the
              output  stream.   It is only valid in N, E and END_G clauses.  The
              output graph may be set by the user.

       $T : graph_t
              denotes the current target graph. It is a subgraph of  $G  and  is
              available only in N, E and END_G clauses.

       $tgtname : string
              denotes  the  name  of the target graph.  By default, it is set to
              &quot;gvpr_result&quot;.  If used multiple times  during  the  execution  of
              gvpr,  the  name  will be appended with an integer.  This variable
              may be set by the user.

       $tvroot : node_t
              indicates the starting node for a (directed or undirected)  depth&#8208;
              first  traversal  of  the  graph (cf. $tvtype below).  The default
              value is NULL for each input graph.

       $tvedge : edge_t
              For BFS and DFS traversals, this is set to the edge used to arrive
              at  the  current node or edge. At the beginning of a traversal, or
              for other traversal types, the value is NULL.

       $tvtype : tvtype_t
              indicates how gvpr traverses a graph. It can only take one of  the
              constant values with the previx &quot;TV_&quot; described below.  TV_flat is
              the default.

              In the underlying graph library  cgraph(3),  edges  in  undirected
              graphs  are given an arbitrary direction. This is used for traver&#8208;
              sals, such as TV_fwd, requiring directed edges.

       ARGC : int
              denotes the number of arguments specified by the -a args  command&#8208;
              line argument.

       ARGV : string array
              denotes  the  array of arguments specified by the -a args command&#8208;
              line argument. The ith argument is given by ARGV[i].

BUILT&#8208;IN CONSTANTS
       There are several symbolic constants defined by gvpr.

       NULL : obj_t
              a null object reference, equivalent to 0.

       TV_flat : tvtype_t
              a simple, flat traversal, with graph objects visited in  seemingly
              arbitrary order.

       TV_ne : tvtype_t
              a  traversal  which first visits all of the nodes, then all of the
              edges.

       TV_en : tvtype_t
              a traversal which first visits all of the edges, then all  of  the
              nodes.

       TV_dfs : tvtype_t
       TV_postdfs : tvtype_t
       TV_prepostdfs : tvtype_t
              a  traversal of the graph using a depth&#8208;first search on the under&#8208;
              lying undirected graph.  To do the traversal, gvpr will check  the
              value  of  $tvroot.  If this has the same value that it had previ&#8208;
              ously (at the start, the previous value is initialized to  NULL.),
              gvpr  will  simply  look  for some unvisited node and traverse its
              connected component. On the other hand, if  $tvroot  has  changed,
              its  connected  component will be toured, assuming it has not been
              previously visited or, if $tvroot  is  NULL,  the  traversal  will
              stop. Note that using TV_dfs and $tvroot, it is possible to create
              an infinite loop.

              By default, the traversal is done in pre-order. That is, a node is
              visited  before all of its unvisited edges. For TV_postdfs, all of
              a node&apos;s unvisited edges are visited before the node. For  TV_pre&#8208;
              postdfs,  a  node  is  visited  twice, before and after all of its
              unvisited edges.

       TV_fwd : tvtype_t
       TV_postfwd : tvtype_t
       TV_prepostfwd : tvtype_t
              A traversal of the graph using a depth&#8208;first search on  the  graph
              following  only forward arcs.  The choice of roots for the traver&#8208;
              sal is the same as described  for  TV_dfs  above.   The  different
              order  of  visitation  specified by TV_fwd, TV_postfwd and TV_pre&#8208;
              postfwd are the same as those specified by the  analogous  traver&#8208;
              sals TV_dfs, TV_postdfs and TV_prepostdfs.

       TV_rev : tvtype_t
       TV_postrev : tvtype_t
       TV_prepostrev : tvtype_t
              A  traversal  of the graph using a depth&#8208;first search on the graph
              following only reverse arcs.  The choice of roots for the  traver&#8208;
              sal  is  the  same  as  described for TV_dfs above.  The different
              order of visitation specified by TV_rev,  TV_postrev  and  TV_pre&#8208;
              postrev  are  the same as those specified by the analogous traver&#8208;
              sals TV_dfs, TV_postdfs and TV_prepostdfs.

       TV_bfs : tvtype_t
              A traversal of the graph using a bread&#8208;first search on  the  graph
              ignoring  edge  directions.  See  the item on TV_dfs above for the
              role of $tvroot.

EXAMPLES
              gvpr -i &apos;N[color==&quot;blue&quot;]&apos; file.dot

       Generate the node&#8208;induced subgraph of all nodes with color blue.
&#12;              gvpr -c &apos;N[color==&quot;blue&quot;]{color = &quot;red&quot;}&apos; file.dot

       Make all blue nodes red.

              BEGIN { int n, e; int tot_n = 0; int tot_e = 0; }
              BEG_G {
                n = nNodes($G);
                e = nEdges($G);
                printf (&quot;%d nodes %d edges %s0, n, e, $G.name);
                tot_n += n;
                tot_e += e;
              }
              END { printf (&quot;%d nodes %d edges total0, tot_n, tot_e) }

       Version of the program gc.

              gvpr -c &quot;&quot;

       Equivalent to nop.

              BEG_G { graph_t g = graph (&quot;merge&quot;, &quot;S&quot;); }
              E {
                node_t h = clone(g,$.head);
                node_t t = clone(g,$.tail);
                edge_t e = edge(t,h,&quot;&quot;);
                e.weight = e.weight + 1;
              }
              END_G { $O = g; }

       Produces a strict version of the input graph, where the weight  attribute
       of  an edge indicates how many edges from the input graph the edge repre&#8208;
       sents.

              BEGIN {node_t n; int deg[]}
              E{deg[head]++; deg[tail]++; }
              END_G {
                for (deg[n]) {
                  printf (&quot;deg[%s] = %d0, n.name, deg[n]);
                }
              }

       Computes the degrees of nodes with edges.

ENVIRONMENT
       GPRPATH
              Colon&#8208;separated list of directories to be  searched  to  find  the
              file specified by the -f option.

BUGS AND WARNINGS
       When  the  program  is  given as a command line argument, the usual shell
       interpretation takes place, which may affect some of the special names in
       gvpr. To avoid this, it is best to wrap the program in single quotes.

       As  of  24  April  2008,  gvpr  switched to using a new, underlying graph
       library, which uses the simpler model that there is only one  copy  of  a
       node,  not one copy for each subgraph logically containing it. This means
       that iterators such as InxtnodeP cannot traverse a subgraph using just  a
       node argument. For this reason, subgraph traversal requires new functions
       ending in &quot;_sg&quot;, which also take a subgraph argument. The versions  with&#8208;
       out that suffix will always traverse the root graph.

       There  is  a  single global scope, except for formal function parameters,
       and even these can interfere with the type system. Also,  the  extent  of
       all  variables is the entire life of the program.  It might be preferable
       for scope to reflect the natural nesting of the clauses, or for the  pro&#8208;
       gram to at least reset locally declared variables.  For now, it is advis&#8208;
       able to use distinct names for all variables.

       If a function ends with a complex statement, such  as  an  IF  statement,
       with  each  branch  doing  a  return,  type checking may fail.  Functions
       should use a return at the end.

       The expr library does not support string values of (char*)0.  This  means
       we can&apos;t distinguish between &quot;&quot; and (char*)0 edge keys.  For the purposes
       of looking up and creating edges, we translate &quot;&quot; to be  (char*)0,  since
       this latter value is necessary in order to look up any edge with a match&#8208;
       ing head and tail.

       Related to this, strings converted to integers act  like  char  pointers,
       getting  the value 0 or 1 depending on whether the string consists solely
       of zeroes or not. Thus, the ((int)&quot;2&quot;) evaluates to 1.

       The language inherits the usual C problems such  as  dangling  references
       and the confusion between &apos;=&apos; and &apos;==&apos;.
