GWORLDCLOCK(1)                                                    GWORLDCLOCK(1)



NAME
       gworldclock - Displays time and date in specified time zones.

SYNOPSIS
       gworldclock [ -f FILE ]


DESCRIPTION
       gworldclock  displays  the  time and date of specified time zones using a
       GTK+ interface. It also allows the zones to be  &quot;rendezvoused&quot;  or  &quot;syn&#8208;
       chronised&quot; to a time other than the current time.

       The  time  zones may be chosen from the list given in the GUI user inter&#8208;
       face.   The  zones   available   are   generated   from   the   data   in
       /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.   The  chosen  set  of  zones  is stored in
       ${HOME}/.tzlist by default, but an alternate file may be specified at the
       command line via -f. Alternatively this file may be created by hand in TZ
       format. The zone list is kept in  a  format  consistent  with  the  shell
       script  tzwatch,  currently found in twclock.  The format consists of one
       TZ string per  line,  optionally  followed  by  a  human-friendly  string
       enclosed in inverted commas (&quot;), providing a name for the zone.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE
              Read zone list from FILE instead of ${HOME}/.tzlist.

SEE ALSO
       tzwatch (1)
