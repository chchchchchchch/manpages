H2PH(1)                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                 H2PH(1)



NAME
       h2ph - convert .h C header files to .ph Perl header files

SYNOPSIS
       h2ph [-d destination directory] [-r | -a] [-l] [headerfiles]

DESCRIPTION
       h2ph converts any C header files specified to the corresponding Perl
       header file format.  It is most easily run while in /usr/include:

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .

       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at Perl&apos;s
       architecture dependent library directory.  You can specify a different
       hierarchy with a -d switch.

       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to standard output.

OPTIONS
       -d destination_dir
           Put the resulting .ph files beneath destination_dir, instead of
           beneath the default Perl library location
           ($Config{&apos;installsitearch&apos;}).

       -r  Run recursively; if any of headerfiles are directories, then run h2ph
           on all files in those directories (and their subdirectories, etc.).
           -r and -a are mutually exclusive.

       -a  Run automagically; convert headerfiles, as well as any .h files which
           they include.  This option will search for .h files in all
           directories which your C compiler ordinarily uses.  -a and -r are
           mutually exclusive.

       -l  Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination directory.  If
           -l is not specified, then links are skipped over.

       -h  Put ``hints&apos;&apos; in the .ph files which will help in locating problems
           with h2ph.  In those cases when you require a .ph file containing
           syntax errors, instead of the cryptic

                   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn

           you will see the slightly more helpful

                   [ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn

           However, the .ph files almost double in size when built using -h.

       -D  Include the code from the .h file as a comment in the .ph file.  This
           is primarily used for debugging h2ph.

       -Q  ``Quiet&apos;&apos; mode; don&apos;t print out the names of the files being
           converted.
&#12;ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.

FILES
        /usr/include/*.h
        /usr/include/sys/*.h

       etc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The usual warnings if it can&apos;t read or write the files involved.

BUGS
       Doesn&apos;t construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It doesn&apos;t handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to isolate
       definitions inside evals so that you can get at the definitions that it
       can translate.

       It&apos;s only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to dicker with the
       files produced.

       You have to run this program by hand; it&apos;s not run as part of the Perl
       installation.

       Doesn&apos;t handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a la:

           enum {
               FIRST_VALUE,
               SECOND_VALUE,
           #ifdef ABC
               THIRD_VALUE
           #endif
           };

       Doesn&apos;t necessarily locate all of your C compiler&apos;s internally-defined
       symbols.
