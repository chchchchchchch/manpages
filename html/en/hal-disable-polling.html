HAL-DISABLE-POLLING(1)                                    HAL-DISABLE-POLLING(1)



NAME
       hal-disable-polling - disable polling on drives with removable media

SYNOPSIS
       hal-disable-polling [options]


DESCRIPTION
       hal-disable-polling  can be used to to disable and enable media detection
       on drives with removable storage. For more information about both the big
       picture  and  specific HAL properties, refer to the HAL spec which can be
       found in /usr/share/doc/hal-doc/spec/hal-spec.html depending on the  dis&#8208;
       tribution.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --udi  The UDI (Unique Device Identifier) of the device object.

       --device
              The device file of the drive.

       --enable-polling
              Enable polling instead of disabling it.

       --help Print out usage.

       --version
              Print the version.


NOTES
       This program requires super user privileges.


RETURN VALUE
       If  the  requested  operation was successful, this program will exit with
       exit code 0.


HISTORY
       Polling a storage drive is a necessary  evil  to  detect  when  the  user
       inserts  or  removes media. Human computer interaction studies have shown
       that a broad class of users expect their system to  react  within  a  few
       seconds of this. Thus, the hald daemon polls through the hald-addon-stor&#8208;
       age addon (one instance for each drive with removable media).

       The purpose of the hald-addon-storage addon is simply to open the special
       device file at a regular interval (either every 2 or every 16 seconds) to
       check for new media. This program tries to open the device file using the
       O_EXCL option which means that programs like cdrecord(1) that uses O_EXCL
       automatically prevents the hald-addon-storage for interferring by  conti&#8208;
       nously opening the device file. In addition, if the drive is locked using
       HAL (see hal-lock(1)) the addon also stops polling.

       Unfortunately, polling a storage drive can have adverse side  effects  if
       the  hardware  and/or  device  driver for the hardware is malfunctioning.
       Additionally, the operating  system  kernel  itself  may  offer  multiple
       interfaces  for  the  same  device  (e.g. /dev/sg0 and /dev/scd0) so even
       O_EXCL won&apos;t work. Also, polling a drive may decrease throughput in  cer&#8208;
       tain  (odd  and/or broken) configurations; for example, if two IDE drives
       shares the same host (master/slave), bus traffic and contention caused by
       polling  e.g. the optical drive (slave) can reduce throughput to the hard
       disk (master) and/or interfere with CD burning on another  optical  drive
       (master).  Finally,  polling  a drive incurs an overhead both in the host
       system (processes get woken up often, preventing the CPU  to  stay  in  a
       deep power saving states) and it may prevent the actual drive from reach&#8208;
       ing deep power states as well. As a result, more power  is  consumed  and
       this affects battery life for laptops.

       Despite  the existence of support for asynchronous media change notifica&#8208;
       tion in recent MMC (Multi-Media Commands)  specifications,  virtually  no
       optical  drives  are  compliant with the specification. Fortunately newer
       SATA ATAPI hardware seems to support Asynchronous Notification  (AN)  and
       at  this  time  of writing (March 2007) work is underway to make both the
       Linux operating system kernel and HAL take advantage of this.

       It is the position of the HAL team that polling should be avoided at  all
       costs as long as it doesn&apos;t heavily impact the user experience in a nega&#8208;
       tive way. This tool is provided as a stop-gap measure to use if a  system
       is  rendered  useless due to bugs in drivers and/or hardware that is pro&#8208;
       voked by HAL polling the drive. If such a bug is encountered it should be
       reported  (see  the BUGS section below) so it can be fixed - historically
       hald have triggered a number of bugs in Linux storage drivers and related
       subsystems (such as USB) that have later been fixed.


BUGS
       Please  send  bug  reports  to either the distribution or the HAL mailing
       list, see  http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal  on  how  to
       subscribe.
