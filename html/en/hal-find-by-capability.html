DESCRIPTION
       hal-get-capability  finds  device  object  in  the HAL device database by
       looking at device capabilities. For more information about both  the  big
       picture  and  specific HAL properties, refer to the HAL spec which can be
       found in /usr/share/doc/hal-doc/spec/hal-spec.html depending on the  dis&#8208;
       tribution.

       --capability
              The name of the capability.

       --help Print out usage.

       --version
              Print the version.


RETURN VALUE
       If  devices  matching  the  given  capability  are found each UDI (Unique
       Device Identifier) is printed on stdout and the program exits  with  exit
       code  0.  If  no devices are found or an error occured, the program exits
       with a non-zero exit code.
