HAL-LOCK(1)                                                          HAL-LOCK(1)



NAME
       hal-lock - lock an interface

SYNOPSIS
       hal-lock [options]


DESCRIPTION
       hal-lock  can  be used to acquire a lock on a given interface either on a
       given device or globally. For more information about both the big picture
       and  the semantics of HAL locks, refer to the HAL spec which can be found
       in /usr/share/doc/hal-doc/spec/hal-spec.html depending on  the  distribu&#8208;
       tion.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --interface
              The name of the interface to lock.

       --run  Program to run if the lock was acquired.

       --udi  The  UDI  (Unique Device Identifier) of the device object. If this
              is ommitted, the global lock will be tried.

       --exclusive
              Whether the lock can be held by others.

       --exit-with-lock
              Kill the program if the acquired lock is  lost.  This  only  makes
              sense  if  you  pass  a  specific  UDI due to the semantics of HAL
              locks.

       --exit-with-dev
              Kill the program if the device is removed. This only  makes  sense
              if you pass a specific UDI due to the semantics of HAL locks.

       --help Print out usage.

       --version
              Print the version.


RETURN VALUE
       This program will attempt to grab a lock on a given interface.  Unless, a
       specific UDI is given, the global lock will be tried.  If  the  lock  was
       succesfully  acquired  the  program specified by the option --run will be
       run and upon termination this program will exit with exit code 0. If  the
       lock wasn&apos;t acquired or an error occured while taking the lock, this pro&#8208;
       gram will exit with a non-zero exit code and the given program  will  not
       be run.



NOTES
       This  program  is only useful for launching software that doesn&apos;t use HAL
       at all (since such software launched using hal-lock would be  locked  out
       itself);  for  example  a partition table editor part-foo may use wrapper
       script like this

       hal-lock --interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage --exclusive --run
       /path/to/part-foo-program


BUGS
       Please  send  bug  reports  to either the distribution or the HAL mailing
       list, see  http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal  on  how  to
       subscribe.
