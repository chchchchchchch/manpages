              or x for hexadecimal values.

       --uint64
              Set value property of the property to a 64-bit  unsigned  integer.
              The  value  passed  is  assumed to be decimal unless it&apos;s prefixed

RETURN VALUE
       If  setting  the property succeeds, this program will exit with exit code
       0. On errors a non-zero the program will exit with a non-zero exit  code.
       Note  that setting properties on the HAL device database usually requires
       super user privileges.
