HALD(8)                                                                  HALD(8)



NAME
       hald - HAL daemon

SYNOPSIS
       hald [options]


DESCRIPTION
       hald  is  a  daemon that maintains a database of the devices connected to
       the system system in real-time. The daemon connects to the  D-Bus  system
       message bus to provide an API that applications can use to discover, mon&#8208;
       itor and invoke operations on devices. For more  information  about  both
       the big picture and specific API details, refer to the HAL spec which can
       be found in /usr/share/doc/hal-doc/spec/hal-spec.html  depending  on  the
       distribution.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --daemon=yes|no
              Specify whether to run in the foreground or the background.

       --verbose=yes|no
              Enable verbose debug output.

       --use-syslog
              Enable  logging  of  debug output to the syslog instead of stderr.
              Use this option only together with --verbose.

       --help Print out usage.

       --version
              Print the version of the daemon and exit.


BUGS AND DEBUGGING
       Please send bug reports to either the distribution  or  the  HAL  mailing
       list,  see  http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal  on  how to
       subscribe.

       First, to obtain useful debug traces you  will  need  to  have  debuginfo
       packages installed. On a Fedora system this is in the hal-debuginfo pack&#8208;
       age and can be installed via the yum update program.

       Second, shut down the existing hald daemon instance; on a  Fedora  system
       this is achieved by

       /etc/init.d/haldaemon stop

       After having shut down the daemon, you might want to run

       pkill hald

       to  ensure  that all the helper processe of hald are killed too. To start
       the HAL daemon, use

       /usr/sbin/hald --daemon=no --verbose=yes

       If the daemon crashes, you can start it under a debugger via

       gdb /usr/sbin/hald

       and then typing

       run --daemon=no --verbose=yes

       at the (gdb) prompt. To capture a back trace,  use  the  bt  command  and
       attach this to the bug report.

       Please  also  attach the output of lshal(1) in the bug report if possible
       (it&apos;s not possible if the hald daemon crashed). If the nature of the  bug
       has  to  do with hotplugging, attach two outputs of lshal(1) - one before
       the device hotplug event and one after.
