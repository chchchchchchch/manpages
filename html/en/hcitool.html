NAME
       hcitool - configure Bluetooth connections

SYNOPSIS
       hcitool [-h]
       hcitool [-i &lt;hciX&gt;] [command [command parameters]]


DESCRIPTION
       hcitool  is used to configure Bluetooth connections and send some special
       command to Bluetooth devices. If no command is given, or if the option -h
       is used, hcitool prints some usage information and exits.

OPTIONS
       -h     Gives a list of possible commands

       -i &lt;hciX&gt;
              The  command is applied to device hciX , which must be the name of
              an installed Bluetooth device. If not specified, the command  will
              be sent to the first available Bluetooth device.

COMMANDS
       dev    Display local devices

       inq    Inquire  remote  devices.  For  each  discovered device, Bluetooth
              device address, clock offset and class are printed.

       scan   Inquire remote devices. For each discovered  device,  device  name
              are printed.

       name &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Print device name of remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       info &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Print device name, version and supported features of remote device
              with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       spinq  Start periodic inquiry process. No inquiry results are printed.

       epinq  Exit periodic inquiry process.

       cmd &lt;ogf&gt; &lt;ocf&gt; [parameters]
              Submit an arbitrary HCI command to local  device.   ogf,  ocf  and
              parameters are hexadecimal bytes.

       con    Display active baseband connections

       cc [--role=m|s] [--pkt-type=&lt;ptype&gt;] &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Create baseband connection to remote device with Bluetooth address
              bdaddr.  Option --pkt-type specifies  a  list  of  allowed  packet
              types.   &lt;ptype&gt;  is a comma-separated list of packet types, where
              the possible packet types are DM1, DM3, DM5, DH1, DH3,  DH5,  HV1,
              HV2, HV3.  Default is to allow all packet types. Option --role can
              have value m (do not allow role switch, stay master) or  s  (allow
              role  switch,  become  slave  if  the peer asks to become master).
              Default is m.

       dc &lt;bdaddr&gt; [reason]
              Delete baseband  connection  from  remote  device  with  Bluetooth
              address  bdaddr.  The reason can be one of the Bluetooth HCI error
              codes. Default is 19 for user ended connections. The value must be
              given in decimal.

       sr &lt;bdaddr&gt; &lt;role&gt;
              Switch  role for the baseband connection from the remote device to
              master or slave.

       cpt &lt;bdaddr&gt; &lt;packet types&gt;
              Change packet types for baseband connection to device  with  Blue&#8208;
              tooth  address  bdaddr.  packet types is a comma-separated list of
              packet types, where the possible packet types are DM1,  DM3,  DM5,
              DH1, DH3, DH5, HV1, HV2, HV3.

       rssi &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Display received signal strength information for the connection to
              the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       lq &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Display link quality for the connection to the device  with  Blue&#8208;
              tooth address bdaddr.

       tpl &lt;bdaddr&gt; [type]
              Display transmit power level for the connection to the device with
              Bluetooth address bdaddr.  The type  can  be  0  for  the  current
              transmit  power  level  (which  is  default)  or 1 for the maximum
              transmit power level.

       afh &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Display AFH channel map for the  connection  to  the  device  with
              Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       lp &lt;bdaddr&gt; [value]
              With no value, displays link policy settings for the connection to
              the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  If value is given, sets
              the  link  policy settings for that connection to value.  Possible
              values are RSWITCH, HOLD, SNIFF and PARK.

       lst &lt;bdaddr&gt; [value]
              With no value, displays link supervision timeout for  the  connec&#8208;
              tion  to  the  device  with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  If value is
              given, sets the link supervision timeout for  that  connection  to
              value slots, or to infinite if value is 0.

       auth &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Request  authentication  for  the  device  with  Bluetooth address
              bdaddr.

       enc &lt;bdaddr&gt; [encrypt enable]
              Enable or disable the encryption for  the  device  with  Bluetooth
              address bdaddr.

       key &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Change  the  connection  link  key  for  the device with Bluetooth
              address bdaddr.

       clkoff &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              Read the clock  offset  for  the  device  with  Bluetooth  address
              bdaddr.

       clock [bdaddr] [which clock]
              Read  the clock for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  The
              clock can be 0 for the local clock or  1  for  the  piconet  clock
              (which is default).
