NAME
       hg - Mercurial source code management system

SYNOPSIS
       hg command [option]... [argument]...

DESCRIPTION
       The hg command provides a command line interface to the Mercurial system.

COMMAND ELEMENTS
       files...
              indicates  one  or  more  filename or relative path filenames; see
              File Name Patterns for information on pattern matching

       path   indicates a path on the local machine

       revision
              indicates a changeset which can be specified as a changeset  revi&#8208;
              sion  number,  a  tag, or a unique substring of the changeset hash
              value

       repository path
              either the pathname of a local repository or the URI of  a  remote
              repository.

OPTIONS
       -R, --repository
              repository root directory or name of overlay bundle file

       --cwd  change working directory

       -y, --noninteractive
              do not prompt, automatically pick the first choice for all prompts

       -q, --quiet
              suppress output

       -v, --verbose
              enable additional output

       --config
              set/override config option (use &apos;section.name=value&apos;)

       --debug
              enable debugging output

       --debugger
              start debugger

       --encoding
              set the charset encoding (default: ascii)

       --encodingmode
              set the charset encoding mode (default: strict)

              always print a traceback on exception

       --time time how long the command takes

       --profile
              print command execution profile
&#12;       --version
              output version information and exit

       -h, --help
              display help and exit

COMMANDS
   add
       hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.

       The  files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To undo an
       add before that, see hg forget.

       If no names are given, add all files to the repository.

       An example showing how new (unknown) files are added automatically by  hg
       add:

       $ ls
       foo.c
       $ hg status
       ? foo.c
       $ hg add
       adding foo.c
       $ hg status
       A foo.c

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

   addremove
       hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.

       New  files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in .hgignore. As
       with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.

       Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files. With a  parameter
       greater  than  0,  this compares every removed file with every added file
       and records those similar enough as renames. This option takes a percent&#8208;
       age between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identical) as its parame&#8208;
       ter. Detecting renamed files this way can be expensive. After using  this
       option,  hg status -C can be used to check which files were identified as
       moved or renamed.  If this option is not specified, only renames of iden&#8208;
       tical files are detected.

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       -s, --similarity
              guess renamed files by similarity (0&lt;=s&lt;=100)
&#12;       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

   annotate
       hg annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...

       List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line

       This  command  is  useful  for  discovering when a change was made and by
       whom.

       Without the -a/--text option, annotate will  avoid  processing  files  it
       detects  as  binary.  With  -a,  annotate  will annotate the file anyway,
       although the results will probably be neither useful nor desirable.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              annotate the specified revision

       --follow
              follow copies/renames and list the filename (DEPRECATED)

       --no-follow
              don&apos;t follow copies and renames

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -u, --user
              list the author (long with -v)

       -f, --file
              list the filename

       -d, --date
              list the date (short with -q)

       -n, --number
              list the revision number (default)

       -c, --changeset
              list the changeset

       -l, --line-number
              show line number at the first appearance

       -w, --ignore-all-space
              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns
&#12;              aliases: blame

   archive
       hg archive [OPTION]... DEST

       By default, the revision used is the parent of the working directory; use
       -r/--rev to specify a different revision.

       The  archive  type  is automatically detected based on file extension (or
       override using -t/--type).

       Examples:

       &#183; create a zip file containing the 1.0 release:

         hg archive -r 1.0 project-1.0.zip

       &#183; create a tarball excluding .hg files:

         hg archive project.tar.gz -X &quot;.hg*&quot;

       Valid types are:

       files

              a directory full of files (default)

       tar

              tar archive, uncompressed

       tbz2

              tar archive, compressed using bzip2

       tgz

              tar archive, compressed using gzip

       uzip

              zip archive, uncompressed

       zip

              zip archive, compressed using deflate

       The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given  using  a
       format string; see hg help export for details.

       Each  member  added  to an archive file has a directory prefix prepended.
       Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string for the prefix. The default is
       the basename of the archive, with suffixes removed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --no-decode
              do not pass files through decoders

       -p, --prefix
              directory prefix for files in archive

       -r, --rev
              revision to distribute

       -t, --type
              type of distribution to create
&#12;       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   backout
       hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV

       Prepare  a  new  changeset  with  the effect of REV undone in the current
       working directory.

       If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset is
       committed automatically. Otherwise, hg needs to merge the changes and the
       merged result is left uncommitted.

       Note   backout cannot be used to fix  either  an  unwanted  or  incorrect
              merge.

       By  default,  the  pending  changeset will have one parent, maintaining a
       linear history. With --merge, the pending changeset will instead have two
       parents:  the  old parent of the working directory and a new child of REV
       that simply undoes REV.

       Before version 1.7, the behavior without --merge was equivalent to speci&#8208;
       fying  --merge  followed  by  hg update --clean . to cancel the merge and
       leave the child of REV as a head to be merged separately.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --merge
              merge with old dirstate parent after backout

       --parent
              parent to choose when backing out merge (DEPRECATED)

       -r, --rev
              revision to backout

       -t, --tool
              specify merge tool

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

   bisect
       hg bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]
&#12;       This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems.  To  use,
       mark  the  earliest  changeset you know exhibits the problem as bad, then
       mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem as good.  Bisect
       will  update your working directory to a revision for testing (unless the
       -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once you have performed  tests,  mark
       the  working  directory  as good or bad, and bisect will either update to
       another candidate changeset or announce that it has found the  bad  revi&#8208;
       sion.

       As  a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a revision
       as good or bad without checking it out first.

       If you supply a command, it will be used for  automatic  bisection.   Its
       exit status will be used to mark revisions as good or bad: status 0 means
       good, 125 means to skip the revision, 127 (command not found) will  abort
       the  bisection,  and any other non-zero exit status means the revision is
       bad.

       Some examples:

       &#183; start a bisection with known bad revision 12, and good revision 34:

         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12

       &#183; advance the current bisection by marking current revision  as  good  or
         bad:

         hg bisect --good
         hg bisect --bad

       &#183; mark  the  current revision, or a known revision, to be skipped (eg. if
         that revision is not usable because of another issue):

         hg bisect --skip
         hg bisect --skip 23

       &#183; forget the current bisection:

         hg bisect --reset

       &#183; use &apos;make &amp;&amp; make tests&apos; to automatically find the first  broken  revi&#8208;
         sion:

         hg bisect --reset
         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12
         hg bisect --command &apos;make &amp;&amp; make tests&apos;

       &#183; see all changesets whose states are already known in the current bisec&#8208;
         tion:

         hg log -r &quot;bisect(pruned)&quot;

       &#183; see all changesets that took part in the current bisection:

         hg log -r &quot;bisect(range)&quot;

       &#183; with the graphlog extension, you can even get a nice graph:

         hg log --graph -r &quot;bisect(range)&quot;

       See hg help revsets for more about the bisect() keyword.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --reset
              reset bisect state
&#12;       -g, --good
              mark changeset good

       -b, --bad
              mark changeset bad

       -s, --skip
              skip testing changeset

       -e, --extend
              extend the bisect range

       -c, --command
              use command to check changeset state

       -U, --noupdate
              do not update to target

   bookmarks
       hg bookmarks [-f] [-d] [-i] [-m NAME] [-r REV] [NAME]

       Bookmarks are pointers to certain  commits  that  move  when  committing.
       Bookmarks  are local. They can be renamed, copied and deleted. It is pos&#8208;
       sible to use hg merge NAME to merge from a given bookmark, and hg  update
       NAME to update to a given bookmark.

       You can use hg bookmark NAME to set a bookmark on the working directory&apos;s
       parent revision with the given name. If you specify a revision  using  -r
       REV  (where REV may be an existing bookmark), the bookmark is assigned to
       that revision.

       Bookmarks can be pushed and pulled between repositories (see hg help push
       and  hg  help pull). This requires both the local and remote repositories
       to support bookmarks. For versions prior to 1.8, this means the bookmarks
       extension must be enabled.

       With  -i/--inactive,  the  new bookmark will not be made the active book&#8208;
       mark. If -r/--rev is given, the new bookmark will not be made active even
       if  -i/--inactive  is  not given. If no NAME is given, the current active
       bookmark will be marked inactive.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force

       -r, --rev
              revision

       -d, --delete
              delete a given bookmark

       -m, --rename
              rename a given bookmark

       -i, --inactive
              mark a bookmark inactive

   branch
       hg branch [-fC] [NAME]

       Note   Branch names are permanent and global. Use hg bookmark to create a
              light-weight  bookmark  instead.  See  hg  help  glossary for more
              information about named branches and bookmarks.

       With no argument, show the current branch name. With  one  argument,  set
       the  working  directory  branch  name  (the  branch will not exist in the
       repository until the next commit). Standard practice recommends that pri&#8208;
       mary development take place on the &apos;default&apos; branch.

       Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you set a branch name
       that already exists, even if it&apos;s inactive.

       Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to that of the  par&#8208;
       ent of the working directory, negating a previous branch change.

       Use  the command hg update to switch to an existing branch. Use hg commit
       --close-branch to mark this branch as closed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch

       -C, --clean
              reset branch name to parent branch name

   branches
       hg branches [-ac]

       List the repository&apos;s named branches, indicating which ones are inactive.
       If  -c/--closed  is  specified, also list branches which have been marked
       closed (see hg commit --close-branch).

       If -a/--active is specified, only show active branches. A branch is  con&#8208;
       sidered active if it contains repository heads.

       Use the command hg update to switch to an existing branch.

       Returns 0.

       Options:

       -a, --active
              show only branches that have unmerged heads

       -c, --closed
              show normal and closed branches

   bundle
       hg bundle [-f] [-t TYPE] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE [DEST]

       Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not known to
       be in another repository.

       If you omit the destination repository, then hg assumes  the  destination
       will  have  all the nodes you specify with --base parameters. To create a
       bundle containing all changesets, use -a/--all (or --base null).

       You can change compression method with the -t/--type option.  The  avail&#8208;
       able  compression methods are: none, bzip2, and gzip (by default, bundles
       are compressed using bzip2).

       The bundle file can then be  transferred  using  conventional  means  and
       applied  to another repository with the unbundle or pull command. This is
       useful when direct push and pull are not available or when  exporting  an
       entire repository is undesirable.

       Applying  bundles preserves all changeset contents including permissions,
       copy/rename information, and revision history.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       -r, --rev
              a changeset intended to be added to the destination
&#12;       -b, --branch
              a specific branch you would like to bundle

       --base a base changeset assumed to be available at the destination

       -a, --all
              bundle all changesets in the repository

       -t, --type
              bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   cat
       hg cat [OPTION]... FILE...

       Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If no revi&#8208;
       sion  is given, the parent of the working directory is used, or tip if no
       revision is checked out.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name  of  the  file  is  given
       using  a  format  string.  The  formatting  rules are the same as for the
       export command, with the following additions:

       %s

              basename of file being printed

       %d

              dirname of file being printed, or &apos;.&apos; if in repository root

       %p

              root-relative path name of file being printed

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -o, --output
              print output to file with formatted name

       -r, --rev
              print the given revision

       --decode
              apply any matching decode filter

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   clone
       hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

       If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to  the  base&#8208;
       name of the source.

       The  location  of  the  source  is added to the new repository&apos;s .hg/hgrc
       file, as the default to be used for future pulls.

       Only local paths and ssh://  URLs  are  supported  as  destinations.  For
       ssh://  destinations, no working directory or .hg/hgrc will be created on
       the remote side.

       To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more revisions  iden&#8208;
       tifiers  with  -r/--rev or branches with -b/--branch. The resulting clone
       will contain only the specified changesets  and  their  ancestors.  These
       options  (or  &apos;clone  src#rev  dest&apos;) imply --pull, even for local source
       repositories. Note that specifying a tag will include the tagged  change&#8208;
       set but not the changeset containing the tag.

       To  check  out a particular version, use -u/--update, or -U/--noupdate to
       create a clone with no working directory.

       For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever  the  source  and
       destination  are  on  the  same filesystem (note this applies only to the
       repository data, not to the working directory). Some filesystems, such as
       AFS,  implement  hardlinking  incorrectly,  but  do not report errors. In
       these cases, use the --pull option to avoid hardlinking.

       In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working directory using
       full hardlinks with

       $ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE

       This  is  the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The opera&#8208;
       tion is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during the operation
       is  up  to  you)  and  you have to make sure your editor breaks hardlinks
       (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so). Also, this is  not  compatible
       with  certain  extensions  that place their metadata under the .hg direc&#8208;
       tory, such as mq.

       Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable revi&#8208;
       sion from this list:

       a. null if -U or the source repository has no changesets

       b. if  -u  .  and the source repository is local, the first parent of the
          source repository&apos;s working directory

       c. the changeset specified with -u (if a branch name, this means the lat&#8208;
          est head of that branch)

       d. the changeset specified with -r

       e. the tipmost head specified with -b

       f. the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax

       g. the tipmost head of the default branch

       h. tip

       Examples:

       &#183; clone a remote repository to a new directory named hg/:

         hg clone http://selenic.com/hg

       &#183; create a lightweight local clone:

         hg clone project/ project-feature/

       &#183; clone from an absolute path on an ssh server (note double-slash):

         hg clone ssh://user@server//home/projects/alpha/

       &#183; do  a  high-speed  clone over a LAN while checking out a specified ver&#8208;
         sion:

         hg clone --uncompressed http://server/repo -u 1.5

       &#183; create a repository without changesets after a particular revision:

         hg clone -r 04e544 experimental/ good/

       &#183; clone (and track) a particular named branch:

         hg clone http://selenic.com/hg#stable

       See hg help urls for details on specifying URLs.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -U, --noupdate
              the clone will include an empty working copy (only a repository)

       -u, --updaterev
              revision, tag or branch to check out

       -r, --rev
              include the specified changeset

       -b, --branch
              clone only the specified branch

       --pull use pull protocol to copy metadata

       --uncompressed
              use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   commit
       hg commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a  central&#8208;
       ized  SCM,  this operation is a local operation. See hg push for a way to
       actively distribute your changes.

       If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by hg status will  be
       committed.

       If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any filenames
       or -I/-X filters.

       If no commit message is specified, Mercurial starts your configured  edi&#8208;
       tor  where  you  can enter a message. In case your commit fails, you will
       find a backup of your message in .hg/last-message.txt.

       The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the working directory
       with  a new commit that contains the changes in the parent in addition to
       those currently reported by hg status, if there are any. The  old  commit
       is  stored in a backup bundle in .hg/strip-backup (see hg help bundle and
       hg help unbundle on how to restore it).

       Message, user and date are taken from the amended  commit  unless  speci&#8208;
       fied. When a message isn&apos;t specified on the command line, the editor will
       open with the message of the amended commit.

       It is not possible to amend public changesets (see  hg  help  phases)  or
       changesets that have children.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing changed.

       Options:

       -A, --addremove
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       --close-branch
              mark a branch as closed, hiding it from the branch list

       --amend
              amend the parent of the working dir

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

              aliases: ci

   copy
       hg copy [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... DEST

       Mark  dest  as  having  copies  of  source files. If dest is a directory,
       copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file, the source must be a
       single file.

       By  default,  this  command copies the contents of files as they exist in
       the working directory. If  invoked  with  -A/--after,  the  operation  is
       recorded, but no copying is performed.

       This  command  takes  effect  with the next commit. To undo a copy before
       that, see hg revert.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record a copy that has already occurred

       -f, --force
              forcibly copy over an existing managed file

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

              aliases: cp
&#12;   diff
       hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...

       Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

       Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

       Note   diff may generate  unexpected  results  for  merges,  as  it  will
              default  to comparing against the working directory&apos;s first parent
              changeset if no revisions are specified.

       When two revision arguments are given, then  changes  are  shown  between
       those  revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is
       compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are  specified,
       the working directory files are compared to its parent.

       Alternatively  you  can  specify  -c/--change  with a revision to see the
       changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.

       Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs  of  files
       it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, probably
       with undesirable results.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended  diff  for&#8208;
       mat. For more information, read hg help diffs.

       Examples:

       &#183; compare a file in the current working directory to its parent:

         hg diff foo.c

       &#183; compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename info:

         hg diff --git -r 1.0:1.2 lib/

       &#183; get change stats relative to the last change on some date:

         hg diff --stat -r &quot;date(&apos;may 2&apos;)&quot;

       &#183; diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword:

         hg diff &quot;set:added() and grep(GNU)&quot;

       &#183; compare a revision and its parents:

         hg diff -c 9353         # compare against first parent
         hg diff -r 9353^:9353   # same using revset syntax
         hg diff -r 9353^2:9353  # compare against the second parent

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              revision

       -c, --change
              change made by revision

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --nodates
              omit dates from diff headers

       -p, --show-function
              show which function each change is in
&#12;       --reverse
              produce a diff that undoes the changes

       -w, --ignore-all-space
              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

       -U, --unified
              number of lines of context to show

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

   export
       hg export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] REV...

       Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.

       The  information  shown  in the changeset header is: author, date, branch
       name (if non-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit comment.

       Note   export may generate unexpected diff output for  merge  changesets,
              as  it  will  compare the merge changeset against its first parent
              only.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name  of  the  file  is  given
       using a format string. The formatting rules are as follows:

       %%

              literal &quot;%&quot; character

       %H

              changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)

       %N

              number of patches being generated

       %R

              changeset revision number

       %b

              basename of the exporting repository

       %h

              short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)

       %m

              first line of the commit message (only alphanumeric characters)

       %n

              zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1

       %r

              zero-padded changeset revision number

       Without the -a/--text option, export will avoid generating diffs of files
       it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a diff anyway, proba&#8208;
       bly with undesirable results.

       Use  the  -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff for&#8208;
       mat. See hg help diffs for more information.

       With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be against the second par&#8208;
       ent. It can be useful to review a merge.

       Examples:

       &#183; use export and import to transplant a bugfix to the current branch:

         hg export -r 9353 | hg import -

       &#183; export  all  the changesets between two revisions to a file with rename
         information:

         hg export --git -r 123:150 &gt; changes.txt

       &#183; split outgoing changes into a series of patches with descriptive names:

         hg export -r &quot;outgoing()&quot; -o &quot;%n-%m.patch&quot;

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -o, --output
              print output to file with formatted name

       --switch-parent
              diff against the second parent

       -r, --rev
              revisions to export

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --nodates
              omit dates from diff headers

   forget
       hg forget [OPTION]... FILE...

       Mark the specified files so they will no longer be tracked after the next
       commit.

       This  only  removes  files  from  the current branch, not from the entire
       project history, and it does not delete them from the working directory.

       To undo a forget before the next commit, see hg add.

       Examples:

       &#183; forget newly-added binary files:

         hg forget &quot;set:added() and binary()&quot;

       &#183; forget files that would be excluded by .hgignore:

         hg forget &quot;set:hgignore()&quot;

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   graft
       hg graft [OPTION]... REVISION...

       This command uses Mercurial&apos;s merge logic to copy individual changes from
       other  branches  without  merging  branches in the history graph. This is
       sometimes known as &apos;backporting&apos; or &apos;cherry-picking&apos;. By  default,  graft
       will copy user, date, and description from the source changesets.

       Changesets  that are ancestors of the current revision, that have already
       been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.

       If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process  is  interrupted
       so  that  the current merge can be manually resolved.  Once all conflicts
       are addressed, the graft process can be continued with the  -c/--continue
       option.

       Note   The -c/--continue option does not reapply earlier options.

       Examples:

       &#183; copy a single change to the stable branch and edit its description:

         hg update stable
         hg graft --edit 9393

       &#183; graft a range of changesets with one exception, updating dates:

         hg graft -D &quot;2085::2093 and not 2091&quot;

       &#183; continue a graft after resolving conflicts:

         hg graft -c

       &#183; show the source of a grafted changeset:

         hg log --debug -r tip

       Returns 0 on successful completion.

       Options:

       -c, --continue
              resume interrupted graft

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -D, --currentdate
              record the current date as commit date

       -U, --currentuser
              record the current user as committer

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

       -t, --tool
              specify merge tool
&#12;       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

   grep
       hg grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...

       Search revisions of files for a regular expression.

       This  command  behaves  differently  than  Unix  grep.  It  only  accepts
       Python/Perl regexps. It searches  repository  history,  not  the  working
       directory. It always prints the revision number in which a match appears.

       By  default,  grep only prints output for the first revision of a file in
       which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision that contains a
       change  in match status (&quot;-&quot; for a match that becomes a non-match, or &quot;+&quot;
       for a non-match that becomes a match), use the --all flag.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -0, --print0
              end fields with NUL

       --all  print all revisions that match

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -f, --follow
              follow changeset  history,  or  file  history  across  copies  and
              renames

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore case when matching

       -l, --files-with-matches
              print only filenames and revisions that match

       -n, --line-number
              print matching line numbers

       -r, --rev
              only search files changed within revision range

       -u, --user
              list the author (long with -v)

       -d, --date
              list the date (short with -q)

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   heads
       hg heads [-ac] [-r STARTREV] [REV]...

       With no arguments, show all repository branch heads.

       Repository  &quot;heads&quot;  are  changesets  with  no child changesets. They are
       where development generally takes place and are  the  usual  targets  for
       update  and  merge  operations.  Branch heads are changesets that have no
       child changeset on the same branch.

       If one or more REVs are given, only branch heads on the branches  associ&#8208;
       ated with the specified changesets are shown. This means that you can use
       hg heads foo to see the heads on a branch named foo.

       If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed (see hg
       commit --close-branch).

       If  STARTREV  is  specified,  only  those  heads  that are descendants of
       STARTREV will be displayed.

       If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics  will  be  ignored  and
       only changesets without children will be shown.

       Returns 0 if matching heads are found, 1 if not.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              show only heads which are descendants of STARTREV

       -t, --topo
              show topological heads only

       -a, --active
              show active branchheads only (DEPRECATED)

       -c, --closed
              show normal and closed branch heads

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

   help
       hg help [-ec] [TOPIC]

       With no arguments, print a list of commands with short help messages.

       Given a topic, extension, or command name, print help for that topic.

       Returns 0 if successful.

       Options:

       -e, --extension
              show only help for extensions

       -c, --command
              show only help for commands

   identify
       hg identify [-nibtB] [-r REV] [SOURCE]

       Print  a summary identifying the repository state at REV using one or two
       parent hash identifiers, followed by a &quot;+&quot; if the working  directory  has
       uncommitted  changes,  the  branch name (if not default), a list of tags,
       and a list of bookmarks.

       When REV is not given, print a summary of the current state of the repos&#8208;
       itory.

       Specifying  a  path  to  a repository root or Mercurial bundle will cause
       lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

       Examples:

       &#183; generate a build identifier for the working directory:

         hg id --id &gt; build-id.dat

       &#183; find the revision corresponding to a tag:

         hg id -n -r 1.3

       &#183; check the most recent revision of a remote repository:

         hg id -r tip http://selenic.com/hg/

       Returns 0 if successful.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              identify the specified revision

       -n, --num
              show local revision number

       -i, --id
              show global revision id

       -b, --branch
              show branch

       -t, --tags
              show tags

       -B, --bookmarks
              show bookmarks

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

              aliases: id

   import
       hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...

       Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless --no-commit
       is specified).

       If  there  are  outstanding changes in the working directory, import will
       abort unless given the -f/--force flag.

       You can import a patch straight from a  mail  message.  Even  patches  as
       attachments  work  (to use the body part, it must have type text/plain or
       text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of  email  message  are  used  as
       default  committer  and  commit message. All text/plain body parts before
       first diff are added to commit message.

       If the imported patch was generated by hg export,  user  and  description
       from patch override values from message headers and body. Values given on
       command line with -m/--message and -u/--user override these.

       If --exact is specified, import will set the  working  directory  to  the
       parent  of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the resulting
       changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in the patch. This may
       happen  due  to  character set problems or other deficiencies in the text
       patch format.

       Use --bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the repository,  not
       touching  the working directory. Without --exact, patches will be applied
       on top of the working directory parent revision.

       With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and  copies  in
       the patch in the same way as hg addremove.

       To  read a patch from standard input, use &quot;-&quot; as the patch name. If a URL
       is specified, the patch will be downloaded from it.  See  hg  help  dates
       for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Examples:

       &#183; import a traditional patch from a website and detect renames:
&#12;         hg import -s 80 http://example.com/bugfix.patch

       &#183; import a changeset from an hgweb server:

         hg import http://www.selenic.com/hg/rev/5ca8c111e9aa

       &#183; import all the patches in an Unix-style mbox:

         hg import incoming-patches.mbox

       &#183; attempt to exactly restore an exported changeset (not always possible):

         hg import --exact proposed-fix.patch

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -p, --strip
              directory strip option for patch. This has the same meaning as the
              corresponding patch option (default: 1)

       -b, --base
              base path (DEPRECATED)

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -f, --force
              skip check for outstanding uncommitted changes

       --no-commit
              don&apos;t commit, just update the working directory

       --bypass
              apply patch without touching the working directory

       --exact
              apply patch to the nodes from which it was generated

       --import-branch
              use any branch information in patch (implied by --exact)

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

       -s, --similarity
              guess renamed files by similarity (0&lt;=s&lt;=100)

              aliases: patch

   incoming
       hg incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle FILENAME] [SOURCE]

       Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or the  default  pull
       location.  These are the changesets that would have been pulled if a pull
       at the time you issued this command.

       For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading  the  changesets
       twice if the incoming is followed by a pull.

       See pull for valid source format details.

       Returns 0 if there are incoming changes, 1 otherwise.
&#12;       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even if remote repository is unrelated

       -n, --newest-first
              show newest record first

       --bundle
              file to store the bundles into

       -r, --rev
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       -B, --bookmarks
              compare bookmarks

       -b, --branch
              a specific branch you would like to pull

       -p, --patch
              show patch

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -l, --limit
              limit number of changes displayed

       -M, --no-merges
              do not show merges

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

              aliases: in

   init
       hg init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

       Initialize  a  new repository in the given directory. If the given direc&#8208;
       tory does not exist, it will be created.

       If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

       It is possible to specify an ssh:// URL as the destination.  See hg  help
       urls for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side
&#12;       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   locate
       hg locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...

       Print  files under Mercurial control in the working directory whose names
       match the given patterns.

       By default, this command searches all directories in the  working  direc&#8208;
       tory.  To  search  just the current directory and its subdirectories, use
       &quot;--include .&quot;.

       If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names  of  all
       files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

       If  you want to feed the output of this command into the &quot;xargs&quot; command,
       use the -0 option to both this command and &quot;xargs&quot;. This will  avoid  the
       problem  of  &quot;xargs&quot; treating single filenames that contain whitespace as
       multiple filenames.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              search the repository as it is in REV

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       -f, --fullpath
              print complete paths from the filesystem root

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   log
       hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]

       Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire project.

       If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0  unless  --follow
       is  set, in which case the working directory parent is used as the start&#8208;
       ing revision.

       File history is shown without following rename or copy history of  files.
       Use  -f/--follow  with  a  filename  to follow history across renames and
       copies. --follow without a filename will only show ancestors  or  descen&#8208;
       dants of the starting revision.

       By  default  this  command prints revision number and changeset id, tags,
       non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for each  commit.
       When  the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of changed files and full
       commit message are shown.

       Note   log -p/--patch may  generate  unexpected  diff  output  for  merge
              changesets,  as  it  will only compare the merge changeset against
              its first parent. Also, only files  different  from  BOTH  parents
              will appear in files:.

       Note   for  performance reasons, log FILE may omit duplicate changes made
              on branches and will  not  show  deletions.  To  see  all  changes
              including duplicates and deletions, use the --removed switch.

       Some examples:

       &#183; changesets with full descriptions and file lists:

         hg log -v

       &#183; changesets ancestral to the working directory:
&#12;         hg log -f

       &#183; last 10 commits on the current branch:

         hg log -l 10 -b .

       &#183; changesets showing all modifications of a file, including removals:

         hg log --removed file.c

       &#183; all changesets that touch a directory, with diffs, excluding merges:

         hg log -Mp lib/

       &#183; all revision numbers that match a keyword:

         hg log -k bug --template &quot;{rev}\n&quot;

       &#183; check if a given changeset is included is a tagged release:

         hg log -r &quot;a21ccf and ancestor(1.9)&quot;

       &#183; find all changesets by some user in a date range:

         hg log -k alice -d &quot;may 2008 to jul 2008&quot;

       &#183; summary of all changesets after the last tag:

         hg log -r &quot;last(tagged())::&quot; --template &quot;{desc|firstline}\n&quot;

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See hg help revisions and hg help revsets for more about specifying revi&#8208;
       sions.

       See hg help templates for more about pre-packaged styles  and  specifying
       custom templates.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --follow
              follow  changeset  history,  or  file  history  across  copies and
              renames

              aliases: history

   manifest
       hg manifest [-r REV]

       Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.   If  no
       revision  is given, the first parent of the working directory is used, or
       the null revision if no revision is checked out.

       With -v, print file  permissions,  symlink  and  executable  bits.   With
       --debug, print file revision hashes.

       If option --all is specified, the list of all files from all revisions is
       printed. This includes deleted and renamed files.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              revision to display

       --all  list files from all revisions

   merge
       hg merge [-P] [-f] [[-r] REV]

       The current working directory is updated with all  changes  made  in  the
       requested revision since the last common predecessor revision.

       Files  that  changed  between either parent are marked as changed for the
       next commit and a commit must be performed before any further updates  to
       the repository are allowed. The next commit will have two parents.

       --tool  can  be  used  to specify the merge tool used for file merges. It
       overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your configuration  files.
       See hg help merge-tools for options.

       If  no  revision  is  specified, the working directory&apos;s parent is a head
       revision, and the current branch contains exactly  one  other  head,  the
       other  head  is  merged  with by default. Otherwise, an explicit revision
       with which to merge with must be provided.

       hg resolve must be used to resolve unresolved files.

       To undo an uncommitted merge, use hg update --clean  . which  will  check
       out a clean copy of the original merge parent, losing all changes.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force a merge with outstanding changes

       -r, --rev
              revision to merge

       -P, --preview
              review revisions to merge (no merge is performed)

       -t, --tool
              specify merge tool

   outgoing
       hg outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]

       Show  changesets not found in the specified destination repository or the
       default push location. These are the changesets that would be pushed if a
       push was requested.

       See pull for details of valid destination formats.

       Returns 0 if there are outgoing changes, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       -r, --rev
              a changeset intended to be included in the destination

              recurse into subrepositories

              aliases: out

   parents
       hg parents [-r REV] [FILE]

       Print  the  working  directory&apos;s parent revisions. If a revision is given
       via -r/--rev, the parent of that revision will be  printed.   If  a  file
       argument  is  given,  the  revision  in  which  the file was last changed
       (before the working directory revision or the argument to --rev if given)
       is printed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              show parents of the specified revision

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

   paths
       hg paths [NAME]

       Show  definition  of  symbolic  path name NAME. If no name is given, show
       definition of all available names.

       Option -q/--quiet suppresses all output when searching for NAME and shows
       only the path names when listing all definitions.

       Path  names are defined in the [paths] section of your configuration file
       and in /etc/mercurial/hgrc. If run inside a repository, .hg/hgrc is used,
       too.

       The  path  names  default  and default-push have a special meaning.  When
       performing a push or pull operation, they are used  as  fallbacks  if  no
       location  is specified on the command-line.  When default-push is set, it
       will be used for push and  default  will  be  used  for  pull;  otherwise
       default is used as the fallback for both.  When cloning a repository, the
       clone source is written as default in .hg/hgrc.  Note  that  default  and
       default-push  apply to all inbound (e.g.  hg incoming) and outbound (e.g.
       hg outgoing, hg email and hg bundle) operations.

       See hg help urls for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

   phase
       hg phase [-p|-d|-s] [-f] [-r] REV...

       With no argument, show the phase name of specified revisions.

       With one of -p/--public, -d/--draft  or  -s/--secret,  change  the  phase
       value of the specified revisions.

       Unless  -f/--force  is  specified,  hg  phase won&apos;t move changeset from a
       lower phase to an higher phase. Phases are ordered as follows:

       public &lt; draft &lt; secret

       Return 0 on success, 1 if no phases were changed or  some  could  not  be
       changed.

       Options:

       -p, --public
              set changeset phase to public

       -d, --draft
              set changeset phase to draft
&#12;       -s, --secret
              set changeset phase to secret

       -f, --force
              allow to move boundary backward

       -r, --rev
              target revision

   pull
       hg pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

       Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

       This  finds  all changes from the repository at the specified path or URL
       and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless -R is  speci&#8208;
       fied).  By  default,  this does not update the copy of the project in the
       working directory.

       Use hg incoming if you want to see what would have been added by  a  pull
       at  the  time  you  issued  this command. If you then decide to add those
       changes to the repository, you should use hg pull -r  X where  X  is  the
       last changeset listed by hg incoming.

       If  SOURCE is omitted, the &apos;default&apos; path will be used.  See hg help urls
       for more information.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.

       Options:

       -u, --update
              update to new branch head if changesets were pulled

       -f, --force
              run even when remote repository is unrelated

       -r, --rev
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       -B, --bookmark
              bookmark to pull

       -b, --branch
              a specific branch you would like to pull

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   push
       hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

       Push changesets from the local repository to the specified destination.

       This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull  in  the
       destination repository from the current one.

       By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the destination,
       since multiple heads would make it unclear which head  to  use.  In  this
       situation, it is recommended to pull and merge before pushing.

       Use  --new-branch  if you want to allow push to create a new named branch
       that is not present at the destination. This allows you to only create  a
       new branch without forcing other changes.

       Use  -f/--force  to override the default behavior and push all changesets
       on all branches.

       If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors will be
       pushed to the remote repository.
&#12;       Please  see hg help urls for important details about ssh:// URLs. If DES&#8208;
       TINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.

       Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force push

       -r, --rev
              a changeset intended to be included in the destination

       -B, --bookmark
              bookmark to push

       -b, --branch
              a specific branch you would like to push

       --new-branch
              allow pushing a new branch

       -e, --ssh
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   recover
       hg recover

       Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

       This command tries to fix the  repository  status  after  an  interrupted
       operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial suggests it.

       Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover or verify fails.

   remove
       hg remove [OPTION]... FILE...

       Schedule the indicated files for removal from the current branch.

       This  command  schedules  the files to be removed at the next commit.  To
       undo a remove before that, see hg revert. To undo  added  files,  see  hg
       forget.

       -A/--after  can  be  used  to  remove  only  files that have already been
       deleted, -f/--force can be used to force deletion, and -Af can be used to
       remove  files from the next revision without deleting them from the work&#8208;
       ing directory.

       The following table details the behavior of  remove  for  different  file
       states  (columns)  and  option  combinations  (rows). The file states are
       Added [A], Clean [C], Modified [M] and Missing [!]  (as  reported  by  hg
       status).  The  actions  are  Warn,  Remove (from branch) and Delete (from
       disk):

       center; |l|l|l|l|l|.  _ T{ T}   T{ T}   T{ T}   T{ T}   T{ T} _  T{  none
       T}   T{  W T}   T{ RD T}   T{ W T}   T{ R T} _ T{ -f T}   T{ R T}   T{ RD
       T}   T{ RD T}   T{ R T} _ T{ -A T}   T{ W T}   T{ W T}   T{ W  T}   T{  R
       T} _ T{ -Af T}   T{ R T}   T{ R T}   T{ R T}   T{ R T} _

       Note  that remove never deletes files in Added [A] state from the working
       directory, not even if option --force is specified.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any warnings encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record delete for missing files

       -f, --force
              remove (and delete) file even if added or modified
&#12;       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

              aliases: rm

   rename
       hg rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

       Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If dest  is  a
       directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file, there can
       only be one source.

       By default, this command copies the contents of files as  they  exist  in
       the  working  directory.  If  invoked  with  -A/--after, the operation is
       recorded, but no copying is performed.

       This command takes effect at the next commit. To  undo  a  rename  before
       that, see hg revert.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record a rename that has already occurred

       -f, --force
              forcibly copy over an existing managed file

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

              aliases: move mv

   resolve
       hg resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Merges  with unresolved conflicts are often the result of non-interactive
       merging using the internal:merge configuration setting, or a command-line
       merge  tool  like  diff3. The resolve command is used to manage the files
       involved in a merge, after hg merge has been run, and before hg commit is
       run  (i.e.  the  working  directory  must  have two parents). See hg help
       merge-tools for information on configuring merge tools.

       The resolve command can be used in the following ways:

       &#183; hg resolve [--tool TOOL] FILE...: attempt  to  re-merge  the  specified
         files,  discarding  any previous merge attempts. Re-merging is not per&#8208;
         formed for files already marked as resolved. Use --all/-a to select all
         unresolved files. --tool can be used to specify the merge tool used for
         the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your
         configuration  files.   Previous  file  contents are saved with a .orig
         suffix.

       &#183; hg resolve -m [FILE]: mark a file as having been resolved  (e.g.  after
         having  manually  fixed-up the files). The default is to mark all unre&#8208;
         solved files.

       &#183; hg resolve -u [FILE]...: mark a file as unresolved. The default  is  to
         mark all resolved files.

       &#183; hg  resolve  -l:  list files which had or still have conflicts.  In the
         printed list, U = unresolved and R = resolved.

       Note that Mercurial will not let you commit files with  unresolved  merge
       conflicts.  You  must use hg resolve -m ... before you can commit after a
       conflicting merge.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.
&#12;       Options:

       -a, --all
              select all unresolved files

       -l, --list
              list state of files needing merge

       -m, --mark
              mark files as resolved

       -u, --unmark
              mark files as unresolved

       -n, --no-status
              hide status prefix

       -t, --tool
              specify merge tool

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   revert
       hg revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...

       Note   To check out earlier revisions, you should use hg update REV.   To
              cancel a merge (and lose your changes), use hg update --clean ..

       With  no revision specified, revert the specified files or directories to
       the contents they had in the  parent  of  the  working  directory.   This
       restores  the  contents  of  files to an unmodified state and unschedules
       adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the working directory has two par&#8208;
       ents, you must explicitly specify a revision.

       Using the -r/--rev or -d/--date options, revert the given files or direc&#8208;
       tories to their states as of a specific revision. Because revert does not
       change  the  working  directory  parents,  this will cause these files to
       appear modified. This can be helpful to &quot;back out&quot; some or all of an ear&#8208;
       lier change. See hg backout for a related method.

       Modified  files  are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.  To dis&#8208;
       able these backups, use --no-backup.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --all
              revert all changes when no arguments given

       -d, --date
              tipmost revision matching date

       -r, --rev
              revert to the specified revision

       -C, --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

   rollback
       hg rollback

       This command should be used with care. There is only one level  of  roll&#8208;
       back,  and  there  is no way to undo a rollback. It will also restore the
       dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing any dirstate changes
       since that time. This command does not alter the working directory.

       Transactions  are  used  to  encapsulate the effects of all commands that
       create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a repository.
       For  example, the following commands are transactional, and their effects
       can be rolled back:

       &#183; commit

       &#183; import

       &#183; pull

       &#183; push (with this repository as the destination)

       &#183; unbundle

       To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback  a  commit
       transaction if it isn&apos;t checked out. Use --force to override this protec&#8208;
       tion.

       This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once changes
       are  visible  for pull by other users, rolling a transaction back locally
       is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled the  changes).  Fur&#8208;
       thermore,  a race is possible with readers of the repository; for example
       an in-progress pull from the repository may fail if a  rollback  is  per&#8208;
       formed.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

       Options:

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       -f, --force
              ignore safety measures

   root
       hg root

       Print the root directory of the current repository.

       Returns 0 on success.

   serve
       hg serve [OPTION]...

       Start  a  local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use this
       for ad-hoc sharing and browsing of repositories. It is recommended to use
       a real web server to serve a repository for longer periods of time.

       Please  note  that  the  server  does not implement access control.  This
       means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and  nobody  can
       write  to  it  by  default.  Set  the web.allow_push option to * to allow
       everybody to push to the server. You should use a real web server if  you
       need to authenticate users.

       By  default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to stderr. Use
       the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log to files.

       To have the server choose a free port number to listen on, specify a port
       number of 0; in this case, the server will print the port number it uses.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -A, --accesslog
              name of access log file to write to

       -d, --daemon
              run server in background

       --daemon-pipefds
              used internally by daemon mode

       -E, --errorlog
              name of error log file to write to
&#12;       -p, --port
              port to listen on (default: 8000)

       -a, --address
              address to listen on (default: all interfaces)

       --prefix
              prefix path to serve from (default: server root)

       -n, --name
              name to show in web pages (default: working directory)

       --web-conf
              name of the hgweb config file (see &quot;hg help hgweb&quot;)

       --webdir-conf
              name of the hgweb config file (DEPRECATED)

       --pid-file
              name of file to write process ID to

       --stdio
              for remote clients

       --cmdserver
              for remote clients

       -t, --templates
              web templates to use

       --style
              template style to use

       -6, --ipv6
              use IPv6 in addition to IPv4

       --certificate
              SSL certificate file

   showconfig
       hg showconfig [-u] [NAME]...

       With no arguments, print names and values of all config items.

       With  one argument of the form section.name, print just the value of that
       config item.

       With multiple arguments, print names and values of all config items  with
       matching section names.

       With  --debug,  the source (filename and line number) is printed for each
       config item.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -u, --untrusted
              show untrusted configuration options

              aliases: debugconfig

   status
       hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Show status of files in the repository. If names are  given,  only  files
       that  match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or the source of a
       copy/move operation, are  not  listed  unless  -c/--clean,  -i/--ignored,
       -C/--copies  or  -A/--all are given.  Unless options described with &quot;show
       only ...&quot; are given, the options -mardu are used.

       Option -q/--quiet hides untracked  (unknown  and  ignored)  files  unless
       explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

       Note   status  may  appear  to  disagree  with  diff  if permissions have
              changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not
              report  permission  changes and diff only reports changes relative
              to one merge parent.

       If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.  If two  revi&#8208;
       sions  are  given,  the  differences between them are shown. The --change
       option can also be used as a shortcut to list  the  changed  files  of  a
       revision from its first parent.

       The codes used to show the status of files are:

       M = modified
       A = added
       R = removed
       C = clean
       ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
       ? = not tracked
       I = ignored
         = origin of the previous file listed as A (added)

       Examples:

       &#183; show changes in the working directory relative to a changeset:

         hg status --rev 9353

       &#183; show all changes including copies in an existing changeset:

         hg status --copies --change 9353

       &#183; get a NUL separated list of added files, suitable for xargs:

         hg status -an0

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -A, --all
              show status of all files

       -m, --modified
              show only modified files

       -a, --added
              show only added files

       -r, --removed
              show only removed files

       -d, --deleted
              show only deleted (but tracked) files

       -c, --clean
              show only files without changes

       -u, --unknown
              show only unknown (not tracked) files

       -i, --ignored
              show only ignored files

       -n, --no-status
              hide status prefix

       -C, --copies
              show source of copied files

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       --rev  show difference from revision

       --change
              list the changed files of a revision

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

              recurse into subrepositories

              aliases: st
&#12;   summary
       hg summary [--remote]

       This  generates a brief summary of the working directory state, including
       parents, branch, commit status, and available updates.

       With the --remote option, this will check the default paths for  incoming
       and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --remote
              check for push and pull

              aliases: sum

   tag
       hg tag [-f] [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME...

       Name a particular revision using &lt;name&gt;.

       Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are very
       useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant  earlier
       versions  or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing an existing
       tag is normally disallowed; use -f/--force to override.

       If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,  or
       tip if no revision is checked out.

       To  facilitate  version  control, distribution, and merging of tags, they
       are stored as a file named &quot;.hgtags&quot; which is managed similarly to  other
       project  files  and can be hand-edited if necessary. This also means that
       tagging creates a new commit. The file &quot;.hg/localtags&quot; is used for  local
       tags (not shared among repositories).

       Tag  commits  are  usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent of
       the working directory is not a branch head, hg tag aborts; use -f/--force
       to force the tag commit to be based on a non-head changeset.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Since  tag  names have priority over branch names during revision lookup,
       using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force tag

       -l, --local
              make the tag local

       -r, --rev
              revision to tag

       --remove
              remove a tag

       -e, --edit
              edit commit message

       -m, --message
              use &lt;text&gt; as commit message

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

   tags
       hg tags

       This lists both regular and local tags. When the -v/--verbose  switch  is
       used, a third column &quot;local&quot; is printed for local tags.

       Returns 0 on success.

   tip
       hg tip [-p] [-g]

       The  tip  revision  (usually  just  called the tip) is the changeset most
       recently added to the repository (and therefore the most recently changed
       head).

       If  you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If you have
       just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of  that  repository
       becomes  the  current tip. The &quot;tip&quot; tag is special and cannot be renamed
       or assigned to a different changeset.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -p, --patch
              show patch

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

   unbundle
       hg unbundle [-u] FILE...

       Apply one or more compressed changegroup files generated  by  the  bundle
       command.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update has unresolved files.

       Options:

       -u, --update
              update to new branch head if changesets were unbundled

   update
       hg update [-c] [-C] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]

       Update  the repository&apos;s working directory to the specified changeset. If
       no changeset is specified, update to the tip of the current named  branch
       and move the current bookmark (see hg help bookmarks).

       If  the  changeset is not a descendant of the working directory&apos;s parent,
       the update is aborted. With the -c/--check option, the working  directory
       is checked for uncommitted changes; if none are found, the working direc&#8208;
       tory is updated to the specified changeset.

       Update sets the working  directory&apos;s  parent  revison  to  the  specified
       changeset (see hg help parents).

       The following rules apply when the working directory contains uncommitted
       changes:

       1. If  neither  -c/--check  nor  -C/--clean  is  specified,  and  if  the
          requested changeset is an ancestor or descendant of the working direc&#8208;
          tory&apos;s parent, the uncommitted changes are merged into  the  requested
          changeset  and the merged result is left uncommitted. If the requested
          changeset is not an ancestor or descendant (that is, it is on  another
          branch),  the  update  is aborted and the uncommitted changes are pre&#8208;
          served.

       2. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the  uncommitted
          changes are preserved.

       3. With  the -C/--clean option, uncommitted changes are discarded and the
          working directory is updated to the requested changeset.

       Use null as the changeset to remove the working directory (like hg  clone
       -U).

       If  you  want to revert just one file to an older revision, use hg revert
       [-r REV] NAME.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       -C, --clean
              discard uncommitted changes (no backup)

       -c, --check
              update across branches if no uncommitted changes

       -d, --date
              tipmost revision matching date

       Verify the integrity of the current repository.

       This will perform an extensive check of the repository&apos;s integrity, vali&#8208;
       dating the hashes and checksums of each entry in the changelog, manifest,
       and tracked files, as well as  the  integrity  of  their  crosslinks  and
       indices.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

DATE FORMATS
       Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:

       &#183; backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.

       &#183; log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

       Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:

       &#183; Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 (local timezone assumed)

       &#183; Dec 6 13:18 -0600 (year assumed, time offset provided)

       &#183; Dec 6 13:18 UTC (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)

       &#183; Dec 6 (midnight)

       &#183; 13:18 (today assumed)

       &#183; 3:39 (3:39AM assumed)

       &#183; 3:39pm (15:39)

       &#183; 2006-12-06 13:18:29 (ISO 8601 format)

       &#183; 2006-12-6 13:18

       &#183; 2006-12-6

       &#183; 12-6

       &#183; 12/6

       &#183; 12/6/6 (Dec 6 2006)

       Lastly, there is Mercurial&apos;s internal format:

       &#183; 1165432709 0 (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)

       This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number is
       the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). The  second
       is  the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if
       the timezone is east of UTC).

       The log command also accepts date ranges:

       &#183; &lt;DATE - at or before a given date/time

       &#183; &gt;DATE - on or after a given date/time

       &#183; DATE to DATE - a date range, inclusive

       &#183; -DAYS - within a given number of days of today

DIFF FORMATS
       Mercurial&apos;s default format for showing changes between two versions of  a
       file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be used
       by GNU patch and many other standard tools.

       While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode  the  fol&#8208;
       lowing information:

       &#183; executable status and other permission bits

       &#183; copy or rename information

       &#183; changes in binary files

       &#183; creation or deletion of empty files

       Mercurial  also  supports the extended diff format from the git VCS which
       addresses these limitations. The git  diff  format  is  not  produced  by
       default  because a few widespread tools still do not understand this for&#8208;
       mat.

       This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial  repository  (e.g.
       with  hg export), you should be careful about things like file copies and
       renames or other things mentioned above, because when applying a standard
       diff  to  a  different repository, this extra information is lost. Mercu&#8208;
       rial&apos;s internal operations (like push and pull) are not affected by this,
       because they use an internal binary format for communicating changes.

       To  make  Mercurial  produce  the git extended diff format, use the --git
       option available for many commands, or set &apos;git =  True&apos;  in  the  [diff]
       section  of  your  configuration file. You do not need to set this option
       when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       HG     Path to the &apos;hg&apos; executable,  automatically  passed  when  running
              hooks,  extensions  or  external tools. If unset or empty, this is
              the hg executable&apos;s name if it&apos;s frozen, or  an  executable  named
              &apos;hg&apos; (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
              Windows) is searched.

       HGEDITOR
              This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.

              (deprecated, use configuration file)

       HGENCODING
              This overrides the default locale setting detected  by  Mercurial.
              This  setting is used to convert data including usernames, change&#8208;
              set descriptions, tag names, and branches.  This  setting  can  be
              overridden with the --encoding command-line option.

       HGENCODINGMODE
              This  sets  Mercurial&apos;s  behavior  for handling unknown characters
              while transcoding user  input.  The  default  is  &quot;strict&quot;,  which
              causes  Mercurial to abort if it can&apos;t map a character. Other set&#8208;
              tings include &quot;replace&quot;, which replaces  unknown  characters,  and
              &quot;ignore&quot;,  which  drops  them. This setting can be overridden with
              the --encodingmode command-line option.

       HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS
              This  sets  Mercurial&apos;s  behavior  for  handling  characters  with
              &quot;ambiguous&quot;  widths like accented Latin characters with East Asian
              fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters are nar&#8208;
              row,  set this variable to &quot;wide&quot; if such characters cause format&#8208;
              ting problems.

       HGMERGE
              An executable to use for resolving merge  conflicts.  The  program
              will  be  executed  with three arguments: local file, remote file,
              ancestor file.

              (deprecated, use configuration file)

       HGRCPATH
              A list of files or directories to search for configuration  files.
              Item  separator is &quot;:&quot; on Unix, &quot;;&quot; on Windows. If HGRCPATH is not
              set, platform default search path is  used.  If  empty,  only  the
              .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.

              For each element in HGRCPATH:

              &#183; if it&apos;s a directory, all files ending with .rc are added

              &#183; otherwise, the file itself will be added

       HGPLAIN
              When  set,  this  disables  any  configuration settings that might
              change  Mercurial&apos;s  default  output.  This   includes   encoding,
              defaults,  verbose  mode,  debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
              localization. This can be useful when scripting against  Mercurial
              in the face of existing user configuration.

              Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment vari&#8208;
              ables are not overridden.

       HGPLAINEXCEPT
              This is a  comma-separated  list  of  features  to  preserve  when
              HGPLAIN  is enabled. Currently the only value supported is &quot;i18n&quot;,
              which preserves internationalization in plain mode.

              Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything  (even  an  empty  string)  will
              enable plain mode.

       HGUSER This  is  the  string  used as the author of a commit. If not set,
              available values will be considered in this order:

              &#183; HGUSER (deprecated)

              &#183; configuration files from the HGRCPATH

              &#183; EMAIL

              &#183; interactive prompt

              &#183; LOGNAME (with @hostname appended)

              (deprecated, use configuration file)

       EMAIL  May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       LOGNAME
              May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       VISUAL This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.

       EDITOR Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor  for  a
              user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The edi&#8208;
              tor it uses is determined by looking at the environment  variables
              HGEDITOR,  VISUAL  and  EDITOR, in that order. The first non-empty
              one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the  editor  defaults  to
              &apos;sensible-editor&apos;.

       PYTHONPATH
              This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
              set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES
       Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use  of  exten&#8208;
       sions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to existing commands,
       change the default behavior of commands, or implement hooks.

       Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:  they  can
       increase  startup  overhead;  they  may be meant for advanced usage only;
       they may provide potentially dangerous abilities  (such  as  letting  you
       destroy  or  modify  history); they might not be ready for prime time; or
       they may alter some usual behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is thus up  to
       the user to activate extensions as needed.

       To  enable  the  &quot;foo&quot; extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the
       Python search path, create an entry for it in  your  configuration  file,
       like this:

       [extensions]
       foo =

       You may also specify the full path to an extension:

       [extensions]
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

       To  explicitly  disable  an  extension enabled in a configuration file of
       broader scope, prepend its path with !:

       [extensions]
       # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
       bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
       # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
       baz = !

       disabled extensions:

SPECIFYING FILE SETS
       Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of files.

       Like other file patterns, this pattern type is  indicated  by  a  prefix,
       &apos;set:&apos;.  The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by
       infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

       Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with  single  or
       double     quotes    if    they    contain    characters    outside    of
       [.*{}[]?/\_a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff] or if they match  one  of  the  predefined
       predicates.  This generally applies to file patterns other than globs and
       arguments for predicates.

       Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers  by  escaping  them,
       e.g.,  \n  is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being inter&#8208;
       preted, strings can be prefixed with r, e.g. r&apos;...&apos;.

       There is a single prefix operator:

       not x

              Files not in x. Short form is ! x.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       x and y

              The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is x &amp; y.

       x or y

              The union of files in x and y. There  are  two  alternative  short
              forms: x | y and x + y.

       x - y

              Files in x but not in y.

       The following predicates are supported:

       added()

              File that is added according to status.

       binary()

              File that appears to be binary (contains NUL bytes).

       clean()

              File that is clean according to status.

       copied()

              File that is recorded as being copied.

       deleted()

              File that is deleted according to status.

       encoding(name)

              File  can  be successfully decoded with the given character encod&#8208;
              ing. May not be useful for encodings other than ASCII and UTF-8.

       exec()

              File that is marked as executable.

       grep(regex)

              File contains the given regular expression.

       hgignore()

              File that matches the active .hgignore pattern.

       ignored()

              File that is ignored according to status. These files will only be
              considered if this predicate is used.

       modified()

              File that is modified according to status.

       removed()

              File that is removed according to status.

       resolved()

              File that is marked resolved according to the resolve state.

       size(expression)

              File size matches the given expression. Examples:

              &#183; 1k (files from 1024 to 2047 bytes)

              &#183; &lt; 20k (files less than 20480 bytes)

              &#183; &gt;= .5MB (files at least 524288 bytes)

              &#183; 4k - 1MB (files from 4096 bytes to 1048576 bytes)

       subrepo([pattern])

              Subrepositories whose paths match the given pattern.

       symlink()

              File that is marked as a symlink.

       unknown()

              File that is unknown according to status. These files will only be
              considered if this predicate is used.

       unresolved()

              File that is marked unresolved according to the resolve state.

       Some sample queries:

       &#183; Show status of files that appear to be binary in the working directory:

         hg status -A &quot;set:binary()&quot;

       &#183; Forget files that are in .hgignore but are already tracked:

         hg forget &quot;set:hgignore() and not ignored()&quot;

       &#183; Find text files that contain a string:

         hg locate &quot;set:grep(magic) and not binary()&quot;

       &#183; Find C files in a non-standard encoding:

         hg locate &quot;set:**.c and not encoding(&apos;UTF-8&apos;)&quot;
&#12;       &#183; Revert copies of large binary files:

         hg revert &quot;set:copied() and binary() and size(&apos;&gt;1M&apos;)&quot;

       &#183; Remove files listed in foo.lst that contain the letter a or b:

         hg remove &quot;set: &apos;listfile:foo.lst&apos; and (**a* or **b*)&quot;

       See also hg help patterns.

GLOSSARY
       Ancestor
              Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain  of  parent
              changesets  from  a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
              of a changeset can be defined by two properties:  a  parent  of  a
              changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an ances&#8208;
              tor. See also: &apos;Descendant&apos;.

       Bookmark
              Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move  when  commit&#8208;
              ting. They are similar to tags in that it is possible to use book&#8208;
              mark names in all places where Mercurial expects a  changeset  ID,
              e.g.,  with  hg update. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along when you
              make a commit.

              Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks are local,
              unless  they are explicitly pushed or pulled between repositories.
              Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow you to collaborate with others
              on a branch without creating a named branch.

       Branch (Noun)  A child changeset that has been created from a parent that
              is not a head.  These  are  known  as  topological  branches,  see
              &apos;Branch,  topological&apos;.  If  a  topological  branch  is  named, it
              becomes a named branch. If a topological branch is not  named,  it
              becomes  an anonymous branch. See &apos;Branch, anonymous&apos; and &apos;Branch,
              named&apos;.

              Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed  to
              a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these oper&#8208;
              ations. Note that the term branch can also be used  informally  to
              describe  a  development  process  in which certain development is
              done independently of other development. This  is  sometimes  done
              explicitly  with  a named branch, but it can also be done locally,
              using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.

              Example: &quot;The experimental branch&quot;.

              (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which  results  in
              its parent having more than one child.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;m going to branch at X&quot;.

       Branch, anonymous
              Every  time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is
              not a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anony&#8208;
              mous branch is created.

       Branch, closed
              A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.

       Branch, default
              The  branch  assigned  to  a changeset when no name has previously
              been assigned.

       Branch head
              See &apos;Head, branch&apos;.

       Branch, inactive
              If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered to be
              inactive. As an example, a feature branch becomes inactive when it
              is merged into the default branch. The hg  branches command  shows
              inactive  branches  by  default, though they can be hidden with hg
              branches --active.

              NOTE: this concept is  deprecated  because  it  is  too  implicit.
              Branches   should   now  be  explicitly  closed  using  hg  commit
              --close-branch when they are no longer needed.

       Branch, named
              A collection of changesets which have the  same  branch  name.  By
              default,  children  of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
              same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a differ&#8208;
              ent  branch.  See  hg  help branch, hg help branches and hg commit
              --close-branch for more information on managing branches.

              Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace,  dividing
              the  collection  of changesets that comprise the repository into a
              collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not  necessarily
              a  topological  branch.  If a new named branch is created from the
              head of another named branch, or the default branch, but  no  fur&#8208;
              ther  changesets are added to that previous branch, then that pre&#8208;
              vious branch will be a branch in name only.

       Branch tip
              See &apos;Tip, branch&apos;.

       Branch, topological
              Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that  is
              not  a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological
              branch is named, it becomes  a  named  branch.  If  a  topological
              branch  is  not  named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the cur&#8208;
              rent, possibly default, branch.

       Changelog
              A record of the changesets in the order in which they  were  added
              to  the  repository.  This  includes details such as changeset id,
              author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.

       Changeset
              A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.

       Changeset, child
              The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is
              a  child  of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a
              changeset may have.

       Changeset id
              A SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be  rep&#8208;
              resented  as  either  a  &quot;long&quot;  40 hexadecimal digit string, or a
              &quot;short&quot; 12 hexadecimal digit string.

       Changeset, merge
              A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is  commit&#8208;
              ted.

       Changeset, parent
              A  revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a
              parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node  imme&#8208;
              diately  precedes  C  in the DAG. Changesets have at most two par&#8208;
              ents.

       Checkout
              (Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific revision.
              This  use  should probably be avoided where possible, as changeset
              is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;m using checkout X.&quot;

              (Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See
              hg help update.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;m going to check out changeset X.&quot;

       Child changeset
              See &apos;Changeset, child&apos;.

       Close changeset
              See &apos;Head, closed branch&apos;

       Closed branch
              See &apos;Branch, closed&apos;.

       Clone  (Noun)  An  entire  or  partial  copy of a repository. The partial
              clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.

              Example: &quot;Is your clone up to date?&quot;.

              (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using hg clone.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;m going to clone the repository&quot;.

       Closed branch head
              See &apos;Head, closed branch&apos;.
&#12;       Commit (Noun) A synonym for changeset.

              Example: &quot;Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?&quot;

              (Verb) The act of recording changes to a  repository.  When  files
              are  committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the differ&#8208;
              ences between the committed files and their parent changeset, cre&#8208;
              ating a new changeset in the repository.

              Example: &quot;You should commit those changes now.&quot;

       Cset   A common abbreviation of the term changeset.

       DAG    The repository of changesets of a distributed version control sys&#8208;
              tem (DVCS) can be described as a  directed  acyclic  graph  (DAG),
              consisting  of  nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to change&#8208;
              sets and edges imply a parent -&gt; child relation. This graph can be
              visualized  by graphical tools such as hg glog (graphlog). In Mer&#8208;
              curial, the DAG is limited by the requirement for children to have
              at most two parents.

       Default branch
              See &apos;Branch, default&apos;.

       Descendant
              Any  changeset  that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
              from a given changeset.  More  precisely,  the  descendants  of  a
              changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a change&#8208;
              set is a descendant, and the child of a descendant  is  a  descen&#8208;
              dant. See also: &apos;Ancestor&apos;.

       Diff   (Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files
              in two changesets or a changeset and the  current  working  direc&#8208;
              tory.  The  difference  is  usually represented in a standard form
              called a &quot;diff&quot; or &quot;patch&quot;. The &quot;git diff&quot; format is used when the
              changes  include  copies,  renames, or changes to file attributes,
              none of which can be represented/handled  by  classic  &quot;diff&quot;  and
              &quot;patch&quot;.

              Example: &quot;Did you see my correction in the diff?&quot;

              (Verb)  Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or
              patch.

              Example: &quot;If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean.&quot;

       Directory, working
              The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by
              Mercurial,  that  will be recorded in the next commit. The working
              directory initially corresponds to the  snapshot  at  an  existing
              changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See &apos;Par&#8208;
              ent, working directory&apos;. The state may be modified by  changes  to
              the  files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository meta&#8208;
              data exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.

       Draft  Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with publishing
              repositories  and  may thus be safely changed by history-modifying
              extensions. See hg help phases.

       Graph  See DAG and hg help graphlog.

       Head   The term &apos;head&apos; may be used to refer to both a branch  head  or  a
              repository  head, depending on the context. See &apos;Head, branch&apos; and
              &apos;Head, repository&apos; for specific definitions.

              Heads are where development generally  takes  place  and  are  the
              usual targets for update and merge operations.

       Head, branch
              A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.

       Head, closed branch
              A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed
              head is no longer listed by  hg  heads.  A  branch  is  considered
              closed  when  all  its  heads  are  closed and consequently is not
              listed by hg branches.

              Closed heads can be re-opened by committing new changeset  as  the
              child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.

       Head, repository
              A topological head which has not been closed.
&#12;       Head, topological
              A changeset with no children in the repository.

       History, immutable
              Once  committed,  changesets  cannot be altered.  Extensions which
              appear to change  history  actually  create  new  changesets  that
              replace  existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing
              so in public repositories can result in old changesets being rein&#8208;
              troduced to the repository.

       History, rewriting
              The  changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions
              to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in  such
              a way as to preserve changeset contents.

       Immutable history
              See &apos;History, immutable&apos;.

       Merge changeset
              See &apos;Changeset, merge&apos;.

       Manifest
              Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are
              tracked by the changeset.

       Merge  Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update
              to  a  changeset  and  then merge another changeset, you bring the
              history of the latter changeset into your working directory.  Once
              conflicts  are  resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed
              as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.

       Named branch
              See &apos;Branch, named&apos;.

       Null changeset
              The empty changeset. It is the parent state  of  newly-initialized
              repositories  and repositories with no checked out revision. It is
              thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when
              merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias &apos;null&apos;
              or by the changeset ID &apos;000000000000&apos;.

       Parent See &apos;Changeset, parent&apos;.

       Parent changeset
              See &apos;Changeset, parent&apos;.

       Parent, working directory
              The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which  is
              the  child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted
              merge) shown by hg parents. This is changed with hg update.  Other
              commands to see the working directory parent are hg summary and hg
              id. Can be specified by the alias &quot;.&quot;.

       Patch  (Noun) The product of a diff operation.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;ve sent you my patch.&quot;

              (Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one  change&#8208;
              set into another.

              Example: &quot;You will need to patch that revision.&quot;

       Phase  A  per-changeset  state  tracking  how  the  changeset has been or
              should be shared. See hg help phases.

       Public Changesets in the public phase have been  shared  with  publishing
              repositories  and  are therefore considered immutable. See hg help
              phases.

       Pull   An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which  are
              not in the local repository are brought into the local repository.
              Note that this operation without special  arguments  only  updates
              the repository, it does not update the files in the working direc&#8208;
              tory. See hg help pull.

       Push   An operation in which changesets in a local repository  which  are
              not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note
              that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed
              locally  to  the  remote  repository.  Uncommitted changes are not
              sent. See hg help push.

       Repository
              The metadata describing all recorded states  of  a  collection  of
              files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A repos&#8208;
              itory is usually (but not always) found in the .hg subdirectory of
              a  working  directory.  Any  recorded  state  can  be recreated by
              &quot;updating&quot; a working directory to a specific changeset.

       Repository head
              See &apos;Head, repository&apos;.

       Revision
              A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions
              can be updated to by using hg update.  See also &apos;Revision number&apos;;
              See also &apos;Changeset&apos;.

       Revision number
              This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific reposi&#8208;
              tory.  It represents the order in which changesets were added to a
              repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that  the  revi&#8208;
              sion  number  may  be  different in each clone of a repository. To
              identify  changesets  uniquely  between  different   clones,   see
              &apos;Changeset id&apos;.

       Revlog History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form of delta
              encoding, with occasional full revision of data followed by  delta
              of  each successive revision. It includes data and an index point&#8208;
              ing to the data.

       Rewriting history
              See &apos;History, rewriting&apos;.

       Root   A changeset that has only the null changeset as its  parent.  Most
              repositories have only a single root changeset.

       Secret Changesets  in  the secret phase may not be shared via push, pull,
              or clone. See hg help phases.

       Tag    An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used in  all
              places  where  Mercurial  expects  a  changeset  ID, e.g., with hg
              update. The creation of a tag is stored in the  history  and  will
              thus automatically be shared with other using push and pull.

       Tip    The  changeset with the highest revision number. It is the change&#8208;
              set most recently added in a repository.

       Tip, branch
              The head of a given branch with the highest revision number.  When
              a  branch  name is used as a revision identifier, it refers to the
              branch tip. See also &apos;Branch, head&apos;. Note  that  because  revision
              numbers  may  be  different  in  different  repository clones, the
              branch tip may be different in different cloned repositories.

       Update (Noun) Another synonym of changeset.

              Example: &quot;I&apos;ve pushed an update&quot;.

              (Verb) This term is usually used to describe updating the state of
              the working directory to that of a specific changeset. See hg help
              update.

              Example: &quot;You should update&quot;.

       Working directory
              See &apos;Directory, working&apos;.

       Working directory parent
              See &apos;Parent, working directory&apos;.

SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES
SYNOPSIS
       The Mercurial system uses a file called .hgignore in the  root  directory
       of  a  repository to control its behavior when it searches for files that
       it is not currently tracking.

DESCRIPTION
       The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain  files
       that  should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup files cre&#8208;
       ated by editors and build products created by compilers.  These files can
       be ignored by listing them in a .hgignore file in the root of the working
       directory. The .hgignore file must be created manually. It  is  typically
       put  under  version control, so that the settings will propagate to other
       repositories with push and pull.

       An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository  root
       directory,  or  any prefix path of that path, is matched against any pat&#8208;
       tern in .hgignore.
&#12;       For example, say we have an untracked file, file.c, at a/b/file.c  inside
       our  repository. Mercurial will ignore file.c if any pattern in .hgignore
       matches a/b/file.c, a/b or a.

       In addition, a Mercurial  configuration  file  can  reference  a  set  of
       per-user  or global ignore files. See the ignore configuration key on the
       [ui] section of hg help config for details  of  how  to  configure  these
       files.

       To  control  Mercurial&apos;s handling of files that it manages, many commands
       support the -I and -X options; see hg help &lt;command&gt; and hg help patterns
       for details.

SYNTAX
       An  ignore  file  is  a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns,
       with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The  #  character  is
       treated  as  a  comment  character,  and the \ character is treated as an
       escape character.

       Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax  used  is
       Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where NAME is one of the following:

       regexp

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       glob

              Shell-style glob.

       The  chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that follow,
       until another syntax is selected.

       Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of the
       form  *.c  will  match a file ending in .c in any directory, and a regexp
       pattern of the form \.c$ will do the same.  To  root  a  regexp  pattern,
       start it with ^.

       Note   Patterns  specified  in  other  than  .hgignore are always rooted.
              Please see hg help patterns for details.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/

CONFIGURING HGWEB
       Mercurial&apos;s internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single reposi&#8208;
       tory,  or  a collection of them. In the latter case, a special configura&#8208;
       tion file can be used to specify the repository paths to use  and  global
       web configuration options.

       This  file  uses  the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration files,
       but only the following sections are recognized:

          &#183; web

          &#183; paths

          &#183; collections

       The web section can specify all the settings described in the web section
       of the hgrc(5) documentation. See hg help config for information on where
       to find the manual page.

       The paths section provides mappings of physical repository paths to  vir&#8208;
       tual ones. For instance:

       [paths]
       projects/a = /foo/bar
       projects/b = /baz/quux
       web/root = /real/root/*
       / = /real/root2/*
       virtual/root2 = /real/root2/**

       &#183; The  first  two  entries make two repositories in different directories
         appear under the same directory in the web interface

       &#183; The third entry maps every Mercurial repository found  in  &apos;/real/root&apos;
         into  &apos;web/root&apos;.  This format is preferred over the [collections] one,
         since using absolute paths as configuration keys is  not  supported  on
         every platform (especially on Windows).

       &#183; The  fourth  entry  is  a  special  case  mapping  all  repositories in
         &apos;/real/root2&apos; in the root of the virtual directory.

       &#183; The fifth entry recursively finds all repositories under the real root,
         and maps their relative paths under the virtual root.

       The  collections section provides mappings of trees of physical reposito&#8208;
       ries paths to virtual ones, though the paths  syntax  is  generally  pre&#8208;
       ferred. For instance:

       [collections]
       /foo = /foo

       Here,  the  left  side will be stripped off all repositories found in the
       right side. Thus /foo/bar and foo/quux/baz will  be  listed  as  bar  and
       quux/baz respectively.

MERGE TOOLS
       To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.

       A  merge  tool  combines  two  different versions of a file into a merged
       file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common  ances&#8208;
       tor  of  the two file versions, so they can determine the changes made on
       both branches.

       Merge tools are used both for hg resolve, hg merge, hg update, hg backout
       and in several extensions.

       Usually,  the  merge  tool  tries to automatically reconcile the files by
       combining all non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in the two
       different  evolutions  of  the  same initial base file. Furthermore, some
       interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve conflicting
       merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some conflict markers.
       Mercurial does not include any interactive merge programs but  relies  on
       external tools for that.

   Available merge tools
       External   merge  tools  and  their  properties  are  configured  in  the
       merge-tools configuration section - see hgrc(5) - but they can often just
       be named by their executable.

       A  merge  tool  is generally usable if its executable can be found on the
       system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if  it  is
       an  absolute or relative executable path or the name of an application in
       the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be able to handle  the
       merge  if it can handle symlinks if the file is a symlink, if it can han&#8208;
       dle binary files if the file is binary, and if a GUI is available if  the
       tool requires a GUI.

       There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal merge
       tools are:

       internal:dump

              Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the  con&#8208;
              tents  of  local,  other and base. These files can then be used to
              perform a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named a.txt,
              these files will accordingly be named a.txt.local, a.txt.other and
              a.txt.base and they will be placed in the same directory as a.txt.

       internal:fail

              Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified  on  both
              branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be
              used to resolve these conflicts.

       internal:local

              Uses the local version of files as the merged version.
&#12;       internal:merge

              Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merg&#8208;
              ing files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave mark&#8208;
              ers in the partially merged file.

       internal:other

              Uses the other version of files as the merged version.

       internal:prompt

              Asks the user which of the local or the other version to  keep  as
              the merged version.

       Internal  tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will by
       default not handle symlinks or binary files.

   Choosing a merge tool
       Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:

       1. If a tool has been specified  with  the  --tool  option  to  merge  or
          resolve,  it  is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge-tools
          configuration, its configuration is used. Otherwise the specified tool
          must be executable by the shell.

       2. If  the HGMERGE environment variable is present, its value is used and
          must be executable by the shell.

       3. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of  the  patterns
          in  the  merge-patterns  configuration section, the first usable merge
          tool corresponding to a matching pattern is used. Here,  binary  capa&#8208;
          bilities of the merge tool are not considered.

       4. If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is not the
          name of a configured tool, the specified value is  used  and  must  be
          executable  by  the  shell.  Otherwise the named tool is used if it is
          usable.

       5. If any usable merge tools are present in the merge-tools configuration
          section, the one with the highest priority is used.

       6. If  a  program  named hgmerge can be found on the system, it is used -
          but it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.

       7. If the file to be merged is not binary and  is  not  a  symlink,  then
          internal:merge is used.

       8. The merge of the file fails and must be resolved before commit.

       Note   After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt
              to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first.  Only  if
              it  doesn&apos;t  succeed because of conflicting changes Mercurial will
              actually execute the merge program.  Whether  to  use  the  simple
              merge algorithm first can be controlled by the premerge setting of
              the merge tool. Premerge is enabled by default unless the file  is
              binary or a symlink.

       See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the config&#8208;
       uration of merge tools.

SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS
       When Mercurial accepts more than one  revision,  they  may  be  specified
       individually,  or provided as a topologically continuous range, separated
       by the &quot;:&quot; character.

       The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN  and  END  are
       revision  identifiers.  Both  BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not
       specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified,  it
       defaults to the tip. The range &quot;:&quot; thus means &quot;all revisions&quot;.

       If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.

       A  range  acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5 gives
       3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.

FILE NAME PATTERNS
       Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files  at
       a time.

       By  default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended glob pat&#8208;
       terns.

       Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

       Note   Patterns specified in .hgignore are not  rooted.   Please  see  hg
              help hgignore for details.

       To  use  a  plain  path  name without any pattern matching, start it with
       path:. These path names must completely match  starting  at  the  current
       repository root.

       To use an extended glob, start a name with glob:. Globs are rooted at the
       current directory; a glob such as *.c will only match files in  the  cur&#8208;
       rent directory ending with .c.

       The  supported  glob  syntax extensions are ** to match any string across
       path separators and {a,b} to mean &quot;a or b&quot;.

       To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with  re:.   Regexp
       pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.

       To read name patterns from a file, use listfile: or listfile0:.  The lat&#8208;
       ter expects null delimited patterns while the former expects line  feeds.
       Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file pattern.

       Plain examples:

       path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                      of the repository
       path:path:name a file or directory named &quot;path:name&quot;

       Glob examples:

       glob:*.c       any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in the current directory
       *.c            any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in the current directory
       **.c           any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in any subdirectory of the
                      current directory including itself.
       foo/*.c        any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in the directory foo
       foo/**.c       any name ending in &quot;.c&quot; in any subdirectory of foo
                      including itself.

       Regexp examples:

       re:.*\.c$      any name ending in &quot;.c&quot;, anywhere in the repository

       File examples:

       listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
       listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters

       See also hg help filesets.

WORKING WITH PHASES
WHAT ARE PHASES?
       Phases  are a system for tracking which changesets have been or should be
       shared. This helps prevent common mistakes when  modifying  history  (for
       instance, with the mq or rebase extensions).

       Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:

          &#183; public : changeset is visible on a public server

          &#183; draft : changeset is not yet published

          &#183; secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned

       These  phases  are ordered (public &lt; draft &lt; secret) and no changeset can
       be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For instance, if a  changeset  is
       public,  all  its  ancestors  are  also  public. Lastly, changeset phases
       should only be changed towards the public phase.

HOW ARE PHASES MANAGED?
       For the most part,  phases  should  work  transparently.  By  default,  a
       changeset  is  created  in  the  draft phase and is moved into the public
       phase when it is pushed to another repository.

       Once changesets become public, extensions like mq and rebase will  refuse
       to  operate on them to prevent creating duplicate changesets.  Phases can
       also be manually manipulated with the hg phase command if needed. See  hg
       help -v phase for examples.

PHASES AND SERVERS
       Normally, all servers are publishing by default. This means:

       - all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
       public on the client
&#12;       - all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
       client and server

       - secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned

       Note   Pulling  a  draft changeset from a publishing server does not mark
              it as public on the server side due to  the  read-only  nature  of
              pull.

       Sometimes  it  may  be desirable to push and pull changesets in the draft
       phase to share unfinished work. This can be done by setting a  repository
       to disable publishing in its configuration file:

       [phases]
       publish = False

       See hg help config for more information on config files.

       Note   Servers  running  older  versions of Mercurial are treated as pub&#8208;
              lishing.

EXAMPLES
          &#183; list changesets in draft or secret phase:

            hg log -r &quot;not public()&quot;

          &#183; change all secret changesets to draft:

            hg phase --draft &quot;secret()&quot;

          &#183; forcibly move the current changeset and descendants from  public  to
            draft:

            hg phase --force --draft .

          &#183; show a list of changeset revision and phase:

            hg log --template &quot;{rev} {phase}\n&quot;

          &#183; resynchronize draft changesets relative to a remote repository:

            hg phase -fd &apos;outgoing(URL)&apos;

       See hg help phase for more information on manually manipulating phases.

SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS
       Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.

       A  plain  integer  is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
       treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip,  -2
       denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.

       A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision identifier.

       A  hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a unique
       revision identifier and is referred to  as  a  short-form  identifier.  A
       short-form  identifier  is  only valid if it is the prefix of exactly one
       full-length identifier.

       Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is a sym&#8208;
       bolic  name  associated with a revision identifier. A branch name denotes
       the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch names must  not  con&#8208;
       tain the &quot;:&quot; character.

       The  reserved name &quot;tip&quot; is a special tag that always identifies the most
       recent revision.

       The reserved name &quot;null&quot; indicates the null revision. This is  the  revi&#8208;
       sion of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.

       The reserved name &quot;.&quot; indicates the working directory parent. If no work&#8208;
       ing directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an uncommitted
       merge is in progress, &quot;.&quot; is the revision of the first parent.

SPECIFYING REVISION SETS
       Mercurial  supports  a  functional  language for selecting a set of revi&#8208;
       sions.

       The language supports a number of predicates which are  joined  by  infix
       operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

       Identifiers  such  as branch names may need quoting with single or double
       quotes if they contain characters like - or if they match one of the pre&#8208;
       defined predicates.

       Special  characters  can  be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
       e.g., \n is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from  being  inter&#8208;
       preted, strings can be prefixed with r, e.g. r&apos;...&apos;.

       There is a single prefix operator:

       not x

              Changesets not in x. Short form is ! x.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       x::y

              A  DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and
              ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If  the  first  end&#8208;
              point is left out, this is equivalent to ancestors(y), if the sec&#8208;
              ond is left out it is equivalent to descendants(x).

              An alternative syntax is x..y.

       x:y

              All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both  inclu&#8208;
              sive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and tip.

       x and y

              The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is x &amp; y.

       x or y

              The  union  of  changesets  in  x and y. There are two alternative
              short forms: x | y and x + y.

       x - y

              Changesets in x but not in y.

       x^n

              The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.  For n == 0, x; for n ==  1,
              the  first  parent  of each changeset in x; for n == 2, the second
              parent of changeset in x.

       x~n

              The nth first ancestor of x; x~0 is x; x~3 is x^^^.

       There is a single postfix operator:

       x^

              Equivalent to x^1, the first parent of each changeset in x.

       The following predicates are supported:

       adds(pattern)

              Changesets that add a file matching pattern.

       all()

              All changesets, the same as 0:tip.

       ancestor(single, single)

              Greatest common ancestor of the two changesets.

       ancestors(set)

              Changesets that are ancestors of a changeset in set.

       author(string)

              Alias for user(string).

       bisect(string)

              Changesets marked in the specified bisect status:

              &#183; good, bad, skip: csets explicitly marked as good/bad/skip
&#12;              &#183; goods, bads      : csets topologicaly good/bad

              &#183; range              : csets taking part in the bisection

              &#183; pruned             : csets that are goods, bads or skipped

              &#183; untested           : csets whose fate is yet unknown

              &#183; ignored            : csets ignored due to DAG topology

       bookmark([name])

              The named bookmark or all bookmarks.

       branch(string or set)

              All changesets belonging to the given branch or  the  branches  of
              the given changesets.

       children(set)

              Child changesets of changesets in set.

       closed()

              Changeset is closed.

       contains(pattern)

              Revision  contains  a  file matching pattern. See hg help patterns
              for information about file patterns.

       date(interval)

              Changesets within the interval, see hg help dates.

       desc(string)

              Search commit message for string. The match is case-insensitive.

       descendants(set)

              Changesets which are descendants of changesets in set.

       draft()

              Changeset in draft phase.

       file(pattern)

              Changesets affecting files matched by pattern.

       filelog(pattern)

              Changesets connected to the specified filelog.

       first(set, [n])

              An alias for limit().

       follow([file])

              An alias for ::. (ancestors of the working copy&apos;s  first  parent).
              If  a filename is specified, the history of the given file is fol&#8208;
              lowed, including copies.

       grep(regex)

              Like keyword(string) but accepts  a  regex.  Use  grep(r&apos;...&apos;)  to
              ensure  special  escape  characters  are handled correctly. Unlike
              keyword(string), the match is case-sensitive.

       head()

              Changeset is a named branch head.

       heads(set)

              Members of set with no children in set.

       id(string)

              Revision non-ambiguously specified by the given hex string prefix.
&#12;       keyword(string)

              Search commit message, user name, and names of changed  files  for
              string. The match is case-insensitive.

       last(set, [n])

              Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.

       limit(set, [n])

              First n members of set, defaulting to 1.

       matching(revision [, field])

              Changesets  in which a given set of fields match the set of fields
              in the selected revision or set.

              To match more than one field pass the list of fields to match sep&#8208;
              arated by spaces (e.g. author description).

              Valid  fields  are  most  regular revision fields and some special
              fields.

              Regular revision fields are  description,  author,  branch,  date,
              files,  phase,  parents,  substate and user.  Note that author and
              user are synonyms.

              Special fields are summary and metadata: summary matches the first
              line  of  the  description.   metadata  is  equivalent to matching
              description user date (i.e. it matches the main metadata fields).

              metadata is the default field which is used  when  no  fields  are
              specified. You can match more than one field at a time.

       max(set)

              Changeset with highest revision number in set.

       merge()

              Changeset is a merge changeset.

       min(set)

              Changeset with lowest revision number in set.

       modifies(pattern)

              Changesets modifying files matched by pattern.

       outgoing([path])

              Changesets  not  found in the specified destination repository, or
              the default push location.

       p1([set])

              First parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

       p2([set])

              Second parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

       parents([set])

              The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or  the  working
              directory.

       present(set)

              An  empty  set, if any revision in set isn&apos;t found; otherwise, all
              revisions in set.

              If any of specified revisions is not present in the local  reposi&#8208;
              tory, the query is normally aborted. But this predicate allows the
              query to continue even in such cases.

       public()

              Changeset in public phase.

       remote([id [,path]])

              Local revision that corresponds  to  the  given  identifier  in  a
              remote  repository, if present. Here, the &apos;.&apos; identifier is a syn&#8208;
              onym for the current local branch.

       removes(pattern)

              Changesets which remove files matching pattern.

       rev(number)

              Revision with the given numeric identifier.

       reverse(set)

              Reverse order of set.

       roots(set)

              Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.

       secret()

              Changeset in secret phase.

       sort(set[, [-]key...])

              Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending,  specify  a
              key as -key to sort in descending order.

              The keys can be:

              &#183; rev for the revision number,

              &#183; branch for the branch name,

              &#183; desc for the commit message (description),

              &#183; user for user name (author can be used as an alias),

              &#183; date for the commit date

       tag([name])

              The  specified  tag by name, or all tagged revisions if no name is
              given.

       user(string)

              User name contains string. The match is case-insensitive.

       New predicates (known as &quot;aliases&quot;) can be defined, using any combination
       of existing predicates or other aliases. An alias definition looks like:

       &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;definition&gt;

       in  the  revsetalias section of a Mercurial configuration file. Arguments
       of the form $1, $2, etc. are substituted from the alias into the  defini&#8208;
       tion.

       For example,

       [revsetalias]
       h = heads()
       d($1) = sort($1, date)
       rs($1, $2) = reverse(sort($1, $2))

       defines three aliases, h, d, and rs. rs(0:tip, author) is exactly equiva&#8208;
       lent to reverse(sort(0:tip, author)).

       Command line equivalents for hg log:

       -f    -&gt;  ::.
       -d x  -&gt;  date(x)
       -k x  -&gt;  keyword(x)
       -m    -&gt;  merge()
       -u x  -&gt;  user(x)
       -b x  -&gt;  branch(x)
       -P x  -&gt;  !::x
       -l x  -&gt;  limit(expr, x)

       Some sample queries:

       &#183; Changesets on the default branch:

         hg log -r &quot;branch(default)&quot;
&#12;       &#183; Changesets on the default branch since tag 1.5 (excluding merges):

         hg log -r &quot;branch(default) and 1.5:: and not merge()&quot;

       &#183; Open branch heads:

         hg log -r &quot;head() and not closed()&quot;

       &#183; Changesets between tags  1.3  and  1.5  mentioning  &quot;bug&quot;  that  affect
         hgext/*:

         hg log -r &quot;1.3::1.5 and keyword(bug) and file(&apos;hgext/*&apos;)&quot;

       &#183; Changesets committed in May 2008, sorted by user:

         hg log -r &quot;sort(date(&apos;May 2008&apos;), user)&quot;

       &#183; Changesets  mentioning  &quot;bug&quot;  or  &quot;issue&quot;  that  are  not  in a tagged
         release:

         hg log -r &quot;(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tagged())&quot;

SUBREPOSITORIES
       Subrepositories let you nest external repositories  or  projects  into  a
       parent  Mercurial  repository,  and  make  commands  operate on them as a
       group.

       Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion  subreposito&#8208;
       ries.

       Subrepositories are made of three components:

       1. Nested  repository  checkouts.  They can appear anywhere in the parent
          working directory.

       2. Nested repository references. They are defined in .hgsub, which should
          be  placed  in  the root of working directory, and tell where the sub&#8208;
          repository checkouts come from. Mercurial subrepositories  are  refer&#8208;
          enced like:

             path/to/nested = https://example.com/nested/repo/path

          Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:

             path/to/nested       =      [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
             path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path

          where path/to/nested is the checkout location relatively to the parent
          Mercurial root, and https://example.com/nested/repo/path is the source
          repository path. The source can also reference a filesystem path.

          Note that .hgsub does not exist by default in Mercurial  repositories,
          you  have  to  create and add it to the parent repository before using
          subrepositories.

       3. Nested repository states. They are defined in  .hgsubstate,  which  is
          placed in the root of working directory, and capture whatever informa&#8208;
          tion is required to restore the subrepositories to the state they were
          committed  in  a  parent repository changeset. Mercurial automatically
          record the nested repositories states when committing  in  the  parent
          repository.

       Note
          The .hgsubstate file should not be edited manually.

ADDING A SUBREPOSITORY
       If  .hgsub does not exist, create it and add it to the parent repository.
       Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it to live in  the
       parent  repository.  Edit  .hgsub  and  add  the  subrepository  entry as
       described above. At this point, the subrepository is tracked and the next
       commit  will record its state in .hgsubstate and bind it to the committed
       changeset.

SYNCHRONIZING A SUBREPOSITORY
       Subrepos do  not  automatically  track  the  latest  changeset  of  their
       sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds with
       the changeset checked out in the top-level changeset. This is so develop&#8208;
       ers  always  get  a  consistent set of compatible code and libraries when
       they update.

       Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out target sub&#8208;
       repo  at the desired revision, test in the top-level repo, then commit in
       the parent repository to record the new combination.

DELETING A SUBREPOSITORY
       To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete  its  refer&#8208;
       ence from .hgsub, then remove its files.

INTERACTION WITH MERCURIAL COMMANDS
       add    add  does  not  recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is speci&#8208;
              fied.  However, if you specify the full path of a file in  a  sub&#8208;
              repo,  it will be added even without -S/--subrepos specified.  Git
              and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       archive
              archive does not recurse in subrepositories  unless  -S/--subrepos
              is specified.

       commit commit  creates  a  consistent snapshot of the state of the entire
              project and its subrepositories. If any subrepositories have  been
              modified,  Mercurial will abort.  Mercurial can be made to instead
              commit all modified subrepositories by  specifying  -S/--subrepos,
              or  setting  &quot;ui.commitsubrepos=True&quot; in a configuration file (see
              hg help config).  After there are no longer any modified subrepos&#8208;
              itories, it records their state and finally commits it in the par&#8208;
              ent repository.

       diff   diff does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos  is  speci&#8208;
              fied.  Changes are displayed as usual, on the subrepositories ele&#8208;
              ments. Git and Subversion subrepositories are  currently  silently
              ignored.

       forget forget currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos.  Git
              and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       incoming
              incoming does not recurse  in  subrepos  unless  -S/--subrepos  is
              specified.   Git  and  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently
              silently ignored.

       outgoing
              outgoing does not recurse  in  subrepos  unless  -S/--subrepos  is
              specified.   Git  and  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently
              silently ignored.

       pull   pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior  to
              running  hg  update.  Listing  and  retrieving all subrepositories
              changes referenced by the parent repository pulled  changesets  is
              expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion case.

       push   Mercurial  will  automatically push all subrepositories first when
              the parent repository is being pushed. This ensures new subreposi&#8208;
              tory  changes are available when referenced by top-level reposito&#8208;
              ries.  Push is a no-op for Subversion subrepositories.

       status status does not recurse into subrepositories unless  -S/--subrepos
              is  specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as regular Mer&#8208;
              curial changes on the subrepository elements. Subversion subrepos&#8208;
              itories are currently silently ignored.

       update update  restores  the  subrepos  in the state they were originally
              committed in target changeset. If the recorded  changeset  is  not
              available  in the current subrepository, Mercurial will pull it in
              first before updating.  This means that updating can require  net&#8208;
              work access when using subrepositories.

REMAPPING SUBREPOSITORIES SOURCES
       A subrepository source location may change during a project life, invali&#8208;
       dating references stored in the parent repository history. To  fix  this,
       rewriting  rules can be defined in parent repository hgrc file or in Mer&#8208;
       curial configuration. See the [subpaths]  section  in  hgrc(5)  for  more
       details.

TEMPLATE USAGE
       Mercurial  allows  you to customize output of commands through templates.
       You can either pass in a template from the command line, via  the  --tem&#8208;
       plate option, or select an existing template-style (--style).

       You  can  customize  output  for  any  &quot;log-like&quot; command: log, outgoing,
       incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.

       Four styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used when  no
       explicit preference is passed), compact, changelog, and xml.  Usage:

       $ hg log -r1 --style changelog

       A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable expansion:

       $ hg log -r1 --template &quot;{node}\n&quot;
       b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746

       Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of keywords
       depends on the exact context of the templater. These keywords are usually
       available for templating a log-like command:

       author String. The unmodified author of the changeset.

       bisect String. The changeset bisection status.

       bookmarks
              List of strings. Any bookmarks associated with the changeset.

       branch String.  The name of the branch on which the changeset was commit&#8208;
              ted.

       branches
              List of strings. The name of the branch on which the changeset was
              committed. Will be empty if the branch name was default.

       children
              List of strings. The children of the changeset.

       date   Date information. The date when the changeset was committed.

       desc   String. The text of the changeset description.

       diffstat
              String. Statistics of changes with the following format: &quot;modified
              files: +added/-removed lines&quot;

       file_adds
              List of strings. Files added by this changeset.

       file_copies
              List of  strings.  Files  copied  in  this  changeset  with  their
              sources.

       file_copies_switch
              List  of  strings.  Like  &quot;file_copies&quot;  but displayed only if the
              --copied switch is set.

       file_dels
              List of strings. Files removed by this changeset.

       file_mods
              List of strings. Files modified by this changeset.

       files  List of strings. All files modified, added,  or  removed  by  this
              changeset.

       latesttag
              String. Most recent global tag in the ancestors of this changeset.

       latesttagdistance
              Integer. Longest path to the latest tag.

       node   String.  The  changeset  identification  hash, as a 40 hexadecimal
              digit string.

       phase  String. The changeset phase name.

       phaseidx
              Integer. The changeset phase index.

       rev    Integer. The repository-local changeset revision number.

       tags   List of strings. Any tags associated with the changeset.

       The &quot;date&quot; keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you want to
       use  a  date  in your output, you can use a filter to process it. Filters
       are functions which return a string based on the input variable. Be  sure
       to  use  the  stringify  filter first when you&apos;re applying a string-input
       filter to a list-like input variable.  You can also use a chain  of  fil&#8208;
       ters to get the desired output:

       $ hg tip --template &quot;{date|isodate}\n&quot;
       2008-08-21 18:22 +0000

       List of filters:

       addbreaks
              Any  text.  Add an XHTML &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; tag before the end of every line

              nent of the path after splitting by the path  separator  (ignoring
              trailing separators). For example, &quot;foo/bar/baz&quot; becomes &quot;baz&quot; and

       shortbisect
              Any  text.  Treats  text as a bisection status, and returns a sin&#8208;
              gle-character  representing  the  status  (G:  good,  B:  bad,  S:
              skipped, U: untested, I: ignored). Returns single space if text is
              not a valid bisection status.

       shortdate
              Date. Returns a date like &quot;2006-09-18&quot;.

       stringify
              Any type. Turns the value into text by converting values into text
              and concatenating them.

       strip  Any text. Strips all leading and trailing whitespace.

       stripdir
              Treat  the  text as path and strip a directory level, if possible.
              For example, &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;foo/bar&quot; becomes &quot;foo&quot;.

       tabindent
              Any text. Returns the text,  with  every  line  except  the  first
              starting with a tab character.
&#12;       urlescape
              Any text. Escapes all &quot;special&quot; characters. For example, &quot;foo bar&quot;
              becomes &quot;foo%20bar&quot;.

       user   Any text. Returns a short representation of a user name  or  email
              address.

URL PATHS
       Valid URLs are of the form:

       local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]

       Paths  in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial repositories
       or to bundle files (as created by hg bundle or :hg:` incoming --bundle`).
       See also hg help paths.

       An  optional  identifier  after  # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
       changeset to use from the remote repository. See also hg help revisions.

       Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are only pos&#8208;
       sible  if  the  feature  is  explicitly  enabled  on the remote Mercurial
       server.

       Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper  configuration  of
       web.cacerts.

       Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:

       &#183; SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine and
         a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.

       &#183; path is relative to the remote user&apos;s home directory by default. Use an
         extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:

         ssh://example.com//tmp/repository

       &#183; Mercurial  doesn&apos;t  use its own compression via SSH; the right thing to
         do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:

         Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
           Compression no
         Host *
           Compression yes

         Alternatively specify &quot;ssh -C&quot; as your ssh command in  your  configura&#8208;
         tion file or with the --ssh command line option.

       These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path aliases
       under the [paths] section like so:

       [paths]
       alias1 = URL1
       alias2 = URL2
       ...

       You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL  (for  example
       hg pull alias1 will be treated as hg pull URL1).

       Two  path  aliases are special because they are used as defaults when you
       do not provide the URL to a command:

       default:
              When you create a repository with  hg  clone,  the  clone  command
              saves  the  location  of  the source repository as the new reposi&#8208;
              tory&apos;s &apos;default&apos; path. This is then used when you omit  path  from
              push- and pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).

       default-push:
              The  push  command  will look for a path named &apos;default-push&apos;, and
              prefer it over &apos;default&apos; if both are defined.

EXTENSIONS
       This section contains help for extensions that are  distributed  together
       with  Mercurial.  Help for other extensions is available in the help sys&#8208;
       tem.

   acl
       hooks for controlling repository access

       This hook makes it possible to  allow  or  deny  write  access  to  given
       branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets via
       pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.
&#12;       The authorization is matched based on the local user name on  the  system
       where  the  hook  runs,  and  not the committer of the original changeset
       (since the latter is merely informative).

       The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like  hgsh,  pre&#8208;
       venting  authenticating  users  from doing anything other than pushing or
       pulling. The hook is not safe to use  if  users  have  interactive  shell
       access, as they can then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if remote users
       share an account, because then there is no way to distinguish them.

       The order in which access checks are performed is:

       1. Deny  list for branches (section acl.deny.branches)

       2. Allow list for branches (section acl.allow.branches)

       3. Deny  list for paths    (section acl.deny)

       4. Allow list for paths    (section acl.allow)

       The allow and deny sections take key-value pairs.

   Branch-based Access Control
       Use  the  acl.deny.branches  and  acl.allow.branches  sections  to   have
       branch-based access control. Keys in these sections can be either:

       &#183; a branch name, or

       &#183; an asterisk, to match any branch;

       The corresponding values can be either:

       &#183; a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or

       &#183; an asterisk, to match anyone;

   Path-based Access Control
       Use  the  acl.deny  and acl.allow sections to have path-based access con&#8208;
       trol. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with a glob syntax
       by default). The corresponding values follow the same syntax as the other
       sections above.

   Groups
       Group names must be prefixed with an @ symbol. Specifying  a  group  name
       has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.

       You  can define group members in the acl.groups section.  If a group name
       is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under a Unix-like  system,
       the  list  of  users  will be taken from the OS.  Otherwise, an exception
       will be raised.

   Example Configuration
       [hooks]

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions at commit time
       pretxncommit.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions for pull, push,
       # bundle and serve.
       pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       [acl]
       # Allow or deny access for incoming changes only if their source is
       # listed here, let them pass otherwise. Source is &quot;serve&quot; for all
       # remote access (http or ssh), &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;bundle&quot; when the
       # related commands are run locally.
       # Default: serve
       sources = serve

       [acl.deny.branches]

       # Everyone is denied to the frozen branch:
       frozen-branch = *

       # A bad user is denied on all branches:
       * = bad-user

       [acl.allow.branches]

       # A few users are allowed on branch-a:
       branch-a = user-1, user-2, user-3

       # Only one user is allowed on branch-b:
       branch-b = user-1

       # The super user is allowed on any branch:
       * = super-user

       # Everyone is allowed on branch-for-tests:
       branch-for-tests = *

       [acl.deny]
       # This list is checked first. If a match is found, acl.allow is not
       # checked. All users are granted access if acl.deny is not present.
       # Format for both lists: glob pattern = user, ..., @group, ...

       # To match everyone, use an asterisk for the user:
       # my/glob/pattern = *

       # user6 will not have write access to any file:
       ** = user6

       # Group &quot;hg-denied&quot; will not have write access to any file:
       ** = @hg-denied

       # Nobody will be able to change &quot;DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt&quot;, despite
       # everyone being able to change all other files. See below.
       src/main/resources/DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt = *

       [acl.allow]
       # if acl.allow is not present, all users are allowed by default
       # empty acl.allow = no users allowed

   bugzilla
       hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker

       This hook extension adds comments on bugs  in  Bugzilla  when  changesets
       that  refer  to  bugs  by  Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted
       using the Mercurial template mechanism.

       The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla  of  the
       hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked fixed.

       Three basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:

       1. Access  via  the  Bugzilla  XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or
          later.

       2. Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug change via
          email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.

       3. Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla installations
          using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.

       Writing directly to the database is susceptible to  schema  changes,  and
       relies  on  a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change notification
       emails. This script runs as the user running Mercurial, must  be  run  on
       the  host  with  the  Bugzilla  install,  and requires permission to read
       Bugzilla configuration details and the necessary MySQL user and  password
       to  have  full  access rights to the Bugzilla database. For these reasons
       this access mode is now considered deprecated, and will  not  be  updated
       for  new  Bugzilla  versions  going forward. Only adding comments is sup&#8208;
       ported in this access mode.

       Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be  specified
       in  the  configuration. Comments are added under that username. Since the
       configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is  recommended
       that  the  rights  of that user are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum
       necessary to add comments. Marking bugs fixed requires Bugzilla  4.0  and
       later.

       Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends email to
       the Bugzilla email interface to  submit  comments  to  bugs.   The  From:
       address  in  the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial user,
       so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event that
       the  Mercurial  user  email  is  not recognised by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla
       user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used  to  log  into
       Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment. Marking bugs fixed
       works on all supported Bugzilla versions.

       Configuration items common to all access modes:

       bugzilla.version
              This access type to use. Values recognised are:

              xmlrpc

                     Bugzilla XMLRPC interface.

              xmlrpc+email

                     Bugzilla XMLRPC and email interfaces.

              3.0

                     MySQL access, Bugzilla 3.0 and later.

              2.18

                     MySQL access, Bugzilla 2.18 and up  to  but  not  including
                     3.0.

                     MySQL  access,  Bugzilla  2.16  and up to but not including
                     2.18.

       bugzilla.regexp
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for update in changeset commit
              message.   It  must  contain one &quot;()&quot; named group &lt;ids&gt; containing
              the bug IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may also contain
              a  named  group  &lt;hours&gt;  with  a floating-point number giving the
              hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are present, the first
              &quot;()&quot; group is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is not
              updated. The default expression matches Bug 1234,  Bug  no.  1234,
              Bug  number 1234, Bugs 1234,5678, Bug 1234 and 5678 and variations
              thereof, followed by an hours number prefixed by h or hours,  e.g.
              hours 1.5. Matching is case insensitive.

       bugzilla.fixregexp
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for marking fixed in changeset
              commit message. This must contain a &quot;()&quot; named group  &lt;ids&gt;`  con&#8208;
              taining the bug IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may also
              contain a named group ``&lt;hours&gt; with a floating-point number  giv&#8208;
              ing  the  hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are present,
              the first &quot;()&quot; group is assumed to contain the bug IDs,  and  work
              time  is  not  updated. The default expression matches Fixes 1234,
              Fixes bug 1234, Fixes bugs 1234,5678,  Fixes  1234  and  5678  and
              variations  thereof,  followed by an hours number prefixed by h or
              hours, e.g. hours 1.5. Matching is case insensitive.

       bugzilla.fixstatus
              The status to set a bug to when marking fixed. Default RESOLVED.

       bugzilla.fixresolution
              The resolution to set a bug to when marking fixed. Default FIXED.

       bugzilla.style
              The style file to use when formatting comments.

       bugzilla.template
              Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style if spec&#8208;
              ified.  In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords, the extension
              specifies:

              {bug}

                     The Bugzilla bug ID.

              {root}

                     The full pathname of the Mercurial repository.

              {webroot}

                     Stripped pathname of the Mercurial repository.

              {hgweb}

                     Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories.

              Default changeset  {node|short}  in  repo  {root}  refers  to  bug
              {bug}.\ndetails:\n\t{desc|tabindent}

       bugzilla.strip
              The number of path separator characters to strip from the front of
              the Mercurial repository path ({root}  in  templates)  to  produce
              {webroot}.    For    example,    a    repository    with    {root}
              /var/local/my-project with a strip of 2 gives a  value  for  {web&#8208;
              root} of my-project. Default 0.

       web.baseurl
              Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories. Referenced from tem&#8208;
              plates as {hgweb}.

       Configuration items common to XMLRPC+email and MySQL access modes:

       bugzilla.usermap
              Path of file containing Mercurial committer email to Bugzilla user
              email  mappings. If specified, the file should contain one mapping
              per line:

              committer = Bugzilla user

              See also the [usermap] section.

       The [usermap] section is used to specify mappings of Mercurial  committer
       email  to  Bugzilla  user  email.  See  also  bugzilla.usermap.  Contains
       entries of the form committer = Bugzilla user.

       XMLRPC access mode configuration:

       bugzilla.bzurl
              The base URL for the Bugzilla installation.  Default http://local&#8208;
              host/bugzilla.

              The username to use to log into Bugzilla via XMLRPC. Default bugs.

       bugzilla.password
              The password for Bugzilla login.

       XMLRPC+email access mode uses the XMLRPC access mode configuration items,
       and also:

       bugzilla.bzemail
              The Bugzilla email address.

       In addition, the Mercurial email settings must  be  configured.  See  the

              Default localhost.

       bugzilla.db
              Name of the Bugzilla database in MySQL. Default bugs.

       bugzilla.user
              Username to use to access MySQL server. Default bugs.

       bugzilla.password
              Password to use to access MySQL server.

       bugzilla.timeout
              Database connection timeout (seconds). Default 5.

       bugzilla.bzuser
              Fallback Bugzilla user name to record comments with, if  changeset
              committer cannot be found as a Bugzilla user.

              /var/www/html/bugzilla.

       bugzilla.notify
              The command to run to get Bugzilla to send bug change notification
              emails. Substitutes from a map with 3 keys, bzdir, id (bug id) and
              user (committer bugzilla email). Default depends on version;  from
              2.18  it is &quot;cd %(bzdir)s &amp;&amp; perl -T contrib/sendbugmail.pl %(id)s

       Changeset commit comment. Bug 1234.

   children
       command to display child changesets

   Commands
   children
       hg children [-r REV] [FILE]

       Print the children of the working directory&apos;s revisions. If a revision is
       given via -r/--rev, the children of that revision will be printed.  If  a
       file  argument  is  given,  revision  in  which the file was last changed
       (after the working directory revision or the argument to --rev if  given)
       is printed.

       Options:
&#12;       -r, --rev
              show children of the specified revision

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

   churn
       command to display statistics about repository history

   Commands
   churn
       hg churn [-d DATE] [-r REV] [--aliases FILE] [FILE]

       This  command will display a histogram representing the number of changed
       lines or revisions, grouped according to the given template. The  default
       template  will  group  changes by author.  The --dateformat option may be
       used to group the results by date instead.

       Statistics are based on the number of changed lines, or alternatively the
       number of matching revisions if the --changesets option is specified.

       Examples:

       # display count of changed lines for every committer
       hg churn -t &apos;{author|email}&apos;

       # display daily activity graph
       hg churn -f &apos;%H&apos; -s -c

       # display activity of developers by month
       hg churn -f &apos;%Y-%m&apos; -s -c

       # display count of lines changed in every year
       hg churn -f &apos;%Y&apos; -s

       It is possible to map alternate email addresses to a main address by pro&#8208;
       viding a file using the following format:

       &lt;alias email&gt; = &lt;actual email&gt;

       Such a file may be specified  with  the  --aliases  option,  otherwise  a
       .hgchurn file will be looked for in the working directory root.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              count rate for the specified revision or range

       -d, --date
              count rate for revisions matching date spec

       -t, --template
              template to group changesets (default: {author|email})

       -f, --dateformat
              strftime-compatible format for grouping by date

       -c, --changesets
              count rate by number of changesets

       -s, --sort
              sort by key (default: sort by count)

       --diffstat
              display added/removed lines separately

       --aliases
              file with email aliases

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   color
       colorize output from some commands

       This  extension  modifies the status and resolve commands to add color to
       their output to reflect file status, the qseries command to add color  to
       reflect  patch  status (applied, unapplied, missing), and to diff-related
       commands to highlight additions, removals,  diff  headers,  and  trailing
       whitespace.

       Other  effects  in  addition to color, like bold and underlined text, are
       also available. By default, the terminfo database is  used  to  find  the
       terminal  codes  used  to  change  color  and effect.  If terminfo is not
       available, then effects are rendered with the ECMA-48 SGR  control  func&#8208;
       tion (aka ANSI escape codes).

       Default effects may be overridden from your configuration file:

       [color]
       status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
       status.added = green bold
       status.removed = red bold blue_background
       status.deleted = cyan bold underline
       status.unknown = magenta bold underline
       status.ignored = black bold

       # &apos;none&apos; turns off all effects
       status.clean = none
       status.copied = none

       qseries.applied = blue bold underline
       qseries.unapplied = black bold
       qseries.missing = red bold

       diff.diffline = bold
       diff.extended = cyan bold
       diff.file_a = red bold
       diff.file_b = green bold
       diff.hunk = magenta
       diff.deleted = red
       diff.inserted = green
       diff.changed = white
       diff.trailingwhitespace = bold red_background

       resolve.unresolved = red bold
       resolve.resolved = green bold

       bookmarks.current = green

       branches.active = none
       branches.closed = black bold
       branches.current = green
       branches.inactive = none

       tags.normal = green
       tags.local = black bold

       The  available  effects  in  terminfo  mode  are  &apos;blink&apos;, &apos;bold&apos;, &apos;dim&apos;,
       &apos;inverse&apos;, &apos;invisible&apos;, &apos;italic&apos;, &apos;standout&apos;, and &apos;underline&apos;; in ECMA-48
       mode,  the options are &apos;bold&apos;, &apos;inverse&apos;, &apos;italic&apos;, and &apos;underline&apos;.  How
       each is rendered depends on the  terminal  emulator.   Some  may  not  be
       available for a given terminal type, and will be silently ignored.

       Note  that  on  some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when using
       color with the pager extension and less -R. less with the -R option  will
       only  display  ECMA-48  color codes, and terminfo mode may sometimes emit
       codes that less doesn&apos;t understand. You can work around  this  by  either
       using  ansi  mode  (or  auto  mode), or by using less -r (which will pass
       through all terminal control codes, not just color control codes).

       Because there are only eight standard colors, this module allows  you  to
       define  color  names  for  other color slots which might be available for
       your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For instance:

       color.brightblue = 12
       color.pink = 207
       color.orange = 202

       to set &apos;brightblue&apos; to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals  that
       have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and, &apos;pink&apos; and &apos;orange&apos;
       to colors in 256-color xterm&apos;s default color cube.  These defined  colors
       may  then  be  used  as any of the pre-defined eight, including appending
       &apos;_background&apos; to set the background to that color.

       By default, the color extension will use ANSI mode (or win32 mode on Win&#8208;
       dows) if it detects a terminal. To override auto mode (to enable terminfo
       mode, for example), set the following configuration option:

       [color]
       mode = terminfo

       Any value other than &apos;ansi&apos;, &apos;win32&apos;, &apos;terminfo&apos;, or &apos;auto&apos; will  disable
       color.

   convert
       import revisions from foreign VCS repositories into Mercurial

   Commands
   convert
       hg convert [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST [REVMAP]]
&#12;       Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

       &#183; Mercurial [hg]

       &#183; CVS [cvs]

       &#183; Darcs [darcs]

       &#183; git [git]

       &#183; Subversion [svn]

       &#183; GNU Arch [gnuarch]

       &#183; Bazaar [bzr]

       &#183; Perforce [p4]

       Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

       &#183; Mercurial [hg]

       &#183; Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

       If  no  revision  is  given, all revisions will be converted.  Otherwise,
       convert will only import up to the named  revision  (given  in  a  format
       understood by the source).

       If  no  destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the base&#8208;
       name of the source with  -hg  appended.  If  the  destination  repository
       doesn&apos;t exist, it will be created.

       By  default,  all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.  Mercu&#8208;
       rial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers order.  Sort
       modes have the following effects:

       --branchsort
              convert  from  parent to child revision when possible, which means
              branches are usually converted one after the other.  It  generates
              more compact repositories.

       --datesort
              sort  revisions  by date. Converted repositories have good-looking
              changelogs but are often an order of  magnitude  larger  than  the
              same ones generated by --branchsort.

       --sourcesort
              try  to  preserve source revisions order, only supported by Mercu&#8208;
              rial sources.

       If  REVMAP  isn&apos;t  given,  it  will  be  put  in   a   default   location
       (&lt;dest&gt;/.hg/shamap  by  default).  The  REVMAP is a simple text file that
       maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for that revision,  like
       so:

       &lt;source ID&gt; &lt;destination ID&gt;

       If  the  file  doesn&apos;t exist, it&apos;s automatically created. It&apos;s updated on
       each commit copied, so hg convert can  be  interrupted  and  can  be  run
       repeatedly to copy new commits.

       The  authormap  is a simple text file that maps each source commit author
       to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs that use unix
       logins to identify authors (eg: CVS). One line per author mapping and the
       line format is:

       source author = destination author

       Empty lines and lines starting with a # are ignored.

       The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping  of  files  and
       directories. Each line can contain one of the following directives:

       include path/to/file-or-dir

       exclude path/to/file-or-dir

       rename path/to/source path/to/destination

       Comment  lines  start  with  #. A specified path matches if it equals the
       full relative name of a file  or  one  of  its  parent  directories.  The
       include  or  exclude directive with the longest matching path applies, so
       line order does not matter.

       The include directive causes a file, or all files under a  directory,  to
       be included in the destination repository, and the exclusion of all other
       files and directories not  explicitly  included.  The  exclude  directive
       causes files or directories to be omitted. The rename directive renames a
       file or directory if it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory  into
       the root of the repository, use . as the path to rename to.

       The  splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic history, let&#8208;
       ting you specify the parents of a revision. This is useful if you want to
       e.g.  give  a  Subversion  merge  two  parents, or graft two disconnected
       series of history together. Each entry contains  a  key,  followed  by  a
       space, followed by one or two comma-separated values:

       key parent1, parent2

       The  key  is  the revision ID in the source revision control system whose
       parents should be modified (same format as a key in .hg/shamap). The val&#8208;
       ues  are  the  revision IDs (in either the source or destination revision
       control system) that should be used as the new parents for that node. For
       example,  if  you have merged &quot;release-1.0&quot; into &quot;trunk&quot;, then you should
       specify the revision on &quot;trunk&quot; as the first parent and the  one  on  the
       &quot;release-1.0&quot; branch as the second.

       The  branchmap  is  a  file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
       being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in conjunc&#8208;
       tion  with  a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination to help fix
       even the most badly mismanaged repositories and  turn  them  into  nicely
       structured  Mercurial  repositories.  The branchmap contains lines of the
       form:

       original_branch_name new_branch_name

       where &quot;original_branch_name&quot; is the name of  the  branch  in  the  source
       repository, and &quot;new_branch_name&quot; is the name of the branch is the desti&#8208;
       nation repository. No whitespace is allowed in the branch names. This can
       be used to (for instance) move code in one repository from &quot;default&quot; to a
       named branch.

   Mercurial Source
       The Mercurial source  recognizes  the  following  configuration  options,
       which you can set on the command line with --config:

       convert.hg.ignoreerrors
              ignore  integrity  errors  when  reading.  Use it to fix Mercurial
              repositories with missing revlogs, by converting from and to  Mer&#8208;
              curial. Default is False.

       convert.hg.saverev
              store  original  revision  ID  in  changeset (forces target IDs to
              change). It takes a boolean argument and defaults to False.

       convert.hg.startrev
              convert start revision and its descendants.  It takes a  hg  revi&#8208;
              sion identifier and defaults to 0.

   CVS Source
       CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS to indi&#8208;
       cate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct access  to  the
       repository  files  is  not  needed,  unless  of  course the repository is
       :local:. The conversion uses the top level directory in  the  sandbox  to
       find the CVS repository, and then uses CVS rlog commands to find files to
       convert. This means that unless a filemap is given, all files  under  the
       starting  directory will be converted, and that any directory reorganiza&#8208;
       tion in the CVS sandbox is ignored.

       The following options can be used with --config:

       convert.cvsps.cache
              Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing and debug&#8208;
              ging purposes. Default is True.

       convert.cvsps.fuzz
              Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between com&#8208;
              mits with identical user and log message in  a  single  changeset.
              When  very large files were checked in as part of a changeset then
              the default may not be long enough.  The default is 60.

       convert.cvsps.mergeto
              Specify a regular expression to  which  commit  log  messages  are
              matched.  If  a  match  occurs,  then  the conversion process will
              insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log  mes&#8208;
              sage  occurs  to  the  branch  indicated  in the regex. Default is
              {{mergetobranch ([-\w]+)}}

       convert.cvsps.mergefrom
              Specify a regular expression to  which  commit  log  messages  are
              matched.  If  a match occurs, then the conversion process will add
              the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the  regex  as
              the  second  parent of the changeset. Default is {{mergefrombranch
              ([-\w]+)}}

       hook.cvslog
              Specify a Python function to be called at the end of gathering the
              CVS  log.  The function is passed a list with the log entries, and
              can modify the entries in-place, or add or delete them.

       hook.cvschangesets
              Specify a Python function to be called after  the  changesets  are
              calculated  from  the  the  CVS log. The function is passed a list
              with  the  changeset  entries,  and  can  modify  the   changesets
              in-place, or add or delete them.

       An additional &quot;debugcvsps&quot; Mercurial command allows the builtin changeset
       merging code to be run without doing a  conversion.  Its  parameters  and
       output  are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see the command help for
       more details.

   Subversion Source
       Subversion source  detects  classical  trunk/branches/tags  layouts.   By
       default,  the supplied svn://repo/path/ source URL is converted as a sin&#8208;
       gle branch. If  svn://repo/path/trunk  exists  it  replaces  the  default
       branch. If svn://repo/path/branches exists, its subdirectories are listed
       as possible branches. If svn://repo/path/tags exists, it  is  looked  for
       tags  referencing  converted  branches.  Default trunk, branches and tags
       values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths  rela&#8208;
       tive to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto detection.

       The following options can be set with --config:

       convert.svn.branches
              specify   the  directory  containing  branches.   The  default  is
              branches.

       convert.svn.tags
              specify the directory containing tags. The default is tags.

       convert.svn.trunk
              specify the name of the trunk branch. The default is trunk.

       Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,  instead
       of  being  integrally  converted. Only single branch conversions are sup&#8208;
       ported.

       convert.svn.startrev
              specify start Subversion revision number.  The default is 0.

   Perforce Source
       The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a client spec&#8208;
       ification  as  source.  It will convert all files in the source to a flat
       Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches  and  integrations.  Note
       that  when a depot path is given you then usually should specify a target
       directory, because otherwise the target may be named ...-hg.

       It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be  converted  by
       specifying an initial Perforce revision:

       convert.p4.startrev
              specify initial Perforce revision (a Perforce changelist number).

   Mercurial Destination
       The following options are supported:

       convert.hg.clonebranches
              dispatch source branches in separate clones. The default is False.

       convert.hg.tagsbranch
              branch name for tag revisions, defaults to default.

       convert.hg.usebranchnames
              preserve branch names. The default is True.

       Options:

       --authors
              username mapping filename (DEPRECATED, use --authormap instead)

       -s, --source-type
              source repository type

       -d, --dest-type
              destination repository type

       -r, --rev
              import up to target revision REV

       -A, --authormap
              remap usernames using this file

       --filemap
              remap file names using contents of file

       --splicemap
              splice synthesized history into place
&#12;       --branchmap
              change branch names while converting

       --branchsort
              try to sort changesets by branches

       --datesort
              try to sort changesets by date

       --sourcesort
              preserve source changesets order

   eol
       automatically manage newlines in repository files

       This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings (CRLF or LF)
       that are used in the repository and in the local working directory.  That
       way  you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF on Unix/Mac, thereby
       letting everybody use their OS native line endings.

       The extension reads its configuration from a versioned .hgeol  configura&#8208;
       tion  file found in the root of the working copy. The .hgeol file use the
       same syntax as all other Mercurial configuration files. It uses two  sec&#8208;
       tions, [patterns] and [repository].

       The  [patterns]  section  specifies  how line endings should be converted
       between the working copy and the repository. The format is specified by a
       file  pattern.  The  first  match  is used, so put more specific patterns
       first. The available line endings are LF, CRLF, and BIN.

       Files with the declared format of CRLF or LF are always checked  out  and
       stored  in  the repository in that format and files declared to be binary
       (BIN) are left unchanged. Additionally, native is an alias  for  checking
       out  in  the platform&apos;s default line ending: LF on Unix (including Mac OS
       X) and CRLF on Windows. Note that BIN (do nothing  to  line  endings)  is
       Mercurial&apos;s  default behaviour; it is only needed if you need to override
       a later, more general pattern.

       The optional [repository] section specifies the line endings to  use  for
       files  stored  in  the repository. It has a single setting, native, which
       determines the storage line endings for files declared as native  in  the
       [patterns]  section.  It can be set to LF or CRLF. The default is LF. For
       example, this means that on Windows, files configured as native (CRLF  by
       default)  will  be  converted  to LF when stored in the repository. Files
       declared as LF, CRLF, or BIN in the [patterns] section are always  stored
       as-is in the repository.

       Example versioned .hgeol file:

       [patterns]
       **.py = native
       **.vcproj = CRLF
       **.txt = native
       Makefile = LF
       **.jpg = BIN

       [repository]
       native = LF

       Note   The  rules  will first apply when files are touched in the working
              copy, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all files.

       The extension uses an optional [eol] section read from  both  the  normal
       Mercurial  configuration files and the .hgeol file, with the latter over&#8208;
       riding the former. You can use that section to control the overall behav&#8208;
       ior. There are three settings:

       &#183; eol.native  (default  os.linesep)  can be set to LF or CRLF to override
         the default interpretation of native for checkout.  This  can  be  used
         with  hg  archive on Unix, say, to generate an archive where files have
         line endings for Windows.

       &#183; eol.only-consistent (default True) can be set  to  False  to  make  the
         extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent means that
         there is both CRLF and LF present in the file.  Such files are normally
         not touched under the assumption that they have mixed EOLs on purpose.

       &#183; eol.fix-trailing-newline  (default  False) can be set to True to ensure
         that converted files end with a EOL character (either \n or \r\n as per
         the configured patterns).

       The  extension  provides cleverencode: and cleverdecode: filters like the
       deprecated win32text extension does. This  means  that  you  can  disable
       win32text  and enable eol and your filters will still work. You only need
       to these filters until you have prepared a .hgeol file.

       The win32text.forbid* hooks provided by the win32text extension have been
       unified into a single hook named eol.checkheadshook. The hook will lookup
       the expected line endings from the .hgeol  file,  which  means  you  must
       migrate  to a .hgeol file first before using the hook. eol.checkheadshook
       only checks heads, intermediate invalid revisions will be pushed. To for&#8208;
       bid  them completely, use the eol.checkallhook hook. These hooks are best
       used as pretxnchangegroup hooks.

       See hg help patterns for more information about the glob patterns used.

   extdiff
       command to allow external programs to compare revisions

       The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use  external  programs  to
       compare  revisions, or revision with working directory. The external diff
       programs are called with a configurable set of options and two non-option
       arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of files to compare.

       The  extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff commands, so
       you do not need to type hg extdiff -p kdiff3 always.

       [extdiff]
       # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in &apos;context diff&apos; mode
       cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
       ## or the old way:
       #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
       #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

       # add new command called vdiff, runs kdiff3
       vdiff = kdiff3

       # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice)
       meld =

       # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
       # (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102) Non
       # English user, be sure to put &quot;let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1&quot; in
       # your .vimrc
       vimdiff = gvim -f &quot;+next&quot; \
                 &quot;+execute &apos;DirDiff&apos; fnameescape(argv(0)) fnameescape(argv(1))&quot;

       Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at runtime:

       $parent1, $plabel1 - filename, descriptive label of first parent
       $child,   $clabel  - filename, descriptive label of child revision
       $parent2, $plabel2 - filename, descriptive label of second parent
       $root              - repository root
       $parent is an alias for $parent1.

       The extdiff extension will look in your  [diff-tools]  and  [merge-tools]
       sections for diff tool arguments, when none are specified in [extdiff].

       [extdiff]
       kdiff3 =

       [diff-tools]
       kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 &apos;$plabel1&apos; --L2 &apos;$clabel&apos; $parent $child

       You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal hg diff
       command. The extdiff extension makes snapshots of only needed  files,  so
       running  the external diff program will actually be pretty fast (at least
       faster than having to compare the entire tree).

   Commands
   extdiff
       hg extdiff [OPT]... [FILE]...

       Show differences between revisions for  the  specified  files,  using  an
       external  program. The default program used is diff, with default options
       &quot;-Npru&quot;.

       To select a different program, use the -p/--program option.  The  program
       will  be  passed  the  names of two directories to compare. To pass addi&#8208;
       tional options to the program, use  -o/--option.  These  will  be  passed
       before the names of the directories to compare.

       When  two  revision  arguments  are given, then changes are shown between
       those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision  is
       compared  to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified,
       the working directory files are compared to its parent.

       Options:

       -p, --program
              comparison program to run

       -o, --option
              pass option to comparison program

       -r, --rev
              revision

       -c, --change
              change made by revision
&#12;       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   factotum
       http authentication with factotum

       This extension allows the factotum(4) facility on Plan 9 from  Bell  Labs
       platforms to provide authentication information for HTTP access. Configu&#8208;
       ration entries specified in the auth section as  well  as  authentication
       information  provided  in  the  repository URL are fully supported. If no
       prefix is specified, a value of &quot;*&quot; will be assumed.

       By default, keys are specified as:

       proto=pass service=hg prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; user=&lt;username&gt; !password=&lt;password&gt;

       If the factotum extension is unable to read the required key, one will be
       requested interactively.

       A  configuration  section  is available to customize runtime behavior. By
       default, these entries are:

       [factotum]
       executable = /bin/auth/factotum
       mountpoint = /mnt/factotum
       service = hg

       The executable entry defines the full path to the  factotum  binary.  The
       mountpoint  entry  defines the path to the factotum file service. Lastly,
       the service entry controls the service name used when reading keys.

   fetch
       pull, update and merge in one command

   Commands
   fetch
       hg fetch [SOURCE]

       This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path  or  URL
       and adds them to the local repository.

       If  the  pulled  changes add a new branch head, the head is automatically
       merged, and the result of the merge is committed.  Otherwise, the working
       directory is updated to include the new changes.

       When  a  merge  is  needed, the working directory is first updated to the
       newly pulled changes. Local changes  are  then  merged  into  the  pulled
       changes. To switch the merge order, use --switch-parent.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success.

       commands to sign and verify changesets

   Commands
   sigcheck
       hg sigcheck REVISION

       verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision

   sign
       hg sign [OPTION]... [REVISION]...

       If  no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used, or
       tip if no revision is checked out.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Options:

       -l, --local
              make the signature local

       -f, --force

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

   sigs
       hg sigs

       list signed changesets

   graphlog
       command to view revision graphs from a shell

       This extension adds a --graph option to the incoming,  outgoing  and  log
       commands.  When  this  options  is  given, an ASCII representation of the
       revision graph is also shown.

   Commands
   glog
       hg glog [OPTION]... [FILE]

       Print a revision history alongside a  revision  graph  drawn  with  ASCII
       characters.

   hgcia
       hooks for integrating with the CIA.vc notification service

       This is meant to be run as a changegroup or incoming hook.  To  configure
       it, set the following options in your hgrc:

       [cia]
       # your registered CIA user name
       user = foo
       # the name of the project in CIA
       project = foo
       # the module (subproject) (optional)
       #module = foo
       # Append a diffstat to the log message (optional)
       #diffstat = False
       # Template to use for log messages (optional)
       #template = {desc}\n{baseurl}{webroot}/rev/{node}-- {diffstat}
       # Style to use (optional)
       #style = foo
       # The URL of the CIA notification service (optional)
       # You can use mailto: URLs to send by email, eg
       # mailto:cia@cia.vc
       # Make sure to set email.from if you do this.
       #url = http://cia.vc/
       # print message instead of sending it (optional)
       #test = False
       # number of slashes to strip for url paths
       #strip = 0

       [hooks]
       # one of these:
       changegroup.cia = python:hgcia.hook
       #incoming.cia = python:hgcia.hook

       [web]
       # If you want hyperlinks (optional)
       baseurl = http://server/path/to/repo

   hgk
       browse the repository in a graphical way

       The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in a graph&#8208;
       ical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk  is  not  dis&#8208;
       tributed with Mercurial.)

       hgk  consists  of  two  parts:  a Tcl script that does the displaying and
       querying of information, and an  extension  to  Mercurial  named  hgk.py,
       which  provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can be found in the
       contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext  repository,
       and needs to be enabled.

       The  hg  view command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command to
       work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can  specify  the
       path to hgk in your configuration file:

       [hgk]
       path=/location/of/hgk

       hgk can make use of the extdiff extension to visualize revisions.  Assum&#8208;
       ing you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just add:

       [hgk]
       vdiff=vdiff

       Revisions context menu will now display additional entries to fire  vdiff
       on hovered and selected revisions.

   Commands
   view
       hg view [-l LIMIT] [REVRANGE]

       start interactive history viewer

       Options:

       -l, --limit
              limit number of changes displayed

   highlight
       syntax highlighting for hgweb (requires Pygments)

       It    depends    on    the    Pygments   syntax   highlighting   library:
       http://pygments.org/

       There is a single configuration option:

       [web]
       pygments_style = &lt;style&gt;

       The default is &apos;colorful&apos;.

   inotify
       accelerate status report using Linux&apos;s inotify service

   Commands
   inserve
       hg inserve [OPTION]...

       start an inotify server for this repository

       Options:

       -d, --daemon
              run server in background

       --daemon-pipefds
              used internally by daemon mode

       -t, --idle-timeout
              minutes to sit idle before exiting

       --pid-file
              name of file to write process ID to

   interhg
       expand expressions into changelog and summaries

       This extension allows the use of a special  syntax  in  summaries,  which
       will  be automatically expanded into links or any other arbitrary expres&#8208;
       sion, much like InterWiki does.

       A few example patterns (link to bug tracking, etc.) that may be  used  in
       your hgrc:

       [interhg]
       issues = s!issue(\d+)!&lt;a href=&quot;http://bts/issue\1&quot;&gt;issue\1&lt;/a&gt;!
       bugzilla = s!((?:bug|b=|(?=#?\d{4,}))(?:\s*#?)(\d+))!&lt;a..=\2&quot;&gt;\1&lt;/a&gt;!i
       boldify = s!(^|\s)#(\d+)\b! &lt;b&gt;#\2&lt;/b&gt;!

   keyword
       expand keywords in tracked files

       This  extension  expands  RCS/CVS-like  or  self-customized $Keywords$ in
       tracked text files selected by your configuration.

       Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not  stored  in  the
       change  history.  The  mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the
       current user or for archive distribution.

       Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining  to  the  latest  change
       relative to the working directory parent of each file.

       Configuration  is  done  in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps]
       sections of hgrc files.

       Example:

       [keyword]
       # expand keywords in every python file except those matching &quot;x*&quot;
       **.py =
       x*    = ignore

       [keywordset]
       # prefer svn- over cvs-like default keywordmaps
       svn = True

       Note   The more specific you are in your filename patterns the  less  you
              lose speed in huge repositories.

       For  [keywordmaps]  template mapping and expansion demonstration and con&#8208;
       trol run hg kwdemo. See hg help templates for a list  of  available  tem&#8208;
       plates and filters.

       Three additional date template filters are provided:

       utcdate

              &quot;2006/09/18 15:13:13&quot;

       svnutcdate

              &quot;2006-09-18 15:13:13Z&quot;

       svnisodate

              &quot;2006-09-18 08:13:13 -700 (Mon, 18 Sep 2006)&quot;

       The  default  template  mappings (view with hg kwdemo -d) can be replaced
       with customized keywords and templates. Again, run hg  kwdemo to  control
       the results of your configuration changes.

       Before  changing/disabling  active  keywords, you must run hg kwshrink to
       avoid storing expanded keywords in the change history.

       To force expansion after enabling it, or a configuration change,  run  hg
       kwexpand.

       Expansions  spanning  more than one line and incremental expansions, like
       CVS&apos; $Log$, are not supported. A keyword  template  map  &quot;Log  =  {desc}&quot;
       expands to the first line of the changeset description.

   Commands
   kwdemo
       hg kwdemo [-d] [-f RCFILE] [TEMPLATEMAP]...

       Show  current,  custom, or default keyword template maps and their expan&#8208;
       sions.

       Extend the current configuration by  specifying  maps  as  arguments  and
       using -f/--rcfile to source an external hgrc file.

       Use -d/--default to disable current configuration.

       See hg help templates for information on templates and filters.

       Options:

       -d, --default
              show default keyword template maps

       -f, --rcfile
              read maps from rcfile

   kwexpand
       hg kwexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Run after (re)enabling keyword expansion.

       kwexpand refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   kwfiles
       hg kwfiles [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       List  which  files  in the working directory are matched by the [keyword]
       configuration patterns.

       Useful to prevent inadvertent keyword expansion and to speed up execution
       by including only files that are actual candidates for expansion.

       See  hg  help keyword on how to construct patterns both for inclusion and
       exclusion of files.

       With -A/--all and -v/--verbose the codes used to show the status of files
       are:

       K = keyword expansion candidate
       k = keyword expansion candidate (not tracked)
       I = ignored
       i = ignored (not tracked)

       Options:

       -A, --all
              show keyword status flags of all files

       -i, --ignore
              show files excluded from expansion

       -u, --unknown
              only show unknown (not tracked) files

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   kwshrink
       hg kwshrink [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Must be run before changing/disabling active keywords.

       kwshrink refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   largefiles
       track large binary files

       Large  binary  files tend to be not very compressible, not very diffable,
       and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled efficiently by  Mer&#8208;
       curial&apos;s  storage  format  (revlog),  which is based on compressed binary
       deltas; storing large binary files  as  regular  Mercurial  files  wastes
       bandwidth  and  disk  space  and  increases Mercurial&apos;s memory usage. The
       largefiles extension addresses these problems  by  adding  a  centralized
       client-server  layer  on  top  of Mercurial: largefiles live in a central
       store out on the network somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that
       you need when you need them.

       largefiles  works  by  maintaining  a  &quot;standin  file&quot; in .hglf/ for each
       largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA-1 hash plus  newline)
       and  are  tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are identified by the
       SHA-1 hash of their contents, which is written to the standin. largefiles
       uses  that revision ID to get/put largefile revisions from/to the central
       store. This saves both disk space and bandwidth, since you don&apos;t need  to
       retrieve all historical revisions of large files when you clone or pull.

       To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add --large
       to your hg add command. For example:

       $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
       $ hg add --large randomdata
       $ hg commit -m &apos;add randomdata as a largefile&apos;

       When you push a changeset  that  adds/modifies  largefiles  to  a  remote
       repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along with it.  Note
       that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension enabled
       for this to work.

       When  you  pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote reposi&#8208;
       tory, Mercurial behaves as normal. However, when you  update  to  such  a
       revision,  any  largefiles  needed  by  that  revision are downloaded and
       cached (if they have never been downloaded before). This means that  net&#8208;
       work  access  may be required to update to changesets you have not previ&#8208;
       ously updated to.

       If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without  the  large&#8208;
       files  extension,  you  will  need to convert your repository in order to
       benefit from largefiles. This is done with the hg lfconvert command:

       $ hg lfconvert --size 10 oldrepo newrepo
&#12;       In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new  file  over
       10MB  will  automatically be added as a largefile. To change this thresh&#8208;
       old, set largefiles.minsize in your Mercurial config file to the  minimum
       size  in megabytes to track as a largefile, or use the --lfsize option to
       the add command (also in megabytes):

       [largefiles]
       minsize = 2

       $ hg add --lfsize 2

       The largefiles.patterns config option allows you to  specify  a  list  of
       filename patterns (see hg help patterns) that should always be tracked as
       largefiles:

       [largefiles]
       patterns =
         *.jpg
         re:.*\.(png|bmp)$
         library.zip
         content/audio/*

       Files that match one of  these  patterns  will  be  added  as  largefiles
       regardless of their size.

       The  largefiles.minsize  and  largefiles.patterns  config options will be
       ignored for any repositories not already containing a largefile.  To  add
       the  first  largefile to a repository, you must explicitly do so with the
       --large flag passed to the hg add command.

   Commands
   lfconvert
       hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]

       Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical  to  SOURCE
       except  that certain files will be converted as largefiles: specifically,
       any file that matches any PATTERN or whose size is above the minimum size
       threshold is converted as a largefile. The size used to determine whether
       or not to track a file as a largefile is the size of the first version of
       the file. The minimum size can be specified either with --size or in con&#8208;
       figuration as largefiles.size.

       After running this command you will need to make sure that largefiles  is
       enabled anywhere you intend to push the new repository.

       Use  --to-normal  to convert largefiles back to normal files; after this,
       the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.

       Options:

       -s, --size
              minimum size (MB) for files to be converted as largefiles

       --to-normal
              convert from a largefiles repo to a normal repo

   mq
       manage a stack of patches

       This extension lets you work with a  stack  of  patches  in  a  Mercurial
       repository.  It  manages  two  stacks of patches - all known patches, and
       applied patches (subset of known patches).

       Known patches are represented as patch files in  the  .hg/patches  direc&#8208;
       tory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

       Common tasks (use hg help command for more details):

       create new patch                          qnew
       import existing patch                     qimport

       print patch series                        qseries
       print applied patches                     qapplied

       add known patch to applied stack          qpush
       remove patch from applied stack           qpop
       refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

       By  default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to avoid
       losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty files  cre&#8208;
       ations or deletions. This behaviour can be configured with:

       [mq]
       git = auto/keep/yes/no

       If  set  to  &apos;keep&apos;,  mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while
       preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to &apos;yes&apos;  or  &apos;no&apos;,
       mq  will  override  the [diff] section and always generate git or regular
       patches, possibly losing data in the second case.

       It may be desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret phase (see
       hg help phases), which can be enabled with the following setting:

       [mq]
       secret = True

       You  will  by  default be managing a patch queue named &quot;patches&quot;. You can
       create other, independent patch queues with the hg qqueue command.

   Commands
   qapplied
       hg qapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -1, --last
              show only the preceding applied patch

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qclone
       hg qclone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       If source is local, destination will have no patches applied.  If  source
       is  remote,  this command can not check if patches are applied in source,
       so cannot guarantee that patches are not applied in destination.  If  you
       clone remote repository, be sure before that it has no patches applied.

       Source  patch  repository  is looked for in &lt;src&gt;/.hg/patches by default.
       Use -p &lt;url&gt; to change.

       The patch directory must be a nested Mercurial repository,  as  would  be
       created by hg init --mq.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       --pull use pull protocol to copy metadata

       -U, --noupdate
              do not update the new working directories

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

              aliases: qci

   qdelete
       hg qdelete [-k] [PATCH]...

       The  patches  must  not  be  applied, and at least one patch is required.
       Exact patch identifiers must be given. With -k/--keep,  the  patch  files
       are preserved in the patch directory.

       To  stop  managing a patch and move it into permanent history, use the hg
       qfinish command.

       Options:

       -k, --keep
              keep patch file

       -r, --rev
              stop managing a revision (DEPRECATED)

              aliases: qremove qrm

   qdiff
       hg qdiff [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Shows a diff which includes the current patch  as  well  as  any  changes
       which  have  been  made  in  the working directory since the last refresh
       (thus showing what the current patch would become after a qrefresh).

       Use hg diff if you only want to see the changes made since the last  qre&#8208;
       fresh,  or  hg export qtip if you want to see changes made by the current
       patch without including changes made since the qrefresh.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

       -U, --unified
              number of lines of context to show

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

   qfinish
       hg qfinish [-a] [REV]...

       Finishes the specified revisions (corresponding to  applied  patches)  by
       moving them out of mq control into regular repository history.

       Accepts  a  revision  range  or  the -a/--applied option. If --applied is
       specified, all applied mq revisions are removed from mq  control.  Other&#8208;
       wise,  the  given  revisions  must be at the base of the stack of applied
       patches.

       This can be especially useful if your changes have  been  applied  to  an
       upstream  repository,  or  if  you  are  about  to  push  your changes to
       upstream.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --applied
              finish all applied changesets

   qfold
       hg qfold [-e] [-k] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH...

       Patches must not yet be applied. Each patch will be successively  applied
       to  the  current  patch in the order given. If all the patches apply suc&#8208;
       cessfully, the current patch will be refreshed with  the  new  cumulative
       patch, and the folded patches will be deleted. With -k/--keep, the folded
       patch files will not be removed afterwards.

       The header for each folded patch will be concatenated  with  the  current
       patch header, separated by a line of * * *.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              edit patch header

       -k, --keep
              keep folded patch files

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

   qgoto
       hg qgoto [OPTION]... PATCH

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              overwrite any local changes

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qguard
       hg qguard [-l] [-n] [PATCH] [-- [+GUARD]... [-GUARD]...]

       Guards  control  whether a patch can be pushed. A patch with no guards is
       always pushed. A patch with a positive guard (&quot;+foo&quot;) is pushed  only  if
       the  hg  qselect command  has activated it. A patch with a negative guard
       (&quot;-foo&quot;) is never pushed if the hg qselect command has activated it.

       With no arguments, print the currently active  guards.   With  arguments,
       set guards for the named patch.

       Note   Specifying negative guards now requires &apos;--&apos;.

       To set guards on another patch:

       hg qguard other.patch -- +2.6.17 -stable

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -l, --list
              list all patches and guards

       -n, --none
              drop all guards

   qheader
       hg qheader [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

   qimport
       hg qimport [-e] [-n NAME] [-f] [-g] [-P] [-r REV]... FILE...

       The patch is inserted into the series after the last applied patch. If no
       patches have been applied, qimport prepends the patch to the series.

       The patch will have the same name as its source file unless you give it a
       new one with -n/--name.
&#12;       You  can  register  an existing patch inside the patch directory with the
       -e/--existing flag.

       With -f/--force, an existing patch of the same name will be overwritten.

       An existing changeset may be placed under mq control with -r/--rev  (e.g.
       qimport  --rev  tip  -n  patch  will  place  tip under mq control).  With
       -g/--git, patches imported with --rev will use the git diff  format.  See
       the  diffs  help  topic for information on why this is important for pre&#8208;
       serving rename/copy information and permission changes. Use hg qfinish to
       remove changesets from mq control.

       To  import  a  patch from standard input, pass - as the patch file.  When
       importing from standard input, a patch name must be specified  using  the
       --name flag.

       To import an existing patch while renaming it:

       hg qimport -e existing-patch -n new-name

       Returns 0 if import succeeded.

       Options:

       -e, --existing
              import file in patch directory

       -n, --name
              name of patch file

       -f, --force
              overwrite existing files

       -r, --rev
              place existing revisions under mq control

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -P, --push
              qpush after importing

   qinit
       hg qinit [-c]

       The  queue  repository  is unversioned by default. If -c/--create-repo is
       specified, qinit will create a separate  nested  repository  for  patches
       (qinit  -c  may also be run later to convert an unversioned patch reposi&#8208;
       tory into a versioned one). You can use qcommit to commit changes to this
       queue repository.

       This  command  is  deprecated. Without -c, it&apos;s implied by other relevant
       commands. With -c, use hg init --mq instead.

       Options:

       -c, --create-repo
              create queue repository

   qnew
       hg qnew [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH [FILE]...

       qnew creates a new patch on top of the currently-applied patch (if  any).
       The patch will be initialized with any outstanding changes in the working
       directory. You may also use -I/--include, -X/--exclude, and/or a list  of
       files  after  the patch name to add only changes to matching files to the
       new patch, leaving the rest as uncommitted modifications.

       -u/--user and -d/--date can be used to set the  (given)  user  and  date,
       respectively.  -U/--currentuser  and -D/--currentdate set user to current
       user and date to current date.

       -e/--edit, -m/--message or -l/--logfile set the patch header as  well  as
       the  commit  message.  If  none is specified, the header is empty and the
       commit message is &apos;[mq]: PATCH&apos;.

       Use the -g/--git option to keep the patch in the git extended  diff  for&#8208;
       mat. Read the diffs help topic for more information on why this is impor&#8208;
       tant for preserving permission changes and copy/rename information.

       Returns 0 on successful creation of a new patch.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              edit commit message

       -f, --force
              import uncommitted changes (DEPRECATED)

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format
&#12;       -U, --currentuser
              add &quot;From: &lt;current user&gt;&quot; to patch

       -u, --user
              add &quot;From: &lt;USER&gt;&quot; to patch

       -D, --currentdate
              add &quot;Date: &lt;current date&gt;&quot; to patch

       -d, --date
              add &quot;Date: &lt;DATE&gt;&quot; to patch

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

   qnext
       hg qnext [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qpop
       hg qpop [-a] [-f] [PATCH | INDEX]

       By default, pops off the top of the patch stack. If given a  patch  name,
       keeps  popping  off  patches  until  the named patch is at the top of the
       stack.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --all
              pop all patches

       -n, --name
              queue name to pop (DEPRECATED)

       -f, --force
              forget any local changes to patched files

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qprev
       hg qprev [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qpush
       hg qpush [-f] [-l] [-a] [--move] [PATCH | INDEX]

       When -f/--force is applied, all local changes in patched  files  will  be
       lost.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              apply on top of local changes

       -e, --exact
              apply the target patch to its recorded parent

       -l, --list
              list patch name in commit text

       -a, --all
              apply all patches

       -m, --merge
              merge from another queue (DEPRECATED)

       -n, --name
              merge queue name (DEPRECATED)
&#12;       --move reorder patch series and apply only the patch

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qqueue
       hg qqueue [OPTION] [QUEUE]

       Supports  switching  between  different patch queues, as well as creating
       new patch queues and deleting existing ones.

       Omitting a queue name or specifying -l/--list will show  you  the  regis&#8208;
       tered  queues  - by default the &quot;normal&quot; patches queue is registered. The
       currently  active  queue  will  be  marked  with  &quot;(active)&quot;.  Specifying
       --active will print only the name of the active queue.

       To  create  a new queue, use -c/--create. The queue is automatically made
       active, except in the case where there are applied patches from the  cur&#8208;
       rently  active  queue in the repository. Then the queue will only be cre&#8208;
       ated and switching will fail.

       To delete an existing queue, use --delete. You  cannot  delete  the  cur&#8208;
       rently active queue.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -l, --list
              list all available queues

       --active
              print name of active queue

       -c, --create
              create new queue

       --rename
              rename active queue

       --delete
              delete reference to queue

       --purge
              delete queue, and remove patch dir

   qrefresh
       hg qrefresh [-I] [-X] [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-s] [FILE]...

       If  any file patterns are provided, the refreshed patch will contain only
       the modifications that match those patterns; the remaining  modifications
       will remain in the working directory.

       If -s/--short is specified, files currently included in the patch will be
       refreshed just like matched files and remain in the patch.

       If -e/--edit is specified, Mercurial will start  your  configured  editor
       for  you  to  enter  a  message.  In case qrefresh fails, you will find a
       backup of your message in .hg/last-message.txt.

       hg add/remove/copy/rename work as usual, though you  might  want  to  use
       git-style patches (-g/--git or [diff] git=1) to track copies and renames.
       See the diffs help topic for more information on the git diff format.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              edit commit message

   qselect
       hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...

       Use  the hg qguard command to set or print guards on patch, then use qse&#8208;
       lect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be pushed if it has  no
       guards  or  any  positive  guards match the currently selected guard, but
       will not be pushed if any negative guards match the  current  guard.  For
       example:

       qguard foo.patch -- -stable    (negative guard)
       qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
       qselect stable

       This activates the &quot;stable&quot; guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because it has
       a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it has a positive match).

       With no arguments, prints the currently active guards.   With  one  argu&#8208;
       ment, sets the active guard.

       Use  -n/--none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed).  When no
       guards are active, patches with positive guards are skipped  and  patches
       with negative guards are pushed.

       qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop guarded
       patches by default. Use --pop to pop back to the last applied patch  that
       is  not  guarded. Use --reapply (which implies --pop) to push back to the
       current patch afterwards, but skip guarded patches.

       Use -s/--series to print a list of all guards  in  the  series  file  (no
       other arguments needed). Use -v for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -n, --none
              disable all guards

       -s, --series
              list all guards in series file
&#12;       --pop  pop to before first guarded applied patch

       --reapply
              pop, then reapply patches

   qseries
       hg qseries [-ms]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -m, --missing
              print patches not in series

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qtop
       hg qtop [-s]

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qunapplied
       hg qunapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -1, --first
              show only the first patch

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   strip
       hg strip [-k] [-f] [-n] REV...

       The  strip command removes the specified changesets and all their descen&#8208;
       dants. If the working directory has uncommitted changes, the operation is
       aborted  unless  the --force flag is supplied, in which case changes will
       be discarded.

       If a parent of the working directory is stripped, then the working direc&#8208;
       tory  will automatically be updated to the most recent available ancestor
       of the stripped parent after the operation completes.

       Any stripped changesets are stored in .hg/strip-backup as a  bundle  (see
       hg  help bundle and hg help unbundle). They can be restored by running hg
       unbundle .hg/strip-backup/BUNDLE, where BUNDLE is the bundle file created
       by  the  strip.  Note  that the local revision numbers will in general be
       different after the restore.

       Use the --no-backup option to discard the backup bundle once  the  opera&#8208;
       tion completes.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --rev
              strip  specified revision (optional, can specify revisions without
              this option)

       -f, --force
              force removal  of  changesets,  discard  uncommitted  changes  (no
              backup)

       -b, --backup
              bundle only changesets with local revision number greater than REV
              which are not descendants of REV (DEPRECATED)

       --no-backup
              no backups

       --nobackup
              no backups (DEPRECATED)

       -n     ignored  (DEPRECATED)

       -k, --keep
              do not modify working copy during strip

   notify
       hooks for sending email push notifications

       This extension let you run hooks sending email notifications when change&#8208;
       sets are being pushed, from the sending or receiving side.
&#12;       First,  enable the extension as explained in hg help extensions, and reg&#8208;
       ister the hook you want to run. incoming and changegroup hooks are run by
       the changesets receiver while the outgoing one is for the sender:

       [hooks]
       # one email for each incoming changeset
       incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
       # one email for all incoming changesets
       changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       # one email for all outgoing changesets
       outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       Now  the hooks are running, subscribers must be assigned to repositories.
       Use the [usersubs] section to map repositories to a given  email  or  the
       [reposubs] section to map emails to a single repository:

       [usersubs]
       # key is subscriber email, value is a comma-separated list of glob
       # patterns
       user@host = pattern

       [reposubs]
       # key is glob pattern, value is a comma-separated list of subscriber
       # emails
       pattern = user@host

       Glob  patterns  are matched against absolute path to repository root. The
       subscriptions can be defined in their own file and referenced with:

       [notify]
       config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile

       Alternatively, they can be added to Mercurial configuration files by set&#8208;
       ting the previous entry to an empty value.

       At  this  point,  notifications  should be generated but will not be sent
       until you set the notify.test entry to False.

       Notifications content can be tweaked  with  the  following  configuration
       entries:

       notify.test
              If  True,  print  messages  to  stdout  instead  of  sending them.
              Default: True.

       notify.sources
              Space separated list of change  sources.  Notifications  are  sent
              only  if  it  includes  the  incoming  or outgoing changes source.
              Incoming sources can be serve for changes coming from http or ssh,
              pull for pulled changes, unbundle for changes added by hg unbundle
              or push for changes being pushed locally. Outgoing sources are the
              same  except  for  unbundle  which is replaced by bundle. Default:
              serve.

       notify.strip
              Number of leading slashes to strip from  url  paths.  By  default,
              notifications  references  repositories  with their absolute path.
              notify.strip let you turn them into relative paths.  For  example,
              notify.strip=3  will change /long/path/repository into repository.
              Default: 0.

       notify.domain
              If subscribers emails or the from email have no domain  set,  com&#8208;
              plete them with this value.

       notify.style
              Style file to use when formatting emails.

       notify.template
              Template to use when formatting emails.

       notify.incoming
              Template  to  use  when run as incoming hook, override notify.tem&#8208;
              plate.

       notify.outgoing
              Template to use when run as outgoing  hook,  override  notify.tem&#8208;
              plate.

       notify.changegroup
              Template  to  use  when  running  as  changegroup  hook,  override
              notify.template.

       notify.maxdiff
              Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification email. Set
              to 0 to disable the diff, -1 to include all of it. Default: 300.

       notify.maxsubject
              Maximum number of characters in emails subject line. Default: 67.

       notify.diffstat
              Set  to  True  to include a diffstat before diff content. Default:
              True.
&#12;       notify.merge
              If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.

       notify.mbox
              If set, append  mails  to  this  mbox  file  instead  of  sending.
              Default: None.

       notify.fromauthor
              If  set, use the first committer of the changegroup for the &quot;From&quot;
              field of the notification mail. If not set, take the user from the
              pushing repo.  Default: False.

       If  set, the following entries will also be used to customize the notifi&#8208;
       cations:

       email.from
              Email From address to use if none can be found in generated  email
              content.

       web.baseurl
              Root repository browsing URL to combine with repository paths when
              making references. See also notify.strip.

   pager
       browse command output with an external pager

       To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable:

       [pager]
       pager = less -FRSX

       If no pager is set, the pager extensions uses  the  environment  variable
       $PAGER. If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is set, no pager is used.

       You  can  disable  the  pager  for certain commands by adding them to the
       pager.ignore list:

       [pager]
       ignore = version, help, update

       You  can  also  enable  the  pager  only  for  certain   commands   using
       pager.attend. Below is the default list of commands to be paged:

       [pager]
       attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, glog, log, qdiff

       Setting  pager.attend  to  an  empty  value will cause all commands to be
       paged.

       If pager.attend is present, pager.ignore will be ignored.

       To ignore global commands like hg version or hg help, you have to specify
       them in your user configuration file.

       The  --pager=...  option  can  also  be used to control when the pager is
       used. Use a boolean value like yes, no, on, off, or use auto  for  normal
       behavior.

   patchbomb
       command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails

       The  series  is  started  off with a &quot;[PATCH 0 of N]&quot; introduction, which
       describes the series as a whole.

       Each patch email has a Subject line of &quot;[PATCH M of N]  ...&quot;,  using  the
       first  line of the changeset description as the subject text. The message
       contains two or three body parts:

       &#183; The changeset description.

       &#183; [Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.

       &#183; The patch itself, as generated by hg export.

       Each message refers to the first in the series using the In-Reply-To  and
       References  headers,  so they will show up as a sequence in threaded mail
       and news readers, and in mail archives.

       To configure other defaults, add a section like this to  your  configura&#8208;
       tion file:

       [email]
       from = My Name &lt;my@email&gt;
       to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
       cc = cc1, cc2, ...
       bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
       reply-to = address1, address2, ...

       Use  [patchbomb]  as  configuration  section name if you need to override
       global [email] address settings.

       Then you can use the hg email command to mail a series of changesets as a
       patchbomb.

       You  can  also either configure the method option in the email section to
       be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp]  section  so  that
       the  patchbomb  extension can automatically send patchbombs directly from
       the commandline. See the [email]  and  [smtp]  sections  in  hgrc(5)  for
       details.

   Commands
   email
       hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...

       By  default, diffs are sent in the format generated by hg export, one per
       message. The series starts with a &quot;[PATCH 0 of  N]&quot;  introduction,  which
       describes the series as a whole.

       Each  patch  email  has a Subject line of &quot;[PATCH M of N] ...&quot;, using the
       first line of the changeset description as the subject text.  The message
       contains two or three parts. First, the changeset description.

       With  the -d/--diffstat option, if the diffstat program is installed, the
       result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.

       Finally, the patch itself, as generated by hg export.

       With the -d/--diffstat or -c/--confirm options,  you  will  be  presented
       with  a  final  summary of all messages and asked for confirmation before
       the messages are sent.

       By default the patch is included as text  in  the  email  body  for  easy
       reviewing. Using the -a/--attach option will instead create an attachment
       for the patch. With -i/--inline an inline attachment will be created. You
       can include a patch both as text in the email body and as a regular or an
       inline attachment by combining the -a/--attach or  -i/--inline  with  the
       --body option.

       With -o/--outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not found in the
       destination repository (or only those which are ancestors of  the  speci&#8208;
       fied revisions if any are provided)

       With -b/--bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing, but a single
       email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment will be sent.

       With -m/--mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in  a  pager
       or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX mailbox file with
       the patch emails. This mailbox file can be previewed with any  mail  user
       agent which supports UNIX mbox files.

       With  -n/--test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent.  You will
       be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject and an introductory
       message describing the patches of your patchbomb.  Then when all is done,
       patchbomb messages are displayed. If the PAGER  environment  variable  is
       set,  your pager will be fired up once for each patchbomb message, so you
       can verify everything is alright.

       In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your series intro&#8208;
       ductory message in .hg/last-email.txt.

       Examples:

       hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
       hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
       hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
       hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

       hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
       hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
       hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
       hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
       hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&amp;    # generate an mbox file...
         mutt -R -f mbox         # ... and view it with mutt
       hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&amp;    # generate an mbox file ...
         formail -s sendmail \   # ... and use formail to send from the mbox
           -bm -t &lt; mbox         # ... using sendmail

       Before  using  this  command, you will need to enable email in your hgrc.
       See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.

   progress
       show progress bars for some actions

       This  extension  uses  the  progress information logged by hg commands to
       draw progress bars that are as informative  as  possible.  Some  progress
       bars  only  offer indeterminate information, while others have a definite
       end point.

       The following settings are available:

       [progress]
       delay = 3 # number of seconds (float) before showing the progress bar
       changedelay = 1 # changedelay: minimum delay before showing a new topic.
                       # If set to less than 3 * refresh, that value will
                       # be used instead.
       refresh = 0.1 # time in seconds between refreshes of the progress bar
       format = topic bar number estimate # format of the progress bar
       width = &lt;none&gt; # if set, the maximum width of the progress information
                      # (that is, min(width, term width) will be used)
       clear-complete = True # clear the progress bar after it&apos;s done
       disable = False # if true, don&apos;t show a progress bar
       assume-tty = False # if true, ALWAYS show a progress bar, unless
                          # disable is given

       Valid entries for the format field are topic, bar,  number,  unit,  esti&#8208;
       mate,  speed,  and  item.  item defaults to the last 20 characters of the
       item, but this can be changed by adding either -&lt;num&gt;  which  would  take
       the last num characters, or +&lt;num&gt; for the first num characters.

   purge
       command to delete untracked files from the working directory

   Commands
   purge
       hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...

       Delete  files  not  known  to Mercurial. This is useful to test local and
       uncommitted changes in an otherwise-clean source tree.

       This means that purge will delete:

       &#183; Unknown files: files marked with &quot;?&quot; by hg status

       &#183; Empty directories: in fact Mercurial ignores  directories  unless  they
         contain files under source control management

       But it will leave untouched:

       &#183; Modified and unmodified tracked files

       &#183; Ignored files (unless --all is specified)

       &#183; New files added to the repository (with hg add)

       If  directories are given on the command line, only files in these direc&#8208;
       tories are considered.

       Be careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete  some  files  you
       forgot  to  add  to the repository. If you only want to print the list of
       files that this program would delete, use the --print option.

       Options:

       -a, --abort-on-err
              abort if an error occurs

       --all  purge ignored files too

       -p, --print
              print filenames instead of deleting them

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs (implies -p/--print)

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

              aliases: clean

   rebase
       command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor

       This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing Mercurial repos&#8208;
       itory.

       For more information: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension

   Commands
   rebase
       hg rebase [-s REV | -b REV] [-d REV] [options]
       hg rebase {-a|-c}

       Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of history
       (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be useful for  lin&#8208;
       earizing local changes relative to a master development tree.

       You  should not rebase changesets that have already been shared with oth&#8208;
       ers. Doing so will force everybody else to perform  the  same  rebase  or
       they will end up with duplicated changesets after pulling in your rebased
       changesets.

       If you don&apos;t specify a destination changeset (-d/--dest), rebase uses the
       tipmost  head of the current named branch as the destination. (The desti&#8208;
       nation changeset is not modified by  rebasing,  but  new  changesets  are
       added as its descendants.)

       You  can  specify  which  changesets to rebase in two ways: as a &quot;source&quot;
       changeset or as a &quot;base&quot; changeset. Both are shorthand  for  a  topologi&#8208;
       cally  related  set  of  changesets (the &quot;source branch&quot;). If you specify
       source (-s/--source), rebase will rebase that changeset and  all  of  its
       descendants  onto  dest.  If  you  specify  base (-b/--base), rebase will
       select ancestors of base back to but not including  the  common  ancestor
       with  dest. Thus, -b is less precise but more convenient than -s: you can
       specify any changeset in the source branch, and rebase  will  select  the
       whole branch. If you specify neither -s nor -b, rebase uses the parent of
       the working directory as the base.
&#12;       By default, rebase recreates the  changesets  in  the  source  branch  as
       descendants  of  dest and then destroys the originals. Use --keep to pre&#8208;
       serve the original source  changesets.  Some  changesets  in  the  source
       branch  (e.g.  merges from the destination branch) may be dropped if they
       no longer contribute any change.

       One result of the rules  for  selecting  the  destination  changeset  and
       source branch is that, unlike merge, rebase will do nothing if you are at
       the latest (tipmost) head of a named branch with two heads. You  need  to
       explicitly  specify  source  and/or  destination  (or update to the other
       head, if it&apos;s the head of the intended source branch).

       If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a merge, it can be contin&#8208;
       ued with --continue/-c or aborted with --abort/-a.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase.

       Options:

       -s, --source
              rebase from the specified changeset

       -b, --base
              rebase  from  the  base of the specified changeset (up to greatest
              common ancestor of base and dest)

       -r, --rev
              rebase these revisions

       -d, --dest
              rebase onto the specified changeset

       --collapse
              collapse the rebased changesets

       -m, --message
              use text as collapse commit message

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -l, --logfile
              read collapse commit message from file

       --keep keep original changesets

       --keepbranches
              keep original branch names

       -D, --detach
              force detaching of source from its original branch

       -t, --tool
              specify merge tool

       -c, --continue
              continue an interrupted rebase

       -a, --abort
              abort an interrupted rebase

       --style
              display using template map file

       --template
              display with template

   record
       commands to interactively select changes for commit/qrefresh

   Commands
   qrecord
       hg qrecord [OPTION]... PATCH [FILE]...

       See hg help qnew &amp; hg help record for more information and usage.

   record
       hg record [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by hg status will  be
       candidates for recording.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       You will be prompted for whether to record changes to each modified file,
       and for files with multiple changes, for each change  to  use.  For  each
       query, the following responses are possible:

       y - record this change
       n - skip this change
       e - edit this change manually

       s - skip remaining changes to this file
       f - record remaining changes to this file
&#12;       d - done, skip remaining changes and files
       a - record all changes to all remaining files
       q - quit, recording no changes

       ? - display help

       This command is not available when committing a merge.

       Options:

       -A, --addremove
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       --close-branch
              mark a branch as closed, hiding it from the branch list

       --amend
              amend the parent of the working dir

       -I, --include
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X, --exclude
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m, --message
              use text as commit message

       -l, --logfile
              read commit message from file

       -d, --date
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u, --user
              record the specified user as committer

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -w, --ignore-all-space
              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

   relink
       recreates hardlinks between repository clones

   Commands
   relink
       hg relink [ORIGIN]

       When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be hardlinked
       so that they only use the space of a single repository.

       Unfortunately,  subsequent  pulls  into  either  repository  will   break
       hardlinks  for  any  files  touched  by  the new changesets, even if both
       repositories end up pulling the same changes.

       Similarly, passing --rev to &quot;hg clone&quot; will fail to  use  any  hardlinks,
       falling back to a complete copy of the source repository.

       This  command  lets  you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that wasted
       space.

       This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN,  which  must
       be   on   the   same   local  disk.  If  ORIGIN  is  omitted,  looks  for
       &quot;default-relink&quot;, then &quot;default&quot;, in [paths].

       Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while  the  command
       is running. (Both repositories will be locked against writes.)

   schemes
       extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms

       This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a lot
       of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:

       [schemes]
       py = http://code.python.org/hg/

       After that you can use it like:

       hg clone py://trunk/

       Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for  example
       used by Google Code:

       [schemes]
       gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
&#12;       The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited num&#8208;
       ber of variables, starting with {1} and continuing with {2}, {3}  and  so
       on.  This  variables will receive parts of URL supplied, split by /. Any&#8208;
       thing not specified as {part} will be just appended to an URL.

       For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:

       [schemes]
       py = http://hg.python.org/
       bb = https://bitbucket.org/
       bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
       gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
       kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/

       You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new  scheme  with  the
       same name.

   share
       share a common history between several working directories

   Commands
   share
       hg share [-U] SOURCE [DEST]

       Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its history
       with another repository.

       Note   using rollback or  extensions  that  destroy/modify  history  (mq,
              rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared clones.
              In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to  the  same
              changeset,  and one of them destroys that changeset with rollback,
              the other clone will suddenly stop working:  all  operations  will
              fail  with &quot;abort: working directory has unknown parent&quot;. The only
              known workaround is to use debugsetparents on the broken clone  to
              reset it to a changeset that still exists (e.g. tip).

       Options:

       -U, --noupdate
              do not create a working copy

   unshare
       hg unshare

       Copy the store data to the repo and remove the sharedpath data.

   transplant
       command to transplant changesets from another branch

       This extension allows you to transplant patches from another branch.

       Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a map
       from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.

   Commands
   transplant
       hg transplant [-s REPO] [-b BRANCH [-a]] [-p REV] [-m REV] [REV]...

       Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working  direc&#8208;
       tory  with  the  log of the original changeset. The changesets are copied
       and will thus appear twice in  the  history.  Use  the  rebase  extension
       instead if you want to move a whole branch of unpublished changesets.

       If  --log  is specified, log messages will have a comment appended of the
       form:

       (transplanted from CHANGESETHASH)

       You can rewrite the changelog message  with  the  --filter  option.   Its
       argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as $1 and the
       patch as $2.

       If --source/-s is specified, selects changesets from  the  named  reposi&#8208;
       tory.  If  --branch/-b  is  specified, selects changesets from the branch
       holding the named revision, up to that revision. If  --all/-a  is  speci&#8208;
       fied,  all  changesets  on the branch will be transplanted, otherwise you
       will be prompted to select the changesets you want.

       hg transplant --branch REVISION --all will transplant the selected branch
       (up to the named revision) onto your current working directory.

       You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge change&#8208;
       sets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors  of  a  merged
       transplant,  and  you  can  merge descendants of them normally instead of
       transplanting them.

       Merge changesets may be transplanted directly by  specifying  the  proper
       parent changeset by calling hg transplant --parent.

       If  no  merges  or  revisions  are  provided, hg transplant will start an
       interactive changeset browser.

       If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand and  then
       resume where you left off by calling hg transplant --continue/-c.
&#12;       Options:

       -s, --source
              pull patches from REPO

       -b, --branch
              pull patches from branch BRANCH

       -a, --all
              pull all changesets up to BRANCH

       -p, --prune
              skip over REV

       -m, --merge
              merge at REV

       --parent
              parent to choose when transplanting merge

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       --log  append transplant info to log message

       -c, --continue
              continue last transplant session after repair

       --filter
              filter changesets through command

   win32mbcs
       allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings

       Some  MBCS  encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.  split&#8208;
       ting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call such  a
       encoding  (i.e.  shift_jis  and  big5)  as  &quot;problematic encoding&quot;.  This
       extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings  by  wrapping
       some functions to convert to Unicode string before path operation.

       This extension is useful for:

       &#183; Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.

       &#183; Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.

       &#183; All  users  who  use  a repository with one of problematic encodings on
         case-insensitive file system.

       This extension is not needed for:

       &#183; Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.

       &#183; Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.

       Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:

       &#183; You should use single encoding in one repository.

       &#183; If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.

       &#183; win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.

       By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by  Mercurial.   You
       can specify the encoding by config option:

       [win32mbcs]
       encoding = sjis

       It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF-8 log message.

   win32text
       perform automatic newline conversion

          Deprecation:  The  win32text extension requires each user to configure
          the extension again and again for each clone since  the  configuration
          is not copied when cloning.

          We  have therefore made the eol as an alternative. The eol uses a ver&#8208;
          sion controlled file for its configuration and each clone will  there&#8208;
          fore use the right settings from the start.

       To perform automatic newline conversion, use:

       [extensions]
       win32text =
       [encode]
       ** = cleverencode:
       # or ** = macencode:

       [decode]
       ** = cleverdecode:
       # or ** = macdecode:

       If  not doing conversion, to make sure you do not commit CRLF/CR by acci&#8208;
       dent:

       [hooks]
       pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

       To do the same check on a server to prevent CRLF/CR from being pushed  or
       pulled:

       [hooks]
       pretxnchangegroup.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxnchangegroup.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

   zeroconf
       discover and advertise repositories on the local network

       The  zeroconf  extension will advertise hg serve instances over DNS-SD so
       that they can be discovered using the hg  paths command  without  knowing
       the server&apos;s address.

       To  allow  other people to discover your repository using run hg serve in
       your repository:

       $ cd test
       $ hg serve

       You can discover Zeroconf-enabled repositories by running hg paths:

       $ hg paths
       zc-test = http://example.com:8000/test

FILES
       /etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc

              This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in  .hg/hgrc
              override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override settings made in
              the global  /etc/mercurial/hgrc  configuration.   See  hgrc(5) for
              details of the contents and format of these files.

       .hgignore

              This  file  contains  regular  expressions  (one  per  line)  that
              describe file names that should be ignored by hg. For details, see
              hgignore(5).

       .hgsub

              This  file defines the locations of all subrepositories, and tells
              where the subrepository checkouts came from. For details,  see  hg
              help subrepos.

       .hgsubstate

              This  file is where Mercurial stores all nested repository states.
              NB: This file should not be edited manually.

       .hgtags

              This file contains changeset hash values and text tag  names  (one
              of each separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of
              the repository contents. The file content is encoded using UTF-8.

       .hg/last-message.txt

              This file is used by hg commit to store a  backup  of  the  commit
              message in case the commit fails.

       .hg/localtags

              This  file  can  be used to define local tags which are not shared
              among repositories. The file format is the same  as  for  .hgtags,
              but it is encoded using the local system encoding.

       Some  commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in .orig, if the
       .orig file already exists and is not tracked by  Mercurial,  it  will  be
       overwritten.

BUGS
       Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (see Resources below)
       when you find them.
