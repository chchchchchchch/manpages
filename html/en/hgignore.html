HGIGNORE(5)                     Mercurial Manual                     HGIGNORE(5)



NAME
       hgignore - syntax for Mercurial ignore files

SYNOPSIS
       The  Mercurial  system uses a file called .hgignore in the root directory
       of a repository to control its behavior when it searches for  files  that
       it is not currently tracking.

DESCRIPTION
       The  working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain files
       that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup files  cre&#8208;
       ated by editors and build products created by compilers.  These files can
       be ignored by listing them in a .hgignore file in the root of the working
       directory.  The  .hgignore file must be created manually. It is typically
       put under version control, so that the settings will propagate  to  other
       repositories with push and pull.

       An  untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository root
       directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against  any  pat&#8208;
       tern in .hgignore.

       For  example, say we have an untracked file, file.c, at a/b/file.c inside
       our repository. Mercurial will ignore file.c if any pattern in  .hgignore
       matches a/b/file.c, a/b or a.

       In  addition,  a  Mercurial  configuration  file  can  reference a set of
       per-user or global ignore files. See the ignore configuration key on  the
       [ui]  section  of  hg  help  config for details of how to configure these
       files.

       To control Mercurial&apos;s handling of files that it manages,  many  commands
       support the -I and -X options; see hg help &lt;command&gt; and hg help patterns
       for details.

SYNTAX
       An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of  a  list  of  patterns,
       with  one  pattern  per line. Empty lines are skipped. The # character is
       treated as a comment character, and the \  character  is  treated  as  an
       escape character.

       Mercurial  supports  several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used is
       Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where NAME is one of the following:

       regexp

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       glob

              Shell-style glob.

       The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that  follow,
       until another syntax is selected.

       Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of the
       form *.c will match a file ending in .c in any directory,  and  a  regexp
       pattern  of  the  form  \.c$  will do the same. To root a regexp pattern,
       start it with ^.

       Note   Patterns specified in other  than  .hgignore  are  always  rooted.
              Please see hg help patterns for details.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/
