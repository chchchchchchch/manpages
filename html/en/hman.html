hman(1)                                                                  hman(1)



NAME
       hman - browse the on-line manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       hman [ -P browser ] [ -H host ] [ section ] name
       hman [ -P browser ] [ -H host ] [ section ] [ index ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  hman  script is an interface to man2html(1) that allows you to enter
       man page requests at the  command  line  and  view  the  output  in  your
       favourite  browser.  The behaviour reminds of that of man(1) so that many
       people will be able to alias hman to man.  If the browser  used  is  net&#8208;
       scape,  and an incarnation of netscape is running already, hman will pass
       the request to the existing browser.


OPTIONS
       -P  browser
              Specify which browser (like lynx, xmosaic,  arena,  chimera,  net&#8208;
              scape, amaya, ...) to use.  This option overrides the MANHTMLPAGER
              environment variable.  The default is  the  non-httpd  version  of
              lynx, or sensible-browser if lynx cannot be found.

       -H  host
              Specify  from  what  host to get the man pages.  This option over&#8208;
              rides the MANHTMLHOST environment variable.  The default is local&#8208;
              host.


ENVIRONMENT
       MANHTMLPAGER
              The  default  browser  to  use  is selected using this environment
              variable.

       MANHTMLHOST
              The default host to use is selected using this  environment  vari&#8208;
              able.
