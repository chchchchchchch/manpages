HSMARKDOWN(1)                                                      HSMARKDOWN(1)



NAME
       hsmarkdown - convert markdown-formatted text to HTML

SYNOPSIS
       hsmarkdown [input-file]...

DESCRIPTION
       hsmarkdown  converts  markdown-formatted text to HTML.  It is designed to
       be usable as a drop-in replacement for John Gruber&apos;s Markdown.pl.

       If no input-file is specified, input is read from stdin.  Otherwise,  the
       input-files are concatenated (with a blank line between each) and used as
       input.  Output goes to stdout by default.  For  output  to  a  file,  use
       shell redirection:


             hsmarkdown input.txt &gt; output.html

       hsmarkdown is implemented as a symlink to the pandoc(1) executable.  When
       called under the name hsmarkdown, pandoc behaves as if it had been called
       with  the  options  --from markdown --to html --strict  and  disables all
       other options.  (Command-line options will be interpreted  as  filenames,
       as they are by Markdown.pl.)

SEE ALSO
       pandoc(1).   The  README file distributed with Pandoc contains full docu&#8208;
       mentation.

       The Pandoc source code and  all  documentation  may  be  downloaded  from
       &lt;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/&gt;.
