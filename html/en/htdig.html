htdig(1)                                                                htdig(1)



NAME
       htdig - retrieve HTML documents for ht://Dig search engine

SYNOPSIS
       htdig [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and gathers infor&#8208;
       mation from these documents which can later be used to search these docu&#8208;
       ments. This program can be referred to as the search robot.

OPTIONS
       -      Get  the  list of URLs to start indexing from standard input. This
              will override the default parameter  start_url  specified  in  the
              config file  and the file supplied to the -m option.

       -a     Use  alternate work files. Tells htdig to append .work to database
              files, causing a second copy of the database  to  be  built.  This
              allows the original files to be used by htsearch during the index&#8208;
              ing run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -h maxhops
              Restrict the dig to documents that are at most maxhops links  away
              from  the  starting document. This only works if option -i is also
              given.

       -i     Initial. Do not use any  old  databases.  Old  databases  will  be
              erased before running the program.

       -m filename
              Minimal  run.  Only  index  the  URLs  given in the file filename,
              ignoring all others. URLs in the file should be formatted one  URL
              per line.

       -s     Print statistics about the dig after completion.

       -t     Create an ASCII version of the document database. This database is
              easy to parse with other  programs  so  that  information  can  be
              extracted  from  it  for  purposes other than searching. One could
              gather some interesting statistics from this database.

              cB cB  c  l  .   Fieldname Value  u    URL  t    Title  a    State
                   (0  normal, 1 not found, 2 not indexed, 3 obsolete) m    Time
              of last modification reported by the server s    Document Size  in
              bytes H    Excerpt of the document h    Meta Description l    Time
              of last retrieval L    Count of links in the document or  of  out&#8208;
              going  links  b    Number  of  links  to the document, also called
                   incoming links or backlinks c    Hop count of  this  document
              g    Signature  of  this document      (used to detect duplicates)
              e    E-Mail address  to  use  for  a  notification  from  htnotify
              n    Date  on  which such notification is sent S    Subject of the
              notifcation message d    The text of Incoming  links  pointing  to
              this   document        (e.g.   &lt;a   href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;)
              A    Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)

       -u username:password
              Tells htdig to send the supplied username and password  with  each
              HTTP  request.  The  credentials will be encoded using the &#180;Basic&#180;
              authentication method. There HAS to be a  colon  (:)  between  the
              username and password.

       -v     Verbose  mode.  This increases the verbosity of the program. Using
              more than 2 is probably only useful for  debugging  purposes.  The
              default  verbose  mode  (using  only one -v) gives a nice progress
              report while digging. Please consult  the  section  below  on  the
              exact format of the progress report.


       FORMAT OF THE PROGRESS REPORT GIVEN IN VERBOSE MODE
              A  line  is  shown for each URL, with 3 numbers before the URL and
              some symbols after the URL. The first number is the number of doc&#8208;
              uments  parsed  so far, the second is the DocID for this document,
              and the third is the hop count of the  document  (number  of  hops
              from one of the start_url documents). Signification of the symbols
              printed after the url:

              &quot;*&quot; is printed for a link already visited

              &quot;+&quot; is printed for a new link just queued

              &quot;-&quot; is output for a link rejected for any of a number of  reasons.
              To  find out what those reasons are, you need to run htdig with at
              least 3 -v options, i.e. -vvv.

       If there are no &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; symbols after the URL,  it  doesn&apos;t  mean
       the document was not parsed or was empty, but only that no links to other
       documents were found within it. With more verbose output,  these  symbols
       will get interspersed in several lines of debugging output.


       FILES

       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
