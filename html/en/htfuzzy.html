NAME
       htfuzzy  -  fuzzy  command-line  search  utility  for the ht://Dig search
       engine

SYNOPSIS
       htfuzzy [-c configfile] [-v] algorithm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Description to follow here

OPTIONS
       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -v     Verbose mode Use this to get more  verbose  output  while  running
              htfuzzy. More than one v can be specified (ie.  -vv , -vvv
               etc  ).  Specifying more than two v&apos;s is probably only useful for
              debugging purposes.

Supported Algorithms
       Different algorithms are supported for searching:
              soundex Creates  a slightly modified soundex key database. Differ&#8208;
              ences  with  the standard soundex algorithm are: Keys are 6 digits
              and the first letter is also encoded.        metaphone  Creates  a
              metaphone  key  database.  This algorithm is more specific to Eng&#8208;
              lish, but  will  get  fewer   &quot;weird&quot;  matches  than  the  soundex
              algorithm.

              accents (No description of the algorithm at the moment)

              endings  Creates   two   databases  which  can  be  used  to match
              common word endings. The creation of these  databases  requires  a
              list of affix rules and a dictionary which uses those affix rules.
              The format of the affix  rules and  dictionary  files are the ones
              used by the ispell program. Included with the distribution are the
              affix rules for English and a  fairly  small  English  dictionary.
              Other  languages  can  be  supported  by  getting  the appropriate
              affix rules and dictionaries. These are available  for  many  lan&#8208;
              guages; check the ispell distribution for more details.

              synonyms Creates a database of synonyms for words. It reads a text
              database of synonyms and creates a  database  that  htsearch   can
              then  use.  Each line of the text database consists of words where
              the first word will have the other words on that line as synonyms.


Notes on searching
       Please consult specialised literature to find out how the different algo&#8208;
       rithms work or simply try another
              search strategy you do not get the intended search results.


FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
