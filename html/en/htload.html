htload(1)                                                              htload(1)



NAME
       htload - reads in an ASCII-text version of the document database

SYNOPSIS
       htload [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Htload   reads  in  an ASCII-text version of the document database in the
       same form as the  -t  option  of  htdig  and  htdump. Note that this will
       overwrite data in your databases, so this should be used with great care.

OPTIONS
       -a     Use alternate work files. Tells htload to append .work to database
              files, allowing it to operate on a second set of databases.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -i     Initial.  Do  not use any old databases. This is  accomplished  by
              first erasing the databases.

       -v     Verbose mode. This doesn&apos;t have much effect.

File Formats
       Document Database
              Each  line  in  the file starts with the document id followed by a
              list of fieldname : value separated by  tabs.  The  fields  always
              appear in the order listed below:

       u      URL

       t      Title

       a      State (0 = normal, 1 = not found, 2 = not indexed, 3 = obsolete)

       m      Last modification time as reported by the server

       s      Size in bytes

       H      Excerpt

       h      Meta description

       l      Time of last retrieval

       L      Count of the links in the document (outgoing links)

       b      Count of the links to the document (incoming links or backlinks)

       c      HopCount of this document

       g      Signature of the document used for duplicate-detection

       e      E-mail address to use for a notification message from htnotify

       n      Date to send out a notification e-mail message

       S      Subject for a notification e-mail message

       d      The   text   of   links   pointing  to  this  document.  (e.g.  &lt;a
              href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;)
&#12;       A      Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)

       Word Database
              While  htdump  and  htload  don&apos;t  deal  with  the  word  database
              directly,  it&apos;s  worth mentioning it here because you need to deal
              with it when copying  the  ASCII  databases  from  one  system  to
              another. The initial word database produced by htdig is already in
              ASCII format, and a binary version of it is produced  by  htmerge,
              for  use  by htsearch. So, when you copy over the ASCII version of
              the document database produced by htdump, you need  to  copy  over
              the  wordlist as well, then run htload to make the binary document
              database on the target system, followed by running htmerge to make
              the word index.

       Each line in the word list file starts with the word
              followed  by  a  list  of fieldname : value separated by tabs. The
              fields always appear in the order listed below, with the last  two
              being optional:

       i      Document ID

       l      Location of word in document (1 to 1000)

       w      Weight of word based on scoring factors

       c      Count of word&apos;s appearances in document, if more than 1

       a      Anchor number if word occurred after a named anchor

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.

       /var/lib/htdig/db.docs
              The default ASCII document database file.

       /var/lib/htdig/db.wordlist
              The default ASCII word database file.
