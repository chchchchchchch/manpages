NAME
       htmerge - create document index and word database for the ht://Dig search
       engine

SYNOPSIS
       htmerge [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Htmerge is used to create a document index and  word  database  from  the
       files  that  were  created  by  htdig.  These  databases are then used by
       htsearch to perform the actual searched.

OPTIONS
       -a     Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to append .work to  database
              files,  causing  a  second  copy of the database to be built. This
              allows the original files to be used by htsearch during the index&#8208;
              ing run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -d     Prevent the document index from being created.

       -s     Print  statistics  about  the  document  and  word databases after
              htmerge has finished.

       -v     Run in verbose mode. This  will  provide  some  hints  as  to  the
              progress  of  the  merge.  This can be useful when running htmerge
              interactively since some parts (especially the word database  cre&#8208;
              ation) can take a very long time.

       -w     Prevent the word database from being created.

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR In  addition to the command line options, the environment variable
              TMPDIR will be used to designate the directory where  intermediate
              files are stored during the sorting process.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
