NAME
       html2ps - convert HTML to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       html2ps [ -2cdDFghHLnORtTuUv ] [ -b URL ] [ -C string ] [ -e encoding ] [
       -f file[:file[:...]]  ] [ -i num ] [ -k file ] [ -l lang ] [ -m num  ]  [
       -M num ] [ -N num ] [ -o file ] [ -r path ] [ -s num ] [ -S string ] [ -W
       string ] [ -x num ] [ URL|file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The program html2ps converts HTML to PostScript. The  HTML  code  can  be
       retrieved  from one or more URL:s or local files, specified as parameters
       on the command line.  If no parameter is given, html2ps reads from  stan&#8208;
       dard input.

       Note:  To  avoid  unnecessary network traffic, one can rebuild an already
       generated PostScript file with new  options.  This  is  done  by  running
       html2ps  with  the new options, and with the old PostScript file as input
       (not applicable for all options).

OPTIONS
       All options have a short (case sensitive), and a long (case  insensitive)
       form.

       -2 --twoup
              Two column (2-up) output. The default is one column per page.

       -b URL --base URL
              Use  URL  as  a  base  to  expand  relative references for in-line
              images. This is useful if you have  downloaded  a  document  to  a
              local  file.  The URL should then be the URL of the original docu&#8208;
              ment.

       -c --check
              Check the syntax of  the  HTML  file  (using  an  external  syntax
              checker). The default is to not make a syntax check.

       -C string --toc string
              Generate  a  table of contents (ToC). The value should be a string
              consisting of one of the letters &apos;f&apos;, &apos;h&apos;, or &apos;t&apos;, optionally com&#8208;
              bined with the letter &apos;b&apos;:

              b      The  ToC  will  be printed first. This requires that Ghost&#8208;
                     script is installed.
              f      The ToC will be generated from the links in  the  converted
                     document.
              h      The  ToC  will be generated from headings and titles in the
                     converted documents. Note that if the document  author  for
                     some  strange  reason has chosen to use some other means to
                     represent the headings than the  HTML  elements  H1,...,H6,
                     you are out of luck!
              t      The  ToC  will be generated from links having the attribute
                     rev=TOC in the converted document.

       -d --debug
              Generate debugging information. You should always use this  option
              when reporting problems with html2ps.

       -D --dsc --DSC
              Generate  DSC  compliant PostScript. This requires Ghostscript and
              can take quite some time to do. Note that a PostScript file gener&#8208;
              ated  with  this  option  cannot  be  used as input to html2ps for
              reformatting later.

       -e encoding --encoding encoding
              The document encoding. Currently recognized values are ISO-8859-1,
              EUC-JP,  SHIFT-JIS,  and  ISO-2022-JP  (other EUC-xx encodings may
              also work). The default is ISO-8859-1.

       -f file[:file[:...]] --rcfile file[:file[:...]]
              A colon separated list of configuration file names to use  instead
              of the default personal configuration file $HOME/.html2psrc.  Def&#8208;
              initions made in one file override definitions in  previous  files
              (the  last file in the list has highest precedence). An empty file
              name (as in &apos;:file&apos;, &apos;file1::file3&apos;, or &apos;file:&apos;)  will  expand  to
              the default personal file. The environment variable HTML2PSPATH is
              used to specify the directories where to search for  these  files.
              (Note:  this  is only supposed to be used on the command line, not
              in a configuration file.)

       -F --frame
              Draw a frame around the text on each page. The default is  to  not
              draw a frame.

       -g --grayscale
              Convert  colour  images  to  grayscale images. Note that the Post&#8208;
              Script file will be smaller  when  the  images  are  converted  to
              grayscale. The default is to generate colour images.

       -h --help
              Show usage information.

       -H --hyphenate
              Hyphenate the text. This requires TeX hyphenation pattern files.

       -i num --scaleimage num
              Scale in-line images with a factor num The default is 1.

       -k file --cookie file
              Enable  cookie  support,  using  a  netscape formatted cookie file
              (requires libwww-perl).

       -l lang --language lang
              Specifies the language of the document (overrides an eventual LANG
              attribute  of  the  BODY  element).   The language should be given
              according to RFC1766 (ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt) and ISO
              639 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm).

       -L --landscape
              Generate  code for printing in landscape mode. The default is por&#8208;
              trait mode.

       -m num --scalemath num
              Scale mathematical formulas with a factor num The default is 1.

       -M num --mainchapter num
              Specifies the start number for automatic numbering of headings (by
              setting the seq-number parameter), the default is 1.

       -n --number
              Insert page numbers. The default is to not number the pages.

       -N num --startno num
              Specifies the starting page number, the default is 1.

       -o file --output file
              Write  the  PostScript  code  to file.  The default is to write to
              standard output.

       -O --original
              Use PostScript original images if they exist. For  example,  if  a
              document  contains  an image figure.gif, and an encapsulated Post&#8208;
              Script file named figure.ps exists in  the  same  directory,  that
              file  will  be  use  instead. This only work for documents read as
              local files. Note: if the PostScript file  is  large  or  contains
              bitmap  images,  this must be combined with the -D option. In HTML
              4.0 this can be achieved in a much better way with:

              &lt;OBJECT data=&quot;figure.ps&quot; type=&quot;application/postscript&quot;&gt;
              &lt;OBJECT data=&quot;figure.gif&quot; type=&quot;image/gif&quot;&gt;
              &lt;PRE&gt;[Maybe some ASCII art for text browsers]&lt;/PRE&gt;
              &lt;/OBJECT&gt;
              &lt;/OBJECT&gt;

       -r path --rootdir path
              When a document is read from a local file, this value specifies  a
              base  directory  for  resolving  relative links starting with &quot;/&quot;.
              Typically, this should be the directory where  your  web  server&apos;s
              home page resides.

       -R --xref
              Insert  cross  references  at every link to within the set of con&#8208;
              verted documents.

       -s num --scaledoc num
              Scale the entire document with a factor num The default is 1.

       -S string --style string
              This option complements/overrides definitions made in the configu&#8208;
              ration  files.  The string must follow the configuration file syn&#8208;
              tax. (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the command  line,
              not in a configuration file.)

       -t --titlepage
              Generate a title page. The default is to not generate one.

       -T --text
              Text mode, ignore images. The default is to include the images.

       -u --underline
              Underline  text  that constitutes a hypertext link. The default is
              to not underline.

       -U --colour
              Produce colour output for text  and  background,  when  specified.
              The  default  is  black text on white background (mnemonic: coloUr
              ;-).

       -v --version
              Print information about the current version of html2ps.

       -W string --web string
              Process a web of documents by  recursively  retrieve  and  convert
              documents  that  are referenced with hyperlinks. When dealing with
              remote documents it will of course be necessary to impose restric&#8208;
              tions,  to avoid downloading the entire web... The value should be
              a string consisting of one of the letters &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;l&apos;,  &apos;r&apos;,  or
              &apos;s&apos;,  optionally  combined  with a combination of the letters &apos;p&apos;,
              &apos;L&apos;, and a positive integer:

              a      Follow all links.
              b      Follow only links to within the same directory,  or  below,
                     as the start document.
              l      Follow  only  links specified with &quot;&lt;LINK rel=NEXT&gt;&quot; in the
                     document.
              p      Prompt for each remote document. This mode  will  automati&#8208;
                     cally be entered after the first 50 documents.
              r      Follow only relative links.
              s      Follow  only  links  to within the same server as the start
                     document.
              L      With this option, the order in which the documents are pro&#8208;
                     cessed  will  be:  first  all top level documents, then the
                     documents linked to from these etc.  For  example,  if  the
                     document A has links to B and C, and B has a link to D, the
                     order will be A-B-C-D.  By default, each document  will  be
                     followed  by  the  first  document  it links to etc; so the
                     default order for the example is A-B-D-C.
              #      A positive integer giving the number of  recursive  levels.
                     The default is 4 (when the option is present).

       -x num --duplex num
              Generate  postscript code for single or double sided printing.  No
              default, valid values are:

              0      Single sided.
              1      Double sided.
              2      Double sided, opposite page reversed (tumble mode).

BUGS
       (This is incomplete.)

       The CELLSPACING attribute of the TABLE  element  is  not  implemented  as
       described  in  the  specification;  instead  the value of the CELLPADDING
       attribute is increased by half the value of CELLSPACING.

       Rendering HTML tables well is a non-trivial task. For &quot;real&quot; tables, that
       is  representation  of tabular data, html2ps usually generates reasonably
       good output. When tables are used for layout purposes, the result  varies
       from good to useless. This is because a table cell is never broken across
       pages. So if a table contains a cell with a lot of  content,  the  entire
       table  may  have to be scaled down in size in order to make this cell fit
       on a single page. Sometimes this may even result in unreadable output.

       Page breaks are occasionally done in bad  places:  for  example  directly
       after a (long) heading, and before the last line in a paragraph.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML2PSPATH
              This  variable  specifies the directories to search for configura&#8208;
              tion files. It should be  a  colon  separated  list  of  directory
              names.  Use  a  dot  &apos;.&apos; to denote the current directory. An empty
              directory name (as in &apos;:dir&apos;, &apos;dir1::dir3&apos;, or &apos;dir:&apos;) will expand
              to  the  directory  where  the  global  configuration file is. The
              default value is &apos;.:&apos;,  that  is:  search  the  current  directory
              first, and then the global one.


FILES
       $HOME/.html2psrc
              User configuration file, see html2psrc(5).
