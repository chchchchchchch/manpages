html2psrc(5)            html2ps configuration file format           html2psrc(5)



NAME
       html2psrc - configuration file format for html2ps(1)

DESCRIPTION
       Configuration  files  are  used  for layout control, resource information
       etc. Normally, there should always exist a global configuration file.  In
       this  file one typically specify things like: what image conversion pack&#8208;
       ages are available on the system, the default  paper  size,  the  default
       text fonts and sizes, etc.

       For  Unix  and  Windows systems, the installation script &apos;install&apos; can be
       used to automatically build a global configuration file with  all  neces&#8208;
       sary  definitions,  and  install  all  files.  The  files replaced by the
       installation are saved. If you for some reason are not satisfied with the
       new  version: execute the script &apos;backout&apos; to reinstall your earlier ver&#8208;
       sion.

       On other systems, you will have to manually create a global configuration
       file,  and insert the name of this file into the html2ps script (close to
       the beginning, the line starting with &quot;$globrc=&quot;). The configuration file
       should contain a package block, and perhaps paper and hyphenation blocks,
       described below.

       Each user can  then  have  a  personal  configuration  file  (by  default
       $HOME/.html2psrc)  that complements/overrides the definitions made in the
       global file. It is also possible to specify alternative files on the com&#8208;
       mand line, using the -f option.

FILE FORMAT
       A  configuration file can include other configuration files. This is done
       with:

          @import &quot;filename&quot;;

       The rest of the configuration file consists of zero or  more  blocks.   A
       block is given by a block name, followed by the block definition, as in:

          BODY {
            font-size: 12pt;
            font-family: Helvetica;
            text-align: justify
          }

       The  block  definition,  enclosed  by curly braces: { }, consists of key-
       value pairs and/or other blocks. A key-value pair  consists  of  the  key
       name  followed  by  a  colon, followed by the value. Blocks and key-value
       pairs are separated by semicolons. The semicolon may be omitted  after  a
       block.

       Several  blocks  can  share the same definition. The block names are then
       separated be commas, as in:

          H2, H4, H6 { font-style: italic }

       A comment in a configuration file starts with  the  characters  &quot;/*&quot;  and
       ends with &quot;*/&quot;:

          @html2ps {
            seq-number: 1;  /* Automatic numbering of headings */
          }

       Notations

       Here are some definitions of terms used below:

              Flag:  A value of either 0 (absence, inactive etc) or 1 (presence,
                     active etc).
              Absolute size:
                     A real number optionally followed by one of  the  following
                     two-letter unit identifiers: cm (centimeters), mm (millime&#8208;
                     ters), in (inches),  pt  (points,  1pt  =  1/72  inch),  pc
                     (picas, 1pc = 12pt). The default unit is centimeters.
              Relative size:
                     A  size  relative to current fontsize. The default and cur&#8208;
                     rently only recognized unit is em. One em equals  the  size
                     of  the  current font.  The value should be given as a real
                     number, optionally followed by &apos;em&apos;, as in &apos;0.25em&apos;.
              Whitespace:
                     Any one of the characters: space, tab, newline, or carriage
                     return.

       CSS2 blocks

       All  blocks,  except  one: the @html2ps block, coincides with a subset of
       the   Cascading   Style    Sheets,    level    2    CSS2    Specification
       (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/).   The  following  default  settings for
       html2ps illustrate just about everything that currently can be used  from
       the CSS2 specification:

          BODY {
            font-family: Times;
            font-size: 11pt;
            text-align: left;
            background: white;
          }

          H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 {
            font-weight: bold;
            margin-top: 0.8em;
            margin-bottom: 0.5em;
          }
          H1 { font-size: 19pt }
          H2 { font-size: 17pt }
          H3 { font-size: 15pt }
          H4 { font-size: 13pt }
          H5 { font-size: 12pt }
          H6 { font-size: 11pt }

          P, OL, UL, DL, BLOCKQUOTE, PRE {
            margin-top: 1em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
          }

          P {
            line-height: 1.2em;
            text-indent: 0;
          }

          OL, UL, DD { margin-left: 2em }

          TT, KBD, PRE { font-family: Courier }

          PRE { font-size: 9pt }

          BLOCKQUOTE {
            margin-left: 1em;
            margin-right: 1em;
          }

          ADDRESS {
            margin-top: 0.5em;
            margin-bottom: 0.5em;
          }

          TABLE {
            margin-top: 1.3em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
          }

          DIV.noprint { display: none }

          DEL { text-decoration: line-through }

          A:link, HR { color: black }

          @page {
            margin-left: 2.5cm;
            margin-right: 2.5cm;
            margin-top: 3cm;
            margin-bottom: 3cm;
          }

       The program specific block @html2ps:

       This  block  is  used to specify parameters that are specific to html2ps,
       and not covered by CSS2. The @html2ps  block has several  sub-blocks  and
       key-value pairs, these are described in this section.

       The package block
            This  block  is used to specify which program packages are installed
            on the system. Typically, this is done in the  global  configuration
            file.

            PerlMagick
                   A  flag  specifying  whether  the  Perl  module PerlMagick is
                   installed or not. The default is 0.

            ImageMagick
                   A  flag  specifying  whether  the  ImageMagick   package   is
                   installed or not. The default is 0.

            pbmplus
                   A flag specifying whether the pbmplus package is installed or
                   not. The default is 0.

            netpbm A flag specifying whether the netpbm package is installed  or
                   not. The default is 0.

            djpeg  A  flag  specifying  whether  djpeg is installed or not.  The
                   default is 0.

            Ghostscript
                   A flag specifying whether Ghostscript is  installed  or  not.
                   The default is 0.

            TeX    A  flag  specifying  whether  the TeX package is installed or
                   not.  The default is 0.

            dvips  A flag specifying whether dvips is  installed  or  not.   The
                   default is 0.

            libwww-perl
                   A flag specifying whether the Perl module library libwww-perl
                   is installed or not. The default is 0.

            geturl When neither of the Perl packages for retrieving remote docu&#8208;
                   ments are available, it is possible to use some other program
                   like wget or lynx. This value should be set to a command that
                   retrieves  a  document  with  a complete MIME header, such as
                   &quot;wget -s -q -O-&quot; or &quot;lynx -source -mime_header&quot;.

            check  The name of a program used for  syntax  checking  HTML  docu&#8208;
                   ments.  No default, a good choice is weblint.

            path   A  colon  separated list of directories where the executables
                   from the program  packages  are.  It  is  only  necessary  to
                   include  directories  that  are not in the PATH for a typical
                   user.

       The paper block
            The paper size is defined in this block.  The  size  can  either  be
            given  as  one  of  the recognized paper types or by giving explicit
            values for the paper height and width. As of version 1.0 beta2,  one
            can  also  use the @page block in CSS2 for the paper size. The paper
            block is kept for backwards compatibility.  Also, one can only spec&#8208;
            ify explicit dimensions in @page, not any paper types by name.

            type   Paper type, possible choices are: A0, A1, A2, A3, A4,...,A10,
                   B0, B1,...,B10, letter, legal, arche,  archd,  archc,  archb,
                   archa, flsa, flse, halfletter, 11x17, and ledger (this set of
                   paper types is taken from Aladdin Ghostscript).  The  default
                   is A4.

            height An absolute size specifying the paper height.

            width  An absolute size specifying the paper width.

       The option block
            This  block  is  used  to  set  default  values for the command line
            options. The key in the key-value pair is the option name, in either
            its long or short form.

            twoup  Two column (2-up) output. The default is one column per page.

            base   Use  URL  as a base to expand relative references for in-line
                   images. This is useful if you have downloaded a document to a
                   local  file.   The URL should then be the URL of the original
                   document.

            check  Check the syntax of the HTML file (using an  external  syntax
                   checker). The default is to not make a syntax check.

            toc    Generate  a  table  of  contents (ToC). The value should be a
                   string consisting of one of the letters  &apos;f&apos;,  &apos;h&apos;,  or  &apos;t&apos;,
                   optionally combined with the letter &apos;b&apos;:

                   b      The  ToC  will  be  printed  first. This requires that
                          Ghostscript is installed.
                   f      The ToC will be generated from the links in  the  con&#8208;
                          verted document.
                   h      The  ToC will be generated from headings and titles in
                          the converted documents. Note  that  if  the  document
                          author  for some strange reason has chosen to use some
                          other means to represent the headings  than  the  HTML
                          elements H1,...,H6, you are out of luck!
                   t      The  ToC  will  be  generated  from  links  having the
                          attribute rev=TOC in the converted document.

            debug  Generate debugging information. You should  always  use  this
                   option when reporting problems with html2ps.

            DSC    Generate  DSC compliant PostScript. This requires Ghostscript
                   and can take quite some time to do. Note  that  a  PostScript
                   file  generated  with  this option cannot be used as input to
                   html2ps for reformatting later.

            encoding
                   The  document  encoding.  Currently  recognized  values   are
                   ISO-8859-1,  EUC-JP, SHIFT-JIS, and ISO-2022-JP (other EUC-xx
                   encodings may also work). The default is ISO-8859-1.

            rcfile A colon separated list of configuration  file  names  to  use
                   instead   of   the   default   personal   configuration  file
                   $HOME/.html2psrc.  Definitions made in one file override def&#8208;
                   initions  in  previous  files  (the last file in the list has
                   highest precedence). An  empty  file  name  (as  in  &apos;:file&apos;,
                   &apos;file1::file3&apos;,  or  &apos;file:&apos;) will expand to the default per&#8208;
                   sonal file. The environment variable HTML2PSPATH is  used  to
                   specify  the  directories  where  to  search for these files.
                   (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the command  line,
                   not in a configuration file.)

            frame  Draw  a frame around the text on each page. The default is to
                   not draw a frame.

            grayscale
                   Convert colour images to  grayscale  images.  Note  that  the
                   PostScript file will be smaller when the images are converted
                   to grayscale. The default is to generate colour images.

            help   Show usage information.

            hyphenate
                   Hyphenate the text. This  requires  TeX  hyphenation  pattern
                   files.

            scaleimage
                   Scale in-line images with a factor num.  The default is 1.

            cookie Enable cookie support, using a netscape formatted cookie file
                   (requires libwww-perl).

            language
                   Specifies the language of the document (overrides an eventual
                   LANG  attribute of the BODY element).  The language should be
                   given            according             to             RFC1766
                   (ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt)     and     ISO     639
                   (http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm).

            landscape
                   Generate code for printing in landscape mode. The default  is
                   portrait mode.

            scalemath
                   Scale  mathematical  formulas with a factor num.  The default
                   is 1.

            mainchapter
                   Specifies the start number for automatic numbering  of  head&#8208;
                   ings (by setting the seq-number parameter), the default is 1.

            number Insert page numbers. The default is to not number the pages.

            startno
                   Specifies the starting page number, the default is 1.
&#12;            output Write the PostScript code to file. The default is to write to
                   standard output.

            original
                   Use PostScript original images if they exist. For example, if
                   a  document contains an image figure.gif, and an encapsulated
                   PostScript file named figure.ps exists in the same directory,
                   that  file  will be use instead. This only work for documents
                   read as local files. Note: if the PostScript file is large or
                   contains  bitmap  images,  this  must be combined with the -D
                   option. In HTML 4.0 this can be achieved in a much better way
                   with:

               &lt;OBJECT data=&quot;figure.ps&quot; type=&quot;application/postscript&quot;&gt;
                &lt;OBJECT data=&quot;figure.gif&quot; type=&quot;image/gif&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;PRE&gt;[Maybe some ASCII art for text browsers]&lt;/PRE&gt;
                &lt;/OBJECT&gt;
               &lt;/OBJECT&gt;

            rootdir
                   When  a document is read from a local file, this value speci&#8208;
                   fies a base directory for resolving relative  links  starting
                   with &quot;/&quot;.  Typically, this should be the directory where your
                   web server&apos;s home page resides.

            xref   Insert cross references at every link to within  the  set  of
                   converted documents.

            scaledoc
                   Scale  the entire document with a factor num.  The default is
                   1.

            style  This option complements/overrides  definitions  made  in  the
                   configuration files. The string must follow the configuration
                   file syntax. (Note: this is only supposed to be used  on  the
                   command line, not in a configuration file.)

            titlepage
                   Generate a title page. The default is to not generate one.

            text   Text  mode,  ignore  images.  The  default  is to include the
                   images.

            underline
                   Underline text that constitutes a hypertext link. The default
                   is to not underline.

            colour Produce  colour  output  for text and background, when speci&#8208;
                   fied.   The  default  is  black  text  on  white   background
                   (mnemonic: coloUr ;-).

            version
                   Print information about the current version of html2ps.

            web    Process  a  web of documents by recursively retrieve and con&#8208;
                   vert documents that  are  referenced  with  hyperlinks.  When
                   dealing  with remote documents it will of course be necessary
                   to impose  restrictions,  to  avoid  downloading  the  entire
                   web...  The value should be a string consisting of one of the
                   letters &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;l&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, or &apos;s&apos;, optionally combined  with
                   a  combination  of the letters &apos;p&apos;, &apos;L&apos;, and a positive inte&#8208;
                   ger:

                   a      Follow all links.
                   b      Follow only links to within  the  same  directory,  or
                          below, as the start document.
                   l      Follow  only links specified with &quot;&lt;LINK rel=NEXT&gt;&quot; in
                          the document.
                   p      Prompt for each remote document. This mode will  auto&#8208;
                          matically be entered after the first 50 documents.
                   r      Follow only relative links.
                   s      Follow  only  links  to  within the same server as the
                          start document.
                   L      With this option, the order in which the documents are
                          processed will be: first all top level documents, then
                          the documents linked to from these etc.  For  example,
                          if  the  document  A has links to B and C, and B has a
                          link to D, the order will  be  A-B-C-D.   By  default,
                          each  document  will be followed by the first document
                          it links to etc; so the default order for the  example
                          is A-B-D-C.
                   #      A positive integer giving the number of recursive lev&#8208;
                          els. The default is 4 (when the option is present).

            duplex Generate postscript code for single or double sided printing.
                   No default, valid values are:

                   0      Single sided.
                   1      Double sided.
                   2      Double sided, opposite page reversed (tumble mode).

       The margin block
            This block is used to specify page margins. The left, right, top and
            bottom margins, previously defined with this block,  should  now  be
            defined using the @page construction from CSS2.

            middle An  absolute  size  for the distance between the columns when
                   printing two columns per page, default is 2cm.

       The xref block
            At every hyperlink (to within the set of converted documents) it  is
            possible  to have a cross reference inserted. The xref block is used
            to control this function.

            text   This defines the cross reference text  to  be  inserted;  the
                   symbol  $N  will  expand  to  the page number, default is &quot;[p
                   $N]&quot;.

            passes The number of passes used to  insert  the  cross  references.
                   Normally,  only  one  pass is run. But since the insertion of
                   the page numbers may effect the page  breaks,  it  might  for
                   large  documents  with many links be necessary with more than
                   one pass to get the cross references right. The default is 1.

       The quote block
            Language specific quotation marks are defined in this block.   These
            quotation marks are used with the HTML 4.01 element Q for short quo&#8208;
            tations. Quotation marks are predefined for a  few  languages  (Eng&#8208;
            lish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian (also Nynorsk and Bokm&#229;l), Finnish,
            Spanish, French, German and Italian). It is possible to define  dif&#8208;
            ferent quotation marks for quotes within quotes.

            A  quotation mark is defined as a string, using the same encoding as
            the converted document (normally ISO-8859-1), and/or with  character
            entities.  Note that quotation mark characters for several languages
            are not included in ISO-8859-1, and  their  corresponding  character
            entities were not been defined prior to HTML 4.0.

            Quotation  marks  for a language can be defined explicitly in a sub-
            block of the quote block. One can also identify the set of quotation
            marks  with  another  previously defined language, using a key-value
            pair.  The sub-block/key name should  equal  the  language  code  as
            defined  in  ISO  639. The language sub-block can have the following
            key-values:

                   open   The quote opening character(s).
                   close  The quote closing character(s). If undefined, it  will
                          equal open.
                   open2  The  quote  opening  character(s)  for  quotes  within
                          quotes. If undefined, it will equal open.
                   close2 The  quote  closing  character(s)  for  quotes  within
                          quotes. If undefined, it will equal close.

            Example:  English  and Spanish use the same set of quotation marks -
            at least according to my book on typography. These (already known to
            html2ps) are defined with:

               quote {
                 en {
                   open: &quot;&amp;ldquo;&quot;;
                   close: &quot;&amp;rdquo;&quot;;
                   open2: &quot;`&quot;;
                   close2: &quot;&apos;&quot;;
                 }
                 es: en;
               }

       The toc block
            When  a  table of contents (ToC) is generated from document headings
            and titles, the appearance is controlled by this block.

            heading
                   A string with HTML code specifying  a  heading  used  on  the
                   first ToC page.

            level  The  maximum  heading  level  used  for building the ToC. The
                   default is 6, which means that all headings will generate ToC
                   entries.

            indent The  ToC entries are indented proportional to the correspond&#8208;
                   ing heading level. This  value  specifies  the  size  of  the
                   indentation.  The default is 1em.

       The titlepage block
            When a title page is generated, its appearance is controlled by this
            block.

            content
                   A string with HTML code specifying  a  heading  used  on  the
                   title    page,    The    default   is   &quot;&lt;DIV   align=center&gt;
                   &lt;H1&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;$T&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;H2&gt;$[author]&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&quot;.

            margin-top
                   The size of the top margin on the title page, The default  is
                   4cm.

       The font block
            Currently,  html2ps recognizes the fonts: Times, New-Century-School&#8208;
            book, Helvetica, Helvetica-Narrow,  Palatino,  Avantgarde,  Bookman,
            and  Courier.  To add a new font (family), choose a name (consisting
            of letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores)  for  the  font.  Then
            define a sub-block to the font block, with the same name as the cho&#8208;
            sen font name. This block can contain two key-value pairs:

                   names  A string containing four PostScript font names,  sepa&#8208;
                          rated  by whitespace, corresponding to the font styles
                          normal, italic, bold, and bold-italic.  If  less  than
                          four  names are given, the first is used for the miss&#8208;
                          ing names. Note that PostScript font  names  are  case
                          sensitive.
                   files  A  string of four file names, separated by whitespace,
                          for files containing font  definitions  for  the  four
                          font styles as specified above.

            Example:  A  font &apos;myfont&apos; has its four font styles defined in local
            files.  To use this font in all tables in the  converted  documents,
            one can use something like:

               TABLE { font-family: myfont }

               @html2ps {
                 font {
                   myfont {
                     names:   &quot;MyFont-Roman  MyFont-Italic  MyFont-Bold  MyFont-
                     BoldItalic&quot;;
                     files:    &quot;/x/y/myfr.pfa    /x/y/myfi.pfa     /x/y/myfb.pfa
                     /x/y/myfbi.pfa&quot;;
                   }
                 }
               }

       The hyphenation block
            Hyphenation  pattern  files for different languages are specified in
            sub-blocks within this block. The blocks names should equal the lan&#8208;
            guage  code as defined in ISO 639. These language blocks can contain
            the following two key-values:

                   file   A hyphenation pattern file in TeX format for this lan&#8208;
                          guage.
                   extfile
                          A file containing a list of hyphenation exceptions for
                          this language.   The  exception  file  should  contain
                          words, separated by whitespaces, with hyphens inserted
                          where hyphenation is allowed,  as  in:  &quot;in-fra-struc-
                          ture white-space&quot;.

            For  example,  for  English (with language code &apos;en&apos;) one can have a
            block like:

                   en {
                     file: &quot;/opt/tex/lib/macros/hyphen.tex&quot;;
                     extfile: &quot;/opt/tdb/lib/html2ps/enhyphext&quot;;
                   }

            The hyphenation block itself can furthermore have these key-values:

            min    A positive integer defining the minimum number of  letters  a
                   word  must  contain  to  make it a candidate for hyphenation.
                   The default is 8.

            start  A positive integer defining the  minimum  number  of  letters
                   that  must precede the hyphen when a word is hyphenated.  The
                   default is 4.

            end    A positive integer defining the  minimum  number  of  letters
                   that  must  follow the hyphen when a word is hyphenated.  The
                   default is 3.

       The header block
            This block is used to specify page headers. It is possible to define
            left,  center, and right headers. Different headers for odd and even
            pages can be specified. Some symbols can be used that will expand to
            document title, author, date etc. See below.
&#12;            left   A left aligned header. If the alternate flag in this block is
                   set to 1, this will be the right header on even pages.

                   for double sided printing.  The default is 1.

       The footer block
            This block is used to specify page footers. It is possible to define
            left, center, and right footers. Different footers for odd and  even
            pages can be specified. Some symbols can be used that will expand to
            document title, author, date etc. See below.

            left   A left aligned footer. If the alternate flag in this block is

                   words. The default is 0pt.

       The draft block
            It is possible to have some text written in a large font  diagonally
            across  each page. Typically this is a word, written in a very light
            colour, indicating that the document is a draft.

            text   The text to be printed, default is &quot;DRAFT&quot;.

            print  A flag specifying whether the draft text should be printed or
                   not.  If unspecified, the draft text is printed when the doc&#8208;

            this block to extend this list of colours. This is  done  with  key-
            value  pairs, where the key is the colour name, and the value is the
            colour given as  a  hexadecimal  RGB  value,  for  example:  &quot;brown:
            A52A2A;&quot;.
       Key-value pairs in the @html2ps block

              default is &quot;[IMAGE]&quot;.

       datefmt
              The symbol $D can be used in page headers and  footers  to  insert
              the  current date/time; the value of the datefmt key specifies the
              format used. The syntax is the same as in the strftime(3) routine.
              The  default is &quot;%e %b %Y  %R&quot;, which gives a date string like &quot; 7

       locale The locale (language code) used for formating  language  dependent
              parts  of  the  date/time in datefmt. If unspecified, the value is
              taken from environment variables, see setlocale(3). No default.

       doc-sep
              A string of HTML code that will be inserted between the  documents
              when more than one are converted. The default is &quot;&lt;!--NewPage--&gt;&quot;,
              which will cause a page break. You may use (almost) any HTML code,
              for example &quot;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;IMG src=...&gt;&quot;.

       ball-radius
              The  radius,  given  as  a  relative  size,  of  the balls used in
              unordered lists. The default is 0.25em.

       numbstyle
              Page numbering style, 0=arabic, 1=roman. The default is 0.

       showurl
              When this flag is set to 1, the URL for external links  are  shown
              within parentheses after the link. The default is 0.

       seq-number
              When  this  flag  is  set,  the  headings  in the document will be
              sequentially numbered: H1 headings will be numbered 1,  2,...,  H2
              headings  1.1, 1.2, etc. The starting number for H1 can be changed
              using the -M (--mainchapter) option. The default is 0.

       extrapage
              A flag specifying whether an extra (empty) page should be printed,
              when  necessary,  to ensure that the title page, the table of con&#8208;
              tents, and the document itself will start on odd  pages.  This  is
              typically desirable for double sided printing. The default is 1.

       break-table
              A  flag  specifying  if  a table should be broken across two pages
              when it does not fit on the current page, but it does on a page of
              its own.  The default is 0 (avoid breaking tables when possible).

       forms  This flag is used to specify whether FORM elements in the document
              should be processed or ignored. Some forms  may  be  suitable  for
              printing  out  and be filled out (with a pen), others are not. The
              default is 1.

       textarea-data
              When a TEXTAREA element contains prefilled data, the text will  be
              used as labels if this flag is set, otherwise ignored. The default
              is 0.

       page-break
              Set this flag to 0 to suppress the normal behavior  of  generating
              page  breaks  from  the  comment  &lt;!--NewPage--&gt; etc, as specified
              below. The default is 1.

       expand-acronyms
              A flag specifying whether acronyms, given by the ACRONYM  element,
              should be expanded or not. The default is 0.

       spoof  Some  web  servers  return  different documents depending on which
              user agent is used to retrieve the document. You can fool the  web
              server  that  a  certain browser is used, by setting this value to
              the identification used by the  browser,  such  as  &quot;Mozilla/4.0&quot;.
              This  only  works  if  you  are  using one of the Perl packages to
              retrieve remote documents.

       ssi    When this flag is set, some Server Side Includes will be processed
              when  the  document  is  read  from  a  local  file.  Examples are
              &lt;!--#include file=...&gt;, &lt;!--#echo var=&quot;LAST_MODIFIED&quot;&gt;,  &lt;!--#con&#8208;
              fig timefmt=...&gt;. The default is 0.

       prefilled
              This  flag controls whether the content of form elements should be
              rendered or not. That is, when this flag is set,  the  content  of
              TEXTAREA  elements,  and  the value of the value attribute of text
              INPUT elements will be shown.  Also,  checked  radio  buttons  and
              checkboxes will be marked.  The default is 0.

SYMBOLS
       The  following  symbols  can  be  used  on the title page, the page head&#8208;
       ers/footers, and in the heading for the table of contents:

       Symbols of the form &quot;$[name]&quot; will expand to the  value  of  the  content
       attribute  of  META elements, having either of the attributes &quot;name=name&quot;
       or &quot;http-equiv=name&quot; (case insensitive string  matching).   For  example,
       when a document containing:

          &lt;META name=&quot;expires&quot; content=&quot;31 Dec 2011&quot;&gt;

       is converted, using a configuration file with:

          footer { left: &quot;Expires: $[expires]&quot; }

       this left footer will be inserted:

          Expires: 31 Dec 2011

       In addition, these symbols are defined:

              $T     Current document title.
              $A     Author   of  current  document,  as  specified  with  &lt;META
                     name=&quot;Author&quot; content=&quot;...&quot;&gt; in the document head.
              $U     The URL, or file name, of current document.
              $N     Page number.
              $H     Current document heading (level 1-3).
              $D     Current date/time. The format is given by the datefmt key.

       So $A is equivalent to $[author], but kept for backwards compatibility.

       To avoid symbol expansion, precede the dollar sign with a  backslash,  as
       in &quot;\$T&quot;.

HINTS
       I  imagine  that  a  typical  use of configuration files can be something
       along the following lines.

       System specific definitions  (e.g.  specification  of  available  program
       packages)  and global defaults (paper type etc) are defined in the global
       configuration file.
&#12;       If there is more than one user of the program on the  system,  each  user
       can  also  have  a personal configuration file with his/hers own personal
       preferences.  (On a single user system one can use the global  configura&#8208;
       tion file for this purpose as well.)

       One may also develop a collection of configuration files for typical sit&#8208;
       uations. These files are placed  in  a  directory  that  is  searched  by
       html2ps  (the  search  path  is  defined  with  the  environment variable
       HTML2PSPATH).  For example, to print a document as slides - in  landscape
       mode,  with large text in Helvetica, and a thick frame - one can create a
       configuration file, called &apos;slides&apos; say, containing:

          @html2ps {
            option {
              landscape: 1;
              frame: 1;
            }
            frame { width: 3pt }
          }
          BODY {
            font-family: Helvetica;
            font-size: 20pt;
          }
          H1 { font-size: 35pt }
          H2 { font-size: 32pt }
          H3 { font-size: 29pt }
          H4 { font-size: 26pt }
          H5 { font-size: 23pt }
          H6 { font-size: 20pt }
          PRE { font-size: 18pt }

       Then use the command:

          html2ps -f slides ...

       to convert the document. Note that with this command the file &apos;slides&apos; is
       used  instead  of the personal configuration file. If you want both to be
       used, giving precedence to definitions made in the file &apos;slides&apos;, use the
       command:

          html2ps -f :slides ...

       (The  page  breaks  between  the  slides  can for example be generated by
       adding &apos;&lt;HR class=PAGE-BREAK&gt;&apos; to the HTML document.)

       For features that are frequently turned on and off, and  that  cannot  be
       controlled by command line options, it may be a good idea to create small
       configuration files as &quot;building blocks&quot;. For example  a  file  &apos;A4&apos;  for
       printing on A4 paper (if you have some other default paper type):

          @html2ps { paper { type: A4 } }

       and a file &apos;hnum&apos; for automatic numbering of headings:

          @html2ps { seq-number: 1 }

       Combining  this  with  the  previous  example:  to convert a document for
       printing on A4 sized slides with all headings numbered, use the command:

          html2ps -f :slides:A4:hnum ...
