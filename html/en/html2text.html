html2text(1)                                                        html2text(1)



NAME
       html2text - an advanced HTML-to-text converter

SYNOPSIS
       html2text -help
       html2text -version
       html2text  [  -unparse  | -check ] [ -debug-scanner ] [ -debug-parser ] [
       -rcfile path ] [ -style ( compact | pretty ) ] [ -width width ] [ -o out&#8208;
       put-file ] [ -nobs ] [ -ascii | -utf8 ] [ -nometa ] [ input-url ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       html2text  reads HTML documents from the input-urls, formats each of them
       into a stream of plain text characters, and writes the result to standard
       output (or into output-file, if the -o command line option is used).

       If  no input-urls are specified on the command line, html2text reads from
       standard input. A dash as the input-url is an alternate  way  to  specify
       standard input.

       html2text  understands  all HTML 3.2 constructs, but can render only part
       of them due to the limitations of the text output  format.  However,  the
       program  attempts  to provide good substitutes for the elements it cannot
       render.  html2text parses HTML 4 input, too, but not always as successful
       as  other HTML processors. It also accepts syntactically incorrect input,
       and attempts to interpret it &quot;reasonably&quot;.

       The way html2text formats the HTML documents is controlled by  formatting
       properties   read   from   an   RC  file.   html2text  attempts  to  read
       $HOME/.html2textrc (or the file specified by  the  -rcfile  command  line
       option);  if  that  file  cannot  be  read,  html2text  attempts  to read
       /etc/html2textrc.  If no RC file can be read (or if the RC file does  not
       override  all  formatting  properties),  then  &quot;reasonable&quot;  defaults are
       assumed. The RC file format is described  in  the  html2textrc(5)  manual
       page.

       Debian  version  of  html2text also can do input and output recoding (see
       /usr/share/doc/html2text/README.Debian for more info).   html2text  tries
       to  fetch  encoding from HTML document. If encoding is not specified, you
       can use -ascii and -utf8 options.  Output is converted to  user&apos;s  locale
       charset (LC_CTYPE).

OPTIONS
       -nometa
              By  default, Debian version of html2text use &apos;meta http-equiv&apos; tag
              for input recoding. This option cancels this behavior.

       -ascii By default, when -nometa is supplied, html2text uses UTF-8 for the
              output.  Specifying  this  option, plain ASCII is used instead. To
              find out how non-ASCII characters are rendered, refer to the  file
              &quot;ascii.substitutes&quot;.

       -utf8  By  default,  when  -nometa is supplied, html2text uses ISO 8859-1
              for the input. Specifying this option, UTF-8 is used instead (both
              for input and output). This option implies -nobs.

       -check This  option is for diagnostic purposes: The HTML document is only
              parsed and not processed otherwise. In  this  mode  of  operation,
              html2text  will  report  on parse errors and scan errors, which it
              does not in other modes of operation. Note  that  parse  and  scan
              errors  are not fatal for html2text, but may cause mis-interpreta&#8208;
              tion of the HTML code and/or portions of the document being  swal&#8208;
              lowed.

       -debug-parser
              Let  html2text  report  on  the  tokens being shifted, rules being
              applied, etc., while scanning the HTML document.  This  option  is
              for diagnostic purposes.

       -debug-scanner
              Let html2text report on each lexical token scanned, while scanning
              the HTML document. This option is for diagnostic purposes.

       -help  Print command line summary and exit.

       -nobs  By default, original html2text  renders  underlined  letters  with
              sequences  like &quot;underscore-backspace-character&quot; and boldface let&#8208;
              ters like &quot;character-backspace-character&quot;. Because of issues  with
              UTF-8,  Debian version of html2text doesn&apos;t produce backspaces, so
              this option really does nothing.

       -o output-file
              Write the output to output-file instead of standard output. A dash
              as  the  output-file  is  an alternate way to specify the standard
              output.

       -rcfile path
              Attempt to read the file specified in path as RC file.

       -style ( compact | pretty )
              Style pretty changes some of the default values of the  formatting
              parameters  documented  in  html2textrc(5).  To find out which and
              how the formatting parameter defaults are changed, check the  file
              &quot;pretty.style&quot;.  If  this  option  is  omitted,  style  compact is
              assumed as default.

       -unparse
              This option is for diagnostic purposes: Instead of formatting  the
              parsed document, generate HTML code, that is guaranteed to be syn&#8208;
              tactically correct. If html2text has problems parsing a  syntacti&#8208;
              cally  incorrect HTML document, this option may help you to under&#8208;
              stand what html2text thinks that the original HTML code means.

       -version
              Print program version and exit.

       -width width
              By default, html2text formats the  HTML  documents  for  a  screen
              width  of 79 characters. If redirecting the output into a file, or
              if your terminal has a width other than 80 characters, or  if  you
              just want to get an idea how html2text deals with large tables and
              different terminal widths, you may want  to  specify  a  different
              width.

FILES
       /etc/html2textrc
              System wide parser configuration file.

       $HOME/.html2textrc
              Personal parser configuration file, overrides the system wide val&#8208;
              ues.

CONFORMING TO
       HTML 3.2 (HTML 3.2 Reference  Specification  -  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-
       html32),

RESTRICTIONS
       Debian  version  of html2text have no http support. Use html2text through
       pipes with curl or wget instead. See README.Debian for more information.

       html2text was written to convert HTML 3.2 documents. When using  it  with
       HTML  4  or even XHTML 1 documents, some constructs present only in these
       HTML versions might not be rendered.
