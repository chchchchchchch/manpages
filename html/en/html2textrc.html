html2textrc(5)                                                    html2textrc(5)



NAME
       html2textrc - formatting properties file for html2text(1)

SYNOPSIS
       Key [ = | : ] Value

DESCRIPTION
       The  html2textrc(5)  file  defines a set of formatting properties used by
       the html2text(1) utility, that overrides the program&apos;s  built-in  format&#8208;
       ting  defaults.  Each line of the html2textrc(5) file is either a format&#8208;
       ting property or a comment.

       Lines with a leading &quot;#&quot; or &quot;!&quot; (i.e. the first non-space character is  a
       &quot;#&quot;  or  a  &quot;!&quot;)   and blank lines (i.e. a line consisting only of white-
       space characters), are considered comments and ignored.  Everything  else
       is  literary  interpreted by the parser as a formatting property, where a
       string-type property value may also  be  empty  (unsets  default  value).
       Both, the property key and the property value, may contain C-style escape
       sequences to mask meta characters.

       A property definition line consists of:

       (1)    Optional leading space,

       (2)    the property key (a sequence of non-space  characters  except  &quot;=&quot;
              and &quot;:&quot;) as described below,

       (3)    an optional space,

       (4)    an optional &quot;=&quot; or &quot;:&quot;,

       (5)    optional space,

       (6)    the property value as described below.
              Everything  up  to the next newline is interpreted literary as the
              value of the specified element. Literary meant leading white-space
              must  be  quoted  with  backslashes  (i.e.  &quot;\ &quot;). Be aware not to
              include unwanted trailing white-space characters.

OPTIONS
       The following is the list of valid formatting properties,  together  with
       their  default  values. If the -style command line option of html2text(1)
       is used, different default values apply.

       Curly braces indicate alternatives, e.g.  {A B}C stands for AC or BC.

       DOCUMENT.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after,  and
              how  many  blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right
              of the formatted document.  (Numeric.)

       BODY.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Same for the document body. (Since the document body is  currently
              the  only document part that is rendered, it is virtually the same
              whether you specify DOCUMENT or BODY).  (Numeric.)

       {OL UL DIR MENU DL}.vspace.{before between after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before a list, between
              the individual list items, and after the list.  (Numeric.)

       {OL UL DIR MENU}.indents = 6
              Specifies  by  how deep list items are indented. If an item bullet
              would not fit into the space created by the indentation, then  the
              indentation  is  automatically increased such that the bullet fits
              in (relevant for relatively wide bullets, e.g. roman  numbers).
              If  N  blank-separated integers are specified instead of one, then
              the first N-1 integers specify indentation for the first N-1  list
              nesting  levels,  while the last integer specifies the indentation
              for nesting levels N and higher.  (Numeric.)

       {UL DIR}.default_types = DISC CIRCLE SQUARE
              Specifies the default list type (i.e. the bullet  style),  if  the
              HTML  list tag does not specify an explicit type. Legal values are
              NO_BULLET, DISC, SQUARE, CIRCLE, CUSTOM1, CUSTOM2 and CUSTOM3.  If
              more  than  one  value is specified, then the values apply for the
              respective list nesting levels (see indents).  (Option.)

       MENU.default_types = NO_BULLET
              Same for &lt;MENU&gt;, but here the default is NO_BULLET.  (Option.)

       LI.{disc square circle custom1 custom2 custom3}_bullet = {* # o + - ~}
              Specifies the strings used as list item bullets.  (String.)

       {DT DD}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after,  and
              how  many  blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right
              of each &lt;DT&gt; or &lt;DD&gt; element.  (Numeric.)

       HR.marker = =
              Specifies the character to use for horizontal rules.  (String.)

       HR.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after,  and
              how  many  blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right
              of the horizontal rule.  (Numeric.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.prefix = {****** ***** **** *** ** *}
              Specifies how headings are decorated with a prefix.  (The  default
              values have a trailing blank, e.g. &quot;****** &quot;.)  (String.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.suffix = {****** ***** **** *** ** *}
              Specifies  how  headings are decorated with a suffix. (The default
              values have a leading blank, e.g. &quot;\ ******&quot;.)  (String.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.vspace.{before after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after head&#8208;
              ings.  (Numeric.)

       {PRE P}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies  how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and
              how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to  the  right
              of these items.  (Numeric.)

       {BLOCKQUOTE ADDRESS}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = {0 0 5
       5}
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after,  and
              how  many  blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right
              of these items.  (Numeric.)

       TABLE.vspace.{before after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank  lines  are  inserted  before  and  after
              tables.  (Numeric.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.attributes = BOLD
              Specifies  the  cell  attributes  for  headings.  The  value  is a
              sequence of NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE and STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       {TT I BIG SMALL SUB SUP DFN CODE SAMP KBD CITE}.attributes = NONE
              Specifies the cell attributes for these text items.  Legal  values
              are: NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE or STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       U.attributes = UNDERLINE
              Same  for  &lt;U&gt;  elements,  but  with  a  different  default value.
              (Option.)

       {B EM STRONG}.attributes = BOLD
              Same for these elements,  but  with  a  different  default  value.
              (Option.)

       STRIKE.attributes = STRIKETHROUGH
              Same  for  &lt;STRIKE&gt;  elements, but with a different default value.
              (Option.)

       A.attributes.{internal_link external_link} = UNDERLINE
              Specifies the cell attributes for links. A link is an &lt;A&gt;  element
              that  has  an  &quot;HREF&quot;  attribute. An internal link is a link whose
              &quot;HREF&quot;  attribute  starts  with  a  hash  character   (e.g.    &quot;&lt;A
              href=&quot;#42&quot;&gt;&quot;).   Legal  values are again NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE and
              STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       IMG.replace.{all noalt} = unset
              Specifies the string used to replace all &lt;IMG&gt; elements, or  those
              without an &quot;ALT&quot; attribute set.  (String.)

       IMG.alt.{prefix suffix} = {[ ]}
              Specifies   how  the  values  (if  any)  of  IMG  elements&apos;  &quot;ALT&quot;
              attributes are marked.  (String.)
