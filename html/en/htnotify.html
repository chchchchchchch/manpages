       by htmerge

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       Htnotify scans the document database created  by  htmerge  and  sends  an

              configuration file.

       -c configfile

              mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.  Used once will
              display a log of what email messages were  sent.  Used  more  than
              once  will  display information about each document that has email
              notification set.
