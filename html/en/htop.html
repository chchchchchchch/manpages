HTOP(1)                               Utils                              HTOP(1)



NAME
       htop - interactive process viewer

SYNOPSIS
       htop [-dChusv]

DESCRIPTION
       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It  is  similar  to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizon&#8208;
       tally, so you can see all the processes running on the system, along with
       their full command lines.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without enter&#8208;
       ing their PIDs.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are madatory for short options too.

       -d --delay=DELAY
              Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds

       -C --no-color --no-colour
              Start htop in monochrome mode

       -h --help
              Display a help message and exit

       -u --user=USERNAME
              Show only the processes of a given user

       -s --sort-key COLUMN
              Sort by this column (use --sort-key help for a column list)

       -v --version
              Output version information and exit

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       The following commands are supported while in htop:

       Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End
            Scroll the process list.

       Space
            Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on  multiple  pro&#8208;
            cesses,  like  &quot;kill&quot;,  will then apply over the list of tagged pro&#8208;
            cesses, instead of the currently highlighted one.

       U    Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).

       s    Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this
            key  will  attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a
            live update of system calls issued by the process.

       l    Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed,  pressing
            this  key  will  display  the list of file descriptors opened by the
            process.

       L    Trace process library calls: if  ltrace(1)  is  installed,  pressing
            this  key will attach it to the currently selected process, present&#8208;
            ing a live update of library calls issued by the process.
&#12;       F1, h, ?
            Go to the help screen

       F2, S
            Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed
            at  the top of the screen, set various display options, choose among
            color schemes, and select which  columns  are  displayed,  in  which
            order.

       F3, /
            Incrementally  search  the  command  lines of all the displayed pro&#8208;
            cesses. The currently selected (highlighted) command will update  as
            you  type.  While  in  search  mode,  pressing F3 will cycle through
            matching occurrences.

       F4, \
            Incremental process filtering: type in part  of  a  process  command
            line  and  only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel
            filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc.

       F5, t
            Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and  layout  the  rela&#8208;
            tions  between  them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between
            tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a  sort  view
            will exit tree view.

       F6, &lt;, &gt;
            Select a field for sorting. The current sort field is indicated by a
            highlight in the header.

       F7, ]
            Increase the  selected  process&apos;s  priority  (subtract  from  &apos;nice&apos;
            value).  This can only be done by the superuser.

       F8, [
            Decrease the selected process&apos;s priority (add to &apos;nice&apos; value)

       F9, k
            &quot;Kill&quot;  process:  sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one
            or a group of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the  signal
            to  all tagged processes.  If none is tagged, sends to the currently
            selected process.

       F10, q
            Quit

       I    Invert the sort order:  if  sort  order  is  increasing,  switch  to
            decreasing, and vice-versa.

       +, - When  in  tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree
            is collapsed a &quot;+&quot; sign shows to the left of the process name.

       a (on multiprocessor machines)
            Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.

       u    Show only processes owned by a specified user.

       M    Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).

       P    Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).

       T    Sort by time (top compatibility key).

       F    &quot;Follow&quot; process: if the sort order causes  the  currently  selected
            process  to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This
            is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process
            always  visible  on  screen.  When  a movement key is used, &quot;follow&quot;
            loses effect.

       K    Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to  be
            displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       H    Hide  user  threads: on systems that represent them differently than
            ordinary processes (such as recent  NPTL-based  systems),  this  can
            hide  threads from userspace processes in the process list. (This is
            a toggle key.)

       Ctrl-L
            Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.

       Numbers
            PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight  will  be
            moved to it.


COLUMNS
       The following columns can display data about each process. A value of &apos;-&apos;
       in all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or
       currently unimplemented in htop. The names below are the ones used in the
       &quot;Available Columns&quot; section of the setup screen. If a different  name  is
       shown in htop&apos;s main screen, it is shown below in parenthesis.

               S for sleeping (idle)
               R for running
               D for disk sleep (uninterruptible)
               Z for zombie (waiting for parent to read it&apos;s exit status)
