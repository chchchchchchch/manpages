NAME
       htpurge -  remove unused documents from the database (general maintenance
       script)

SYNOPSIS
       htpurge [-][-a][-c configfile][-u][-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Htpurge functions to remove specified URLs from the databases as well  as
       bad  URLs,  unretrieved  URLs, obsolete documents, etc. It is recommended
       that htpurge be run after htdig to clean out any documents of this sort.


       OPTIONS

       -      Take URL list from standard input (rather than specified with -u).
              Format  of  input file is one URL per line.  -a Use alternate work
              files. Tells htpurge to append .work to database files, causing  a
              second  copy of the database to be built. This allows the original
              files to be used by htsearch during the run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -u URL Add this URL to the list of documents to remove. Must be specified
              multiple  times if more than one URL are to be removed. Should nor
              be used together with -.

       -v     Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.   Using
              more  than  2  is probably only useful for debugging purposes. The
              default verbose mode (using only one -v)  gives  a  nice  progress
              report while digging.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
