NAME
       htsearch  -  create  document  index  and  word database for the ht://Dig
       search engine

SYNOPSIS
       htsearch [options] [query_string]

DESCRIPTION
       Htsearch is used to sift through the  databases created by htdig for con&#8208;
       tent.  It is the actual search engine of the htdig search system. It is a
       CGI program that is expected to be invoked  by  an  HTML  form.  It  will
       accept both the GET and POST methods of passing data to the CGI program.

OPTIONS
       query_string
              A CGI-style query string can be given as a single argument, and is
              only used if the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable is  not  set.
              If  no  query_string  is  given,  and  REQUEST_METHOD  is not set,
              htsearch will prompt for the query.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default (for  security
              reasons this option is only available when htsearch is used on the
              command line).

       -v -d  Run in verbose mode.  This increases the verbosity of the program.
              Using  more than 2 is probably only useful for debugging purposes.
              The default verbose mode gives a progress on what it is doing  and
              where it is.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.

              The default search results header file

       /etc/htdig/footer.html
              The default search results footer file

       /etc/htdig/wrapper.html
              The  default search results wrapper file, that contains the header
              and footer together in one file

       /etc/htdig/nomatch.html
              The default &apos;no matches found&apos; HTML file

       /etc/htdig/syntax.html
