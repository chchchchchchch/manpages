NAME
       htstat  -   returns  statistics  on the document and word databases, much
       like the -s option to htdig or htmerge.

SYNOPSIS
       htstat [-v][-a][-c configfile][-u]

DESCRIPTION
       Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and gathers infor&#8208;
       mation from these documents which can later be used to search these docu&#8208;
       ments. This program can be referred to as the search robot.

OPTIONS
       -a     Use alternate work files. Tells htstat to append .work to database
              files,  causing  a  second  copy of the database to be built. This
              allows the original files to be used by htsearch during the run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -u     Give a list of URLs in the document database.

       -v     Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.   Using
              more  than  2  is probably only useful for debugging purposes. The
              default verbose mode (using only one -v)  gives  a  nice  progress
              report while digging.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
