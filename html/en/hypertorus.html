DESCRIPTION
       The hypertorus program shows the Clifford torus as it rotates in 4d.  The
       Clifford torus is a torus lies on the &quot;surface&quot; of the hypersphere in 4d.
       The program projects the 4d torus to 3d using either a perspective or  an
       orthographic  projection.   Of the two alternatives, the perspective pro&#8208;
       jection looks much more appealing.  In orthographic projections the torus
       degenerates  into  a  doubly  covered cylinder for some angles.  The pro&#8208;
       jected 3d torus can then be projected to the screen either  perspectively
       or  orthographically.   There are three display modes for the torus: mesh
       (wireframe), solid, or transparent.  Furthermore, the appearance  of  the
       torus  can  be as a solid object or as a set of see-through bands or see-
       through spirals.  Finally, the colors with with the torus is drawn can be
       set  to  either  two-sided  or  to a color wheel.  In the first case, the
       torus is drawn with red on the outside and green  on  the  inside.   This
       mode  enables you to see that the torus turns inside-out as it rotates in
       4d.  The second mode draws the torus with a fully saturated color  wheel.
       This gives a very nice effect when combined with the see-through bands or
       see-through spirals mode.  The rotation speed for each of the six  planes
       around  which the torus rotates can be chosen.  This program is very much
       inspired by Thomas Banchoff&apos;s book &quot;Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry,
       Computer  Graphics,  and Higher Dimensions&quot;, Scientific American Library,
       1990.

OPTIONS
       hypertorus accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -delay microseconds
               How much of a delay should be introduced  between  steps  of  the
               animation.  Default 25000, or 1/40th second.

       The  following  three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how
       the torus is displayed.

       -wireframe
               Display the torus as a wireframe mesh.

       -surface
               Display the torus as a solid surface (default).
&#12;       -transparent
               Display the torus as a transparent surface.

       The following seven options are mutually exclusive.  They  determine  the
       appearance of the torus.

       -solid  Display the torus as a solid object.

       -bands  Display the torus as see-through bands (default).

       -spirals-1, -spirals-2, -spirals-4, -spirals-8, -spirals-16
               Display  the torus as see-through spirals with the indicated num&#8208;
               ber of spirals.

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how  to
       color the torus.

       -twosided
               Display  the  torus with two colors: red on the outside and green
               on the inside.

       -colorwheel
               Display the torus with a fully saturated color  wheel  (default).
               If  the torus is displayed as see-through bands each band will be
               displayed with a different color.  Likewise, if the torus is dis&#8208;
               played  as see-through spirals each spiral will receive a differ&#8208;
               ent color.

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the
       torus is projected from 3d to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       -perspective-3d
               Project  the  torus  from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection
               (default).

       -orthographic-3d
               Project the torus from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the
       torus is projected from 4d to 3d.

       -perspective-4d
               Project  the  torus  from 4d to 3d using a perspective projection
               (default).

       -orthographic-4d
               Project the torus from 4d to 3d using an orthographic projection.

       The following six options determine  the  rotation  speed  of  the  torus
       around  the  six possible hyperplanes.  The rotation speed is measured in
       degrees per frame.  The speeds should be set to relatively small  values,
       e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.

       -speed-wx float
               Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).

       -speed-wy float
               Rotation speed around the wy plane (default: 1.3).

       -speed-wz float
               Rotation speed around the wz plane (default: 1.5).

       -speed-xy float
               Rotation speed around the xy plane (default: 1.7).

       -speed-xz float
               Rotation speed around the xz plane (default: 1.9).
&#12;       -speed-yz float
               Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

INTERACTION
       If  you run this program in standalone mode you can rotate the hypertorus
       by dragging the mouse while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates
       the  hypertorus  in  3D,  i.e., around the wx, wy, and wz planes.  If you
       press the shift key while dragging the mouse with the left button pressed
       the  hypertorus is rotated in 4D, i.e., around the xy, xz, and yz planes.
       To examine the hypertorus at your leisure, it is best to set  all  speeds
       to  0.  Otherwise, the hypertorus will rotate while the left mouse button
       is not pressed.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
