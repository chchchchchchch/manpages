d2i_X509_NAME(3SSL)                  OpenSSL                 d2i_X509_NAME(3SSL)



NAME
       d2i_X509_NAME, i2d_X509_NAME - X509_NAME encoding functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/x509.h&gt;

        X509_NAME *d2i_X509_NAME(X509_NAME **a, unsigned char **pp, long length);
        int i2d_X509_NAME(X509_NAME *a, unsigned char **pp);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions decode and encode an X509_NAME structure which is the the
       same as the Name type defined in RFC2459 (and elsewhere) and used for
       example in certificate subject and issuer names.

       Othewise the functions behave in a similar way to d2i_X509() and
       i2d_X509() described in the d2i_X509(3) manual page.
