DESCRIPTION
       i740 is an Xorg driver for Intel i740 video cards.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The i740 driver supports Intel 740 based cards.  A list of cards reported
       to work is provided in the README file with the driver source.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The  driver  auto-detects  all device information necessary to initialize
       the card.

       However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       VideoRam - in kilobytes

       DacSpeed - in MHz

       MemBase - physical address of the linear framebuffer

       IOBase  - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers

       The following driver options are supported on all chipsets:

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable  or  enable  2D  acceleration.  Default:  acceleration  is
              enabled.

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Request a software cursor (hardware is default). Default: off

       Option &quot;SDRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force the use of SDRAM timings. Default: off

       Option &quot;SGRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force the use of SGRAM timings. Default: off

       Option &quot;SlowRam&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force the use of slower ram timings. Default: off

       Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default). Default: off

       Option &quot;UsePIO&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force  the  use  of  programmed IO (Memory mapped is the default).
              Default: off

       Note: the i740 X server should automatically detect whether your card has
       SGRAM or SDRAM.  Use the &quot;sgram&quot; and &quot;sdram&quot; options if it is incorrectly
       detected.
