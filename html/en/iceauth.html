NAME
       iceauth - ICE authority file utility

SYNOPSIS
       iceauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqib ] [ command arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iceauth program is used to edit and display the authorization infor&#8208;
       mation used in connecting with ICE.  This  program  is  usually  used  to
       extract  authorization  records  from  one  machine  and merge them in on

       other  users).   Commands (described below) may be entered interactively,
       on the iceauth command line, or in scripts.

OPTIONS
       -f authfile  Name of the authority file to use. Will default to
                    the file currently in use by the session.

       -v           Turns on extra messages (verbose mode)

       -q           Turns off extra messages (quiet mode)

       -i           Ignore the locks on the authority file

       -b           Break the locks on the authority file

       -u           Print basic usage instructions
