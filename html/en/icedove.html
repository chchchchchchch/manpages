ICEDOVE(1)                     Linux User&apos;s Manual                    ICEDOVE(1)



NAME
       icedove  - Mail User Agent (MUA) and newsgroup/RSS client for X11 derived
       from the Mozilla Thunderbird.

SYNOPSIS
       icedove [OPTIONS] [URL]

       /usr/lib/icedove/icedove-bin [OPTIONS] [URL]


DESCRIPTION
       Icedove provides IMAP/POP support, a built-in  RSS  reader,  support  for
       HTML  mail, powerful quick search, saved search folders, advanced message
       filtering, junk mail controls, message grouping, labels, return receipts,
       smart address book, LDAP address completion, import tools and the ability
       to manage multiple identities in email and newsgroup accounts.

       Icedove provides enterprise and government grade security such as S/MIME,
       digital  signing,  message  encryption,  and support for certificates and
       security devices.


USAGE
       icedove is a executable file that will set up  the  environment  for  the
       starting  executable,  icedove-bin.   If  there is an Icedove mail client
       already running, icedove will arrange for it to create a new mail  client
       window; otherwise it will start the Icedove application.


OPTIONS
       A summary of the options supported by icedove is included below.


   X11 options
       --display=DISPLAY
              X display to use

              Make all warnings fatal

              Show summary of options.

       -v, -version
              Print Icedove version.

       -P [profile]
              Start with profile. When no profile is given, displays the Profile
              Manager. May require -no-remote, see below.

       -ProfileManager
              Start with profile manager. May require -no-remote, see below.

       -no-remote
              Don&apos;t connect to a running Icedove instance. Don&apos;t accept or  send
              remote  commands.  This  option can be necessary in conjunction to
              several of the options above, that won&apos;t have any effect  when  an

              instance.

       -UILocale locale
              Start  with locale resources as User Interface locale. By default,
              it is guessed from environment and available locales for Icedove.

       -safe-mode
              Starts Icedove in safe mode, i.e.  disabling  all  extensions  and

EXAMPLES
   Some typical use case for starting Icedove from a console
       Starting Icedove without any extra options, useful to any  messages  from
       icedove in case something went not o.k.:

           icedove

       Starting  Icedove  without any extensions or themes, useful if extensions
       may make some trouble:

           icedove -safe-mode

       Starting Icedove with a composing window:

           icedove -compose

       Starting Icedove with the default debugger:

           /usr/lib/icedove/run-mozilla.sh -debug /usr/lib/icedove/icedove-bin

       Starting Icedove with the specific debugger:
