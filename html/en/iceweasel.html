NAME
       iceweasel - a Web browser for X11 derived from the Mozilla browser


SYNOPSIS
       iceweasel [OPTIONS] [URL]

       /usr/lib/iceweasel/iceweasel [OPTIONS] [URL]


DESCRIPTION
       Iceweasel  is  an open-source web browser, designed for standards compli&#8208;
       ance, performance and portability.


USAGE
       If there is an Iceweasel browser already running, iceweasel will  arrange
       for  it  to  create  a  new browser window; otherwise it will start a new
       instance.


OPTIONS
       A summary of the options supported by iceweasel is included below.


   X11 options
       --display=DISPLAY
              X display to use

       --sync Make X calls synchronous

       --no-xshm
              Don&apos;t use X shared memory extension

       --xim-preedit=STYLE

       --xim-status=STYLE

       --g-fatal-warnings
              Make all warnings fatal


   Mozilla options
       -h, -help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, -version
              Print Iceweasel version.

       -P [profile]
              Start with profile. When no profile is given, displays the Profile
              Manager. May require -no-remote, see below.

       -migration
              Start with migration wizard. May require -no-remote, see below.

       -ProfileManager
              Start with profile manager. May require -no-remote, see below.

       -no-remote
              Don&apos;t  connect to a running Iceweasel instance. This option can be
              necessary in conjunction to several of  the  options  above,  that
              won&apos;t have any effect when an Iceweasel instance is running unless
              -no-remote is used at the same time.

       -UILocale locale
              Start with locale resources as User Interface locale. By  default,
              it   is   guessed  from  environment  and  available  locales  for
              Iceweasel.

       -safe-mode
              Starts Iceweasel in safe mode, i.e. disabling all  extensions  and
              showing a bit more debugging messages.

       -jsconsole
              Start with Javascript Console
