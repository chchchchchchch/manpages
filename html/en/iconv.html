ICONV(1)                        Debian GNU/Linux                        ICONV(1)



NAME
       iconv - Convert encoding of given files from one encoding to another

SYNOPSIS
       iconv -f encoding [-t encoding] [inputfile]...

DESCRIPTION
       The iconv program converts the encoding of characters in inputfile, or
       from the standard input if no filename is specified, from one coded
       character set to another. The result is written to standard output unless
       otherwise specified by the --output option.

       --from-code, -f encoding
              Convert characters from encoding.

       --to-code, -t encoding
              Convert characters to encoding. If not specified the encoding
              corresponding to the current locale is used.

       --list, -l
              List known coded character sets.

       -c     Omit invalid characters from output.

       --output, -o file
              Specify output file (instead of stdout).

       --silent, -s
              Suppress warnings, but not errors.

       --verbose
              Print progress information.

       --help, -?
              Give help list.

       --usage
              Give a short usage message.

       --version, -V
              Print program version.

ENCODINGS
       The values permitted for --from-code and --to-code can be listed by the
       iconv --list command, and all combinations of the listed values are
       supported. Furthermore the following two suffixes are supported:

       //TRANSLIT
              When the string &quot;//TRANSLIT&quot; is appended to --to-code,
              transliteration is activated.  This means that when a character
              cannot be represented in the target character set, it can be
              approximated through one or several similarly looking characters.

       //IGNORE
              When the string &quot;//IGNORE&quot; is appended to --to-code, characters
              that cannot be represented in the target character set will be
              silently discarded.
