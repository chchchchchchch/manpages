ICONV_OPEN(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              ICONV_OPEN(3)



NAME
       iconv_open - allocate descriptor for character set conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;iconv.h&gt;

       iconv_t iconv_open(const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iconv_open() function allocates a conversion descriptor suitable for
       converting byte sequences from character encoding fromcode  to  character
       encoding tocode.

       The  values  permitted for fromcode and tocode and the supported combina&#8208;
       tions are system-dependent.  For the GNU C library, the permitted  values
       are  listed  by  the  iconv  --list  command, and all combinations of the
       listed values are supported.  Furthermore the GNU C library and  the  GNU
       libiconv library support the following two suffixes:

       //TRANSLIT
              When  the  string &quot;//TRANSLIT&quot; is appended to tocode, translitera&#8208;
              tion is activated.  This means that when  a  character  cannot  be
              represented  in  the  target character set, it can be approximated
              through one or several similarly looking characters.

       //IGNORE
              When the string &quot;//IGNORE&quot; is appended to tocode, characters  that
              cannot be represented in the target character set will be silently
              discarded.

       The resulting conversion descriptor can be used with iconv(3) any  number
       of times.  It remains valid until deallocated using iconv_close(3).

       A  conversion  descriptor  contains  a  conversion state.  After creation
       using iconv_open(), the state is in the initial  state.   Using  iconv(3)
       modifies the descriptor&apos;s conversion state.  (This implies that a conver&#8208;
       sion descriptor can not be used in multiple threads simultaneously.)   To
       bring  the  state  back  to  the initial state, use iconv(3) with NULL as
       inbuf argument.

RETURN VALUE
       The iconv_open() function returns a freshly allocated conversion descrip&#8208;
       tor.  In case of error, it sets errno and returns (iconv_t) -1.

ERRORS
       The following error can occur, among others:

       EINVAL The  conversion  from  fromcode  to tocode is not supported by the
              implementation.

VERSIONS
       This function is available in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       UNIX98, POSIX.1-2001.
