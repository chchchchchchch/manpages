NAME
       ident - Ident protocol client

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.3

       package require ident  ?0.42?

       ::ident::query socket ?callback?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  ident package provides a client implementation of the ident protocol
       as defined in RFC 1413 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt).

       ::ident::query socket ?callback?
              This command queries the ident daemon on the remote  side  of  the
              given socket, and returns the result of the query as a dictionary.
              Interpreting the dictionary as list the first key will  always  be
              resp-type,  and  can  have  one  of  the values USERID, ERROR, and
              FATAL.  These response types have the following meanings:

              USERID This indicates a successful response.  Two  more  keys  and
                     associated values are returned, opsys, and user-id.

              ERROR  This  means the ident server has returned an error.  A sec&#8208;
                     ond key named error is present  whose  value  contains  the
                     error-type field from the server response.

              FATAL  Fatal  errors  happen  when no ident server is listening on
                     the remote side, or when the ident server gives a  response
                     that  does not conform to the RFC. A detailed error message
                     is returned under the error key.
