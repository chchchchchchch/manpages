identify(1)                                                          identify(1)



NAME
       identify  - describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
       files.

SYNOPSIS
       identify [options] input-file

OVERVIEW
       The identify program is a member of the ImageMagick(1)  suite  of  tools.
       It  describes  the format and characteristics of one or more image files.
       It also reports if an image is incomplete  or  corrupt.  The  information
       returned  includes  the image number, the file name, the width and height
       of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not, the number of col&#8208;
       ors  in  the  image  (by default off use -define unique=true option), the
       number of bytes in the image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM,  etc.),
       and  finally the number of seconds it took to read and process the image.
       Many more attributes are available with the verbose option.

         -ping                efficiently determine image attributes
         -quiet               suppress all warning messages
         -regard-warnings     pay attention to warning messages
         -sampling-factor geometry
                              horizontal and vertical sampling factor
         -seed value          seed a new sequence of pseudo-random numbers
         -set attribute value set an image attribute
         -size geometry       width and height of image
         -strip               strip image of all profiles and comments
         -unique              display the number of unique colors in the image
         -units type          the units of image resolution
         -verbose             print detailed information about the image
         -virtual-pixel method
                              virtual pixel access method

       Image Operators:
         -negate              replace each pixel with its complementary color

       Miscellaneous Options:
         -debug events        display copious debugging information
         -help                print program options
         -log format          format of debugging information
         -list type           print a list of supported option arguments
         -version             print version information

       By default, the image format of `file&apos; is determined by its magic number.
       To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an  image
       format  name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the
       filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify  &apos;file&apos;  as  &apos;-&apos;  for  standard
       input or output.

NOTE
       Although  some  options  appear  to modify the file to be identified, the
       identify command is strictly read only. For  instance,  the  crop  option
       crops the in-memory image and then describes the result.
