IDLE(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    IDLE(2)



NAME
       idle - make process 0 idle

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int idle(void);

DESCRIPTION
       idle()  is  an  internal system call used during bootstrap.  It marks the
       process&apos;s pages as swappable, lowers its priority, and  enters  the  main
       scheduling loop.  idle() never returns.

       Only  process  0  may call idle().  Any user process, even a process with
       superuser permission, will receive EPERM.

RETURN VALUE
       idle() never returns for process 0, and always  returns  -1  for  a  user
       process.

ERRORS
       EPERM  Always, for a user process.

VERSIONS
       Since 2.3.13 this system call does not exist anymore.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  Linux-specific,  and  should  not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.
