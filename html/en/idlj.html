Name
       idlj - The IDL-to-Java Compiler

       idlj generates Java bindings from a given IDL file.

Synopsis
       idlj [ options ] idl-file


       where idl-file is the name of a file containing Interface Definition Lan&#8208;
       guage (IDL) definitions. Options may appear in any order, but  must  pre&#8208;
       cede the idl-file.

Description
       The  IDL-to-Java  Compiler  generates  the  Java bindings for a given IDL
       file.  For binding details, see the OMG IDL to Java Language Language
       Mapping Specification @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/map&#8208;
       ping/jidlMapping.html. Some previous releases of the IDL-to-Java compiler
       were named idltojava.

   Emitting Client and Server Bindings
       To generate Java bindings for an IDL file named My.idl:

       idlj My.idl


       This generates the client-side bindings and is equivalent to:

       idlj -fclient My.idl


       The client-side bindings do not include the server-side skeleton. If you
       want to generate the server-side bindings for the interfaces:

       idlj -fserver My.idl


       Server-side bindings include the client-side bindings plus the skeleton,
       all of which are POA (that is, Inheritance Model) classes. If you want to
       generate both client and server-side bindings, use one of the following
       (equivalent) commands:

       idlj -fclient -fserver My.idl
       idlj -fall My.idl


       There are two possible server-side models: the Inheritance Model and the
       Tie Delegation Model.

       The default server-side model is the Portable Servant Inheritance Model.
       Given an interface My defined in My.idl, the file MyPOA.java is gener&#8208;
       ated. You must provide the implementation for My and it must inherit from
       MyPOA.

       MyPOA.java is a stream-based skeleton that extends org.omg.Portable&#8208;
       Server.Servant @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/omg/PortableServer/Ser&#8208;
       vant.html and implements the InvokeHandler interface and the operations
       interface associated with the IDL interface the skeleton implements.

       The PortableServer module for the Portable Object Adapter (POA) @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/POA.html
       defines the native Servant type. In the Java programming language, the
       Servant type is mapped to the Java org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class.
       It serves as the base class for all POA servant implementations and pro&#8208;
       vides a number of methods that may be invoked by the application program&#8208;
       mer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA itself and may be
       overridden by the user to control aspects of servant behavior.

       Another option for the Inheritance Model is to use the -oldImplBase flag
       in order to generate server-side bindings that are compatible with ver&#8208;
       sions of the Java programming language prior to J2SE 1.4. Note that using
       the -oldImplBase flag is non-standard: these APIs are being deprecated.
       You would use this flag ONLY for compatibility with existing servers
       written in J2SE 1.3. In that case, you would need to modify an existing
       MAKEFILE to add the -oldImplBase flag to the idlj compiler, otherwise
       POA-based server-side mappings will be generated. To generate server-side
       bindings that are backwards compatible:

       idlj -fclient -fserver -oldImplBase My.idl
       idlj -fall -oldImplBase My.idl


       Given an interface My defined in My.idl, the file _MyImplBase.java is
       generated. You must provide the implementation for My and it must inherit
       from _MyImplBase.

       The other server-side model is called the Tie Model. This is a delegation
       model. Because it is not possible to generate ties and skeletons at the
       same time, they must be generated separately. The following commands gen&#8208;
       erate the bindings for the Tie Model:

       idlj -fall My.idl
       idlj -fallTIE My.idl


       For the interface My, the second command generates MyPOATie.java. The
       constructor to MyPOATie takes a delegate. In this example, using the
       default POA model, the constructor also needs a poa. You must provide the
       implementation for delegate, but it does not have to inherit from any
       other class, only the interface MyOperations. But to use it with the ORB,
       you must wrap your implementation within MyPOATie. For instance:

           ORB orb = ORB.init(args, System.getProperties());

           // Get reference to rootpoa &amp; activate the POAManager
           POA rootpoa = (POA)orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);
           rootpoa.the_POAManager().activate();

           // create servant and register it with the ORB
           MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant();
           myDelegate.setORB(orb);

           // create a tie, with servant being the delegate.
           MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate, rootpoa);

           // obtain the objectRef for the tie
           My ref = tie._this(orb);


       You might want to use the Tie model instead of the typical Inheritance
       model if your implementation must inherit from some other implementation.
       Java allows any number of interface inheritance, but there is only one
       slot for class inheritance. If you use the inheritance model, that slot
       is used up . By using the Tie Model, that slot is freed up for your own
       use. The drawback is that it introduces a level of indirection: one extra
       method call occurs when invoking a method.

       To generate server-side, Tie model bindings that are compatible with ver&#8208;
       sions of the IDL to Java language mapping in versions prior to J2SE 1.4.

       idlj -oldImplBase -fall My.idl
       idlj -oldImplBase -fallTIE My.idl


       For the interface My, this will generate My_Tie.java. The constructor to
       My_Tie takes a impl. You must provide the implementation for impl, but it
       does not have to inherit from any other class, only the interface Hel&#8208;
       loOperations. But to use it with the ORB, you must wrap your implementa&#8208;
       tion within My_Tie. For instance:

           ORB orb = ORB.init(args, System.getProperties());

           // create servant and register it with the ORB
           MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant();
           myDelegate.setORB(orb);

           // create a tie, with servant being the delegate.
           MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate);

           // obtain the objectRef for the tie
           My ref = tie._this(orb);


   Specifying Alternate Locations for Emitted Files
       If you want to direct the emitted files to a directory other than the
       current directory, invoke the compiler as:

       idlj -td /altdir My.idl


       For the interface My, the bindings will be emitted to /altdir/My.java,
       etc., instead of ./My.java.

   Specifying Alternate Locations for Include Files
       If My.idl included another idl file, MyOther.idl, the compiler assumes
       that MyOther.idl resides in the local directory. If it resides in
       /includes, for example, then you would invoke the compiler with the fol&#8208;
       lowing command:

       idlj -i /includes My.idl


       If My.idl also included Another.idl that resided in /moreIncludes, for
       example, then you would invoke the compiler with the following command:

       idlj -i /includes -i /moreIncludes My.idl


       Since this form of include can become irritatingly long, another means of
       indicating to the compiler where to search for included files is pro&#8208;
       vided. This technique is similar to the idea of an environment variable.
       Create a file named idl.config in a directory that is listed in your
       CLASSPATH. Inside of idl.config, provide a line with the following form:

       includes=/includes;/moreIncludes


       The compiler will find this file and read in the includes list. Note that
       in this example the separator character between the two directories is a
       semicolon (;). This separator character is platform dependent. On the
       Windows platform, use a semicolon, on the Unix platform, use a colon,
       etc. For more information on includes, see the Setting the Classpath @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/index.html#general.

   Emitting Bindings for Include Files
       By default, only those interfaces, structs, etc, that are defined in the
       idl file on the command line have Java bindings generated for them. The
       types defined in included files are not generated. For example, assume
       the following two idl files:

       My.idl

       #include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
       interface My
       {
       };


       MyOther.idl

       interface MyOther
       {
       };


       The following command will only generate the java bindings for My:

       idlj My.idl


       To generate all of the types in My.idl and all of the types in the files
       that My.idl includes (in this example, MyOther.idl), use the following
       command:

       idlj -emitAll My.idl


       There is a caveat to the default rule. #include statements which appear
       at global scope are treated as described. These #include statements can
       be thought of as import statements. #include statements which appear
       within some enclosing scope are treated as true #include statements,
       meaning that the code within the included file is treated as if it
       appeared in the original file and, therefore, Java bindings are emitted
       for it. Here is an example:

       My.idl

       #include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
       interface My
       {
         #include &lt;Embedded.idl&gt;
       };


       MyOther.idl

       interface MyOther
       {
       };


       Embedded.idl

       enum E {one, two, three};


       Running the following command:
&#12;       idlj My.idl


       will generate the following list of Java files:

       Notice that MyOther.java was not generated because it is defined in an
       import-like #include. But E.java was generated because it was defined in
       a true #include. Also notice that since Embedded.idl was included within
       the scope of the interface My, it appears within the scope of My (that
       is,in MyPackage).

       If the -emitAll flag had been used in the previous example, then all
       types in all included files would be emitted.

   Inserting Package Prefixes
       Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has constructed the
       following IDL file:

       Widgets.idl

       module Widgets
       {
         interface W1 {...};
         interface W2 {...};
       };


       Running this file through the IDL-to-Java compiler will place the Java
       bindings for W1 and W2 within the package Widgets. But there is an indus&#8208;
       try convention that states that a company&apos;s packages should reside within
       a package named com.&lt;company name&gt;. The Widgets package is not good
       enough. To follow convention, it should be com.abc.Widgets. To place this
       package prefix onto the Widgets module, execute the following:

       idlj -pkgPrefix Widgets com.abc Widgets.idl


       If you have an IDL file which includes Widgets.idl, the -pkgPrefix flag
       must appear in that command also. If it does not, then your IDL file will
       be looking for a Widgets package rather than a com.abc.Widgets package.

       If you have a number of these packages that require prefixes, it might be
       easier to place them into the idl.config file described above. Each pack&#8208;
       age prefix line should be of the form:

       PkgPrefix.&lt;type&gt;=&lt;prefix&gt;


       So the line for the above example would be:
       PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc


       The use of this option does not affect the Repository ID.

   Defining Symbols Before Compilation
       You may need to define a symbol for compilation that is not defined
       within the IDL file, perhaps to include debugging code in the bindings.
       The command

       idlj -d MYDEF My.idl


       is the equivalent of putting the line #define MYDEF inside My.idl.

   Preserving Pre-Existing Bindings
       If the Java binding files already exist, the -keep flag will keep the
       compiler from overwriting them. The default is to generate all files
       without considering if they already exist. If you&apos;ve customized those
       files (which you should not do unless you are very comfortable with their
       contents), then the -keep option is very useful. The command

       idlj -keep My.idl


       emits all client-side bindings that do not already exist.

   Viewing Progress of Compilation
       The IDL-to-Java compiler will generate status messages as it progresses
       through its phases of execution. Use the -v option to activate this &quot;ver&#8208;
       bose&quot; mode:

       idlj -v My.idl


       By default the compiler does not operate in verbose mode.

   Displaying Version Information
       To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler, specify the
       -version option on the command-line:

       idlj -version


       Version information also appears within the bindings generated by the
       compiler. Any additional options appearing on the command-line are
       ignored.

Options
          -d symbol
             This is equivalent to the following line in an IDL file:
             #define symbol

          -emitAll
             Emit all types, including those found in #include files.

          -fside
             Defines what bindings to emit. side is one of client, server,
             serverTIE, all, or allTIE. The -fserverTIE and -fallTIE options
             cause delegate model skeletons to be emitted. Assumes -fclient if
             the flag is not specified.

          -i include-path
             By default, the current directory is scanned for included files.
             This option adds another directory.

          -keep
             If a file to be generated already exists, do not overwrite it. By
             default it is overwritten.

          -noWarn
             Suppresses warning messages.

          -oldImplBase
             Generates skeletons compatible with pre-1.4 JDK ORBs. By default,
             the POA Inheritance Model server-side bindings are generated. This
             option provides backward-compatibility with older versions of the
             Java programming language by generating server-side bindings that
             are ImplBase Inheritance Model classes.

          -pkgPrefix type prefix
             Wherever type is encountered at file scope, prefix the generated
             Java package name with prefix for all files generated for that
             type. The type is the simple name of either a top-level module, or
             an IDL type defined outside of any module.

          -pkgTranslate type package
             Whenever the module name type is encountered in an identifier,
             replace it in the identifier with package for all files in the gen&#8208;
             erated Java package. Note that pkgPrefix changes are made first.
             type is the simple name of either a top-level module, or an IDL
             type defined outside of any module, and must match the full package
             name exactly.
             If more than one translation matches an identifier, the longest
             match is chosen. For example, if the arguments include:
               -pkgTranslate foo bar -pkgTranslate foo.baz buzz.fizz
             The following translations would occur:
             foo          =&gt; bar
             foo.boo      =&gt; bar.boo
             foo.baz      =&gt; buzz.fizz
             foo.baz.bar  =&gt; buzz.fizz.bar
             The following package names cannot be translated:

             o org

             o org.omg or any subpackages of org.omg
          Any attempt to translate these packages will result in uncompilable
          code, and the use of these packages as the first argument after -pkg&#8208;
          Translate will be treated as an error.

          -skeletonName xxx%yyy
             Use xxx%yyy as the pattern for naming the skeleton. The defaults
             are:

             o %POA for the POA base class (-fserver or -fall)

             o _%ImplBase for the oldImplBase class (-oldImplBase and (-fserver
               or -fall))

          -td dir
             Use dir for the output directory instead of the current directory.

          -tieName xxx%yyy
             Name the tie according to the pattern. The defaults are:

             o %POATie for the POA tie base class (-fserverTie or -fallTie)

             o %_Tie for the oldImplBase tie class (-oldImplBase and (-fserver&#8208;
               Tie or -fallTie))

          -nowarn, -verbose
             Verbose mode.

          -version
             Display version information and terminate.


       See the Description section for more option information.

Restrictions:
          o Escaped identifiers in the global scope may not have the same spell&#8208;
            ing as IDL primitive types, Object, or ValueBase. This is because
            the symbol table is pre-loaded with these identifiers; allowing them
            to be redefined would overwrite their original definitions. (Possi&#8208;
            ble permanent restriction).

          o The fixed IDL type is not supported.


Known Problems:
          o No import generated for global identifiers. If you invoke on an
            unexported local impl, you do get an exception, but it seems to be
            due to a NullPointerException in the ServerDelegate DSI code.
