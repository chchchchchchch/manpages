IDMAP_AD(8)                System Administration tools               IDMAP_AD(8)



NAME
       idmap_ad - Samba&#180;s idmap_ad Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from
       an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema extensions. This module
       implements only the &quot;idmap&quot; API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be
       provided in advance by the administrator by adding the
       posixAccount/posixGroup classes and relative attribute/value pairs to the
       user and group objects in the AD.

       Note that the idmap_ad module has changed considerably since Samba
       versions 3.0 and 3.2. Currently, the ad backend does not work as the the
       default idmap backend, but one has to configure it separately for each
       domain for which one wants to use it, using disjoint ranges. One usually
       needs to configure a writeable default idmap range, using for example the
       tdb or ldap backend, in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and
       possibly other trusted domains. The writeable default config is also
       needed in order to be able to create group mappings. This catch-all
       default idmap configuration should have a range that is disjoint from any
       explicitly configured domain with idmap backend ad. See the example
       below.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       range = low - high
           Defines the available matching UID and GID range for which the
           backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
           specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the range is
           ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It is intended as a
           way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely
           defined IDs.

       schema_mode = &lt;rfc2307 | sfu &gt;
           Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use when querying Active
           Directory regarding user and group information. This can be either
           the RFC2307 schema support included in Windows 2003 R2 or the Service
           for Unix (SFU) schema.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal
       and trusted AD domains. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must
       be resolved beforehand, there is no guarantee on the order conflicting
       mappings would be resolved at this point. This example also shows how to
       leave a small non conflicting range for local id allocation that may be
       used in internal backends like BUILTIN.

                [global]
                idmap config * : backend = tdb
                idmap config * : range = 1000000-1999999

                idmap config CORP : backend  = ad
                idmap config CORP : range = 1000-999999

       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
