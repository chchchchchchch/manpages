NAME
       idmap_adex - Samba&#180;s idmap_adex Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_adex plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from
       an AD server that uses RFC2307 schema extensions. This module implements
       both the idmap and nss_info APIs and supports domain trustes as well as
       two-way cross forest trusts. It is a read-only plugin requiring that the
       administrator provide mappings in advance by adding the POSIX attribute
       information to the users and groups objects in AD. The most common means
       of doing this is using &quot;Identity Services for Unix&quot; support on Windows
       2003 R2 and later.

       Note that you must add the uidNumber, gidNumber, and uid attributes to
       the partial attribute set of the forest global catalog servers. This can
       be done using the Active Directory Schema Management MMC plugin
       (schmmgmt.dll).

NSS_INFO
       The nss_info plugin supports reading the unixHomeDirectory, gidNumber,
       loginShell, and uidNumber attributes from the user object and the
       gidNumber attribute from the group object to fill in information required
       by the libc getpwnam() and getgrnam() family of functions. Group
       membership is filled in according to the Windows group membership and not
       the msSFU30PosixMember attribute.

       Username aliases are implement by setting the uid attribute on the user
       object. While group name aliases are implemented by reading the
       displayname attribute from the group object.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings and NSS data from
       our principal and trusted AD domains.

                [global]
                idmap config * : backend = adex
                idmap config * : range = 1000-4000000000

                winbind nss info = adex
                winbind normalize names = yes
