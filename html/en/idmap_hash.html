IDMAP_HASH(8)              System Administration tools             IDMAP_HASH(8)



NAME
       idmap_hash - Samba&#180;s idmap_hash Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_hash plugin implements a hashing algorithm used to map SIDs for
       domain users and groups to 31-bit uids and gids, respectively. This
       plugin also implements the nss_info API and can be used to support a
       local name mapping files if enabled via the &quot;winbind normalize names&quot; and
       &quot;winbind nss info&quot; parameters in smb.conf.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       name_map
           Specifies the absolute path to the name mapping file used by the
           nss_info API. Entries in the file are of the form &quot;unix name =
           qualified domain name&quot;. Mapping of both user and group names is
           supported.

EXAMPLES
       The following example utilizes the idmap_hash plugin for the idmap and
       nss_info information.

                [global]
                idmap config * : backend = hash
                idmap config * : range = 1000-4000000000

                winbind nss info = hash
                winbind normalize names = yes
                idmap_hash:name_map = /etc/samba/name_map.cfg
