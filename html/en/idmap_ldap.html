NAME
       idmap_ldap - Samba&#180;s idmap_ldap Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_ldap plugin provides a means for Winbind to store and retrieve
       SID/uid/gid mapping tables in an LDAP directory service.

       In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is an allocating
       backend: This means that it needs to allocate new user and group IDs in
       order to create new mappings.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       ldap_base_dn = DN
           Defines the directory base suffix to use for SID/uid/gid mapping
           entries. If not defined, idmap_ldap will default to using the &quot;ldap
           idmap suffix&quot; option from smb.conf.

       ldap_user_dn = DN
           Defines the user DN to be used for authentication. The secret for
           authenticating this user should be stored with net idmap secret (see
           net(8)). If absent, the ldap credentials from the ldap passdb
           configuration are used, and if these are also absent, an anonymous
           bind will be performed as last fallback.

       ldap_url = ldap://server/
           Specifies the LDAP server to use for SID/uid/gid map entries. If not
           defined, idmap_ldap will assume that ldap://localhost/ should be
           used.

       range = low - high
           Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
           backend is authoritative.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how an ldap directory is used as the default
       idmap backend. It also configures the idmap range and base directory
       suffix. The secret for the ldap_user_dn has to be set with &quot;net idmap
       secret &#180;*&#180; password&quot;.

                [global]
                idmap config * : backend      = ldap
                idmap config * : range        = 1000000-1999999
                idmap config * : ldap_url     = ldap://localhost/
                idmap config * : ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=example,dc=com
                idmap config * : ldap_user_dn = cn=idmap_admin,dc=example,dc=com


       This example shows how ldap can be used as a readonly backend while tdb
       is the default backend used to store the mappings. It adds an explicit
       configuration for some domain DOM1, that uses the ldap idmap backend.
       Note that a range disjoint from the default range is used.

                [global]
                # &quot;backend = tdb&quot; is redundant here since it is the default
                idmap config * : backend = tdb
                idmap config * : range = 1000000-1999999

                idmap config DOM1 : backend = ldap
                idmap config DOM1 : range = 2000000-2999999
                idmap config DOM1 : read only = yes
                idmap config DOM1 : ldap_url = ldap://server/
                idmap config DOM1 : ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=dom1,dc=example,dc=com
                idmap config DOM1 : ldap_user_dn = cn=idmap_admin,dc=dom1,dc=example,dc=com


NOTE
       In order to use authentication against ldap servers you may need to
       provide a DN and a password. To avoid exposing the password in plain text
       in the configuration file we store it into a security store. The &quot;net
       idmap &quot; command is used to store a secret for the DN specified in a
       specific idmap domain.
