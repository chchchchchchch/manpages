NAME
       idmap_nss - Samba&#180;s idmap_nss Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_nss plugin provides a means to map Unix users and groups to
       Windows accounts and obsoletes the &quot;winbind trusted domains only&quot;
       smb.conf option. This provides a simple means of ensuring that the SID
       for a Unix user named jsmith is reported as the one assigned to
       DOMAIN\jsmith which is necessary for reporting ACLs on files and printers
       stored on a Samba member server.

EXAMPLES
       This example shows how to use idmap_nss to check the local accounts for
       its own domain while using allocation to create new mappings for trusted
       domains

                [global]
                idmap config * : backend = tdb
                idmap config * : range = 1000000-1999999

                idmap config SAMBA : backend  = nss
                idmap config SAMBA : range = 1000-999999


AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
       Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source
       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
