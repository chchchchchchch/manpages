IDMAP_RID(8)               System Administration tools              IDMAP_RID(8)



NAME
       idmap_rid - Samba&#180;s idmap_rid Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_rid backend provides a way to use an algorithmic mapping scheme
       to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No database is required in this case as the
       mapping is deterministic.

       Note that the idmap_rid module has changed considerably since Samba
       versions 3.0. and 3.2. Currently, there should to be an explicit idmap
       configuration for each domain that should use the idmap_rid backend,
       using disjoint ranges. One usually needs to define a writeable default
       idmap range, using a backent like tdb or ldap that can create unix ids,
       in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and other domains, and also
       in order to be able to create group mappings. See the example below.

       Note that the old syntax idmap backend = rid:&quot;DOM1=range DOM2=range2 ...&quot;
       is not supported any more since Samba version 3.0.25.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       range = low - high
           Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
           backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
           algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the range, they
           are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It is intended as
           a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely
           defined IDs.

       base_rid = INTEGER
           Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of a UID or a GID,
           and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID. This means
           SIDs with a RID less than the base rid are filtered. The default is
           not to restrict the allowed rids at all, i.e. a base_rid value of 0.
           A good value for the base_rid can be 1000, since user RIDs by default
           start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal).

           Use of this parameter is deprecated.

THE MAPPING FORMULAS
       The Unix ID for a RID is calculated this way:

                          ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW_RANGE_ID.


       Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for a given Unix ID
       is this:

                          RID = ID + BASE_RID - LOW_RANGE_ID.



EXAMPLES
       This example shows how to configure two domains with idmap_rid, the
       principal domain and a trusted domain, leaving the default id mapping
       scheme at tdb. The example also demonstrates the use of the base_rid
       parameter for the trusted domain.

                [global]
                security = domain
                workgroup = MAIN

                idmap config * : backend        = tdb
                idmap config * : range          = 1000000-1999999

                idmap config MAIN : backend     = rid
                idmap config MAIN : range       = 10000 - 49999

                idmap config TRUSTED : backend  = rid
                idmap config TRUSTED : range    = 50000 - 99999
                idmap config TRUSTED : base_rid = 1000


AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
       Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source
       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
