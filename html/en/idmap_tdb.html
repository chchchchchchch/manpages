NAME
       idmap_tdb - Samba&#180;s idmap_tdb Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_tdb plugin is the default backend used by winbindd for storing
       SID/uid/gid mapping tables.

       In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is an allocating
       backend: This means that it needs to allocate new user and group IDs in
       order to create new mappings.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       range = low - high
           Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
           backend is authoritative.

EXAMPLES
       This example shows how tdb is used as a the default idmap backend. This
       configured range is used for uid and gid allocation.

                [global]
                # &quot;backend = tdb&quot; is redundant here since it is the default
                idmap config * : backend = tdb
                idmap config * : range = 1000000-2000000
