       directives.  Print each identifier on a line, followed by  a  space-sepa&#8208;
       rated list of the files in which that identifier occurs.

       The Debian project regards the full documentation for ifnames to be  non-
       free,  so  it is not included in Debian.  Nevertheless, the non-free dis&#8208;
       tribution that accompanies Debian includes the manual in its autoconf-doc
       package.   Otherwise,  you  may  be  able  to  access the Autoconf manual
       online.
