NAME
       ifup - bring a network interface up

       ifdown - take a network interface down

       ifquery - parse interface configuration

       faces=FILE] [--allow CLASS] -a|IFACE...

DESCRIPTION
       The  ifup and ifdown commands may be used to configure (or, respectively,
       deconfigure) network interfaces based on  interface  definitions  in  the
       file  /etc/network/interfaces.   ifquery  command  may  be  used to parse
       interfaces configuration.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -a, --all
              If given to ifup, affect all interfaces marked  auto.   Interfaces
              are brought up in the order in which they are defined in /etc/net&#8208;
              work/interfaces.  Combined with --allow, acts on all interfaces of
              a specified class instead.  If given to ifdown, affect all defined
              interfaces.  Interfaces are brought down in  the  order  in  which
              they  are  currently  listed  in  the  state file. Only interfaces
              defined in /etc/network/interfaces will be brought down.

       --force
              Force configuration or deconfiguration of the interface.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       --allow=CLASS
              Only allow interfaces listed in an allow-CLASS line  in  /etc/net&#8208;
              work/interfaces to be acted upon.

       -i FILE, --interfaces=FILE
              Read  interface  definitions  from  FILE instead of from /etc/net&#8208;
              work/interfaces.

       -X PATTERN, --exclude=PATTERN
              Exclude interfaces from the list of interfaces to  operate  on  by
              the  PATTERN.   PATTERN  uses  a usual shell glob syntax. If shell
              wildcards are not used, it must match the  exact  interface  name.
              This option may be specified multiple times resulting in more than
              one pattern being excluded.

       -o OPTION=VALUE
              Set OPTION to VALUE as though it were in /etc/network/interfaces.
&#12;       -n, --no-act
              Don&apos;t configure any interfaces or run any &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; commands.

       --no-mappings
              Don&apos;t run any mappings.  See interfaces(5)  for  more  information
              about the mapping feature.

       --no-scripts
              Don&apos;t run any scripts under /etc/network/if-*.d/

       -V, --version
              Show copyright and version information.

       -v, --verbose
              Show commands as they are executed.

       -l, --list
              For  ifquery,  list  all  the interfaces which match the specified
              class.  If no class specified, prints all the interfaces listed as
              auto.

EXAMPLES
       ifup -a
              Bring  up  all  the  interfaces  defined  with  auto  in /etc/net&#8208;
              work/interfaces

       ifup eth0
              Bring up interface eth0

       ifup eth0=home
              Bring up interface eth0 as logical interface home

       ifdown -a
              Bring down all interfaces that are currently up.

       ifquery -l
              Print names of all interfaces specified with the auto keyword.

       ifquery -l --allow=hotplug
              Print names of all interfaces  specified  with  the  allow-hotplug
              keyword.

       ifquery eth0
              Display the interface options as specified in the ifupdown config&#8208;
              uration. Each key-value pair is printed  out  on  individual  line
              using &quot;: &quot; as separator.

NOTES
       ifup, ifdown, and ifquery are actually the same program called by differ&#8208;
       ent names.

       The program does not configure network interfaces directly; it  runs  low
       level utilities such as ip to do its dirty work.

       When  invoked,  ifdown  checks  if  ifup  is still running. In that case,
       SIGTERM is sent to ifup.

FILES
       /etc/network/interfaces
              definitions of  network  interfaces  See  interfaces(5)  for  more
              information.

       /run/network/ifstate
              current state of network interfaces

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       The  program  keeps records of whether network interfaces are up or down.
       Under exceptional circumstances these  records  can  become  inconsistent
       with  the  real states of the interfaces.  For example, an interface that
       was brought up using ifup and  later  deconfigured  using  ifconfig  will
       still  be  recorded as up.  To fix this you can use the --force option to
       force ifup or ifdown to run  configuration  or  deconfiguration  commands
       despite what it considers the current state of the interface to be.

       The file /run/network/ifstate must be writable for ifup or ifdown to work
       properly.  If that location is not writable  (for  example,  because  the
       root  filesystem is mounted read-only for system recovery) then /run/net&#8208;
       work/ifstate should be made a symbolic link to a writable  location.   If
       that  is not possible then you can use the --force option to run configu&#8208;
       ration or deconfiguration commands without updating the file.

       Note that the program does not run automatically:  ifup  alone  does  not
       bring  up  interfaces that appear as a result of hardware being installed
       and ifdown alone does not bring  down  interfaces  that  disappear  as  a
       result  of hardware being removed.  To automate the configuration of net&#8208;
       work interfaces you need to install other packages  such  as  udev(7)  or
       ifplugd(8).
