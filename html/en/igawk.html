NAME
       igawk - gawk with include files

SYNOPSIS
       igawk [ all gawk options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
       igawk [ all gawk options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Igawk  is  a  simple shell script that adds the ability to have ``include
       files&apos;&apos; to gawk(1).

       AWK programs for igawk are the same as for gawk, except  that,  in  addi&#8208;
       tion, you may have lines like

              @include getopt.awk

       in  your  program  to include the file getopt.awk from either the current
       directory or one of the other directories in the search path.

OPTIONS
       See gawk(1) for a full description of the AWK language  and  the  options
       that gawk supports.

EXAMPLES
       cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; test.awk
       @include getopt.awk

       BEGIN {
            while (getopt(ARGC, ARGV, &quot;am:q&quot;) != -1)
                 ...
       }
       EOF

       igawk -f test.awk
