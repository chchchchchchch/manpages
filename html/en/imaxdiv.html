DIV(3)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     DIV(3)



NAME
       div,  ldiv, lldiv, imaxdiv - compute quotient and remainder of an integer
       division

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       div_t div(int numerator, int denominator);
       ldiv_t ldiv(long numerator, long denominator);
       lldiv_t lldiv(long long numerator, long long denominator);

       #include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;

       imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t numerator, intmax_t denominator);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       lldiv():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The div() function computes the value numerator/denominator  and  returns
       the  quotient  and remainder in a structure named div_t that contains two
       integer members (in unspecified order) named quot and rem.  The  quotient
       is  rounded  toward  zero.   The  result satisfies quot*denominator+rem =
       numerator.

       The ldiv(), lldiv(), and imaxdiv() functions do the same,  dividing  num&#8208;
       bers of the indicated type and returning the result in a structure of the
       indicated name, in all cases with fields quot and rem of the same type as
       the function arguments.

RETURN VALUE
       The div_t (etc.) structure.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4,  4.3BSD,  C89. C99.  The functions lldiv() and imaxdiv() were added
       in C99.

EXAMPLE
       After

               div_t q = div(-5, 3);

       the values q.quot and q.rem are -1 and -2, respectively.
