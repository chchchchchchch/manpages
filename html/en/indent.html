INDENT(1)                                                              INDENT(1)



NAME
       indent  -  changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or deleting
       whitespace.

SYNOPSIS
       indent [options] [input-files]

       indent [options] [single-input-file] [-o output-file]

       indent --version

DESCRIPTION
       This man page is generated from the file indent.texinfo.  This is Edition
       of &quot;The indent Manual&quot;, for Indent Version , last updated .

       The  indent program can be used to make code easier to read.  It can also
       convert from one style of writing C to another.

       indent understands a substantial amount about the syntax  of  C,  but  it
       also attempts to cope with incomplete and misformed syntax.

       In  version  1.2  and more recent versions, the GNU style of indenting is
       the default.

INVOKING INDENT
       As of version 1.3, the format of the indent command is:


            indent [options] [input-files]

            indent [options] [single-input-file] [-o output-file]


       This  format  is  different  from  earlier versions and other versions of
       indent.

       In the first form, one or more input files are specified.  indent makes a
       backup  copy  of  each  file,  and the original file is replaced with its
       indented version.  See BACKUP FILES, for an explanation  of  how  backups
       are made.

       In  the  second form, only one input file is specified.  In this case, or
       when the standard input is used, you may specify an output file after the
       &#8216;-o&#8217; option.

       To  cause indent to write to standard output, use the &#8216;-st&#8217; option.  This
       is only allowed when there is only one input file, or when  the  standard
       input is used.

       If no input files are named, the standard input is read for input.  Also,
       if a filename named &#8216;-&#8217; is specified, then the standard input is read.
&#12;       As an example, each of the following  commands  will  input  the  program
       &#8216;slithy_toves.c&#8217; and write its indented text to &#8216;slithy_toves.out&#8217;:


            indent slithy_toves.c -o slithy_toves.out

            indent -st slithy_toves.c &gt; slithy_toves.out

            cat slithy_toves.c | indent -o slithy_toves.out


       Most  other  options to indent control how programs are formatted.  As of
       version 1.2, indent also recognizes a long name  for  each  option  name.
       Long  options  are prefixed by either &#8216;--&#8217; or &#8216;+&#8217;.  [ &#8216;+&#8217; is being super&#8208;
       seded by &#8216;--&#8217; to maintain consistency with the POSIX standard.]
        In most of this document, the traditional, short names are used for  the
       sake  of  brevity.   See OPTION SUMMARY, for a list of options, including
       both long and short names.

       Here is another example:

            indent -br test/metabolism.c -l85

       This will indent the program  &#8216;test/metabolism.c&#8217;  using  the  &#8216;-br&#8217;  and
       &#8216;-l85&#8217;  options,  write the output back to &#8216;test/metabolism.c&#8217;, and write
       the original contents of &#8216;test/metabolism.c&#8217; to  a  backup  file  in  the
       directory &#8216;test&#8217;.

       Equivalent invocations using long option names for this example would be:


            indent --braces-on-if-line --line-length185 test/metabolism.c

            indent +braces-on-if-line +line-length185 test/metabolism.c


       If  you find that you often use indent with the same options, you may put
       those options into a file named &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217;.  indent will  look  for  a
       profile  file  in three places. First it will check the environment vari&#8208;
       able INDENT_PROFILE. If that exists its value is  expected  to  name  the
       file  that  is  to  be  used. If the environment variable does not exist,
       indent looks for &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217; in the current directory
        and use that if found.  Finally indent will search your  home  directory
       for  &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217;  and  use that file if it is found.  This behaviour is
       different from that of other versions of indent, which load both files if
       they both exist.

       The  format  of  &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217;  is simply a list of options, just as they
       would appear on the command line, separated by white space (tabs, spaces,
       and  newlines).   Options  in &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217; may be surrounded by C or C++
       comments, in which case they are ignored.

       Command  line  switches  are  handled  after  processing  &#8216; .indent.pro&#8217;.
       Options  specified  later  override arguments specified earlier, with one
       exception:  Explicitly  specified  options  always  override   background
       options  (See  COMMON STYLES).   You  can  prevent indent from reading an
       &#8216;.indent.pro&#8217; file by specifying the &#8216;-npro&#8217; option.


BACKUP FILES
       As of version 1.3, GNU indent makes GNU-style backup files, the same  way
       GNU  Emacs  does.  This means that either simple or numbered backup file&#8208;
       names may be made.

       Simple backup file names are generated by appending a suffix to the orig&#8208;
       inal  file name.  The default for this suffix is the one-character string
       &#8216;~&#8217; (tilde).  Thus, the backup file for &#8216;python.c&#8217; would be &#8216;python.c~&#8217;.

       Instead of the default, you may specify any string as a suffix by setting
       the environment variable SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX to your preferred suffix.

       Numbered   backup   versions   of   a   file   &#8216;momeraths.c&#8217;   look  like
       &#8216;momeraths.c.~23~&#8217;, where 23 is the version of  this  particular  backup.
       When  making  a numbered backup of the file &#8216;src/momeraths.c&#8217;, the backup
       file will be named &#8216;src/momeraths.c.~V~&#8217;, where V is one greater than the
       highest  version currently existing in the directory &#8216;src&#8217;.  The environ&#8208;
       ment variable VERSION_WIDTH controls the number  of  digits,  using  left
       zero  padding when necessary.  For instance, setting this variable to &quot;2&quot;
       will lead to the backup file being named &#8216;momeraths.c.~04~&#8217;.

       The type of backup file made is controlled by the value of  the  environ&#8208;
       ment  variable  VERSION_CONTROL.  If it is the string &#8216;simple&#8217;, then only
       simple backups will be made.  If its value is the string &#8216;numbered&#8217;, then
       numbered backups will be made.  If its value is &#8216;numbered-existing&#8217;, then
       numbered backups will be made if there already exist numbered backups for
       the  file  being  indented;  otherwise, a simple backup is made.  If VER&#8208;
       SION_CONTROL is not set, then indent assumes the behaviour of  &#8216;numbered-
       existing&#8217;.

       Other  versions  of  indent use the suffix &#8216;.BAK&#8217; in naming backup files.
       This behaviour can be emulated by setting SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX to &#8216;.BAK&#8217;.

       Note also that other versions of  indent  make  backups  in  the  current
       directory,  rather than in the directory of the source file as GNU indent
       now does.


COMMON STYLES
       There are several common styles of C code, including the GNU  style,  the
       Kernighan  &amp; Ritchie style, and the original Berkeley style.  A style may
       be selected with a single background option, which  specifies  a  set  of
       values  for  all  other  options.   However, explicitly specified options
       always override options implied by a background option.

       As of version 1.2, the default style of GNU  indent  is  the  GNU  style.
       Thus,  it  is  no longer necessary to specify the option &#8216;-gnu&#8217; to obtain
       this format, although doing so will not cause an error.  Option  settings
       which correspond to the GNU style are:

            -nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -bl -bli2 -bls -ncdb -nce -cp1 -cs -di2
            -ndj -nfc1 -nfca -hnl -i2 -ip5 -lp -pcs -nprs -psl -saf -sai
            -saw -nsc -nsob

       The  GNU  coding  style  is that preferred by the GNU project.  It is the
       style that the GNU Emacs C mode encourages and which is  used  in  the  C
       portions  of  GNU  Emacs.   (People  interested  in  writing programs for
       Project GNU should get a copy of &quot;The GNU Coding Standards&quot;,  which  also
       covers  semantic and portability issues such as memory usage, the size of
       integers, etc.)

       The Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style is used throughout  their  well-known  book
       &quot;The  C Programming Language&quot;.  It is enabled with the &#8216;-kr&#8217; option.  The
       Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style corresponds to the following set of options:

            -nbad -bap -bbo -nbc -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce -ci4 -cli0
            -cp33 -cs -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -nfca -hnl -i4 -ip0 -l75 -lp -npcs
            -nprs -npsl -saf -sai -saw -nsc -nsob -nss

       Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style does not put comments to the right of  code  in
       the same column at all times (nor does it use only one space to the right
       of the code), so for this style indent has arbitrarily chosen column 33.

       The style of the original Berkeley indent may be obtained  by  specifying
       &#8216;-orig&#8217;  (or  by  specifying  &#8216;--original&#8217;,  using the long option name).
       This style is equivalent to the following settings:

            -nbad -nbap -bbo -bc -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -cdb -ce -ci4 -cli0
            -cp33 -di16 -fc1 -fca -hnl -i4 -ip4 -l75 -lp -npcs -nprs -psl
            -saf -sai -saw -sc -nsob -nss -ts8
&#12;       The Linux style is used in the linux kernel code and drivers. Code gener&#8208;
       ally  has to follow the Linux coding style to be accepted.  This style is
       equivalent to the following settings:

            -nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -hnl -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce -ci4
            -cli0 -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -i8 -ip0 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs -npsl -sai
            -saf -saw -ncs -nsc -sob -nfca -cp33 -ss -ts8 -il1


BLANK LINES
       Various programming styles use blank lines in different  places.   indent
       has  a  number  of  options  to  insert or delete blank lines in specific
       places.

       The &#8216;-bad&#8217; option causes indent to force a blank line after  every  block
       of  declarations.   The  &#8216;-nbad&#8217;  option  causes indent not to force such
       blank lines.

       The &#8216;-bap&#8217; option forces a blank line after every  procedure  body.   The
       &#8216;-nbap&#8217; option forces no such blank line.

       The  &#8216;-bbb&#8217;  option  forces  a blank line before every boxed comment (See
       COMMENTS.)  The &#8216;-nbbb&#8217; option does not force such blank lines.

       The &#8216;-sob&#8217; option causes indent to swallow optional blank lines (that is,
       any  optional  blank  lines present in the input will be removed from the
       output).  If the &#8216;-nsob&#8217; is specified, any blank  lines  present  in  the
       input file will be copied to the output file.



--blank-lines-after-declarations
       The  &#8216;-bad&#8217; option forces a blank line after every block of declarations.
       The &#8216;-nbad&#8217; option does not add any such blank lines.

       For example, given the input
            char *foo;
            char *bar;
            /* This separates blocks of declarations.  */
            int baz;

       indent -bad produces

            char *foo;
            char *bar;

            /* This separates blocks of declarations.  */
            int baz;

       and indent -nbad produces

            char *foo;
            char *bar;
            /* This separates blocks of declarations.  */
            int baz;


--blank-lines-after-procedures
       The &#8216;-bap&#8217; option forces a blank line after every procedure body.

       For example, given the input

            int
            foo ()
            {
              puts(&quot;Hi&quot;);
            }
            /* The procedure bar is even less interesting.  */
            char *
            bar ()
            {
              puts(&quot;Hello&quot;);
            }

       indent -bap produces

            int
            foo ()
            {
              puts (&quot;Hi&quot;);
            }

            /* The procedure bar is even less interesting.  */
            char *
            bar ()
            {
              puts (&quot;Hello&quot;);
            }

       and indent -nbap produces

            int
            foo ()
            {
              puts (&quot;Hi&quot;);
            }
            /* The procedure bar is even less interesting.  */
            char *
            bar ()
            {
              puts (&quot;Hello&quot;);
            }

       No blank line will be added after the procedure foo.


COMMENTS
       indent formats both C and C++ comments. C comments are begun  with  &#8216;/*&#8217;,
       terminated  with  &#8216;*/&#8217;  and may contain newline characters.  C++ comments
       begin with the delimiter &#8216;//&#8217; and end at the newline.

       indent handles comments differently depending upon their context.  indent
       attempts  to  distinguish  between comments which follow statements, com&#8208;
       ments which follow declarations, comments following  preprocessor  direc&#8208;
       tives,  and  comments  which  are not preceded by code of any sort, i.e.,
       they begin the text of the line (although not necessarily in column 1).

       indent further distinguishes between comments found outside of procedures
       and  aggregates,  and  those  found within them.  In particular, comments
       beginning a line found within a procedure will be indented to the  column
       at  which code is currently indented.  The exception to this is a comment
       beginning in the leftmost column;  such a comment is output at that  col&#8208;
       umn.

       indent  attempts  to leave boxed comments unmodified. The general idea of
       such a comment is that it is enclosed in a rectangle or &#8216;&#8216;box&#8217;&#8217; of  stars
       or  dashes  to visually set it apart.  More precisely, boxed comments are
       defined as those in which the initial &#8216;/*&#8217; is followed immediately by the
       character  &#8216;*&#8217;, &#8216;=&#8217;, &#8216;_&#8217;, or &#8216;-&#8217;, or those in which the beginning comment
       delimiter (&#8216;/*&#8217;) is on a line by itself, and the  following  line  begins
       with a &#8216;*&#8217; in the same column as the star of the opening delimiter.

       Examples of boxed comments are:

            /**********************
             * Comment in a box!! *
             **********************/

                   /*
                    * A different kind of scent,
                    * for a different kind of comment.
                    */

       indent  attempts to leave boxed comments exactly as they are found in the
       source file.  Thus the indentation of the comment is unchanged,  and  its
       length  is  not  checked in any way.  The only alteration made is that an
       embedded tab character may be converted into the  appropriate  number  of
       spaces.

       If  the  &#8216;-bbb&#8217; option is specified, all such boxed comments will be pre&#8208;
       ceded by a blank line, unless such a comment is preceded by code.

       Comments which are not boxed comments may be formatted, which means  that
       the  line  is  broken  to  fit within a right margin and left-filled with
       whitespace.  Single newlines are equivalent to a space, but  blank  lines
       (two  or  more  newlines  in  a row) are taken to mean a paragraph break.
       Formatting of comments which begin after the first column is enabled with
       the  &#8216;-fca&#8217;  option.   To  format  those beginning in column one, specify
       &#8216;-fc1&#8217;.  Such formatting is disabled by default.

       The right margin for formatting defaults to 78, but may be  changed  with
       the  &#8216;-lc&#8217; option.  If the margin specified does not allow the comment to
       be printed, the margin will be automatically extended for the duration of
       that  comment.   The  margin is not respected if the comment is not being
       formatted.

       If the comment begins a line (i.e., there  is  no  program  text  to  its
       left),  it will be indented to the column it was found in unless the com&#8208;
       ment is within a block of code.  In that case, such  a  comment  will  be
       aligned with the indented code of that block (unless the comment began in
       the first column).  This alignment may be affected by  the  &#8216;-d&#8217;  option,
       which  specifies  an amount by which such comments are moved to the left,
       or unindented.  For example, &#8216;-d2&#8217; places comments two spaces to the left
       of  code.   By default, comments are aligned with code, unless they begin
       in the first column, in which case they are left there by default ---  to
       get them aligned with the code, specify &#8216;-fc1&#8217;.

       Comments  to the right of code will appear by default in column 33.  This
       may be changed with one of three options.  &#8216;-c&#8217; will specify  the  column
       for comments following code, &#8216;-cd&#8217; specifies the column for comments fol&#8208;
       lowing declarations, and &#8216;-cp&#8217; specifies the column for comments  follow&#8208;
       ing  preprocessor directives #else and #endif. &#8216;-dj&#8217; together with &#8216;-cd0&#8217;
       can be used to suppress alignment of comments to the  right  of  declara&#8208;
       tions, causing the comment to follow one tabstop from the end of the dec&#8208;
       laration. Normally &#8216;-cd0&#8217; causes &#8216;-c&#8217; to become effective.

       If the code to the left of the comment exceeds the beginning column,  the
       comment  column  will be extended to the next tabstop column past the end
       of the code, or in the case of preprocessor directives, to one space past
       the  end  of  the directive.  This extension lasts only for the output of
       that particular comment.

       The &#8216;-cdb&#8217; option places the comment delimiters on blank lines.  Thus,  a
       single line comment like /* Loving hug */ can be transformed into:

            /*
               Loving hug
             */

       Stars  can  be  placed  at  the beginning of multi-line comments with the
       &#8216;-sc&#8217; option.  Thus, the single-line comment  above  can  be  transformed
       (with &#8216;-cdb -sc&#8217;) into:

            /*
             * Loving hug
             */


STATEMENTS
       The &#8216;-br&#8217; or &#8216;-bl&#8217; option specifies how to format braces.
&#12;       The &#8216;-br&#8217; option formats statement braces like this:

            if (x &gt; 0) {
              x--;
            }

       The &#8216;-bl&#8217; option formats them like this:

            if (x &gt; 0)
              {
                x--;
              }

       If  you  use  the  &#8216;-bl&#8217;  option, you may also want to specify the &#8216;-bli&#8217;
       option.  This option specifies the number of spaces by which  braces  are
       indented.   &#8216;-bli2&#8217;,  the default, gives the result shown above.  &#8216;-bli0&#8217;
       results in the following:

            if (x &gt; 0)
            {
              x--;
            }

       If you are using the &#8216;-br&#8217; option, you probably  want  to  also  use  the
       &#8216;-ce&#8217;  option.  This causes the else in an if-then-else construct to cud&#8208;
       dle up to the immediately preceding &#8216;}&#8217;.  For example, with &#8216;-br -ce&#8217; you
       get the following:

            if (x &gt; 0) {
              x--;
            } else {
              fprintf (stderr, &quot;...something wrong?\n&quot;);
            }

       With &#8216;-br -nce&#8217; that code would appear as

            if (x &gt; 0) {
              x--;
            }
            else {
              fprintf (stderr, &quot;...something wrong?\n&quot;);
            }

       This  causes the while in a do-while loop to cuddle up to the immediately
       preceding &#8216;}&#8217;.  For example, with &#8216;-cdw&#8217; you get the following:

            do {
              x--;
            } while (x);

       With &#8216;-ncdw&#8217; that code would appear as

            do {
              x--;
            }
            while (x);

       The &#8216;-cli&#8217; option specifies the number of spaces that case labels  should
       be indented to the right of the containing switch statement.

       The default gives code like:

            switch (i)
              {
              case 0:
                break;
              case 1:
                {
                  ++i;
                }
              default:
                break;
              }

       Using the &#8216;-cli2&#8217; that would become:

            switch (i)
              {
                case 0:
                  break;
                case 1:
                  {
                    ++i;
                  }
                default:
                  break;
              }

       The  indentation  of  the braces below a case statement can be controlled
       with the &#8216;-cbin&#8217; option.  For example, using &#8216;-cli2 -cbi0&#8217; results in:

            switch (i)
              {
                case 0:
                  break;
                case 1:
                {
                  ++i;
                }
                default:
                  break;
              }

       If a semicolon is on the same line as a for or while statement, the &#8216;-ss&#8217;
       option will cause a space to be placed before the semicolon.  This empha&#8208;
       sizes the semicolon, making it clear that the body of the  for  or  while
       statement is an empty statement.  &#8216;-nss&#8217; disables this feature.

       The  &#8216;-pcs&#8217;  option  causes  a space to be placed between the name of the
       procedure being called and  the  &#8216;(&#8217;  (for  example,  puts (&quot;Hi&quot;);.   The
       &#8216;-npcs&#8217; option would give puts(&quot;Hi&quot;);).


       If  the  &#8216;-cs&#8217;  option  is  specified, indent puts a space between a cast
       operator and the object to be cast. The &#8216;-ncs&#8217; ensures that there  is  no
       space between the cast operator and the object. Remember that indent only
       knows about the standard C data  types  and  so  cannot  recognise  user-
       defined types in casts. Thus (mytype)thing is not treated as a cast.

       The &#8216;-bs&#8217; option ensures that there is a space between the keyword sizeof
       and its argument.  In some versions, this is known as the  &#8216;Bill_Shannon&#8217;
       option.

       The  &#8216;-saf&#8217;  option forces a space between a for and the following paren&#8208;
       thesis.  This is the default.

       The &#8216;-sai&#8217; option forces a space between a if and the following parenthe&#8208;
       sis.  This is the default.

       The &#8216;-saw&#8217; option forces a space between a while and the following paren&#8208;
       thesis.  This is the default.

       The &#8216;-prs&#8217; option causes all parentheses to be  separated  with  a  space
       from whatever is between them.  For example, using &#8216;-prs&#8217; results in code
       like:

              while ( ( e_code - s_code ) &lt; ( dec_ind - 1 ) )
                {
                  set_buf_break ( bb_dec_ind );
                  *e_code++ = &#8217; &#8217;;
                }
&#12;
DECLARATIONS
       By default indent will line up identifiers, in the  column  specified  by
       the &#8216;-di&#8217; option.  For example, &#8216;-di16&#8217; makes things look like:

            int             foo;
            char           *bar;

       Using a small value (such as one or two) for the &#8216;-di&#8217; option can be used
       to cause the identifiers to be placed in the  first  available  position;
       for example:

            int foo;
            char *bar;

       The value given to the &#8216;-di&#8217; option will still affect variables which are
       put on separate lines from their types, for example &#8216;-di2&#8217; will lead to:

            int
              foo;

       If the &#8216;-bc&#8217; option is specified, a newline is forced after each comma in
       a declaration.  For example,

            int a,
              b,
              c;

       With the &#8216;-nbc&#8217; option this would look like

            int a, b, c;

       The &#8216;-bfda&#8217; option causes a newline to be forced after the comma separat&#8208;
       ing the arguments of a function declaration.  The arguments  will  appear
       at  one  indention  level  deeper than the function declaration.  This is
       particularly helpful for functions with long argument lists.  The  option
       &#8216;-bfde&#8217;  causes  a newline to be forced before the closing bracket of the
       function declaration. For both options the &#8217;n&#8217; setting  is  the  default:
       -nbdfa and -nbdfe.


       For example,

            void foo (int arg1, char arg2, int *arg3, long arg4, char arg5);
       With the &#8216;-bfda&#8217; option this would look like

            void foo (
                int arg1,
                char arg2,
                int *arg3,
                long arg4,
                char arg5);

       With, in addition, the &#8216;-bfde&#8217; option this would look like

            void foo (
                int arg1,
                char arg2,
                int *arg3,
                long arg4,
                char arg5
                );

       The  &#8216;-psl&#8217;  option  causes  the  type of a procedure being defined to be
       placed on the line before the name  of  the  procedure.   This  style  is
       required  for the etags program to work correctly, as well as some of the
       c-mode functions of Emacs.

       You must use the &#8216;-T&#8217; option to tell indent the name of all the typenames
       in  your program that are defined by typedef.  &#8216;-T&#8217; can be specified more
       than once, and all names specified are used.  For example, if  your  pro&#8208;
       gram contains

            typedef unsigned long CODE_ADDR;
            typedef enum {red, blue, green} COLOR;

       you would use the options &#8216;-T CODE_ADDR -T COLOR&#8217;.


       The &#8216;-brs&#8217; or &#8216;-bls&#8217; option specifies how to format braces in struct dec&#8208;
       larations.  The &#8216;-brs&#8217; option formats braces like this:

            struct foo {
              int x;
            };

       The &#8216;-bls&#8217; option formats them like this:

            struct foo
            {
              int x;
            };


       Similarly to the structure brace &#8216;-brs&#8217; and &#8216;-bls&#8217; options,
        the function brace options &#8216;-brf&#8217; or &#8216;-blf&#8217; specify how  to  format  the
       braces  in  function  definitions.  The &#8216;-brf&#8217; option formats braces like
       this:

            int one(void) {
              return 1;
            };

       The &#8216;-blf&#8217; option formats them like this:

            int one(void)
            {
              return 1;
            };


INDENTATION
       One issue in the formatting of code  is  how  far  each  line  should  be
       indented from the left margin.  When the beginning of a statement such as
       if or for is encountered, the indentation level is increased by the value
       specified by the &#8216;-i&#8217; option.  For example, use &#8216;-i8&#8217; to specify an eight
       character indentation for each level.  When a statement is broken  across
       two  lines,  the second line is indented by a number of additional spaces
       specified by the &#8216;-ci&#8217; option.  &#8216;-ci&#8217; defaults to  0.   However,  if  the
       &#8216;-lp&#8217; option is specified, and a line has a left parenthesis which is not
       closed on that line, then continuation lines will be lined up to start at
       the  character position just after the left parenthesis.  This processing
       also applies to &#8216;[&#8217; and applies to &#8216;{&#8217; when it occurs  in  initialization
       lists.   For example, a piece of continued code might look like this with
       &#8216;-nlp -ci3&#8217; in effect:

              p1 = first_procedure (second_procedure (p2, p3),
                 third_procedure (p4, p5));

       With &#8216;-lp&#8217; in effect the code looks somewhat clearer:

              p1 = first_procedure (second_procedure (p2, p3),
                                    third_procedure (p4, p5));

       When a statement is broken in between two or more paren pairs (...), each
       extra pair causes the indentation level extra indentation:

            if ((((i &lt; 2 &amp;&amp;
                    k &gt; 0) || p == 0) &amp;&amp;
                q == 1) ||
              n = 0)
&#12;       The  option  &#8216;-ipN&#8217;  can  be used to set the extra offset per paren.  For
       instance, &#8216;-ip0&#8217; would format the above as:

            if ((((i &lt; 2 &amp;&amp;
              k &gt; 0) || p == 0) &amp;&amp;
              q == 1) ||
              n = 0)

       indent assumes that tabs are placed at regular intervals  of  both  input
       and  output  character streams.  These intervals are by default 8 columns
       wide, but (as of version 1.2) may be changed by the &#8216;-ts&#8217;  option.   Tabs
       are treated as the equivalent number of spaces.

       The indentation of type declarations in old-style function definitions is
       controlled by the &#8216;-ip&#8217; parameter.  This is a numeric parameter  specify&#8208;
       ing  how  many  spaces  to  indent  type  declarations.  For example, the
       default &#8216;-ip5&#8217; makes definitions look like this:

            char *
            create_world (x, y, scale)
                 int x;
                 int y;
                 float scale;
            {
              . . .
            }

       For compatibility with other versions of indent,  the  option  &#8216;-nip&#8217;  is
       provided, which is equivalent to &#8216;-ip0&#8217;.

       ANSI  C  allows  white  space  to be placed on preprocessor command lines
       between the character &#8216;#&#8217; and  the  command  name.   By  default,  indent
       removes  this  space,  but specifying the &#8216;-lps&#8217; option directs indent to
       leave this space unmodified. The option  &#8216;-ppi&#8217;  overrides   &#8216;-nlps&#8217;  and
       &#8216;-lps&#8217;.

       This  option  can be used to request that preprocessor conditional state&#8208;
       ments can be indented by to given number of spaces, for example with  the
       option &#8216;-ppi 3&#8217;

            #if X
            #if Y
            #define Z 1
            #else
            #define Z 0
            #endif
            #endif
       becomes
            #if X
            #   if Y
            #      define Z 1
            #   else
            #      define Z 0
            #   endif
            #endif

       This option sets the offset at which a label (except case labels) will be
       positioned. If it is set to zero or a positive number, this indicates how
       far  from  the left margin to indent a label.  If it is set to a negative
       number, this indicates how far back from  the  current  indent  level  to
       place  the  label.  The default setting is -2 which matches the behaviour
       of earlier versions of indent.  Note that this parameter does not  affect
       the  placing of case labels; see the &#8216;-cli&#8217; parameter for that. For exam&#8208;
       ple with the option &#8216;-il 1&#8217;

            group
            function()
            {
                if (do_stuff1() == ERROR)
                    goto cleanup1;
&#12;                if (do_stuff2() == ERROR)
                    goto cleanup2;

                return SUCCESS;

              cleanup2:
                do_cleanup2();

              cleanup1:
                do_cleanup1();

                return ERROR;
            }
       becomes
            group
            function()
            {
                if (do_stuff1() == ERROR)
                    goto cleanup1;

                if (do_stuff2() == ERROR)
                    goto cleanup2;

                return SUCCESS;

             cleanup2:
                do_cleanup2();

             cleanup1:
                do_cleanup1();

                return ERROR;
            }


BREAKING LONG LINES
       With the option &#8216;-ln&#8217;, or &#8216;--line-lengthn&#8217;, it is possible to specify the
       maximum  length of a line of C code, not including possible comments that
       follow it.

       When lines become longer than the specified line length, GNU indent tries
       to break the line at a logical place.  This is new as of version 2.1 how&#8208;
       ever and not very intelligent or flexible yet.

       Currently there are two options that allow  one  to  interfere  with  the
       algorithm that determines where to break a line.

       The  &#8216;-bbo&#8217; option causes GNU indent to prefer to break long lines before
       the boolean operators &amp;&amp; and ||.  The &#8216;-nbbo&#8217; option  causes  GNU  indent
       not  have  that  preference.   For  example,  the  default  option &#8216;-bbo&#8217;
       (together with &#8216;--line-length60&#8217; and &#8216;--ignore-newlines&#8217;) makes code look
       like this:

              if (mask
                  &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &#8217;\0&#8217;)
                      || (mask[1] == &#8217;\0&#8217;
                          &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &#8217;0&#8217;) || (mask[0] == &#8217;*&#8217;)))))

       Using the option &#8216;-nbbo&#8217; will make it look like this:

              if (mask &amp;&amp;
                  ((mask[0] == &#8217;\0&#8217;) ||
                   (mask[1] == &#8217;\0&#8217; &amp;&amp;
                    ((mask[0] == &#8217;0&#8217;) || (mask[0] == &#8217;*&#8217;)))))

       The default &#8216;-hnl&#8217;, however, honours newlines in the input file by giving
       them the highest possible priority to break lines at.  For example,  when
       the input file looks like this:

              if (mask
                  &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &#8217;\0&#8217;)
                  || (mask[1] == &#8217;\0&#8217; &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &#8217;0&#8217;) || (mask[0] == &#8217;*&#8217;)))))

       then  using  the option &#8216;-hnl&#8217;, or &#8216;--honour-newlines&#8217;, together with the
       previously mentioned &#8216;-nbbo&#8217; and &#8216;--line-length60&#8217;, will cause the output
       not  to  be  what is given in the last example but instead will prefer to
       break at the positions where the code was broken in the input file:

              if (mask
                  &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &#8217;\0&#8217;)
                      || (mask[1] == &#8217;\0&#8217; &amp;&amp;
                          ((mask[0] == &#8217;0&#8217;) || (mask[0] == &#8217;*&#8217;)))))

       The idea behind this option is that lines which are  too  long,  but  are
       already  broken up, will not be touched by GNU indent.  Really messy code
       should be run through indent at least once using the  &#8216;--ignore-newlines&#8217;
       option though.


DISABLING FORMATTING
       Formatting  of C code may be disabled for portions of a program by embed&#8208;
       ding special control comments in the program.  To turn off formatting for
       a  section  of a program, place the disabling control comment /* *INDENT-
       OFF* */ on a line by itself  just  before  that  section.   Program  text
       scanned  after  this control comment is output precisely as input with no
       modifications until the corresponding enabling comment is  scanned  on  a
       line  by itself.  The disabling control comment is /* *INDENT-ON* */, and
       any text following the comment on the line is  also  output  unformatted.
       Formatting  begins  again with the input line following the enabling con&#8208;
       trol comment.

       More precisely, indent does not attempt to verify the  closing  delimiter
       (*/)  for  these  C  comments,  and any whitespace on the line is totally
       transparent.

       These control comments also function in  their  C++  formats,  namely  //
       *INDENT-OFF* and // *INDENT-ON*.

       It  should  be  noted that the internal state of indent remains unchanged
       over the course of the unformatted section.  Thus, for  example,  turning
       off  formatting  in  the middle of a function and continuing it after the
       end of the function may lead to bizarre results.  It is therefore wise to
       be somewhat modular in selecting code to be left unformatted.

       As a historical note, some earlier versions of indent produced error mes&#8208;
       sages beginning with *INDENT**.  These versions of indent were written to
       ignore any input text lines which began with such error messages.  I have
       removed this incestuous feature from GNU indent.


MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
       To find out what version of indent you have, use the command indent -ver&#8208;
       sion. This will report the version number of indent, without doing any of
       the normal processing.

       The &#8216;-v&#8217; option can be used to turn on verbose  mode.   When  in  verbose
       mode,  indent reports when it splits one line of input into two more more
       lines of output, and gives some size statistics at completion.

       The &#8216;-pmt&#8217; option causes indent to preserve the access  and  modification
       times on the output files.  Using this option has the advantage that run&#8208;
       ning indent on all source and header files in a project won&#8217;t cause  make
       to  rebuild all targets.  This option is only available on Operating Sys&#8208;
       tems that have the POSIX utime(2) function.


BUGS
       Please report any bugs to bug-indent@gnu.org.

       When indent is run twice on a file, with  the  same  profile,  it  should
       never  change  that  file  the  second  time.  With the current design of
       indent, this can not be guaranteed,  and  it  has  not  been  extensively
       tested.

       indent  does  not understand C. In some cases this leads to the inability
       to join lines.  The result is that running a file through indent is irre&#8208;
       versible,  even  if  the used input file was the result of running indent
       with a given profile (&#8216;.indent.pro&#8217;).

       While an attempt was made to get indent working for C++, it will not do a
       good job on any C++ source except the very simplest.

       indent  does  not  look  at the given &#8216;--line-length&#8217; option when writing
       comments to the output file.  This results often in  comments  being  put
       far to the right.  In order to prohibit indent from joining a broken line
       that has a comment at the end, make sure that the comments start  on  the
       first line of the break.

       indent  does  not  count  lines  and  comments (see the &#8216;-v&#8217; option) when
       indent is turned off with /* *INDENT-OFF* */.

       Comments of the form /*UPPERCASE*/ are not treated as comment but  as  an
       identifier,  causing  them  to be joined with the next line. This renders
       comments of this type useless, unless they are embedded in  the  code  to
       begin with.
