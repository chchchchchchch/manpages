INET_PTON(3)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               INET_PTON(3)



NAME
       inet_pton - convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from text to binary form

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

       int inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  converts  the character string src into a network address
       structure in the af address  family,  then  copies  the  network  address
       structure to dst.  The af argument must be either AF_INET or AF_INET6.

       The following address families are currently supported:

       AF_INET
              src  points  to  a  character  string  containing  an IPv4 network
              address in dotted-decimal format, &quot;ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd&quot;, where ddd  is
              a decimal number of up to three digits in the range 0 to 255.  The
              address is converted to a struct in_addr and copied to dst,  which
              must be sizeof(struct in_addr) (4) bytes (32 bits) long.

       AF_INET6
              src  points  to  a  character  string  containing  an IPv6 network
              address.  The address is converted to a struct in6_addr and copied
              to  dst,  which  must  be  sizeof(struct in6_addr) (16) bytes (128
              bits) long.  The allowed formats for IPv6 addresses  follow  these
              rules:

              1. The preferred format is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x.  This form consists of
                 eight hexadecimal numbers, each of  which  expresses  a  16-bit
                 value (i.e., each x can be up to 4 hex digits).

              2. A  series of contiguous zero values in the preferred format can
                 be abbreviated to ::.  Only one instance of :: can occur in  an
                 address.  For example, the loopback address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 can
                 be abbreviated as ::1.  The wildcard address, consisting of all
                 zeros, can be written as ::.

              3. An  alternate  format is useful for expressing IPv4-mapped IPv6
                 addresses.  This form is written as x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d,  where
                 the  six  leading xs are hexadecimal values that define the six
                 most-significant 16-bit pieces of the address (i.e., 96  bits),
                 and  the  ds  express  a  value in dotted-decimal notation that
                 defines the least significant 32 bits of the address.  An exam&#8208;
                 ple of such an address is ::FFFF:204.152.189.116.

              See  RFC  2373  for  further details on the representation of IPv6
              addresses.

RETURN VALUE
       inet_pton() returns 1 on success (network address was  successfully  con&#8208;
       verted).  0 is returned if src does not contain a character string repre&#8208;
       senting a valid network address in the specified address family.   If  af
       does  not contain a valid address family, -1 is returned and errno is set
       to EAFNOSUPPORT.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Unlike  inet_aton(3)  and   inet_addr(3),   inet_pton()   supports   IPv6
       addresses.  On the other hand, inet_pton() only accepts IPv4 addresses in
       dotted-decimal notation, whereas inet_aton(3) and inet_addr(3) allow  the
       more general numbers-and-dots notation (hexadecimal and octal number for&#8208;
       mats, and formats that don&apos;t require all  four  bytes  to  be  explicitly
       written).   For  an  interface that handles both IPv6 addresses, and IPv4
       addresses in numbers-and-dots notation, see getaddrinfo(3).

BUGS
       AF_INET6 does not recognize IPv4 addresses.  An explicit IPv4-mapped IPv6
       address must be supplied in src instead.

EXAMPLE
       The  program  below demonstrates the use of inet_pton() and inet_ntop(3).
       Here are some example runs:

           $ ./a.out i6 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
           ::
           $ ./a.out i6 1:0:0:0:0:0:0:8
           1::8
           $ ./a.out i6 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:204.152.189.116
           ::ffff:204.152.189.116
