NAME
       infotocap - convert a terminfo description into a termcap description

SYNOPSIS
       infotocap [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .

DESCRIPTION
       infotocap  looks  in each given text file for terminfo descriptions.  For
       each terminfo description found, an  equivalent  termcap  description  is
       written  to  standard  output.   Terminfo use capabilities are translated
       directly to termcap tc capabilities.

       -v   print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

       -V   print out the version of the program in use on  standard  error  and
            exit.

       -1   cause  the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
            will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of  60  charac&#8208;
            ters.

       -w   change the output to width characters.

FILES
       /etc/terminfo       Compiled terminal description database.

NOTES
       This  utility is actually a link to tic, running in -C mode.  You can use
       other tic options such as -f and  -x.
