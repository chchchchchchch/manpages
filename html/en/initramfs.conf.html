INITRAMFS.CONF(5)             initramfs.conf manual            INITRAMFS.CONF(5)



NAME
       initramfs.conf - configuration file for mkinitramfs


DESCRIPTION
       The behaviour of mkinitramfs can be modified by its configuration file.

       Each line in the file can be a configuration variable, a blank line, or a
       comment. The value of an variable is assigned  by  an  statement  of  the
       form: name=[value]

       Configuration  options  can be broken out into configuration snippets and
       placed in individual  files  in  the  /etc/mkinitramfs/conf.d  directory.
       Files  in  this  directory  are  always read after the main configuration
       file, so you can override the settings in the main  config  file  without
       editing it directly.


GENERAL VARIABLES
        MODULES
              Specifies the modules for the initramfs image.

              Modules     listed     in     /etc/initramfs-tools/modules     and
              /usr/share/initramfs-tools/modules.d/* are always included in  the
              initramfs, and are loaded early in the boot process.


              list  doesn&apos;t load any additional modules at boot time, other than
              those listed in the above files.

              most adds most file system, all ata, sata, scsi and usb drivers.

              dep tries to guess which modules are necessary for the running box
              and only adds those modules.

              netboot  adds  the  base  and  network  modules,  but  skips block
              devices.


              The default setting is most.


        BUSYBOX
              Include busybox utilities for the boot scripts.   If  set  to  &apos;n&apos;
              mkinitramfs  will build an initramfs without busybox.  Beware that
              many boot scripts need busybox utilities.


        KEYMAP
              If set to &apos;y&apos;, the  console  keymap  will  be  loaded  during  the
              initramfs  stage.   The  keymap  will  anyway  be  loaded  by  the
              initscripts later, and the packages that  might  need  input  will
              normally set this variable automatically, so there should normally
              be no need to set this.


        COMPRESS
              Specifies the compression method used  for  the  initramfs  image.
              mkinitramfs will default to gzip if the kernel lacks support (CON&#8208;
              FIG_RD) or the corresponding userspace utility is not present.
&#12;        UMASK Set the umask value of the generated initramfs  file.   Useful  to
              not disclose eventual keys.


NFS VARIABLES
        BOOT  Allows  one  to  use  an  nfs drive as the root of the drive.  The
              default is to boot from local media (hard drive, USB stick).   Set
              to nfs for an NFS root share.


        DEVICE
              Specifies the network interface, like eth0.


        ROOT  Allows  optional root bootarg hardcoding, when no root bootarg can
              be passed.  A root bootarg overrides that special setting.


        NFSROOT
              Defaults to auto in order to pick up value from DHCP server.  Oth&#8208;
              erwise you need to specify HOST:MOUNT.
