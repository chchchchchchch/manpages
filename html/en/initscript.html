INITSCRIPT(5)          Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual         INITSCRIPT(5)



NAME
       initscript - script that executes inittab commands.

SYNOPSIS
       /bin/sh /etc/initscript id runlevels action process

DESCRIPTION
       When  the  shell  script  /etc/initscript is present, init will use it to
       execute the commands from inittab.  This script can be used to set things
       like ulimit and umask default values for every process.

EXAMPLES
       This  is  a sample initscript, which might be installed on your system as
       /etc/initscript.sample.


              #
              # initscript   Executed by init(8) for every program it
              #              wants to spawn like this:
              #
              #              /bin/sh /etc/initscript &lt;id&gt; &lt;level&gt; &lt;action&gt; &lt;process&gt;
              #

                # Set umask to safe level, and enable core dumps.
                umask 022
                ulimit -c 2097151
                PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
                export PATH

                # Increase the hard file descriptor limit for all processes
                # to 8192.  The soft limit is still 1024, but any unprivileged
                # process can increase its soft limit up to the hard limit
                # with &quot;ulimit -Sn xxx&quot; (needs a 2.2.13 or later Linux kernel).
                ulimit -Hn 8192

                # Execute the program.
                eval exec &quot;$4&quot;



NOTES
       This script is not meant as startup script for daemons or  somesuch.   It
       has  nothing  to do with a rc.local style script. It&apos;s just a handler for
       things executed from /etc/inittab. Experimenting with this can make  your
       system un(re)bootable.

FILES
       /etc/inittab, /etc/initscript.
