INITTAB(5)             Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual            INITTAB(5)



NAME
       inittab  -  format  of  the inittab file used by the sysv-compatible init
       process

DESCRIPTION
       The inittab file describes which processes are started at bootup and dur&#8208;
       ing  normal operation (e.g. /etc/init.d/boot, /etc/init.d/rc, gettys...).
       Init(8) distinguishes multiple runlevels, each of which can have its  own
       set  of  processes  that are started.  Valid runlevels are 0-6 plus A, B,
       and C for ondemand entries.  An entry in the inittab file has the follow&#8208;
       ing format:

              id:runlevels:action:process

       Lines beginning with `#&apos; are ignored.

       id     is  a  unique sequence of 1-4 characters which identifies an entry
              in inittab (for versions of sysvinit compiled with the  old  libc5
              (&lt; 5.2.18) or a.out libraries the limit is 2 characters).

              Note:  traditionally,  for  getty  and  other login processes, the
              value of the id field is kept the same as the suffix of the corre&#8208;
              sponding  tty, e.g. 1 for tty1. Some ancient login accounting pro&#8208;
              grams might expect this, though I can&apos;t think of any.

       runlevels
              lists the runlevels for  which  the  specified  action  should  be
              taken.

       action describes which action should be taken.

       process
              specifies the process to be executed.  If the process field starts
              with a `+&apos; character, init will not do utmp  and  wtmp  accounting
              for  that process.  This is needed for gettys that insist on doing
              their own utmp/wtmp housekeeping.  This is also a historic bug.

       The runlevels field may contain multiple characters  for  different  run&#8208;
       levels.  For example, 123 specifies that the process should be started in
       runlevels 1, 2, and 3.  The runlevels for ondemand entries may contain an
       A,  B,  or C.  The runlevels field of sysinit, boot, and bootwait entries
       are ignored.

       When the system runlevel is changed, any running processes that  are  not
       specified  for the new runlevel are killed, first with SIGTERM, then with
       SIGKILL.

       Valid actions for the action field are:

       respawn
              The process will be restarted whenever it terminates (e.g. getty).

       wait   The process will be started once when the  specified  runlevel  is
              entered and init will wait for its termination.

       once   The  process  will be executed once when the specified runlevel is
              entered.

       boot   The process will be executed during system  boot.   The  runlevels
              field is ignored.

       bootwait
              The  process will be executed during system boot, while init waits
              for its  termination  (e.g.  /etc/rc).   The  runlevels  field  is
              ignored.

       off    This does nothing.

       ondemand
              A  process marked with an ondemand runlevel will be executed when&#8208;
              ever the specified ondemand runlevel is called.  However, no  run&#8208;
              level  change  will  occur  (ondemand  runlevels are `a&apos;, `b&apos;, and
              `c&apos;).

       initdefault
              An initdefault  entry  specifies  the  runlevel  which  should  be
              entered  after  system  boot.  If none exists, init will ask for a
              runlevel on the console. The process field is ignored.

       sysinit
              The process will be executed during system boot. It will  be  exe&#8208;
              cuted  before  any boot or  bootwait entries.  The runlevels field
              is ignored.

       powerwait
              The process will be executed when the power  goes  down.  Init  is
              usually  informed  about  this  by a process talking to a UPS con&#8208;
              nected to the computer.  Init will wait for the process to  finish
              before continuing.

       powerfail
              As for powerwait, except that init does not wait for the process&apos;s
              completion.

       powerokwait
              This process will be executed as soon as init is informed that the
              power has been restored.

       powerfailnow
              This  process  will be executed when init is told that the battery
              of the external UPS is almost empty and the power is failing (pro&#8208;
              vided that the external UPS and the monitoring process are able to
              detect this condition).

       ctrlaltdel
              The process will be executed when init receives the SIGINT signal.
              This  means  that  someone  on  the system console has pressed the
              CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination. Typically one wants to execute  some
              sort of shutdown either to get into single-user level or to reboot
              the machine.

       kbrequest
              The process will be executed when init receives a signal from  the
              keyboard handler that a special key combination was pressed on the
              console keyboard.

              The documentation for this function is not complete yet; more doc&#8208;
              umentation  can be found in the kbd-x.xx packages (most recent was
              kbd-0.94 at the time of this writing). Basically you want  to  map
              some  keyboard  combination  to  the  &quot;KeyboardSignal&quot; action. For
              example, to map Alt-Uparrow for this purpose use the following  in
              your keymaps file:

              alt keycode 103 = KeyboardSignal


EXAMPLES
       This is an example of a inittab which resembles the old Linux inittab:

              # inittab for linux
              id:1:initdefault:
              rc::bootwait:/etc/rc
              1:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty1
              2:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty2
              3:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty3
              4:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty4
&#12;       This  inittab  file  executes  /etc/rc  during  boot and starts gettys on
       tty1-tty4.

       A more elaborate inittab  with  different  runlevels  (see  the  comments
       inside):

              # Level to run in
              id:2:initdefault:

              # Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
              si::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

              # What to do in single-user mode.
              ~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin

              # /etc/init.d executes the S and K scripts upon change
              # of runlevel.
              #
              # Runlevel 0 is halt.
              # Runlevel 1 is single-user.
              # Runlevels 2-5 are multi-user.
              # Runlevel 6 is reboot.

              l0:0:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 0
              l1:1:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 1
              l2:2:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 2
              l3:3:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 3
              l4:4:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 4
              l5:5:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 5
              l6:6:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 6

              # What to do at the &quot;3 finger salute&quot;.
              ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -h now

              # Runlevel 2,3: getty on virtual consoles
              # Runlevel   3: getty on terminal (ttyS0) and modem (ttyS1)
              1:23:respawn:/sbin/getty tty1 VC linux
              2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty tty2 VC linux
              3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty tty3 VC linux
              4:23:respawn:/sbin/getty tty4 VC linux
              S0:3:respawn:/sbin/getty -L 9600 ttyS0 vt320
              S1:3:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -x0 -D ttyS1
