SETNETGRENT(3)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             SETNETGRENT(3)



NAME
       setnetgrent,  endnetgrent,  getnetgrent,  getnetgrent_r, innetgr - handle
       network group entries

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

       int setnetgrent(const char *netgroup);

       void endnetgrent(void);

       int getnetgrent(char **host, char **user, char **domain);

       int getnetgrent_r(char **host, char **user,
                         char **domain, char *buf, int buflen);

       int innetgr(const char *netgroup, const char *host,
                   const char *user, const char *domain);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       setnetgrent(), endnetgrent(), getnetgrent(), getnetgrent_r(), innetgr():
       _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  netgroup  is  a  SunOS  invention.  A netgroup database is a list of
       string triples (hostname, username, domainname) or other netgroup  names.
       Any  of  the elements in a triple can be empty, which means that anything
       matches.  The functions described here allow access to the netgroup data&#8208;
       bases.  The file /etc/nsswitch.conf defines what database is searched.

       The setnetgrent() call defines the netgroup that will be searched by sub&#8208;
       sequent getnetgrent() calls.  The getnetgrent()  function  retrieves  the
       next  netgroup entry, and returns pointers in host, user, domain.  A NULL
       pointer means that the  corresponding  entry  matches  any  string.   The
       pointers  are  valid  only as long as there is no call to other netgroup-
       related functions.  To avoid this problem you can use  the  GNU  function
       getnetgrent_r()  that stores the strings in the supplied buffer.  To free
       all allocated buffers use endnetgrent().

       In most cases you only want to check if the triplet (hostname,  username,
       domainname)  is  a  member  of a netgroup.  The function innetgr() can be
       used for this without calling the above three functions.  Again,  a  NULL
       pointer  is  a  wildcard and matches any string.  The function is thread-
       safe.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return 1 on success and 0 for failure.

FILES
       /etc/netgroup
       /etc/nsswitch.conf

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are  not  in  POSIX.1-2001,  but  setnetgrent(),  endnet&#8208;
       grent(), getnetgrent(), and innetgr() are available on most UNIX systems.
       getnetgrent_r() is not widely available on other systems.

NOTES
       In the BSD implementation, setnetgrent() returns void.
