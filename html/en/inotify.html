INOTIFY(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 INOTIFY(7)



NAME
       inotify - monitoring file system events

DESCRIPTION
       The  inotify  API provides a mechanism for monitoring file system events.
       Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to  monitor  directo&#8208;
       ries.   When a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the
       directory itself, and for files inside the directory.

       The following system calls are used with this  API:  inotify_init(2)  (or
       inotify_init1(2)),  inotify_add_watch(2),  inotify_rm_watch(2),  read(2),
       and close(2).

       inotify_init(2) creates an inotify instance and returns a file descriptor
       referring  to  the inotify instance.  The more recent inotify_init1(2) is
       like inotify_init(2), but provides some extra functionality.

       inotify_add_watch(2) manipulates the &quot;watch list&quot; associated with an ino&#8208;
       tify instance.  Each item (&quot;watch&quot;) in the watch list specifies the path&#8208;
       name of a file or directory, along with some set of events that the  ker&#8208;
       nel  should  monitor  for  the  file  referred to by that pathname.  ino&#8208;
       tify_add_watch(2) either creates a new watch item, or modifies an  exist&#8208;
       ing  watch.   Each  watch  has  a  unique  &quot;watch descriptor&quot;, an integer
       returned by inotify_add_watch(2) when the watch is created.

       inotify_rm_watch(2) removes an item from an inotify watch list.

       When all file descriptors referring to  an  inotify  instance  have  been
       closed,  the  underlying  object and its resources are freed for reuse by
       the kernel; all associated watches are automatically freed.

       To determine what events have occurred, an application read(2)s from  the
       inotify file descriptor.  If no events have so far occurred, then, assum&#8208;
       ing a blocking file descriptor, read(2) will block  until  at  least  one
       event  occurs  (unless  interrupted  by  a signal, in which case the call
       fails with the error EINTR; see signal(7)).

       Each successful read(2) returns a buffer containing one or  more  of  the
       following structures:

           struct inotify_event {
               int      wd;       /* Watch descriptor */
               uint32_t mask;     /* Mask of events */
               uint32_t cookie;   /* Unique cookie associating related
                                     events (for rename(2)) */
               uint32_t len;      /* Size of name field */
               char     name[];   /* Optional null-terminated name */
           };

       wd  identifies  the  watch for which this event occurs.  It is one of the
       watch descriptors returned by a previous call to inotify_add_watch(2).

       mask contains bits that describe the event that occurred (see below).

       cookie is a unique integer that connects related events.  Currently  this
       is  only  used  for  rename  events,  and  allows  the  resulting pair of
       IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events to be connected by the  application.
       For all other event types, cookie is set to 0.

       The  name  field  is  only  present  when an event is returned for a file
       inside a watched directory; it identifies the file pathname  relative  to
       the watched directory.  This pathname is null-terminated, and may include
       further null bytes to align subsequent reads to a suitable address bound&#8208;
       ary.

       The  len field counts all of the bytes in name, including the null bytes;
       the length of each inotify_event structure  is  thus  sizeof(struct  ino&#8208;
       tify_event)+len.

       The  behavior  when  the  buffer  given to read(2) is too small to return
       information about the next event depends on the kernel version:  in  ker&#8208;
       nels before 2.6.21, read(2) returns 0; since kernel 2.6.21, read(2) fails
       with the error EINVAL.  Specifying a buffer of size

           sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1

       will be sufficient to read at least one event.


   inotify events
       The inotify_add_watch(2) mask argument and the mask  field  of  the  ino&#8208;
       tify_event  structure returned when read(2)ing an inotify file descriptor
       are both bit masks identifying inotify events.  The following bits can be
       specified  in  mask when calling inotify_add_watch(2) and may be returned
       in the mask field returned by read(2):

           IN_ACCESS         File was accessed (read) (*).
           IN_ATTRIB         Metadata changed,  e.g.,  permissions,  timestamps,
                             extended   attributes,   link  count  (since  Linux
                             2.6.25), UID, GID, etc. (*).
           IN_CLOSE_WRITE    File opened for writing was closed (*).
           IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE  File not opened for writing was closed (*).
           IN_CREATE         File/directory created in watched directory (*).
           IN_DELETE         File/directory deleted from watched directory (*).
           IN_DELETE_SELF    Watched file/directory was itself deleted.
           IN_MODIFY         File was modified (*).
           IN_MOVE_SELF      Watched file/directory was itself moved.
           IN_MOVED_FROM     File moved out of watched directory (*).
           IN_MOVED_TO       File moved into watched directory (*).
           IN_OPEN           File was opened (*).

       When monitoring a directory, the events marked with an asterisk (*) above
       can occur for files in the directory, in which case the name field in the
       returned inotify_event structure identifies the name of the  file  within
       the directory.

       The  IN_ALL_EVENTS  macro  is  defined  as a bit mask of all of the above
       events.  This macro can be used as the mask argument  when  calling  ino&#8208;
       tify_add_watch(2).

       Two   additional   convenience  macros  are  IN_MOVE,  which  equates  to
       IN_MOVED_FROM|IN_MOVED_TO,    and    IN_CLOSE,    which    equates     to
       IN_CLOSE_WRITE|IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE.

       The  following  further  bits  can be specified in mask when calling ino&#8208;
       tify_add_watch(2):

           IN_DONT_FOLLOW (since Linux 2.6.15)
                             Don&apos;t dereference pathname  if  it  is  a  symbolic
                             link.
           IN_EXCL_UNLINK (since Linux 2.6.36)
                             By default, when watching events on the children of
                             a directory, events are generated for children even
                             after  they  have been unlinked from the directory.
                             This can result in large numbers  of  uninteresting
                             events  for  some  applications  (e.g., if watching
                             /tmp, in which many applications  create  temporary
                             files whose names are immediately unlinked).  Spec&#8208;
                             ifying IN_EXCL_UNLINK changes the default behavior,
                             so that events are not generated for children after
                             they have been unlinked from the watched directory.
           IN_MASK_ADD       Add (OR) events to watch mask for this pathname  if
                             it already exists (instead of replacing mask).
           IN_ONESHOT        Monitor  pathname  for  one event, then remove from
                             watch list.
           IN_ONLYDIR (since Linux 2.6.15)
                             Only watch pathname if it is a directory.

       The following bits may be set in the mask field returned by read(2):

           IN_IGNORED        Watch was removed explicitly  (inotify_rm_watch(2))
                             or  automatically (file was deleted, or file system
                             was unmounted).
           IN_ISDIR          Subject of this event is a directory.
           IN_Q_OVERFLOW     Event queue overflowed (wd is -1 for this event).
           IN_UNMOUNT        File   system   containing   watched   object   was
                             unmounted.

   /proc interfaces
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory
       consumed by inotify:

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events
              The value in this file is used  when  an  application  calls  ino&#8208;
              tify_init(2)  to  set  an upper limit on the number of events that
              can be queued to the corresponding inotify  instance.   Events  in
              excess  of  this  limit are dropped, but an IN_Q_OVERFLOW event is
              always generated.

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of  inotify  instances
              that can be created per real user ID.

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that can be
              created per real user ID.

VERSIONS
       Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.   The  required  library
       interfaces   were  added  to  glibc  in  version  2.4.   (IN_DONT_FOLLOW,
       IN_MASK_ADD, and IN_ONLYDIR were only added in version 2.5.)

CONFORMING TO
       The inotify API is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Inotify file descriptors can be monitored using select(2),  poll(2),  and
       epoll(7).   When  an event is available, the file descriptor indicates as
       readable.

       Since Linux 2.6.25, signal-driven I/O notification is available for  ino&#8208;
       tify  file  descriptors;  see  the discussion of F_SETFL (for setting the
       O_ASYNC flag), F_SETOWN, and F_SETSIG in fcntl(2).  The siginfo_t  struc&#8208;
       ture (described in sigaction(2)) that is passed to the signal handler has
       the following fields set: si_fd is set to  the  inotify  file  descriptor
       number;  si_signo is set to the signal number; si_code is set to POLL_IN;
       and POLLIN is set in si_band.

       If successive output inotify events produced on the inotify file descrip&#8208;
       tor  are  identical  (same wd, mask, cookie, and name) then they are coa&#8208;
       lesced into a single event if the older event has not yet been read  (but
       see BUGS).

       The  events  returned  by reading from an inotify file descriptor form an
       ordered queue.  Thus, for example, it is guaranteed  that  when  renaming
       from  one  directory  to  another, events will be produced in the correct
       order on the inotify file descriptor.

       The FIONREAD ioctl(2) returns the number of bytes available to read  from
       an inotify file descriptor.

   Limitations and caveats
       Inotify  monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor subdirec&#8208;
       tories under a directory, additional watches must be created.   This  can
       take a significant amount time for large directory trees.

       The  inotify  API  provides no information about the user or process that
       triggered the inotify event.

       Note that the event queue can overflow.  In this case, events  are  lost.
       Robust  applications  should handle the possibility of lost events grace&#8208;
       fully.

       The inotify API identifies affected files by filename.  However,  by  the
       time  an application processes an inotify event, the filename may already
       have been deleted or renamed.

       If monitoring an entire directory subtree, and a new subdirectory is cre&#8208;
       ated  in  that tree, be aware that by the time you create a watch for the
       new subdirectory, new files may already have been created in  the  subdi&#8208;
       rectory.   Therefore,  you may want to scan the contents of the subdirec&#8208;
       tory immediately after adding the watch.

BUGS
       In kernels before 2.6.16, the IN_ONESHOT mask flag does not work.

       Before kernel 2.6.25, the kernel code that was intended to coalesce  suc&#8208;
       cessive  identical  events (i.e., the two most recent events could poten&#8208;
       tially be coalesced if the older had not yet been read)  instead  checked
       if the most recent event could be coalesced with the oldest unread event.
