inotifywait(1)                                                    inotifywait(1)



NAME
       inotifywait - wait for changes to files using inotify


SYNOPSIS
       inotifywait  [-hcmrq]  [-e  &lt;event&gt;  ]  [-t &lt;seconds&gt; ] [--format &lt;fmt&gt; ]
       [--timefmt &lt;fmt&gt; ] &lt;file&gt; [ ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       inotifywait efficiently waits for changes to  files  using  Linux&apos;s  ino&#8208;
       tify(7)  interface.  It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from
       shell scripts.  It can either exit once an event occurs,  or  continually
       execute and output events as they occur.


OUTPUT
       inotifywait  will  output  diagnostic  information  on standard error and
       event information on standard output.  The event output  can  be  config&#8208;
       ured, but by default it consists of lines of the following form:

       watched_filename EVENT_NAMES event_filename


       watched_filename
              is  the name of the file on which the event occurred.  If the file
              is a directory, a trailing slash is output.

       EVENT_NAMES
              are the names of the inotify events which occurred,  separated  by
              commas.

       event_filename
              is output only when the event occurred on a directory, and in this
              case the name of the file within the directory which  caused  this
              event is output.

              By default, any special characters in filenames are not escaped in
              any way.  This can make the output  of  inotifywait  difficult  to
              parse  in  awk scripts or similar.  The --csv and --format options
              will be helpful in this case.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output some helpful usage information.

       @&lt;file&gt;
              When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the  specified
              file  from being watched.  The file must be specified with a rela&#8208;
              tive or absolute path according to whether a relative or  absolute
              path  is  given  for  watched  directories.  If a specific path is
              explicitly both included and excluded, it will always be watched.

              Note: If you need to watch a directory or file whose  name  starts
              with @, give the absolute path.

       --fromfile &lt;file&gt;
              Read  filenames  to watch or exclude from a file, one filename per
              line.  If filenames begin with @ they are  excluded  as  described
              above.   If &lt;file&gt; is `-&apos;, filenames are read from standard input.
              Use this option if you need to watch too many files to pass in  as
              command line arguments.

       -m, --monitor
              Instead of exiting after receiving a single event, execute indefi&#8208;
              nitely.  The default behaviour is to exit after  the  first  event
              occurs.

       -d, --daemon
              Same  as --monitor, except run in the background logging events to
              a file that must be specified by --outfile. Implies --syslog.

       -o, --outfile &lt;file&gt;
              Output events to &lt;file&gt; rather than stdout.

       -s, --syslog
              Output errors to syslog(3) system log module rather than stderr.

       -r, --recursive
              Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed  as  arguments.
              Watches  will  be  set up recursively to an unlimited depth.  Sym&#8208;
              bolic links are not traversed.  Newly created subdirectories  will
              also be watched.

              Warning:  If you use this option while watching the root directory
              of a large tree, it may take  quite  a  while  until  all  inotify
              watches  are  established, and events will not be received in this
              time.  Also, since one inotify watch will be established per  sub&#8208;
              directory,  it  is  possible  that  the  maximum amount of inotify
              watches per user will be reached.  The default maximum is 8192; it
              can    be    increased    by    writing    to    /proc/sys/fs/ino&#8208;
              tify/max_user_watches.


       -q, --quiet
              If specified once, the program will  be  less  verbose.   Specifi&#8208;
              cally,  it  will  not state when it has completed establishing all
              inotify watches.

              If specified twice, the program will output nothing at all, except
              in the case of fatal errors.


       --exclude &lt;pattern&gt;
              Do  not  process  any  events whose filename matches the specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case sensitive.


       --excludei &lt;pattern&gt;
              Do not process any events whose  filename  matches  the  specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case insensitive.


       -t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Exit  if  an  appropriate  event has not occurred within &lt;seconds&gt;
              seconds. If &lt;seconds&gt; is zero (the default), wait indefinitely for
              an event.


       -e &lt;event&gt;, --event &lt;event&gt;
              Listen  for  specific event(s) only.  The events which can be lis&#8208;
              tened for are listed in the EVENTS section.  This  option  can  be
              specified  more  than  once.   If omitted, all events are listened
              for.


       -c, --csv
              Output in CSV (comma-separated values)  format.   This  is  useful
              when  filenames  may  contain spaces, since in this case it is not
              safe to simply split the output at each space character.


       --timefmt &lt;fmt&gt;
              Set a time format string as accepted by strftime(3) for  use  with
              the `%T&apos; conversion in the --format option.


       --format &lt;fmt&gt;
              Output  in a user-specified format, using printf-like syntax.  The
              event strings output are limited to  around  4000  characters  and
              will  be  truncated to this length.  The following conversions are
              supported:


       %w     This will be replaced with the name of the Watched file  on  which
              an event occurred.


       %f     When  an  event  occurs  within a directory, this will be replaced
              with the name of the File which caused the event to occur.  Other&#8208;
              wise, this will be replaced with an empty string.


       %e     Replaced with the Event(s) which occurred, comma-separated.


       %Xe    Replaced  with the Event(s) which occurred, separated by whichever
              character is in the place of `X&apos;.


       %T     Replaced with the current Time in  the  format  specified  by  the
              --timefmt  option,  which  should  be a format string suitable for
              passing to strftime(3).




EXIT STATUS
       0      The program executed successfully, and an event occurred which was
              being listened for.

       1      An  error  occurred  in  execution  of  the  program,  or an event
              occurred which was not being listened for.  The  latter  generally
              occurs  if  something  happens  which forcibly removes the inotify
              watch, such as a watched file being deleted or the filesystem con&#8208;
              taining a watched file being unmounted.

       2      The -t option was used and an event did not occur in the specified
              interval of time.


EVENTS
       The following events are valid for use with the -e option:


       access A watched file or a file within a watched directory was read from.


       modify A watched file or a file within a watched  directory  was  written
              to.


       attrib The  metadata  of a watched file or a file within a watched direc&#8208;
              tory was modified.  This includes  timestamps,  file  permissions,
              extended attributes etc.
&#12;       close_write
              A  watched  file  or a file within a watched directory was closed,
              after being opened in writeable mode.  This does  not  necessarily
              imply the file was written to.


       close_nowrite
              A  watched  file  or a file within a watched directory was closed,
              after being opened in read-only mode.


       close  A watched file or a file within a watched  directory  was  closed,
              regardless  of  how  it  was  opened.   Note that this is actually
              implemented  simply  by  listening  for   both   close_write   and
              close_nowrite,  hence  all close events received will be output as
              one of these, not CLOSE.


       open   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was opened.


       moved_to
              A file or directory was moved  into  a  watched  directory.   This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same
              directory.


       moved_from
              A file or directory was moved  from  a  watched  directory.   This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same
              directory.


       move   A file or directory was moved from  or  to  a  watched  directory.
              Note  that  this  is  actually implemented simply by listening for
              both moved_to and moved_from, hence all close events received will
              be output as one or both of these, not MOVE.


       move_self
              A  watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the file
              or directory is no longer being watched.


       create A file or directory was created within a watched directory.


       delete A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.


       delete_self
              A watched file or directory was deleted.   After  this  event  the
              file  or  directory  is  no  longer being watched.  Note that this
              event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened for.


       unmount
              The filesystem on which a watched file or  directory  resides  was
              unmounted.   After  this  event the file or directory is no longer
              being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it  is  not
              explicitly being listened to.



EXAMPLES
   Example 1
       Running  inotifywait  at  the  command-line  to  wait for any file in the
       `test&apos;  directory  to  be  accessed.   After  running  inotifywait,  `cat
       test/foo&apos; is run in a separate console.

       % inotifywait test
       Setting up watches.
       Watches established.
       test/ ACCESS foo


   Example 2
       A  short  shell script to efficiently wait for httpd-related log messages
       and do something appropriate.

       #!/bin/sh
       while inotifywait -e modify /var/log/messages; do
         if tail -n1 /var/log/messages | grep httpd; then
           kdialog --msgbox &quot;Apache needs love!&quot;
         fi
       done


   Example 3
       A custom output format is used to  watch  `~/test&apos;.   Meanwhile,  someone
       runs  `touch ~/test/badfile; touch ~/test/goodfile; rm ~/test/badfile&apos; in
       another console.

       % inotifywait -m -r --format &apos;%:e %f&apos; ~/test
       Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
       Watches established.
       CREATE badfile
       OPEN badfile
       ATTRIB badfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE badfile
       CREATE goodfile
       OPEN goodfile
       ATTRIB goodfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE goodfile
       DELETE badfile


CAVEATS
       When using inotifywait, the filename that is outputted is not  guaranteed
       to be up to date after a move because it is the inode that is being moni&#8208;
       tored. Additionally, none of the observed operations  are  guaranteed  to
       have been performed on the filename inotifywait was instructed to monitor
       in cases when the file is known by several names in the filesystem.


BUGS
       There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code  which
       can  cause  events  to be missed if they occur in a directory immediately
       after that directory is created.  This is probably not fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
