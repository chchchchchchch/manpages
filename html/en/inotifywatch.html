inotifywatch(1)                                                  inotifywatch(1)



NAME
       inotifywatch - gather filesystem access statistics using inotify


SYNOPSIS
       inotifywatch  [-hvzrqf]  [-e  &lt;event&gt; ] [-t &lt;seconds&gt; ] [-a &lt;event&gt; ] [-d
       &lt;event&gt; ] &lt;file&gt; [ ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       inotifywatch listens  for  filesystem  events  using  Linux&apos;s  inotify(7)
       interface,  then  outputs  a summary count of the events received on each
       file or directory.


OUTPUT
       inotifywatch will output a table on standard out with one column for each
       type  of event and one row for each watched file or directory.  The table
       will show the amount of times each event occurred for each  watched  file
       or directory.  Output can be sorted by a particular event using the -a or
       -d options.

       Some diagnostic information will be output on standard error.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output some helpful usage information.


       -v, --verbose
              Output some extra information on standard error during execution.

       @&lt;file&gt;
              When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the  specified
              file  from being watched.  The file must be specified with a rela&#8208;
              tive or absolute path according to whether a relative or  absolute
              path  is  given  for  watched  directories.  If a specific path is
              explicitly both included and excluded, it will always be watched.

              Note: If you need to watch a directory or file whose  name  starts
              with @, give the absolute path.

       --fromfile &lt;file&gt;
              Read  filenames  to watch or exclude from a file, one filename per
              line.  If filenames begin with @ they are  excluded  as  described
              above.   If &lt;file&gt; is `-&apos;, filenames are read from standard input.
              Use this option if you need to watch too many files to pass in  as
              command line arguments.

       -z, --zero
              Output  table  rows and columns even if all elements are zero.  By
              default, rows and columns are only output if they contain non-zero
              elements.   Using  this  option when watching for every event on a
              lot of files can result in a lot of output!


       --exclude &lt;pattern&gt;
              Do not process any events whose  filename  matches  the  specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case sensitive.
&#12;       --excludei &lt;pattern&gt;
              Do  not  process  any  events whose filename matches the specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case insensitive.


       -r, --recursive
              Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed  as  arguments.
              Watches  will  be  set up recursively to an unlimited depth.  Sym&#8208;
              bolic links are not traversed.  If  new  directories  are  created
              within watched directories they will automatically be watched.

              Warning:  If you use this option while watching the root directory
              of a large tree, it may take  quite  a  while  until  all  inotify
              watches  are  established, and events will not be received in this
              time.  Also, since one inotify watch will be established per  sub&#8208;
              directory,  it  is  possible  that  the  maximum amount of inotify
              watches per user will be reached.  The default maximum is 8192; it
              can    be    increased    by    writing    to    /proc/sys/fs/ino&#8208;
              tify/max_user_watches.


       -t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Listen only for the specified amount of seconds.   If  not  speci&#8208;
              fied,  inotifywatch  will  gather  statistics  until  receiving an
              interrupt signal by (for example) pressing CONTROL-C at  the  con&#8208;
              sole.


       -e &lt;event&gt;, --event &lt;event&gt;
              Listen  for  specific event(s) only.  The events which can be lis&#8208;
              tened for are listed in the EVENTS section.  This  option  can  be
              specified  more  than  once.   If omitted, all events are listened
              for.


       -a &lt;event&gt;, --ascending &lt;event&gt;
              Sort output ascending by event counts  for  the  specified  event.
              Sortable  events  include `total&apos; and all the events listed in the
              EVENTS section except `move&apos; and `close&apos; (you must use `moved_to&apos;,
              `moved_from&apos;,  `close_write&apos;  or  `close_nowrite&apos;  instead).   The
              default is to sort descending by `total&apos;.


       -d &lt;event&gt;, --descending &lt;event&gt;
              Sort output descending by event counts for  the  specified  event.
              Sortable  events  include `total&apos; and all the events listed in the
              EVENTS section except `move&apos; and `close&apos; (you must use `moved_to&apos;,
              `moved_from&apos;,  `close_write&apos;  or  `close_nowrite&apos;  instead).   The
              default is to sort descending by `total&apos;.


EXIT STATUS
       0      The program executed successfully.

       1      An error occurred in execution of the program.


EVENTS
       The following events are valid for use with the -e option:


       access A watched file or a file within a watched directory was read from.


       modify A watched file or a file within a watched  directory  was  written
              to.


       attrib The  metadata  of a watched file or a file within a watched direc&#8208;
              tory was modified.  This includes  timestamps,  file  permissions,
              extended attributes etc.


       close_write
              A  watched  file  or a file within a watched directory was closed,
              after being opened in writeable mode.  This does  not  necessarily
              imply the file was written to.


       close_nowrite
              A  watched  file  or a file within a watched directory was closed,
              after being opened in read-only mode.


       close  A watched file or a file within a watched  directory  was  closed,
              regardless  of  how  it  was  opened.   Note that this is actually
              implemented  simply  by  listening  for   both   close_write   and
              close_nowrite,  hence  all close events received will be output as
              one of these, not CLOSE.


       open   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was opened.


       moved_to
              A file or directory was moved  into  a  watched  directory.   This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same
              directory.


       moved_from
              A file or directory was moved  from  a  watched  directory.   This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same
              directory.


       move   A file or directory was moved from  or  to  a  watched  directory.
              Note  that  this  is  actually implemented simply by listening for
              both moved_to and moved_from, hence all close events received will
              be output as one or both of these, not MOVE.


       move_self
              A  watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the file
              or directory is no longer being watched.


       create A file or directory was created within a watched directory.


       delete A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.


       delete_self
              A watched file or directory was deleted.   After  this  event  the
              file  or  directory  is  no  longer being watched.  Note that this
              event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened for.


       unmount
              The filesystem on which a watched file or  directory  resides  was
              unmounted.   After  this  event the file or directory is no longer
              being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it  is  not
              explicitly being listened to.



EXAMPLE
       Watching the `~/.beagle&apos; directory for 60 seconds:

       % inotifywatch -v -e access -e modify -t 60 -r ~/.beagle
       Establishing watches...
       Setting up watch(es) on /home/rohan/.beagle
       OK, /home/rohan/.beagle is now being watched.
       Total of 302 watches.
       Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
       Will listen for events for 60 seconds.
       total  access  modify  filename

       2      2       0       /home/rohan/.beagle/Indexes/KMailIndex/SecondaryIndex/


CAVEATS
       When using inotifywatch, the filename that is outputted is not guaranteed
       to be up to date after a move because it is the inode that is being moni&#8208;
       tored.  Additionally,  none  of the observed operations are guaranteed to
       have been performed on the filename inotifywatch was instructed to  moni&#8208;
       tor in cases when the file is known by several names in the filesystem.


BUGS
       There  are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code which
       can cause events to be missed if they occur in  a  directory  immediately
       after that directory is created.  This is probably not fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
