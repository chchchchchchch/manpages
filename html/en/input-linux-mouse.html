NAME
       input-linux-mouse - Direct mouse input

SYNOPSIS
       input-linux-mouse: [&lt;mousetype&gt;] [,&lt;file&gt;] [,[b&lt;bauds&gt;][r&lt;rts&gt;][d&lt;dtr&gt;]]


DESCRIPTION
       This  input  opens a file (usually a device file or pipe) and reads mouse
       protocol data from it.

OPTIONS
       mousetype
              Indicates what type of mouse is attached.  The following types are
              supported:

              &#183;   ms, Microsoft : Two button Microsoft compatible mice.

              &#183;   ms3,  IntelliMouse, mman+ : Serial Intellimouse or compatible.
                  Supports four buttons for mice like the Logitech MouseMan+.

              &#183;   MouseSystems, msc :  MouseSystems  compatible  (used  in  most
                  3-button mice).

              &#183;   Logitech, logi :  Used in older Logitech serial mice.

              &#183;   mm, MMSeries :    MM series mice.

              &#183;   Sun  :  Sun  mice.  The protocol is the same as &apos;msc&apos; protocol
                  except it used only 3 bytes per packet.

              &#183;   MouseMan, mman :  MouseMan protocol.

              &#183;   BusMouse, bm : Non-PS/2 busmice.

              &#183;   LinuxUSB, lnxusb : IMPS2 that doesn&apos;t choke on  USB  (no  init
                  attempted).

              &#183;   ps2, PS/2 : PS/2 mice (most non-serial mice use this protocol)

              &#183;   imps2, IMPS/2 : PS/2 IntelliMouse and compatible (not USB, see
                  lnxusb for that.)

              &#183;   mmanps2, MouseManPlusPS/2 : PS/2 Logitech MouseMan+  and  com&#8208;
                  patible.

              Most  of  the  strings  supported by GPM, SVGAlib and XFree can be
              specified.  If you find one that isn&apos;t, please report.

              The  special  value   auto   tells   input-linux-mouse   to   read
              ~/.ggi/input/linux-mouse,       and       if      that      fails,
              $sysconfdir/ggi/input/linux-mouse.  If none of the two  files  are
              found,  input-linux-mouse tries to auto-detect the mouse, and as a
              last resort uses the mouse information specified in  /etc/vga/lib&#8208;
              vga.config.


       file   The file to read mouse protocol data from; defaults to /dev/mouse.


       baud   Baud rate of mouse device.
&#12;
       rts    Turns off RTS if set to 0; turns RTS on if set to a number greater
              than 0.


       dtr    Turns off DTR if set to 0; turns DTR on if set to a number greater
              than 0.


FEATURES
       &#183;   Generates evPtr* events.

FILES
       ~/.ggi/input/linux-mouse  and  $sysconfdir/ggi/input/linux-mouse consists
       of the following entries:

       mouse mousetype
       mdev file

       where mousetype and file has the same semantics as the invocation options
       of the same names.
