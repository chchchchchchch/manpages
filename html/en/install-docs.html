DESCRIPTION
       install-docs is a tool allow Debian package maintainers to register
       documentation to various documentation systems.  It currently supports
       dhelp,  dwww, doc-central, and scrollkeeper browsers.

       This manual page provides a quick synopsis of install-docs usage.  Full
       documentation can be found in the documentation, including a description
       of the control file syntax and grammar.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Operate verbosely.

       -d, --debug
           Print some debugging information.

       --no-update-menus

           scrollkeeper-update(8).

       --rootdir dir
           Set the root directory to dir instead of `/&apos;. Useful and valid only
           with the --check action.

ACTIONS
       Below is list of possible actions install-docs could handle. There can be
       only one action option passed to install-docs, moreover the action with
       its arguments must be the last option passed.

       Each file argument should be the full path for the doc-base control file
       (i.e.  `/usr/share/doc-base/some_file&apos; or
       `/etc/doc-base/documents/some_file&apos;), and each docid should be the
       document identifier (Document identifiers are set in the `Document&apos; field
       of the control file, and usually correspond to the package name.)

       If file or docid equals `-&apos; (the minus sign), the list of arguments is
       read from the standard input (each file name or document id in separate
       line).

       -i file [file ...],  --install file [file ...]
           Install the documentation described by the control file file.

       -r file [file ...],  --remove file [file ...]
           Remove the documentation identified by the control file file.

       -c file [file ...],  --check file [file ...]
           Check the control file file and display number of possible problems
           found.  Use with --verbose to get the actual locations of errors and
           warnings.  If --rootdir was also given, its argument will be
           prepended to names of the files given if the `Files&apos; and `Index&apos;
           fields of the file.

       -R,  --remove-all
           De-register all registered documents.

       -I, --install-all
           (Re)register all documents from /usr/share/doc-base and
           /etc/doc-base/documents.

       -C, --install-changed
           Compare contents of /usr/share/doc-base and /etc/doc-base/documents
           directories with registered documents database and de-register any
           files that are missing and (re)register only changed or new files.

       -s docid [docid ...], --status docid [docid ...]
           Display the status of the document identifier docid.

       -L docid [docid ...], --listfiles docid [docid ...]
