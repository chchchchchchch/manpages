INSTALL-INFO(1)                                                  INSTALL-INFO(1)



NAME
       install-info - wrapper around GNU install-info

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the install-info command.  This manual
       page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the origi&#8208;
       nal script was designed for Debian packaging system.

       install-info is a wrapper around GNU install-info. If it is called from a
       normal shell or script it acts like GNU install-info  by  forwarding  all
       options to ginstall-info.

       If  it  is  called from a maintainer script it gives a warning to rebuild
       packages and does nothing, since info file installation is now  done  via
       triggers.

OPTIONS
       Same as with GNU install-info, see ginstall-info(1).

AUTHOR
       This manual page was written by Norbert Preining &lt;preining@logic.at&gt;, for
       the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
