INSTALL(1)                        User Commands                       INSTALL(1)



NAME
       install - copy files and set attributes

SYNOPSIS
       install [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       install [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       install [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
       install [OPTION]... -d DIRECTORY...

DESCRIPTION
       This  install program copies files (often just compiled) into destination
       locations you choose.  If you want to download and install a ready-to-use
       package on a GNU/Linux system, you should instead be using a package man&#8208;
       ager like yum(1) or apt-get(1).

       In the first three forms, copy SOURCE to DEST or  multiple  SOURCE(s)  to
       the  existing  DIRECTORY, while setting permission modes and owner/group.
       In the 4th form, create all components of the given DIRECTORY(ies).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -c     (ignored)

       -C, --compare
              compare each pair of source and destination  files,  and  in  some
              cases, do not modify the destination at all

       -d, --directory
              treat  all  arguments as directory names; create all components of
              the specified directories

       -D     create all leading components of DEST except the last,  then  copy
              SOURCE to DEST

       -g, --group=GROUP
              set group ownership, instead of process&apos; current group

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set permission mode (as in chmod), instead of rwxr-xr-x

       -o, --owner=OWNER
              set ownership (super-user only)

       -p, --preserve-timestamps
              apply  access/modification  times of SOURCE files to corresponding
              destination files

       -s, --strip
              strip symbol tables

       --strip-program=PROGRAM
              program used to strip binaries

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
&#12;       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -v, --verbose
              print the name of each directory as it is created

       --preserve-context
              preserve SELinux security context

       -Z, --context=CONTEXT
              set SELinux security context of files and directories

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is `~&apos;, unless set with --suffix or  SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUF&#8208;
       FIX.   The version control method may be selected via the --backup option
       or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are  the  val&#8208;
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups
