INSTALLKERNEL(8)                                                INSTALLKERNEL(8)



NAME
       installkernel - install a new kernel image

SYNOPSIS
       installkernel version zImage System.map [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       installkernel  installs a new kernel image onto the system from the Linux
       source tree.  It is called  by  the  Linux  kernel  makefiles  when  make
       install is invoked there.

       The  new  kernel  is  installed into {directory}/vmlinuz-{version}.  If a
       symbolic link {directory}/vmlinuz already exists, it is refreshed by mak&#8208;
       ing a link from {directory}/vmlinuz to the new kernel, and the previously
       installed kernel is available as {directory}/vmlinuz.old.

BUGS
       installkernel resides in /sbin only because the  Linux  kernel  makefiles
       call  it  from there.  It should really be in /usr/sbin.  It isn&apos;t needed
       to boot a system.
