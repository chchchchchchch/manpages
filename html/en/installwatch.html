installwatch(1)                                                  installwatch(1)



NAME
       installwatch &#8212; Track installation of software

SYNOPSIS
       installwatch [options]  [command]

DESCRIPTION
       installwatch is a program that is used in order to track the changes made
       while installing local software (i.e.  &quot;make install&quot;). It  monitors  the
       requested  command,  and  produces  a log which indicates all created and
       modified files. By default it outputs to syslog(3) using  a  priority  of
       &quot;LOG_USER  | LOG_INFO&quot;. This may be overridden by the use of the -o flag.
       The log format is as follows:


       &lt;return-value&gt; &lt;syscall-name&gt; &lt;argument&gt; #&lt;comment&gt;

       Each field is delimited by a &quot;^I&quot; character if logging to  syslog(3),  or
       by a tab when logging to a file.


ENVIRONMENT
       INSTALLWATCH_BACKUP_PATH
                 Set this variable to the location that you want installwatch to
                 copy the original version of  files  which  get  modified.  The
                 directory  will  be created if it does not exist, assuming that
                 the parent is writable.

OPTIONS
       These program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;).  A summary of options is included below.

                 -o        --logfile
                 Directs  that  output from the logged command be written to the
                 filename specified. If the specified file  already  exists,  it
                 will be truncated.

       -r           --root
                 Sets  the  directory under which meta-info and translated files
                 will be stored.

       -t           --trans
                 Toggle translation capabilities.

       -e           --exclude
                 Sets a comma separated neutral directory list,  that  won&apos;t  be
                 concerned by translation or backups.

       -d           --dbgfile
                 Specify a debug file.

       -v       --dbglvl
                 Sets the debug level to be used.

       -h         --help
                 Show help information.

BUGS
       installwatch does not work with programs which are statically linked with
       libc. Due to LD_PRELOAD limitations, it does not work with suid  programs
       (this would probably introduce security problems, anyway).

       mknod(2) is not monitored.
