DESCRIPTION
       intel  is  an  Xorg  driver  for Intel integrated graphics chipsets.  The
       driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24.  All visual types are  supported
       in  depth  8.   For  the i810/i815 other depths support the TrueColor and
       DirectColor visuals.  For the i830M and later, only the TrueColor  visual
       is  supported  for  depths  greater than 8.  The driver supports hardware
       accelerated 3D via the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in
       depth 16 for the i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       intel  supports  the  i810,  i810-DC100, i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM,
       855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM, 945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q, 946GZ, 965GM,  945GME,
       G33,  Q33, Q35, G35, GM45, G45, Q45, G43, G41 chipsets, and Pineview-M in
       Atom N400 series, Pineview-D in Atom D400/D500 series.


CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The  Intel  8xx  and  9xx families of integrated graphics chipsets have a
       unified memory architecture meaning that system memory is used  as  video
       RAM.   For the i810 and i815 family of chipsets, operating system support
       for allocating system memory is required in order  to  use  this  driver.
       For  the  830M and later, this is required in order for the driver to use
       more video RAM than has been pre-allocated at  boot  time  by  the  BIOS.
       This  is  usually  achieved  with  an  &quot;agpgart&quot;  or &quot;agp&quot; kernel driver.
       Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris  have  such  kernel  drivers
       available.

       By  default, the i810/i815 will use 8 MB of system memory for graphics if
       AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16 MB if &lt; 192 MB or 24 MB  if  higher.
       Use the VideoRam option to change the default value.

       For  the  830M  and  later, the driver will automatically size its memory
       allocation according to the features it  will  support.   Therefore,  the
       VideoRam  option, which in the past had been necessary to allow more than
       some small amount of memory to be allocated, is now ignored.

       The following driver Options are supported

       Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              This sets the acceleration method. The legacy method is  uxa,  the
              experimental one is sna.

              Default: uxa.

       Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.

              Default: undefined.
&#12;       Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable DRI support.

              Default: DRI is enabled for configurations where it is supported.


       The  following  driver  Options  are  supported  for  the  i810  and i815
       chipsets:

       Option &quot;CacheLines&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory  used
              for  2D  acceleration  and video when XAA acceleration is enabled.
              Decreasing this amount leaves more for 3D textures.  Increasing it
              can improve 2D performance at the expense of 3D performance.

              Default:  depends  on  the  resolution, depth, and available video
              memory.  The driver attempts to allocate space for at 3 screenfuls
              of pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV video.  The default used for a spe&#8208;
              cific configuration can be found by examining the Xorg log file.

       Option &quot;DDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable DDC support.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.

              Default: 8-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.

       Option &quot;XvMCSurfaces&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option enables XvMC.  The  integer  parameter  specifies  the
              number of surfaces to use.  Valid values are 6 and 7.

              Default: XvMC is disabled.

       VideoRam integer
              This  option  specifies  the  amount  of  system memory to use for
              graphics, in KB.

              The default is 8192 if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16384  if
              &lt;  192 MB, 24576 if higher. DRI require at least a value of 16384.
              Higher values may give better 3D performance, at expense of avail&#8208;
              able system memory.

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable acceleration.

              Default: acceleration is enabled.


       The  following  driver  Options  are  supported  for  the  830M and later
       chipsets:

       Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This is the same as the &quot;ColorKey&quot; option described above.  It  is
              provided for compatibility with most other drivers.

       Option &quot;XvPreferOverlay&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Make  hardware  overlay  be  the  first  XV  adaptor.  The overlay
              behaves incorrectly in the presence of compositing, but some  pre&#8208;
              fer  it due to it syncing to vblank in the absence of compositing.
              While most XV-using applications have options to select  which  XV
              adaptor to use, this option can be used to place the overlay first
              for applications which don&apos;t have options for selecting adaptors.
&#12;              Default: Textured video adaptor is preferred.

       Option &quot;FallbackDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable printing of debugging information on acceleration fallbacks
              to the server log.

              Default: Disabled

       Option &quot;DebugFlushBatches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Flush the batch buffer after every single operation.

              Default: Disabled

       Option &quot;DebugFlushCaches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Include an MI_FLUSH at the end of every batch buffer to force data
              to be flushed out of cache and into memory before  the  completion
              of the batch.

              Default: Disabled

       Option &quot;DebugWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Wait  for  the completion of every batch buffer before continuing,
              i.e. perform synchronous rendering.

              Default: Disabled

       Option &quot;Shadow&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls the use of GPU acceleration and placement  of
              auxiliary  buffers in memory. Enabling the Shadow will disable all
              use of the GPU for RENDER acceleration  and  force  software-fall&#8208;
              backs  for  all but updating the scan-out buffer. Hardware overlay
              is still supported so Xv will continue to  playback  videos  using
              the  GPU,  but  GL will be forced to use software rasterisation as
              well.  This is a last resort measure for  systems  with  crippling
              bugs,  such  as early 8xx chipsets. It is still hoped that we will
              find a workaround to enable as much hardware acceleration on those
              architectures  as is possible, but until then, using a shadow buf&#8208;
              fer should maintain system stability.

              Default: Disabled

       Option &quot;SwapbuffersWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers  and  glXCopy&#8208;
              SubBufferMESA  calls  by  GL  applications.  If enabled, the calls
              will avoid tearing by making sure the display scanline is  outside
              of  the area to be copied before the copy occurs.  If disabled, no
              scanline synchronization is performed, meaning tearing will likely
              occur.   Note  that when enabled, this option can adversely affect
              the framerate of applications that  render  frames  at  less  than
              refresh rate.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;TripleBuffer&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  option  enables the use of a third buffer for page-flipping.
              The third buffer allows applications to run at vrefresh rates even
              if  they  occasionally  fail to swapbuffers on time. The effect of
              such missed swaps is the output jitters between 60fps  and  30fps,
              and in the worst case appears frame-locked to 30fps. The disadvan&#8208;
              tage of triple buffering is  that  there  is  an  extra  frame  of
              latency,  due to the pre-rendered frame sitting in the swap queue,
              between input and any display update.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;Tiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls whether memory buffers for Pixmaps are  allo&#8208;
              cated  in  tiled mode.  In most cases (especially for complex ren&#8208;
              dering), tiling dramatically improves performance.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;LinearFramebuffer&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls whether the  memory  for  the  scanout  (also
              known as the front or frame buffer) is allocated in linear memory.
              A tiled framebuffer is required for power  conservation  features,
              but  for  certain  system  configurations you may wish to override
              this and force a linear layout.

              Default: disabled

       Option &quot;RelaxedFencing&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls whether we attempt to  allocate  the  minimal
              amount  of memory required for the buffers. The reduction in work&#8208;
              ing set has a substantial improvement on system performance.  How&#8208;
              ever,  this  has  been  demonstrate  to be buggy on older hardware
              (845-865 and 915-945, but ok on PineView and later)  so  on  those
              chipsets defaults to off.

              Default:  Enabled  for  G33  (includes PineView), and later, class
              machines.

       Option &quot;XvMC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable XvMC driver. Current support MPEG2 MC on  915/945  and  G33
              series.   User  should provide absolute path to libIntelXvMC.so in
              XvMCConfig file.

              Default: Disabled.

       Option &quot;Throttle&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This option controls whether the  driver  periodically  waits  for
              pending  drawing  operations  to complete. Throttling ensures that
              the GPU does not lag too far behind the CPU  and  thus  noticeable
              delays in user responsible at the cost of throughput performance.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;HotPlug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  option  controls  whether  the driver automatically notifies
              applications when monitors are connected or disconnected.

              Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;string&quot;

              Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particu&#8208;
              lar  driver instance.  If you this option you must use it with all
              instances of the driver
              For example: Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;LVDS1,VGA1&quot; will assign  xrandr
              outputs LVDS1 and VGA0 to this instance of the driver.


OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
       On 830M and better chipsets, the driver supports runtime configuration of
       detected outputs.  You can use the xrandr tool to control outputs on  the
       command line as follows:

              xrandr --output output --set property value

       Note that you may need to quote property and value arguments that contain
       spaces.  Each output listed below may have one or more properties associ&#8208;
       ated  with  it  (like a binary EDID block if one is found).  Some outputs
       have unique properties which are described  below.   See  the  &quot;MULTIHEAD
       CONFIGURATIONS&quot; section below for additional information.

   VGA
       VGA output port (typically exposed via an HD15 connector).
&#12;
   LVDS
       Low  Voltage  Differential  Signalling  output  (typically  a  laptop LCD
       panel).  Available properties:


       BACKLIGHT - current backlight level (adjustable)

       By adjusting the BACKLIGHT property, the brightness on  the  LVDS  output
       can  be  adjusted.   In some cases, this property may be unavailable (for
       example if your platform uses an external microcontroller to control  the
       backlight).


       scaling mode - control LCD panel scaling mode

       When  the  currently  selected display mode differs from the native panel
       resolution, various scaling options are available. These include

         Center

         Simply center the image on-screen without scaling.  This  is  the  only
         scaling mode that guarantees a one-to-one correspondence between native
         and displayed pixels, but some portions of the panel may be unused (so-
         called &quot;letterboxing&quot;).

         Full aspect

         Scale the image as much as possible while preserving aspect ratio. Pix&#8208;
         els may not be displayed one-to-one (there  may  be  some  blurriness).
         Some  portions  of  the  panel may be unused if the aspect ratio of the
         selected mode does not match that of the panel.

         Full

         Scale the image to the panel size without regard to aspect ratio.  This
         is the only mode which guarantees that every pixel of the panel will be
         used. But the displayed image may be  distorted  by  stretching  either
         horizontally  or vertically, and pixels may not be displayed one-to-one
         (there may be some blurriness).

       The precise names of these options may differ  depending  on  the  kernel
       video  driver,  (but the functionality should be similar). See the output
       of xrandr --prop for a list of currently available scaling modes.

   TV
       Integrated TV output.  Available properties include:


       BOTTOM, RIGHT, TOP, LEFT - margins

       Adjusting these properties allows you to control the placement of your TV
       output  buffer  on the screen. The options with the same name can also be
       set in xorg.conf with integer value.


       BRIGHTNESS - TV brightness, range 0-255

       Adjust TV brightness, default value is 128.


       CONTRAST - TV contrast, range 0-255

       Adjust TV contrast, default value is 1.0 in chipset specific format.


       SATURATION - TV saturation, range 0-255

       Adjust TV saturation, default value is 1.0 in chipset specific format.
&#12;       HUE - TV hue, range 0-255

       Adjust TV hue, default value is 0.


       TV_FORMAT - output standard

       This property allows you to control the output standard used on  your  TV
       output  port.   You  can  select between NTSC-M, NTSC-443, NTSC-J, PAL-M,
       PAL-N, and PAL.


       TV_Connector - connector type

       This config option should be added to xorg.conf TV monitor&apos;s section,  it
       allows  you  to  force  the  TV  output connector type, which bypass load
       detect and TV will always be taken as connected. You can  select  between
       S-Video, Composite and Component.


   TMDS-1
       First DVI SDVO output


   TMDS-2
       Second DVI SDVO output


   TMDS-1 , TMDS-2 , HDMI-1 , HDMI-2
       DVI/HDMI outputs. Avaliable common properties include:

       BROADCAST_RGB  - method used to set RGB color range(full range 0-255, not
       full range 16-235)

       Adjusting this propertie allows you to set RGB color range on each  chan&#8208;
       nel  in order to match HDTV requirment(default 0 for full range). Setting
       1 means RGB color range is 16-235, 0 means RGB color range  is  0-255  on
       each channel.


       SDVO and DVO TV outputs are not supported by the driver at this time.


       See  xorg.conf(5)  for  information  on associating Monitor sections with
       these outputs for configuration.  Associating Monitor sections with  each
       output  can be helpful if you need to ignore a specific output, for exam&#8208;
       ple, or statically configure an extended desktop monitor layout.


MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS
       The number of independent outputs is dictated by the number of CRTCs  (in
       X  parlance)  a  given  chip  supports.  Most recent Intel chips have two
       CRTCs, meaning that two separate framebuffers can be displayed simultane&#8208;
       ously,  in  an  extended  desktop configuration.  If a chip supports more
       outputs than it has CRTCs (say local flat panel, VGA and TV in  the  case
       of  many  outputs),  two of the outputs will have to be &quot;cloned&quot;, meaning
       that they display the same framebuffer contents (or one displays a subset
       of another&apos;s framebuffer if the modes aren&apos;t equal).

       You  can  use  the &quot;xrandr&quot; tool, or various desktop utilities, to change
       your output configuration at runtime.  To statically configure your  out&#8208;
       puts, you can use the &quot;Monitor-&lt;type&gt;&quot; options along with additional mon&#8208;
       itor sections in your xorg.conf to  create  your  screen  topology.   The
       example  below  puts  the  VGA  output to the right of the builtin laptop
       screen, both running at 1024x768.

TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES
       The driver supports the following X11 Xv attributes for  Textured  Video.
       You can use the &quot;xvattr&quot; tool to query/set those attributes at runtime.


   XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK
       XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK  is  used  to control whether textured adapter synchro&#8208;
       nizes the screen update to the vblank to eliminate tearing. It is a Bool&#8208;
       ean  attribute  with values of 0 (never sync) or 1 (always sync). An his&#8208;
       toric value of -1 (sync for large windows only) will now  be  interpreted
       as  1, (since the current approach for sync is not costly even with small
       video windows).

REPORTING BUGS
       The xf86-video-intel driver is part  of  the  X.Org  and  Freedesktop.org
       umbrella   projects.    Details   on   bug  reporting  can  be  found  at
       http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/how_to_report_bug.html.  Mailing  lists
       are also commonly used to report experiences and ask questions about con&#8208;
       figuration and other topics.  See lists.freedesktop.org for more informa&#8208;
       tion (the xorg@lists.freedesktop.org mailing list is the most appropriate
       place to ask X.Org and driver related questions).
