INTRO(8)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   INTRO(8)



NAME
       intro - introduction to administration and privileged commands

DESCRIPTION
       Section  8  of  the  manual describes commands which either can be or are
       only used by the superuser, like system-administration commands, daemons,
       and hardware-related commands.

       As  with  the  commands in described section 1, the commands described in
       this section terminate with an exit status  that  indicates  whether  the
       command succeeded or failed.  See intro(1) for more information.
