OUTB(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    OUTB(2)



NAME
       outb,  outw,  outl, outsb, outsw, outsl, inb, inw, inl, insb, insw, insl,
       outb_p, outw_p, outl_p, inb_p, inw_p, inl_p - port I/O

DESCRIPTION
       This family of functions is used to do low-level port input  and  output.
       The  out*  functions do port output, the in* functions do port input; the
       b-suffix functions are byte-width and the w-suffix functions  word-width;
       the _p-suffix functions pause until the I/O completes.

       They are primarily designed for internal kernel use, but can be used from
       user space.

       You compile with -O or -O2 or similar.   The  functions  are  defined  as
       inline  macros,  and  will  not  be  substituted  in without optimization
       enabled, causing unresolved references at link time.

       You use ioperm(2) or alternatively iopl(2) to tell the  kernel  to  allow
       the  user space application to access the I/O ports in question.  Failure
       to do this will cause the application to receive a segmentation fault.

CONFORMING TO
       outb() and friends are hardware-specific.  The value argument  is  passed
       first and the port argument is passed second, which is the opposite order
       from most DOS implementations.

       ioperm(2), iopl(2)
