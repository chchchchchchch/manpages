IO_CANCEL(2)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               IO_CANCEL(2)



NAME
       io_cancel - cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O operation

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/aio_abi.h&gt;          /* Defines needed types */

       int io_cancel(aio_context_t ctx_id, struct iocb *iocb,
                     struct io_event *result);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The io_cancel() system call attempts to cancel an asynchronous I/O opera&#8208;
       tion previously submitted with io_submit(2).  The ctx_id argument is  the
       AIO  context  ID  of the operation to be canceled.  If the AIO context is
       found, the event will be canceled and then copied into the memory pointed
       to by result without being placed into the completion queue.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, io_cancel() returns 0.  For the failure return, see NOTES.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The iocb specified was not canceled.

       EFAULT One of the data structures points to invalid data.

       EINVAL The AIO context specified by ctx_id is invalid.

       ENOSYS io_cancel() is not implemented on this architecture.

VERSIONS
       The asynchronous I/O system calls first appeared in Linux 2.5.

CONFORMING TO
       io_cancel() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper function  for  this  system  call.   You
       could  invoke it using syscall(2).  But instead, you probably want to use
       the io_cancel() wrapper function provided by libaio.

       Note that the libaio wrapper function  uses  a  different  type  (io_con&#8208;
       text_t)  for the ctx_id argument.  Note also that the libaio wrapper does
       not follow the usual C library  conventions  for  indicating  errors:  on
       error  it returns a negated error number (the negative of one of the val&#8208;
       ues listed in ERRORS).  If the system call  is  invoked  via  syscall(2),
       then  the  return  value  follows the usual conventions for indicating an
       error: -1, with errno set to a (positive) value that indicates the error.
