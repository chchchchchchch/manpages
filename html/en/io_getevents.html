IO_GETEVENTS(2)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            IO_GETEVENTS(2)



NAME
       io_getevents - read asynchronous I/O events from the completion queue

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/aio_abi.h&gt;         /* Defines needed types */
       #include &lt;linux/time.h&gt;            /* Defines &apos;struct timespec&apos; */


       int io_getevents(aio_context_t ctx_id, long min_nr, long nr,
                        struct io_event *events, struct timespec *timeout);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_getevents()  system  call attempts to read at least min_nr events
       and up to nr events from the completion queue of the AIO  context  speci&#8208;
       fied  by  ctx_id.   The  timeout argument specifies the amount of time to
       wait for events, where a NULL timeout waits until at least min_nr  events
       have been seen.  Note that timeout is relative and will be updated if not
       NULL and the operation blocks.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, io_getevents() returns the number of events  read:  0  if  no
       events  are  available,  or  less than min_nr if the timeout has elapsed.
       For the failure return, see NOTES.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Either events or timeout is an invalid pointer.

       EINVAL ctx_id is invalid.  min_nr is out of range or nr is out of range.

       EINTR  Interrupted by a signal handler; see signal(7).

       ENOSYS io_getevents() is not implemented on this architecture.

VERSIONS
       The asynchronous I/O system calls first appeared in Linux 2.5.

CONFORMING TO
       io_getevents() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs  that
       are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc  does  not  provide  a  wrapper function for this system call.  You
       could invoke it using syscall(2).  But instead, you probably want to  use
       the io_getevents() wrapper function provided by libaio.

       Note  that  the  libaio  wrapper  function uses a different type (io_con&#8208;
       text_t) for the ctx_id argument.  Note also that the libaio wrapper  does
       not  follow  the  usual  C  library conventions for indicating errors: on
       error it returns a negated error number (the negative of one of the  val&#8208;
       ues  listed  in  ERRORS).   If the system call is invoked via syscall(2),
       then the return value follows the usual  conventions  for  indicating  an
       error: -1, with errno set to a (positive) value that indicates the error.
