IOCTL(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   IOCTL(2)



NAME
       ioctl - control device

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;

       int ioctl(int d, int request, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The ioctl() function manipulates the underlying device parameters of spe&#8208;
       cial files.  In particular, many operating characteristics  of  character
       special  files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with ioctl() requests.
       The argument d must be an open file descriptor.

       The second argument is a device-dependent request code.  The third  argu&#8208;
       ment  is  an  untyped  pointer  to memory.  It&apos;s traditionally char *argp
       (from the days before void * was valid C), and will be so named for  this
       discussion.

       An ioctl() request has encoded in it whether the argument is an in param&#8208;
       eter or out parameter, and the  size  of  the  argument  argp  in  bytes.
       Macros  and  defines used in specifying an ioctl() request are located in
       the file &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;.

RETURN VALUE
       Usually, on success zero is returned.  A few  ioctl()  requests  use  the
       return  value  as  an  output parameter and return a nonnegative value on
       success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  d is not a valid descriptor.

       EFAULT argp references an inaccessible memory area.

       EINVAL Request or argp is not valid.

       ENOTTY d is not associated with a character special device.

       ENOTTY The specified request does not apply to the kind  of  object  that
              the descriptor d references.

CONFORMING TO
       No  single  standard.   Arguments, returns, and semantics of ioctl() vary
       according to the device driver in question (the call is used as a  catch-
       all  for  operations  that  don&apos;t cleanly fit the UNIX stream I/O model).
       See ioctl_list(2) for a list of many of the  known  ioctl()  calls.   The
       ioctl() function call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.

NOTES
       In  order to use this call, one needs an open file descriptor.  Often the
       open(2) call has unwanted side effects, that can be avoided  under  Linux
       by giving it the O_NONBLOCK flag.
