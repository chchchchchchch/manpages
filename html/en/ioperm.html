IOPERM(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  IOPERM(2)



NAME
       ioperm - set port input/output permissions

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; /* for libc5 */
       #include &lt;sys/io.h&gt; /* for glibc */

       int ioperm(unsigned long from, unsigned long num, int turn_on);

DESCRIPTION
       ioperm() sets the port access permission bits for the calling process for
       num bytes starting from port address  from  to  the  value  turn_on.   If
       turn_on   is   nonzero,   the   calling   process   must   be  privileged
       (CAP_SYS_RAWIO).

       Only the first 0x3ff I/O ports can be specified in this manner.  For more
       ports, the iopl(2) system call must be used.

       Permissions  are  not inherited by the child created by fork(2).  Permis&#8208;
       sions are preserved across execve(2); this  is  useful  for  giving  port
       access permissions to unprivileged programs.

       This  call  is mostly for the i386 architecture.  On many other architec&#8208;
       tures it does not exist or will always return an error.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL Invalid values for from or num.

       EIO    (on PowerPC) This call is not supported.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       EPERM  The calling process has insufficient privilege.

CONFORMING TO
       ioperm() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to
       be portable.

NOTES
       Libc5 treats it as a system call  and  has  a  prototype  in  &lt;unistd.h&gt;.
       Glibc1  does  not  have  a  prototype.   Glibc2  has  a prototype both in
       &lt;sys/io.h&gt; and in &lt;sys/perm.h&gt;.  Avoid the latter,  it  is  available  on
       i386 only.
