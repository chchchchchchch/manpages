IOPL(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    IOPL(2)



NAME
       iopl - change I/O privilege level

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;

       int iopl(int level);

DESCRIPTION
       iopl()  changes the I/O privilege level of the calling process, as speci&#8208;
       fied in level.

       This call is necessary to allow 8514-compatible X servers  to  run  under
       Linux.   Since these X servers require access to all 65536 I/O ports, the
       ioperm(2) call is not sufficient.

       In addition to granting unrestricted I/O port access, running at a higher
       I/O  privilege level also allows the process to disable interrupts.  This
       will probably crash the system, and is not recommended.

       Permissions are inherited by fork(2) and execve(2).

       The I/O privilege level for a normal process is 0.

       This call is mostly for the i386 architecture.  On many  other  architec&#8208;
       tures it does not exist or will always return an error.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL level is greater than 3.

       ENOSYS This call is unimplemented.

       EPERM  The calling process has insufficient privilege to call iopl(); the
              CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability is required.

CONFORMING TO
       iopl()  is Linux-specific and should not be used in processes intended to
       be portable.

NOTES
       Libc5 treats it as a system call  and  has  a  prototype  in  &lt;unistd.h&gt;.
       Glibc1  does  not  have  a  prototype.   Glibc2  has  a prototype both in
       &lt;sys/io.h&gt; and in &lt;sys/perm.h&gt;.  Avoid the latter,  it  is  available  on
       i386 only.
