DESCRIPTION
       The address is a protocol (IP or IPv6) address attached to a network
       device.  Each device must have at least one address to use the corre&#8208;
       sponding protocol.  It is possible to have several different addresses
       attached to one device.  These addresses are not discriminated, so that
       the term alias is not quite appropriate for them and we do not use it in
       this document.

       The ip address command displays addresses and their properties, adds new
       addresses and deletes old ones.


   ip address add - add new protocol address.
       dev NAME
              the name of the device to add the address to.


       local ADDRESS (default)
              the address of the interface. The format of the address depends on
              the protocol. It is a dotted quad for IP and a sequence of hexa&#8208;
              decimal halfwords separated by colons for IPv6.  The ADDRESS may
              be followed by a slash and a decimal number which encodes the net&#8208;
              work prefix length.


       peer ADDRESS
              the address of the remote endpoint for pointopoint interfaces.
              Again, the ADDRESS may be followed by a slash and a decimal num&#8208;
              ber, encoding the network prefix length.  If a peer address is
              specified, the local address cannot have a prefix length.  The
              network prefix is associated with the peer rather than with the
              local address.


       broadcast ADDRESS
              the broadcast address on the interface.

              It is possible to use the special symbols &apos;+&apos; and &apos;-&apos; instead of
              the broadcast address.  In this case, the broadcast address is
              derived by setting/resetting the host bits of the interface pre&#8208;
              fix.


       label NAME
              Each address may be tagged with a label string.  In order to pre&#8208;
              serve compatibility with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this string must
              coincide with the name of the device or must be prefixed with the
              device name followed by colon.


       scope SCOPE_VALUE
              the scope of the area where this address is valid.  The available
              scopes are listed in file /etc/iproute2/rt_scopes.  Predefined
              scope values are:

                      global - the address is globally valid.

                      site - (IPv6 only) the address is site local, i.e. it is
                      valid inside this site.

                      link - the address is link local, i.e. it is valid only on
                      this device.

                      host - the address is valid only inside this host.


   ip address delete - delete protocol address
       Arguments: coincide with the arguments of ip addr add.  The device name
       is a required argument.  The rest are optional.  If no arguments are
       given, the first address is deleted.


   ip address show - look at protocol addresses
       dev NAME (default)
              name of device.


       scope SCOPE_VAL
              only list addresses with this scope.


       to PREFIX
              only list addresses matching this prefix.


       label PATTERN
              only list addresses with labels matching the PATTERN.  PATTERN is
              a usual shell style pattern.


       dynamic and permanent
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses installed due to stateless address
              configuration or only list permanent (not dynamic) addresses.


       tentative
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not yet passed dupli&#8208;
              cate address detection.


       deprecated
              (IPv6 only) only list deprecated addresses.


       dadfailed
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have failed duplicate
              address detection.


       temporary
              (IPv6 only) only list temporary addresses.


       primary and secondary
              only list primary (or secondary) addresses.


   ip address flush - flush protocol addresses
       This command flushes the protocol addresses selected by some criteria.


       This command has the same arguments as show.  The difference is that it
       does not run when no arguments are given.


       Warning: This command (and other flush commands described below) is
       pretty dangerous.  If you make a mistake, it will not forgive it, but
       will cruelly purge all the addresses.


       With the -statistics option, the command becomes verbose. It prints out
       the number of deleted addresses and the number of rounds made to flush
       the address list.  If this option is given twice, ip address flush also
       dumps all the deleted addresses in the format described in the previous
       subsection.


EXAMPLES
       ip address show dev eth0
           Shows the addresses assigned to network interface eth0

       ip addr add 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
           Adds an IPv6 address to network interface eth1

       ip addr flush dev eth4
           Removes all addresses from device eth4
