DESCRIPTION
   ip link add - add virtual link
       link DEVICE
              specifies the physical device to act operate on.

              NAME specifies the name of the new virtual device.

              TYPE specifies the type of the new device.

              Link types:

                      vlan - 802.1q tagged virtual LAN interface

                      veth - Virtual ethernet interface

                      vcan - Virtual Local CAN interface

                      dummy - Dummy network interface

                      ifb - Intermediate Functional Block device
&#12;                      macvlan - virtual interface base on link layer address
                      (MAC)

                      can - Controller Area Network interface

                      bridge - Ethernet Bridge device


   ip link delete - delete virtual link
       DEVICE specifies the virtual  device to act operate on.  TYPE specifies
       the type of the device.



       dev DEVICE
              specifies the physical device to act operate on.


   ip link set - change device attributes
       dev DEVICE
              DEVICE specifies network device to operate on. When configuring
              SR-IOV Virtual Fuction (VF) devices, this keyword should specify
              the associated Physical Function (PF) device.


       group GROUP
              GROUP has a dual role: If both group and dev are present, then
              move the device to the specified group.  If only a group is speci&#8208;
              fied, then the command operates on all devices in that group.


       up and down
              change the state of the device to UP or DOWN.


       arp on or arp off
              change the NOARP flag on the device.


       multicast on or multicast off
              change the MULTICAST flag on the device.


       dynamic on or dynamic off
              change the DYNAMIC flag on the device.


       name NAME
              change the name of the device.  This operation is not recommended
              if the device is running or has some addresses already configured.


       txqueuelen NUMBER

       txqlen NUMBER
              change the transmit queue length of the device.


       mtu NUMBER
              change the MTU of the device.


       address LLADDRESS
              change the station address of the interface.
&#12;       broadcast LLADDRESS

       brd LLADDRESS

       peer LLADDRESS
              change the link layer broadcast address or the peer address when
              the interface is POINTOPOINT.


       netns PID
              move the device to the network namespace associated with the
              process PID.


       netns NETNSNAME
              move the device to the network namespace associated with name
              NETNSNAME.


       alias NAME
              give the device a symbolic name for easy reference.


       group GROUP
              specify the group the device belongs to.  The available groups are
              listed in file /etc/iproute2/group.


       vf NUM specify a Virtual Function device to be configured. The associated
              PF device must be specified using the dev parameter.

                      mac LLADDRESS - change the station address for the speci&#8208;
                      fied VF. The vf parameter must be specified.


                      vlan VLANID - change the assigned VLAN for the specified
                      VF. When specified, all traffic sent from the VF will be
                      tagged with the specified VLAN ID. Incoming traffic will
                      be filtered for the specified VLAN ID, and will have all
                      VLAN tags stripped before being passed to the VF. Setting
                      this parameter to 0 disables VLAN tagging and filtering.
                      The vf parameter must be specified.


                      qos VLAN-QOS - assign VLAN QOS (priority) bits for the
                      VLAN tag. When specified, all VLAN tags transmitted by the
                      VF will include the specified priority bits in the VLAN
                      tag. If not specified, the value is assumed to be 0. Both
                      the vf and vlan parameters must be specified. Setting both
                      vlan and qos as 0 disables VLAN tagging and filtering for
                      the VF.


                      rate TXRATE - change the allowed transmit bandwidth, in
                      Mbps, for the specified VF.  Setting this parameter to 0
                      disables rate limiting. The vf parameter must be speci&#8208;
                      fied.


                      spoofchk on|off - turn packet spoof checking on or off for
                      the specified VF.


       master DEVICE
              set master device of the device (enslave device).
&#12;
       nomaster
              unset master device of the device (release device).


       Warning: If multiple parameter changes are requested, ip aborts immedi&#8208;
       ately after any of the changes have failed.  This is the only case when
       ip can move the system to an unpredictable state.  The solution is to
       avoid changing several parameters with one ip link set call.


   ip link show - display device attributes
       dev NAME (default)
              NAME specifies the network device to show.  If this argument is
              omitted all devices in the default group are listed.


       group GROUP
              GROUP specifies what group of devices to show.


       up     only display running interfaces.


EXAMPLES
       ip link show
           Shows the state of all network interfaces on the system.

       ip link set dev ppp0 mtu 1400
           Change the MTU the ppp0 device.

       ip link add link eth0 name eth0.10 type vlan id 10
           Creates a new vlan device eth0.10 on device eth0.

       ip link delete dev eth0.10
           Removes vlan device.
