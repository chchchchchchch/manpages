IP-MONITOR(8)                         Linux                        IP-MONITOR(8)



NAME
       ip-monitor, rtmon - state monitoring

SYNOPSIS
       ip monitor [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]



DESCRIPTION
       The ip utility can monitor the state of devices, addresses and routes
       continuously.  This option has a slightly different format.  Namely, the
       monitor command is the first in the command line and then the object list
       follows:

       ip monitor [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]

       OBJECT-LIST is the list of object types that we want to monitor.  It may
       contain link, address and route.  If no file argument is given, ip opens
       RTNETLINK, listens on it and dumps state changes in the format described
       in previous sections.


       If a file name is given, it does not listen on RTNETLINK, but opens the
       file containing RTNETLINK messages saved in binary format and dumps them.
       Such a history file can be generated with the rtmon utility.  This util&#8208;
       ity has a command line syntax similar to ip monitor.  Ideally, rtmon
       should be started before the first network configuration command is
       issued. F.e. if you insert:

               rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log

       in a startup script, you will be able to view the full history later.


       Certainly, it is possible to start rtmon at any time.  It prepends the
       history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment of starting.
