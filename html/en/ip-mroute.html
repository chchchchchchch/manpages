IP-MROUTE(8)                          Linux                         IP-MROUTE(8)



NAME
       ip-mroute - multicast routing cache management

SYNOPSIS
       ip mroute show [ PREFIX ] [ from PREFIX ] [ iif DEVICE ]


DESCRIPTION
       mroute objects are multicast routing cache entries created by a user
       level mrouting daemon (f.e.  pimd or mrouted ).

       Due to the limitations of the current interface to the multicast routing
       engine, it is impossible to change mroute objects administratively, so we
       may only display them.  This limitation will be removed in the future.


   ip mroute show - list mroute cache entries
       to PREFIX (default)
              the prefix selecting the destination multicast addresses to list.


       iif NAME
              the interface on which multicast packets are received.


       from PREFIX
              the prefix selecting the IP source addresses of the multicast
              route.
