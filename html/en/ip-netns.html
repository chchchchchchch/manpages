IP-NETNS(8)                           Linux                          IP-NETNS(8)



NAME
       ip-netns - process network namespace management

SYNOPSIS
       ip [ OPTIONS ] netns  { COMMAND | help }

       ip netns { list }

       ip netns { add | delete } NETNSNAME

       ip netns exec NETNSNAME command ...


DESCRIPTION
       A network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with
       it&apos;s own routes, firewall rules, and network devices.

       By convention a named network namespace is an object at
       /var/run/netns/NAME that can be opened.  The file descriptor resulting
       from opening /var/run/netns/NAME refers to the specified network names&#8208;
       pace.  Holding that file descriptor open keeps the network namespace
       alive.  The file descriptor can be used with the setns(2) system call to
       change the network namespace associated with a task.

       The convention for network namespace aware applications is to look for
       global network configuration files first in /etc/netns/NAME/ then in
       /etc/.  For example, if you want a different version of /etc/resolv.conf
       for a network namespace used to isolate your vpn you would name it
       /etc/netns/myvpn/resolv.conf.

       ip netns exec automates handling of this configuration, file convention
       for network namespace unaware applications, by creating a mount namespace
       and bind mounting all of the per network namespace configure files into
       their traditional location in /etc.


   ip netns list - show all of the named network namespaces
   ip netns add NAME - create a new named network namespace
   ip netns delete NAME - delete the name of a network namespace
   ip netns exec NAME cmd ... - Run cmd in the named network namespace
