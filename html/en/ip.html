IP(8)                                 Linux                                IP(8)



NAME
       ip - show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels

SYNOPSIS
       ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }


       OBJECT := { link | addr | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable |
               tunnel | tuntap | maddr | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm | netns
               | l2tp }


       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -s[tatistics] | -r[esolve] | -f[amily] { inet |
               inet6 | ipx | dnet | link } | -o[neline] }


OPTIONS
       -V, -Version
              print the version of the ip utility and exit.


       -s, -stats, -statistics
              output more information.  If the option appears twice or more, the
              amount of information increases.  As a rule, the information is
              statistics or some time values.


       -l, -loops
              Specify maximum number of loops the &apos;ip addr flush&apos; logic will
              attempt before giving up.  The default is 10.  Zero (0) means loop
              until all addresses are removed.


       -f, -family
              followed by protocol family identifier: inet, inet6 or link
              ,enforce the protocol family to use.  If the option is not
              present, the protocol family is guessed from other arguments.  If
              the rest of the command line does not give enough information to
              guess the family, ip falls back to the default one, usually inet
              or any.  link is a special family identifier meaning that no net&#8208;
              working protocol is involved.


       -4     shortcut for -family inet.


       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.


       -0     shortcut for -family link.


       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the
              &apos;\&#180; character. This is convenient when you want to count records
              with wc(1)
               or to grep(1) the output.


       -r, -resolve
              use the system&apos;s name resolver to print DNS names instead of host
              addresses.


IP - COMMAND SYNTAX
   OBJECT
       address
              - protocol (IP or IPv6) address on a device.


       addrlabel
              - label configuration for protocol address selection.


       l2tp   - tunnel ethernet over IP (L2TPv3).


       link   - network device.


       maddress
              - multicast address.


       monitor
              - watch for netlink messages.


       mroute - multicast routing cache entry.


       mrule  - rule in multicast routing policy database.


       neighbour
              - manage ARP or NDISC cache entries.


       netns  - manage network namespaces.


       ntable - manage the neighbor cache&apos;s operation.


       route  - routing table entry.


       rule   - rule in routing policy database.


       tunnel - tunnel over IP.


       tuntap - manage TUN/TAP devices.


       xfrm   - manage IPSec policies.


       The names of all objects may be written in full or abbreviated form, f.e.
       address is abbreviated as addr or just a.


   COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible
       actions depends on the object type.  As a rule, it is possible to add,
       delete and show (or list ) objects, but some objects do not allow all of
       these operations or have some additional commands.  The help command is
       available for all objects.  It prints out a list of available commands
       and argument syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually it is
       list or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed, help.
