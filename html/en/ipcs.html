CONFORMING TO
       The Linux ipcs utility is not fully compatible to the POSIX ipcs utility.
       The Linux version does not support the -b and -o options, but  does  sup&#8208;
       port the -l and -u options not defined by POSIX. The portable application
       shall not use the -a, -b, -o, -l, and -u options.
