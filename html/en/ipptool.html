NAME
       ipptool - perform internet printing protocol requests

SYNOPSIS
       ipptool [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -C ] [ -E ] [ -I ] [ -L ] [ -S ] [ -T seconds ] [
       -V version ] [ -X ] [ -c ] [ -d name=value ] [ -f filename ] [ -i seconds
       ] [ -n repeat-count ] [ -q ] [ -t ] [ -v ] URI filename [ ... filenameN ]

DESCRIPTION
       ipptool sends IPP requests to the specified URI and tests and/or displays
       the results. Each named file defines one or more requests, including  the
       expected  response  status,  attributes,  and  values. Output is either a
       plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML report on  the  standard  output,
       with  a  non-zero  exit  status  indicating  that  one or more tests have
       failed. The file format is described in ipptoolfile(5).

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ipptool:

       -4   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or  server  using
            IPv4.

       -6   Specifies  that  ipptool must connect to the printer or server using
            IPv6.

       -C   Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1 &quot;Transfer-
            Encoding:  chunked&quot; header, which is required for conformance by all
            versions of IPP. The default is to use &quot;Transfer-Encoding:  chunked&quot;
            for  requests with attached files and &quot;Content-Length:&quot; for requests
            without attached files.

       -E   Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using  the  HTTP
            &quot;Upgrade&quot; header.

       -I   Specifies that ipptool will continue past errors.

       -L   Specifies  that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.0 &quot;Content-
            Length:&quot; header, which is required for conformance by  all  versions
            of  IPP.  The  default  is  to  use &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; for
            requests with attached  files  and  &quot;Content-Length:&quot;  for  requests
            without attached files.

       -S   Forces (dedicated) SSL encryption when connecting to the server.

       -T seconds
            Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.

       -V version
            Specifies  the  default  IPP  version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, or
            2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is used.

       -X   Specifies that XML (Apple plist) output is desired  instead  of  the
            plain  text  report. This option is incompatible with the -i (inter&#8208;
            val) and -n (repeat-count) options.

       -c   Specifies  that  CSV  (comma-separated  values)  output  is  desired
            instead of the plain text output.

       -d name=value
            Defines the named variable.

       -f filename
            Defines the default request filename for tests.
&#12;       -i seconds
            Specifies  that  the (last) file should be repeated at the specified
            interval. This option is incompatible with the -X (XML plist output)
            option.

       -l   Specifies that plain text output is desired.

       -n repeat-count
            Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated the specified num&#8208;
            ber of times. This option is incompatible with  the  -X  (XML  plist
            output) option.

       -t   Specifies  that  CUPS  test  report output is desired instead of the
            plain text output.

       -v   Specifies that all request and response attributes should be  output
            in CUPS test mode (-t). This is the default for XML output.

COMPATIBILITY
       The ipptool program is unique to CUPS.
