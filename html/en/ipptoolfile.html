NAME
       ipptoolfile - ipptool file format


DESCRIPTION
       The  ipptool(1)  program accepts free-form plain text files that describe
       one or more IPP requests. Comments start with the &quot;#&quot; character and  con&#8208;
       tinue  to the end of the line. Each request is enclosed by curley braces,
       for example:

           # This is a comment
           {
             # The name of the test
             NAME &quot;Print PostScript Job&quot;

             # The request to send
             OPERATION Print-Job
             GROUP operation-attributes-tag
             ATTR charset attributes-charset utf-8
             ATTR language attributes-natural-language en
             ATTR uri printer-uri $uri
             ATTR name requesting-user-name $user
             FILE testfile.ps

             # The response to expect
             STATUS successful-ok
             EXPECT attributes-charset OF-TYPE charset
             EXPECT attributes-natural-language OF-TYPE naturalLanguage
             EXPECT job-id OF-TYPE integer
             EXPECT job-uri OF-TYPE uri
           }
           {
             # The name of the test
             NAME &quot;Get Attributes of PostScript Job&quot;

             # The request to send
             OPERATION Get-Job-Attributes
             GROUP operation-attributes-tag
             ATTR charset attributes-charset utf-8
             ATTR language attributes-natural-language en
             ATTR uri printer-uri $uri
             ATTR integer job-id $job-id
             ATTR name requesting-user-name $user

             # The response to expect
             STATUS successful-ok
             EXPECT attributes-charset OF-TYPE charset

             EXPECT job-state OF-TYPE enum
             EXPECT job-originating-user-name OF-TYPE name WITH-VALUE &quot;$user&quot;
           }


TOP-LEVEL DIRECTIVES
       The following directives can be used outside of a test:

       { test }
            Defines a test.

       DEFINE variable-name value
            Defines the named variable to the given value. This is equivalent to
            specifying &quot;-d variable-name=value&quot; on the ipptool command-line.

       DEFINE-DEFAULT variable-name value
            Defines the named variable to the given value if it does not already
            have a value.

       IGNORE-ERRORS yes

       IGNORE-ERRORS no
            Specifies whether, by default, ipptool will ignore errors  and  con&#8208;
            tinue with subsequent tests.

       INCLUDE &quot;filename&quot;

       INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;
            Includes  another test file. The first form includes a file relative
            to the current test file, while the second form includes a file from
            the ipptool include directory.

       INCLUDE-IF-DEFINED name &quot;filename&quot;

       INCLUDE-IF-DEFINED name &lt;filename&gt;
            Includes  another  test  file  if the named variable is defined. The
            first form includes a file relative to the current test file,  while
            the second form includes a file from the ipptool include directory.

       INCLUDE-IF-NOT-DEFINED name &quot;filename&quot;

       INCLUDE-IF-NOT-DEFINED name &lt;filename&gt;
            Includes another test file if the named variable is not defined. The
            first form includes a file relative to the current test file,  while
            the second form includes a file from the ipptool include directory.

       SKIP-IF-DEFINED variable-name

       SKIP-IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
            Specifies that the remainder of the test file should be skipped when
            the variable is or is not defined.

       TRANSFER auto
            Specifies that tests will, by default, use &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chun&#8208;
            ked&quot;  for  requests  with  attached  files and &quot;Content-Length:&quot; for
            requests without attached files.

       TRANSFER chunked
            Specifies that tests will, by default, use the  HTTP/1.1  &quot;Transfer-
            Encoding:  chunked&quot; header. This is the default and is equivalent to
            specifying &quot;-c&quot; on the ipptool  command-line.  Support  for  chunked
            requests is required for conformance with all versions of IPP.

       TRANSFER length
            Specifies  that  tests  will, by default, use the HTTP/1.0 &quot;Content-
            Length:&quot; header. This is equivalent to specifying &quot;-l&quot; on  the  ipp&#8208;
            tool  command-line.  Support for content length requests is required
            for conformance with all versions of IPP.

       VERSION 1.0

       VERSION 1.1

       VERSION 2.0

       VERSION 2.1

       VERSION 2.2
            Specifies the default IPP version number to use for the  tests  that
            follow.
&#12;TEST DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood in a test:

       ATTR tag attribute-name value(s)
            Adds  an  attribute to the test request. Values are separated by the
            comma (&quot;,&quot;) character - escape commas using the &quot;

       ATTR collection attribute-name { MEMBER tag member-name value(s) ... }  [
       ... { ... } ]
            Adds  a  collection attribute to the test request. Member attributes
            follow the same syntax as regular attributes and can  themselves  be
            nested  collections.   Multiple collection values can be supplied as
            needed.

       DELAY seconds
            Specifies a delay before this test will be run.

       DISPLAY attribute-name
            Specifies that value of the named attribute should be output as part
            of the test report.

       EXPECT attribute-name [ predicate(s) ]

       EXPECT ?attribute-name predicate(s)

       EXPECT !attribute-name
            Specifies  that  the  response  must/may/must  not include the named
            attribute.  Additional requirements can be added as predicates - see
            the &quot;EXPECT PREDICATES&quot; section for more information on predicates.

       FILE filename
            Specifies a file to include at the end of the request. This is typi&#8208;
            cally used when sending a test print file.

       GROUP tag
            Specifies the group tag for subsequent attributes in the request.

       IGNORE-ERRORS yes

       IGNORE-ERRORS no
            Specifies whether ipptool will ignore errors and continue with  sub&#8208;
            sequent tests.

       NAME &quot;literal string&quot;
            Specifies the human-readable name of the test.

       OPERATION operation-code
            Specifies the operation to be performed.

       REQUEST-ID number

       REQUEST-ID random
            Specifies  the  request-id  value  to  use in the request, either an
            integer or the word &quot;random&quot; to use a randomly generated value  (the
            default).

       RESOURCE path
            Specifies  an alternate resource path that is used for the HTTP POST
            request.  The default is the resource from the URI provided  to  the
            ipptool program.

       SKIP-IF-DEFINED variable-name

       SKIP-IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
            Specifies  that the current test should be skipped when the variable
            is or is not defined.

       SKIP-PREVIOUS-ERROR yes

       SKIP-PREVIOUS-ERROR no
            Specifies whether ipptool will skip the current test if the previous
            test resulted in an error/failure.

       STATUS status-code [ predicate ]
            Specifies   an   expected  response  status-code  value.  Additional
            requirements can be added as predicates -  see  the  &quot;STATUS  PREDI&#8208;
            CATES&quot; section for more information on predicates.

       TRANSFER auto
            Specifies that this test will use &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; if it
            has an attached file or &quot;Content-Length:&quot; otherwise.

       TRANSFER chunked
            Specifies that this test will use the  HTTP/1.1  &quot;Transfer-Encoding:
            chunked&quot; header.

       VERSION 1.1

       VERSION 2.0

       VERSION 2.1

       VERSION 2.2

EXPECT PREDICATES
       The following predicates are understood following the EXPECT test  direc&#8208;
       tive:

       COUNT number
            Requires  the  EXPECT attribute to have the specified number of val&#8208;
            ues.

       DEFINE-MATCH variable-name
            Defines the variable to &quot;1&quot; when the  EXPECT  condition  matches.  A
            side-effect  of this predicate is that this EXPECT will never fail a
            test.

       DEFINE-NO-MATCH variable-name
            Defines the variable to &quot;1&quot;  when  the  EXPECT  condition  does  not
            match.  A  side-  effect  of this predicate is that this EXPECT will
            never fail a test.

       DEFINE-VALUE variable-name
            Defines the variable to the value of the attribute when  the  EXPECT
            condition  matches.  A  side-effect  of  this predicate is that this
            EXPECT will never fail a test.

       IF-DEFINED variable-name
            Makes the EXPECT conditions apply only if the specified variable  is
            defined.

       IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
            Makes  the EXPECT conditions apply only if the specified variable is
            not defined.

       IN-GROUP tag
            Requires the EXPECT attribute to be in the specified group tag.

       OF-TYPE tag[,tag,...]
            Requires the EXPECT attribute to use the specified value tag(s).

       REPEAT-MATCH

       REPEAT-NO-MATCH
            Specifies that the current test should be repeated when  the  EXPECT
            condition matches or does not match.

       SAME-COUNT-AS attribute-name
            Requires  the  EXPECT attribute to have the same number of values as
            the specified parallel attribute.

       WITH-VALUE &quot;literal string&quot;
            Requires at least one value of the EXPECT  attribute  to  match  the
            literal string.  Comparisons are case-sensitive.

       WITH-VALUE &quot;/regular expression/&quot;
            Requires  that  all values of the EXPECT attribute match the regular
            expression, which must conform to the POSIX regular expression  syn&#8208;
            tax.  Comparisons are case-sensitive.


STATUS PREDICATES
       The  following predicates are understood following the STATUS test direc&#8208;
       tive:

       IF-DEFINED variable-name
            Makes the STATUS apply only if the specified variable is defined.

       IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
            Makes the STATUS  apply  only  if  the  specified  variable  is  not
            defined.

       REPEAT-MATCH

       REPEAT-NO-MATCH
            Specifies that the current test should be repeated when the response
            status-code matches or does not match the  value  specified  by  the
            STATUS directive.
