IRCII(1)                                                                IRCII(1)



NAME
       ircII - interface to the Internet Relay Chat system

SYNOPSIS
       irc  [-c chan] [-p portno] [-P portno] [-b] [-f] [-F] [-s] [-S] [-t] [-T]
       [-d] [nickname [server list]] [-a] [-v] [-q] [-h hostname ] [-icb] [-irc]

DESCRIPTION
       The ircII program is a full screen, termcap based interface  to  Internet
       Relay  Chat.   It  gives  full access to all of the normal IRC functions,
       plus a variety of additional options.

OPTIONS
       -c chan
              Automatically join channel chan.

       -p portno
              Set the IRC port number to portno (default: 6667, the standard IRC
              port).   Only  supply this if you connect to a server which uses a
              port other than 6667.

       -P portno
              Set the ICB port number to portno (default: 7326, the standard ICB
              port).

       -b     Load  the  .ircrc  file  before connection to a server, not after&#8208;
              wards.

       -f     Use flow control (^S and ^Q) to stop/start the display.   Normally
              these  are  both bound to other functions within irc.  This switch
              is ignored if the  -d switch is used.

       -F     Don&apos;t use flow control (^S and ^Q)  to  stop  start  the  display.
              This switch is ignored if the  -d switch is used.

       -s     Don&apos;t  start  up  the  ircio  process to connect to the IRC server
              (default).

       -S     Start up the ircio process to connect to the IRC server.

       -t     Don&apos;t use the termcap ti and te sequences when starting and  exit&#8208;
              ing (default).

       -T     Do  use  the termcap ti and te sequences when starting and exiting
              if they exist.

       -d     Start in &quot;dumb&quot; mode.  All input is taken directly from stdin  and
              all  output  goes  to  stdout  without using any of the termcap(5)
              screen control codes.

       nickname
              Set the nickname  (overrides  the  environment  variable  IRCNICK;
              default: the username).

       server Set  the  list  of servers with which irc will try to connect upon
              startup.  This list is also used by the program&apos;s /server command.
              The format for lines in the list is:

              hostname [:portno[:password[:nick]]] for IRC connections.  For ICB
              connections, the format is:

              ICB/hostname [:portno[::nick[:group[:mode]]]] with group being the
              initial  group  and  mode being the initial group mode.  See /HELP
              ICB for more information about ICB.

              If the  hostname  is  in  the  format  :servergroup:host.com  then
              servergroup is taken to be the Server Group for this server entry.

       -a     This  adds  the normal irc server list to the command line list of
              irc servers.

       -v     Print the version and release date of ircII and exit.

       -q     Start up irc quickly -- don&apos;t load the IRCRC file.

       -h hostname
              This option instructs ircII to use the given hostname as the local
              address.  Useful only on multi-homed hosts.

       -icb   Use ICB connections by default.

       -irc   Use IRC connections by default.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   The Screen:
       The  screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video status
       line (if supported).  The upper (larger)  part  of  the  screen  displays
       responses  from  the  IRC server.  The lower part of the screen (a single
       line) accepts keyboard input.

       Some terminals do not support certain  features  required  by  ircII,  in
       which  case  you  receive  a  message  stating this.  If this occurs, try
       changing the terminal type or run ircII with the -d option.

   Irc Commands:
       Any line beginning with the slash character &apos;/&apos; is regarded as  an  ircII
       command (the command character may be changed; type &apos;/help set cmdchar&apos;).
       Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to  be
       sent  to  the  current  channel.   To produce a listing of commands, type
       &apos;/help ?&apos;.  To receive information about the commands type  &apos;/help  &lt;com&#8208;
       mand&gt; &apos;.

   The .ircrc File:
       When  ircII is executed, it checks the user&apos;s home directory for a .ircrc
       file, executing the commands in the file.  Commands in this file  do  not
       need to have a leading slash character &apos;/&apos;.  This allows predefinition of
       aliases and other features.

EXAMPLES
       irc -c #users -p 5555
              Connect IRC to port number 5555 of the default host and  enter  on
              channel #users.

       irc Mermaid
              Use the nickname &quot;Mermaid&quot;.

       irc Mermaid server1:5000 server2::passwd server3
              Use the nickname &quot;Mermaid&quot; and the modified server list.

       irc piglet3 :ln:irc1.lamenet.org :ln:irc1.lamenet.org
              Use    the    nickname    &quot;piglet3&quot;,   initially   connecting   to
              irc.au.lamenet.org, with  also  irc.us.lamenet.org  added  to  the
              server list, both having a server group name &quot;ln&quot;.

       irc oink ICB/www.icb.net
              Use the nick &quot;oink&quot; making an ICB connection to www.icb.net.

       irc -d Use dumb mode.

       irc -f Allow use of ^S/^Q to stop/start screen display.
&#12;       irc -e elisa
              Interface IRC with a program called elisa.

       setenv IRCNICK Mermaid
       setenv IRCNAME &quot;The one and only :)&quot;

       irc    Set  the  username (if not specified elsewhere) to &quot;Mermaid&quot;.  The
              user&apos;s name (when provided inside parentheses  in  response  to  a
              WHOIS command) is set to &quot;The one and only :)&quot;.

FILES
       /usr/bin/ircII        the executable program

       ~/.ircrc              default initialization file

       ~/.irc/               directory  you can put your own ircII scripts into,
                             that can then be loaded with /load

       /etc/irc/             directory  containing  message-of-the-day,   master
                             initialization,   help   files  and  ircII  scripts
                             /etc/irc/script/local is the master  initialization
                             file  for  the site, loaded before .ircrc is.  This
                             is a Debian GNU/Linux conffile.

       /usr/share/ircII/     shared repository for help, translation tables  and
                             distributed scripts.

THE HELP FILES
       All  of the ircII commands are fully described in the help files package.
       The best way to start here is with the /HELP ?  command as this prints  a
       listing of all available help files.

SIGNALS
       ircII handles the following signals

       SIGUSR1
              Closes all DCC connections and EXEC&apos;ed processes.

       SIGUSR2
              Drops ircII back to the command line.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       It  can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the .cshrc, .pro&#8208;
       file, or .login file:

       IRCNICK
              The user&apos;s IRC nickname.

       IRCNAME
              The user&apos;s IRC realname (otherwise retreived from /etc/passwd)

       IRCSERVER
              The default IRC server(s) (see server option for details)

       IRCSERVERSFILE
              The file containing the default list of  server(s),  usually  PRE&#8208;
              FIX/lib/irc/ircII.servers.   This  file  should contain one server
              entry per line.

       HOME   Overrides the default home path in /etc/passwd.

       TERM   The type of terminal in use.

FILES
       ircII uses the following files under the library directory, usually  PRE&#8208;
       FIX/share/irc.

       ircII.servers
              The  initial  list  of servers if none are provided on the command
              line.

       ircII.motd
              Message of the day.  This file is displayed only once each time it
              is changed.
