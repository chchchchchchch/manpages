NAME
       isodump - format of IEEE 1394 isochronous packets dump file

DESCRIPTION
       The  isodump format stores a series of IEEE 1394 isochronous stream pack&#8208;
       ets (possibly from multiple channels), including their headers.  Its main
       use  is  as  the  output  format  of  dumpiso(1)  and the input format of
       sendiso(1).

       The 32 byte header starts at offset 0 with the string &quot;1394  isodump  v1&quot;
       followed by a zero byte.  The next 8 bytes form a 64 bit big endian inte&#8208;
       ger, which represents a bit mask of the channels that were dumped.  A set
       bit  at position (1 &lt;&lt; x) signifies that channel x was being listened on.
       The following 8 bytes are set to zero.

       The iso packets follow the header and are appended to the data stream  in
       the  order they were received.  The packets consist of the header quadlet
       as originally received and the data quadlets following directly.  The CRC
       quadlets  after  header  and  data do not appear and everything is in big
       endian, as seen on the bus.

       There is no further framing of the packets in the format,  packet  bound&#8208;
       aries  can  be  found  by  looking  at  the data size field in the header
       quadlet of each packet.  The data size field appears in the most signifi&#8208;
       cant 16 bits of the header quadlet, contain the size in bytes (the actual
       packet is padded to a multiple of four bytes)  and  do  not  include  the
       header packet.

COMPATIBILITY
       This  format  was introduced with the iso send and dump tools distributed
       with libraw1394.  No one else uses it so far.
