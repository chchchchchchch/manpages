ISOSIZE(8)                    System Administration                   ISOSIZE(8)



NAME
       isosize - output the length of an iso9660 filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       isosize [options] iso9660_image_file

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  outputs  the length of an iso9660 file system that is con&#8208;
       tained in the given file.  That file may be a  normal  file  or  a  block
       device  (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0).  In the absence of any switches (and
       errors) it will output the size of the iso9660 filesystem in bytes.  This
       can now be a large number (&gt;&gt; 4 GB).

OPTIONS
       -x, --sectors
              Show  the  block count and block size in human-readable form.  The
              output uses the term &quot;sectors&quot; for &quot;blocks&quot;.

       -d, --divisor number
              Only has an effect when -x is not given.  The value shown  (if  no
              errors)  is  the iso9660 file size in bytes divided by number.  So
              if number is the block size then the shown value will be the block
              count.

       The  size of the file (or block device) holding an iso9660 filesystem can
       be marginally larger than the actual size of the iso9660 filesystem.  One
       reason  for  this is that cd writers are allowed to add &quot;run out&quot; sectors
       at the end of an iso9660 image.
