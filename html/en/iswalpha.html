ISWALPHA(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWALPHA(3)



NAME
       iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswalpha(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswalpha()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the isal&#8208;
       pha(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide  character  belonging  to
       the wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;alpha&quot;  is  a subclass of the wide-character
       class &quot;alnum&quot;, and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character  class
       &quot;graph&quot; and of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;cntrl&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;, the  wide-character
       class  &quot;alpha&quot;  is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;space&quot; and its
       subclass &quot;blank&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;alnum&quot;, the  wide-character
       class &quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;alpha&quot;  is  disjoint from the wide-character
       class &quot;digit&quot;.

       The wide-character class  &quot;alpha&quot;  contains  the  wide-character  classes
       &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot; always contains at least the letters &apos;A&apos;
       to &apos;Z&apos; and &apos;a&apos; to &apos;z&apos;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswalpha() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of iswalpha() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
