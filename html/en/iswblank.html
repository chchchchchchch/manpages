ISWBLANK(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWBLANK(3)



NAME
       iswblank - test for whitespace wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswblank(wint_t wc);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       iswblank():
              _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
              or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswblank()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent   of   the
       isblank(3)  function.   It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging
       to the wide-character class &quot;blank&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;blank&quot; is  a  subclass  of  the  wide-character
       class &quot;space&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;space&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;blank&quot; is disjoint  from  the  wide-character  class  &quot;graph&quot;  and
       therefore  also  disjoint  from its subclasses &quot;alnum&quot;, &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;,
       &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;xdigit&quot;, &quot;punct&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;blank&quot; always contains at least the space char&#8208;
       acter and the control character &apos;\t&apos;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswblank() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;blank&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswblank() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
