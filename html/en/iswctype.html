ISWCTYPE(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWCTYPE(3)



NAME
       iswctype - wide-character classification

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswctype(wint_t wc, wctype_t desc);

DESCRIPTION
       If  wc  is  a  wide character having the character property designated by
       desc (or in other words: belongs to the  character  class  designated  by
       desc),  the  iswctype()  function  returns nonzero.  Otherwise it returns
       zero.  If wc is WEOF, zero is returned.

       desc must be a character property descriptor returned  by  the  wctype(3)
       function.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswctype()  function  returns  nonzero  if the wc has the designated
       property.  Otherwise it returns 0.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswctype() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
