ISWDIGIT(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWDIGIT(3)



NAME
       iswdigit - test for decimal digit wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswdigit(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The   iswdigit()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       isdigit(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide  character  belonging
       to the wide-character class &quot;digit&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;digit&quot;  is  a subclass of the wide-character
       class &quot;xdigit&quot;, and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class
       &quot;alnum&quot;,  of  the  wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; and of the wide-character
       class &quot;print&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide character class &quot;print&quot;, the  wide-character
       class &quot;digit&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;cntrl&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;digit&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;space&quot;  and  its
       subclass &quot;blank&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;alnum&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;digit&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;digit&quot;  is  disjoint  from  the  wide-character
       class  &quot;alpha&quot;  and  therefore also disjoint from its subclasses &quot;lower&quot;,
       &quot;upper&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;digit&quot; always contains exactly the  digits  &apos;0&apos;
       to &apos;9&apos;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswdigit() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;digit&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswdigit() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
