ISWGRAPH(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWGRAPH(3)



NAME
       iswgraph - test for graphic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswgraph(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The   iswgraph()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       isgraph(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide  character  belonging
       to the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;graph&quot;  is  a subclass of the wide-character
       class &quot;print&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;, the  wide-character
       class &quot;graph&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;cntrl&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;graph&quot;  is  disjoint from the wide-character
       class &quot;space&quot; and therefore also disjoint from its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; contains all the  wide  characters  from
       the  wide-character  class &quot;print&quot; except the space character.  It there&#8208;
       fore contains the wide-character classes &quot;alnum&quot; and &quot;punct&quot;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswgraph() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of iswgraph() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
