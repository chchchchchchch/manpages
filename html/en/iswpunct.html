ISWPUNCT(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWPUNCT(3)



NAME
       iswpunct - test for punctuation or symbolic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswpunct(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The   iswpunct()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       ispunct(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide  character  belonging
       to the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;punct&quot;  is  a subclass of the wide-character
       class &quot;graph&quot;, and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character  class
       &quot;print&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;punct&quot;  is  disjoint from the wide-character
       class &quot;alnum&quot; and therefore also disjoint from  its  subclasses  &quot;alpha&quot;,
       &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;xdigit&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;punct&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;cntrl&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;, the  wide-character
       class  &quot;punct&quot;  is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;space&quot; and its
       subclass &quot;blank&quot;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswpunct() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide-character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of iswpunct() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       This function&apos;s name is a misnomer when dealing with Unicode  characters,
       because  the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot; contains both punctuation char&#8208;
       acters and symbol (math, currency, etc.) characters.
