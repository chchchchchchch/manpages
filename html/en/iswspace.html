ISWSPACE(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWSPACE(3)



NAME
       iswspace - test for whitespace wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswspace(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswspace()  function  is  the  wide-character equivalent of the iss&#8208;
       pace(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character  belonging  to
       the wide-character class &quot;space&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;space&quot;  is  disjoint from the wide-character
       class &quot;graph&quot; and therefore also disjoint from  its  subclasses  &quot;alnum&quot;,
       &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;xdigit&quot;, &quot;punct&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;space&quot;  contains  the  wide-character  class
       &quot;blank&quot;.

       The wide-character class &quot;space&quot; always contains at least the space char&#8208;
       acter and the control characters &apos;\f&apos;, &apos;\n&apos;, &apos;\r&apos;, &apos;\t&apos;, &apos;\v&apos;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswspace() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;space&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswspace() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.
