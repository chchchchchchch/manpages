ISWUPPER(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                ISWUPPER(3)



NAME
       iswupper - test for uppercase wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       int iswupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswupper()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the isup&#8208;
       per(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide  character  belonging  to
       the wide-character class &quot;upper&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;upper&quot;  is  a subclass of the wide-character
       class &quot;alpha&quot;, and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character  class
       &quot;alnum&quot;,  of  the  wide-character class &quot;graph&quot; and of the wide-character
       class &quot;print&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;print&quot;, the  wide-character
       class &quot;upper&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;cntrl&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;graph&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;upper&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;space&quot;  and  its
       subclass &quot;blank&quot;.

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;alnum&quot;, the wide-character
       class &quot;upper&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;punct&quot;.

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot;, the  wide-character
       class &quot;upper&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class &quot;digit&quot;.

       The  wide-character  class  &quot;upper&quot; contains at least those characters wc
       which are equal to towupper(wc) and different from towlower(wc).

       The wide-character class &quot;upper&quot; always contains at least the letters &apos;A&apos;
       to &apos;Z&apos;.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswupper() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belong&#8208;
       ing to the wide-character class &quot;upper&quot;.  Otherwise it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       This  function  is  not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode charac&#8208;
       ters, because Unicode knows about three cases:  upper,  lower  and  title
       case.
