IUCODE_TOOL(8)                                                    IUCODE_TOOL(8)



NAME
       iucode_tool - Tool to manipulate Intel&#174; IA32/X86_64 microcode bundles

SYNOPSIS
       iucode_tool [options] [[-ttype] filename|dirname] ...

DESCRIPTION
       iucode_tool  is  an utility that can load Intel&#174; processor microcode data
       from files in both text and binary microcode bundle formats.

       It can output a list of the microcodes in these files, merge them, upload
       them  to  the  kernel  (to  upgrade the microcode in the system processor
       cores) or write some of them out to a file in  binary  format  for  later
       use.

       iucode_tool  will load all microcodes in the specified files and directo&#8208;
       ries to memory, in  order  to  process  them.   Duplicated  and  outdated
       microcodes  will  be discarded.  It can read microcode data from standard
       input (stdin), by specifying a file name of &quot;-&quot; (minus sign).

       Microcode data files are assumed to be in .dat text format if they have a
       .dat  suffix,  and  to  be  in  binary  format otherwise.  Standard input
       (stdin) is assumed to be in .dat text format.  The -t option can be  used
       to change the type of the files specified after it, including for stdin.

       If  a  directory  is specified, all files whose names do not begin with a
       dot will  be  loaded,  in  unspecified  order.   Nested  directories  are
       skipped.

       You can select which microcodes should be written out, listed or uploaded
       to the kernel using the -S, -s, --date-before and  --date-after  options.
       Should  none  of  those  options  be  specified,  all  microcodes will be
       selected.

       You can upload the selected microcodes to the kernel, write them out to a
       file  (in  binary format) or to per-processor-signature files in a direc&#8208;
       tory using the -w, -k, and -K options.

       For more information about Intel processor microcodes,  please  read  the
       included  documentation and the Intel manuals listed in the SEE ALSO sec&#8208;
       tion.


OPTIONS
       iucode_tool accepts the following options:


       -q, --quiet
              Inhibit usual output.

       -v, --verbose
              Print more information.  Use more than once for added verbosity.

       -h, -?, --help
              List all available options and their meanings.

       --usage
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.
&#12;
       -t type
              Sets the file type of the following files. type can be:

              b      binary format.  This is the same format used by the  kernel
                     driver  and  the  BIOS/EFI, which is described in detail by
                     the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures  Software  Developer&apos;s
                     Manual, Volume 3A, section 9.11.

              d      Intel  microcode .dat text format.  This is the format nor&#8208;
                     mally used by Intel to distribute microcode data files.

              a      (default) iucode_tool  will  use  the  filename  suffix  to
                     select  the file type: .dat text format for files that have
                     a .dat suffix, and binary type otherwise.   Note  that  for
                     stdin, .dat text format is assumed.


       --downgrade
              When  multiple  versions of the microcode for a specific processor
              are available from different files, keep the  one  from  the  file
              loaded  last,  regardless  of  revision  levels.  Files are always
              loaded in the order they were specified in the command line.  This
              option has no effect when just one file has been loaded.


       --no-downgrade
              When  multiple  versions of the microcode for a specific processor
              are available from different files, keep the one with the  highest
              revision level.  This is the default mode of operation.


       --strict-checks
              Perform  strict  checks  on the microcode data.  It will refuse to
              load microcodes and microcode data files with unexpected size  and
              metadata.  This is the default mode of operation.


       --no-strict-checks
              Perform less strict checks on the microcode data.  Use only if you
              happen to come across a microcode data file  that  has  microcodes
              with  weird  sizes  inside, or to load microcodes from a truncated
              microcode data  file  (in  which  case  you  will  also  need  the
              --ignore-broken option).


       --ignore-broken
              Skip  broken  microcode  entries  during load, instead of aborting
              execution.


       --no-ignore-broken
              Abort program execution if a  broken  microcode  is  found  during
              load.  This is the default mode of operation.



       -s [!]signature[,pf_mask]
              Select  microcodes by the specificed signature and processor flags
              mask (pf_mask).  If pf_mask is  specified,  it  will  select  only
              microcodes  that  are  suitable  for at least one of the processor
              flag combinations in the mask.

              Specify more than once to select more microcodes.  This option can
              be combined with the -S option to select more microcodes.  If sig&#8208;
              nature is prefixed with a !, it will unselect microcodes  instead.
              Ordering matters, with later -s options overriding earlier ones.

              The  --scan-system option has precedence, therefore the microcodes
              it selects cannot be unselected.


       -S, --scan-system
              Select microcodes by scanning all online processors on this system
              for their signatures.

              This  option  can  be  combined  with the -s option to select more
              microcodes.

              Should the scan fail, the program will print a warning to the user
              and continue as if --scan-system had not been specified.


       --date-before=YYYY-MM-DD and --date-after=YYYY-MM-DD
              Limit  the  selected microcodes by a date range.  The date must be
              given in ISO format, with four digits for the year and two  digits
              for  the  month  and  day  and - for the separator.  Dates are not
              range-checked, so you can use  --date-after=2000-00-00  to  select
              all microcodes dated since January 1st, 2000.


       -l, --list
              List selected microcode signatures.

       -L, --list-all
              List all microcode signatures while they&apos;re being processed.


       -k[device], --kernel[=device]
              Upload  selected microcodes to the kernel.  Optionally, the device
              path can be specified (default: /dev/cpu/microcode).  This  update
              method is being deprecated.

       -K[directory], --write-firmware[=directory]
              Write selected microcodes with the filenames expected by the Linux
              kernel firmware loader.  Optionally, the destination directory can
              be specified (default: /lib/firmware/intel-ucode).


       -wfile, --write-to=file
              Write selected microcodes to a file in binary format.


       --overwrite
              Remove  the destination file before writing.  Without this option,
              iucode_tool will abort if the file already exists.  Do  note  that
              it will remove symlinks instead of following them.


       --no-overwrite
              Abort if the destination file already exists.  This is the default
              mode of operation.  Do note that iucode_tool does not follow  sym&#8208;
              links when writing files.


NOTES
       iucode_tool reads all data to memory before doing any processing.


       The  microcode  data  is  sorted  by  cpu signature.  Older revisions are
       removed (either based on revision level or load order, depending  on  the
       --downgrade  option)  before the data is written to a file or uploaded to
       the kernel.


       Intel microcode data files, both in binary and text formats, can be  con&#8208;
       catenated to generate a bigger and still valid microcode data file.


       iucode_tool  does  not  follow symlinks when writing microcode data files
       (--write-to and --write-firmware options).   It  will  either  refuse  to
       write  the file and abort (default mode of operation), or remove the sym&#8208;
       link before writing (when the --overwrite option  is  active).   It  does
       follow directory symlinks to locate the directory to write files into.


   Linux Notes
       The  cpuid  kernel driver is required for the --scan-system functionality
       to work.

       Each Intel processor microcode must be uploaded through  a  single  write
       syscall  to  /dev/cpu/microcode,  but  more  than  one  microcode  can be
       uploaded per write syscall.  Writing the microcode to the  kernel  device
       will  update  all  system  processor cores at once.  This method is being
       deprecated and does not work on other system processor types.

       The old Linux firmware interface for microcode updates needs to be  trig&#8208;
       gered  on  a per-core basis, by writing the number 1 to /sys/devices/sys&#8208;
       tem/cpu/*/microcode/reload.  Depending on kernel version, you must either
       trigger  it on every core to avoid a dangerous situation where some cores
       are using outdated microcode, or the kernel will accept the request  only
       for the boot processor and use it to trigger an update on all system pro&#8208;
       cessor cores.

       Since Linux v3.6, the per-core interface has been  replaced  with  a  new
       interface  that explicitly triggers an update for every core at once when
       the number 1 is written to /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload.

       The microcode driver should not be unloaded unless you are sure it is not
       going  to be needed.  The driver needs to be loaded in order for the ker&#8208;
       nel to reapply the microcode updates after the system resumes  from  sus&#8208;
       pend  or  hibernation, and also to update any system processor cores that
       were off-line at the time the update was applied.


EXAMPLES
   Updating files in /lib/firmware/intel-ucode:
              iucode_tool    -K/lib/firmware/intel-ucode    /lib/firmware/intel-
              ucode/* /tmp/file-with-new-microcodes.bin

   Processing several compressed files at once:
              zcat intel-microcode*.dat.gz | iucode-tool -k -

              zcat intel-microcode*.bin.gz | iucode-tool -k -tb -


BUGS
       iucode_tool will waste space when writing microcodes with extended signa&#8208;
       tures (one copy per signature).


       The extended signature code is completely  untested,  and  likely  buggy.
       Intel  so  far  has  never  distributed  microcode  data  files using the
       extended signatures.


       Microcode with negative revision numbers is not special-cased,  and  will
       not be preferred over regular microcode.
