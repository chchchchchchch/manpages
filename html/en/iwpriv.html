IWPRIV(8)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  IWPRIV(8)



NAME
       iwpriv  -  configure optionals (private) parameters of a wireless network
       interface

SYNOPSIS
       iwpriv [interface]
       iwpriv interface private-command [private-parameters]
       iwpriv interface private-command [I] [private-parameters]
       iwpriv interface --all

DESCRIPTION
       Iwpriv is the companion tool to iwconfig(8).  Iwpriv deals  with  parame&#8208;
       ters  and  setting  specific to each driver (as opposed to iwconfig which
       deals with generic ones).

       Without any argument, iwpriv list the available private  commands  avail&#8208;
       able  on each interface, and the parameters that they require. Using this
       information, the user may apply those interface specific commands on  the
       specified interface.

       In theory, the documentation of each device driver should indicate how to
       use those interface specific commands and their effect.

PARAMETERS
       private-command [private-parameters]
              Execute the specified private-command on the interface.
              The command may optionally take or require arguments, and may dis&#8208;
              play  information.  Therefore,  the command line parameters may or
              may not be needed and should match the command  expectations.  The
              list  of  commands that iwpriv displays (when called without argu&#8208;
              ment) should give you some hints about those parameters.
              However you should refer to the device  driver  documentation  for
              information on how to properly use the command and the effect.

       private-command [I] [private-parameters]
              Idem,  except  that  I  (an integer) is passed to the command as a
              Token Index.  Only some command will use  the  Token  Index  (most
              will ignore it), and the driver documentation should tell you when
              it&apos;s needed.

       -a/--all
              Execute and display all the private commands that don&apos;t  take  any
              arguments (i.e.  read only).

DISPLAY
       For  each  device which support private commands, iwpriv will display the
       list of private commands available.

       This include the name of the private command,  the  number  or  arguments
       that  may  be set and their type, and the number or arguments that may be
       display and their type.

       For example, you may have the following display :
       eth0      Available private ioctl :
                 setqualthr (89F0) : set   1 byte &amp; get   0
                 gethisto (89F7) : set   0      &amp; get  16 int

       This indicate that you may set the quality threshold and display an  his&#8208;
       togram of up to 16 values with the following commands :
         iwpriv eth0 setqualthr 20
         iwpriv eth0 gethisto
