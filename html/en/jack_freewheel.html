NAME
       jack_freewheel - JACK toolkit client to control freewheeling mode

SYNOPSIS
       jack_freewheel [y|n]

DESCRIPTION
       jack_freewheel  Turns freewheeling mode on (y) or off (n). While in free&#8208;
       wheeling mode, the JACK server does not wait in between process()  calls,
       and does not read or write data from/to any audio interface. That results
       in the JACK graph processing data as fast as possible. Freewheeling makes
       fast exports to files possible.

       There  is  no  useful  reason  to  use this tool other than testing. JACK
       clients that use freewheeling will turn it on and off themselves.
