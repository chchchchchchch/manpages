JACK_IODELAY(1)                                                  JACK_IODELAY(1)



NAME
       jack_iodelay - JACK toolkit client to measure roundtrip latency

SYNOPSIS
       jack_iodelay

DESCRIPTION
       jack_iodelay will create one input and one output port, and then measures
       the latency (signal delay) between them. For this  to  work,  the  output
       port  must be connected to its input port. The measurement is accurate to
       a resolution of greater than 1 sample.

       The expected use is to connect jack_iodelay&apos;s output port to  a  hardware
       playback  port, then use a physical loopback cable from the corresponding
       hardware output connector to an input connector, and to connect that cor&#8208;
       responding  hardware capture port to jack_iodelay&apos;s input port. This cre&#8208;
       ates a roundtrip that goes through any analog-to-digital and  digital-to-
       analog converters that are present in the audio hardware.

       Although  the  hardware  loopback latency is the expected use, it is also
       possible to use jack_iodelay to measure the latency along any fully  con&#8208;
       nected signal path, such as those involving other JACK clients.

       Once  jack_iodelay  completes  its  measurement  it  will print the total
       latency it has detected. This will include  the  JACK  buffer  length  in
       addition  to  any  other  latency in the signal path. It will continue to
       print the value every 0.5 seconds so  that  if  you  wish  you  can  vary
       aspects of the signal path to see their effect on the measured latency.

       If  no incoming signal is detected from the input port, jack_iodelay will
       print

        Signal below threshold... .

       every second until this changes (e.g. until  you  establish  the  correct
       connections).

       To use the value measured by jack_iodelay with the -I and -O arguments of
       a JACK backend (also called Input Latency and Output Latency in the setup
       dialog  of  qjackctl),  you  must  subtract the JACK buffer size from the
       result. The buffer size is determined by multiplying the number of frames
       per  period  (given to the jackd backend by the -p or --period option) by
       the number of periods per buffer (given to the jackd backend by the -n or
       --nperiods  option).   Note  that  JACK2  will add an implicit additional
       period when using the default asynchronous mode, so for JACK1 or JACK2 in
       synchronous  mode,  the buffer size is n*p, but for JACK2 in asynchronous
       mode the buffer size is (n+1)*p.  Once the JACK buffer size is subtracted
       from  the  measured latency, the result is the &quot;extra&quot; latency due to the
       interface hardware. Then, if you believe that the latency is equally dis&#8208;
       tributed  between  the  input  and  output  parts  of your audio hardware
       (extremely likely), divide the result by two and use that for  input  and
       output  latency  values.  Doing this measurement will enable JACK clients
       that use the JACK latency API to accurately position/delay audio to  keep
       signals  synchronized  even when there are inherent delays in the end-to-
       end signal pathways.
