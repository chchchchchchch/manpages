NAME
       jadetex - processing tex files produced by the TeX backend of Jade.

SYNOPSIS
       jadetex [ first line ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  was derived from the manual page for LaTeX and is not
       meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this  version  of
       TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       JadeTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX source pro&#8208;
       gram, so all the capabilities described in tex(1) are present.   pdfjade&#8208;
       tex is the PDFTeX version of the jadeTeX format.
