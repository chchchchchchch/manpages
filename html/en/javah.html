Name
       javah - C Header and Stub File Generator

       javah produces C header files and C source files from a Java class. These
       files provide the connective glue that allow your  Java  and  C  code  to
       interact.

SYNOPSIS
       javah [ options ] fully-qualified-classname. . .


DESCRIPTION
       javah  generates  C  header and source files that are needed to implement
       native methods. The generated header and source files are used by C  pro&#8208;
       grams  to  reference  an  object&apos;s  instance variables from native source
       code. The .h file contains a struct definition whose layout parallels the
       layout of the corresponding class. The fields in the struct correspond to
       instance variables in the class.

       The name of the header file and the  structure  declared  within  it  are
       derived  from  the  name  of  the  class. If the class passed to javah is
       inside a package, the package name is prepended to both the  header  file
       name and the structure name. Underscores (_) are used as name delimiters.

       By  default javah creates a header file for each class listed on the com&#8208;
       mand line and puts the files in the current  directory.  Use  the  -stubs
       option  to  create  source  files.  Use  the -o option to concatenate the
       results for all listed classes into a single file.

       The new native method interface, Java Native Interface  (JNI),  does  not
       require header information or stub files. javah can still be used to gen&#8208;
       erate native method function  proptotypes  needed  for  JNI-style  native
       methods.  javah  produces  JNI-style  output  by  default, and places the
       result in the .h file.

OPTIONS
          -o outputfile
             Concatenates the resulting header  or  source  files  for  all  the
             classes  listed on the command line into outputfile. Only one of -o
             or -d may be used.

          -d directory
             Sets the directory where javah saves the header files or  the  stub
             files. Only one of -d or -o may be used.

          -stubs
             Causes javah to generate C declarations from the Java object file.

          -verbose
             Indicates  verbose  output  and  causes javah to print a message to
             stdout concerning the status of the generated files.

          -help
             Print help message for javah usage.

          -version
             Print out javah version information.

          -jni
             Causes javah to create an output file containing  JNI-style  native
             method  function  prototypes. This is the default output, so use of
             -jni is optional.

          -classpath path
             Specifies the path javah uses to look  up  classes.  Overrides  the
             default  or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is set. Direc&#8208;
             tories are separated by colons. Thus the general  format  for  path
             is:
                .:&lt;your_path&gt;
             For example:
                .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
             As  a  special convenience, a class path element containing a base&#8208;
             name of * is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all  the
             files in the directory with the extension .jar or .JAR (a java pro&#8208;
             gram cannot tell the difference between the two invocations).
             For example, if directory foo contains a.jar and  b.JAR,  then  the
             class  path element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR, except that
             the order of jar files is unspecified. All jar files in the  speci&#8208;
             fied  directory,  even  hidden  ones,  are  included in the list. A
             classpath entry consisting simply of * expands to a list of all the
             jar files in the current directory. The CLASSPATH environment vari&#8208;
             able, where defined, will  be  similarly  expanded.  Any  classpath
             wildcard  expansion  occurs  before  the  Java  virtual  machine is
             started -- no Java  program  will  ever  see  unexpanded  wildcards
             except  by  querying the environment. For example; by invoking Sys&#8208;
             tem.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).

          -bootclasspath path
             Specifies path from which to load bootstrap  classes.  By  default,
             the  bootstrap classes are the classes implementing the core Java 2
             platform located in jre/lib/rt.jar and several other jar files.

          -old
             Specifies that old JDK1.0-style header files should be generated.

          -force
             Specifies that output files should always be written.

          -Joption
             Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one of the
             options  described on the reference page for the java(1). For exam&#8208;
             ple, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
          CLASSPATH
             Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directo&#8208;
             ries are separated by colons, for example,
