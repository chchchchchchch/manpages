javaws(1)                                                              javaws(1)



NAME
       javaws - a Java Web Start client

SYNOPSYS
       javaws [-run-options] jnlp-file
       javaws [-control-option]

DESCRIPTION
       javaws  is an implementation of a JNLP  client. It uses a JNLP (Java Net&#8208;
       work Launch Protocol) file to securely run a remote Java application or a
       Java  applet.   This implementation of javaws is from the IcedTea project
       and is based on the NetX project.

       A JNLP file is an xml file that describes how to securely  run  a  remote
       Java application or a Java applet.


OPTIONS
       When specifying options, the name of the jnlp file must be the last argu&#8208;
       ment to javaws - all the options must preceede it.

       The jnlp-file can either be a url or a local path.

       Control Options

       By default javaws will launch the jnlp  file  specified  on  the  command
       line. The control options can be used to change this behaviour.

       -about      Shows a sample application that can be used to test the basic
                   functionality of this implementation.

       -viewer     Shows the trusted certificate viewer. This allows a  user  to
                   list,  examine,  remove  or export trusted certificates. Note
                   that this only reflects the certificates  trusted  by  javaws
                   and not any other certificates or programs.


       Run Options

       In the default mode, the following run-options can be used:

       -basedir dir
                   Directory  where  the  cache  and certificates to be used are
                   stored.

       -arg arg    Adds an application argument before launching.

       -param name=value
                   Adds an applet parameter before launching.

       -property name=value
                   Sets a system property before launching.

       -update seconds
                   Update check if seconds since last checked.

       -license    Display the GPL license and exit.

       -verbose    Enable verbose output. Very useful in debugging.

       -nosecurity Disables the secure runtime environment.
&#12;       -noupdate   Disables checking for updates.

       -headless   Disables download window, other UIs.

       -strict     Enables strict checking of JNLP file format.  Any  deviations
                   from the JNLP DTD will cause javaws to abort.

       -umask=value
                   Sets the umask for files created by an application.

       -Xnofork    Do  not  create  another  JVM, even if the JNLP file asks for
                   running in a separate JVM. This is useful for debugging.

       -Jjava-option
                   This passes along java-option to the java binary that is run&#8208;
                   ning  javaws. For example, to make javaws run with a max heap
                   size of 80m, use -J-Xmx80m.

       -help       Print a help message and exit.


FILES
       ~/.icedtea/deployment.properties specifies the settings used by javaws


BUGS
       There arent any known bugs. If you come across one, please file it at
           http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/
       Please run javaws in verbose mode and include that output along with  the
       jnlp file when filing out the bug report.
