jcmd(1)                                                                  jcmd(1)



Name
       jcmd - Diagnostic Command

       jcmd  is  a utility to send diagnostic command requests to a running Java
       Virtual Machine.

SYNOPSIS
           jcmd [ option ]
           jcmd &lt;pid | main class&gt; PerfCounter.print
           jcmd &lt;pid | main class&gt; command [arguments]
           jcmd &lt;pid | main class&gt; -f file


DESCRIPTION
       jcmd is a utility to send diagnostic command requests to a  Java  Virtual
       Machine supporting this feature.

       Used  without  arguments  or  with the -l option, jcmd prints the list of
       running Java processes with their process id, their main class and  their
       command line arguments.

       When  a process id is specified on the command line, jcmd sends the diag&#8208;
       nostic command request to the process with this id.

       When a main class is specified on the command line, jcmd sends the  diag&#8208;
       nostic  command  request to all Java processes for which the command line
       argument is a substring of the Java process&apos; main class.

       With the PerfCounter.print argument, jcmd prints the performance counters
       available on the targeted Java process(es).

       With the -f option, jcmd sends to the targeted Java process(es) the diag&#8208;
       nostic commands stored in the file file.

OPTIONS
       Options are mutually exclusive. Options, if used, should  follow  immedi&#8208;
       ately after the command name.

          -l Prints  the  list  of running Java processes with their process id,
             their main class and their command line arguments.

          -h Prints a help message.

          -help
             Prints a help message.


PARAMETERS
          pid
             Identifies  the  process  that  receives  the  diagnostic   command
             requests. The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java
             processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1).

          main class
             Main class of the process  that  receives  the  diagnostic  command
             requests.  When  matching  processes,  any process whose main class
             name contains the specified string as a substring will be  matched.
             If  several running Java processes share this main class, the diag&#8208;
             nostic command request is sent to all these  processes.  To  get  a
             list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1).

          command [arguments]
             Invoke  the  diagnostic command called command on the targeted Java
             process(es). The list of available diagnostic commands for a  given
             process  can  be  obtained  by  invoking  the  help command on this
             process. Each diagnostic command has  its  own  set  of  arguments,
             which  can be obtained by invoking the the command name followed by
             help.

          PerfCounter.print
             Print the performance  counters  available  on  the  targeted  Java
             process(es).  The  list  of  performance counters may vary with the
             Java process.

          -f file
             Read commands from file  and  invoke  them  on  the  targeted  Java
             process(es).  In  file,  each  command  must be written on a single
             line. Lines starting with # are ignored. Processing  of  file  ends
             when all lines have been invoked or when a line containing the stop
             keyword is read.
