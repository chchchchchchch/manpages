DESCRIPTION
       The jconsole command launches a graphical console tool that enables you
       to monitor and manage Java applications and virtual machines on a local
       or remote machine.

       On Windows, jconsole does not associate with a console window. It will,
       however, display a dialog box with error information if the jconsole com&#8208;
       mand fails for some reason.

          -pluginpath plugins
             Specify a list of directories or JAR files which are searched for
             JConsole plugins. The plugins path should contain a provider-con&#8208;
