NAME
       jfs_tune - adjust tunable file system parameters on JFS


SYNOPSIS
       jfs_tune [options] device


DESCRIPTION
       jfs_tune  adjusts tunable parameters on a Linux JFS file system or exter&#8208;
       nal journal.  jfs_tune must be run as root.


       device is the special file name corresponding to the actual device  (e.g.
       /dev/hdb1)  on  which  a JFS file system or JFS external journal has been
       created.


OPTIONS
       -J device=external-journal
              Attach the JFS external journal located on external-journal to the
              JFS file system on device.

              The external journal must already have been created using the com&#8208;
              mand.  More than one file system may share the same external jour&#8208;
              nal.

              mkfs.jfs -J journal_dev external-journal

              Attach  the  external journal to the file system by using the com&#8208;
              mand

              jfs_tune -J device=external-journal device

              Instead of specifying a device name directly, external-journal can
              also be specified by either LABEL=label or UUID=UUID (Use jfs_tune
              -l device to display a journal device&apos;s volume label and UUID.)


       -l     List the contents of the  JFS  file  system  or  external  journal
              superblock that resides on device.


       -L volume-label
              Set  the  volume label of the JFS file system or external journal.
              JFS labels can be at most 16 characters long; if  volume-label  is
              longer  than  16 characters, jfs_tune will truncate it and print a
              warning.  The volume label can be used by mount(8),  fsck(8),  and
              /etc/fstab(5)  (and  possibly  others)  by  specifying  LABEL=vol&#8208;
              ume_label instead of a block special device name like /dev/hda5.


       -U UUID
              Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the file system or
              external  journal  device  to  UUID.   The format of the UUID is a
              series  of  hex  digits   separated   by   hyphens,   like   this:
              &quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;.   The  UUID  parameter may
              also be one of the following:

                   clear  clear the file system UUID

                   random generate a new randomly-generated UUID
&#12;                   time   generate a new time-based UUID

              The UUID may be used by mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5)  (and
              possibly  others)  by specifying UUID=uuid instead of a block spe&#8208;
              cial device name like /dev/hda1.

              See uuidgen(8) for more information.


       -V     Print version information and exit (regardless of any other chosen
              options).


EXAMPLES
       Set  a  randomly-generated UUID for the JFS file system on the 3rd parti&#8208;
       tion of the 2nd hard disk, and view the resultant superblock:

              jfs_tune -l -U random /dev/hdb3

       Attach an already existing external journal on a device labeled JFSLog to
       a JFS file system on /dev/hda8:

              jfs_tune -J device=LABEL=JFSLog /dev/hda8
