Name
       jhat - Java Heap Analysis Tool

SYNOPSIS
       jhat [ options ] &lt;heap-dump-file&gt;



PARAMETERS
          options
             Options, if used, should follow immediately after the command name.

          heap-dump-file
             Java binary heap dump file to be browsed. For a dump file that con&#8208;
             tains multiple heap dumps, you may specify which dump in  the  file
             by appending &quot;#&lt;number&gt; to the file name, i.e. &quot;foo.hprof#3&quot;.


DESCRIPTION
       The  jhat  command parses a java heap dump file and launches a webserver.
       jhat enables you to browse heap dumps  using  your  favorite  webbrowser.
       jhat  supports  pre-designed  queries  (such  as &apos;show all instances of a
       known class &quot;Foo&quot;&apos;) as well as OQL (Object Query Language) -  a  SQL-like
       query language to query heap dumps. Help on OQL is available from the OQL
       help page shown by jhat. With the default port, OQL help is available  at
       http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/

       There are several ways to generate a java heap dump:

          o Use jmap(1) -dump option to obtain a heap dump at runtime;

          o Use jconsole(1) option to obtain a heap dump via HotSpotDiagnos&#8208;
            ticMXBean @
            http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/exten&#8208;
            sion/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.html at runtime;

          o Heap dump will be generated when OutOfMemoryError is thrown by spec&#8208;
            ifying -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError VM option;

          o Use hprof @
            http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Program&#8208;
            ming/HPROF.html.


       NOTE: This tool is experimental and may not be available in future ver&#8208;
       sions of the JDK.

OPTIONS
          -stack false/true
             Turn off tracking object allocation call stack. Note that if allo&#8208;
             cation site information is not available in the heap dump, you have
             to set this flag to false. Default is true.

          -refs false/true
             Turn off tracking of references to objects. Default is true. By
             default, back pointers (objects pointing to a given object a.k.a
             referrers or in-coming references) are calculated for all objects
             in the heap.

          -port port-number
             Set the port for the jhat&apos;s HTTP server. Default is 7000.
&#12;          -exclude exclude-file
             Specify a file that lists data members that should be excluded from
             the &quot;reachable objects&quot; query. For example, if the file lists
             java.lang.String.value, then, whenever list of objects reachable
             from a specific object &quot;o&quot; are calculated, reference paths involv&#8208;
             ing java.lang.String.value field will not considered.

          -baseline baseline-dump-file
             Specify a baseline heap dump. Objects in both heap dumps with the
             same object ID will be marked as not being &quot;new&quot;. Other objects
             will be marked as &quot;new&quot;. This is useful while comparing two differ&#8208;
             ent heap dumps.

          -debug int
             Set debug level for this tool. 0 means no debug output. Set higher
             values for more verbose modes.

          -version
             Report version number and exit.

          -h Output help message and exit.

          -help
             Output help message and exit.

          -J&lt;flag&gt;
             Pass &lt;flag&gt; to the Java virtual machine on which jhat is run. For
             example, -J-Xmx512m to use a maximum heap size of 512MB.
