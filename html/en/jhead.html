JHEAD(1)                                                                JHEAD(1)



NAME
       jhead - Digicam JPEG Exif header manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       jhead [ options ] [ file...  ]


DESCRIPTION
       jhead is used to display and manipulate data contained in the Exif header
       of JPEG images from digital cameras.  By default, jhead displays the more
       useful camera settings from the file in a user-friendly format.

       jhead  can  also be used to manipulate some aspects of the image relating
       to JPEG and Exif headers,  such  as  changing  the  internal  timestamps,
       removing  the  thumbnail,  or  transferring Exif headers back into edited
       images after graphical editors deleted the Exif header.  jhead  can  also
       be  used to launch other programs, similar in style to the UNIX find com&#8208;
       mand, but much simpler.



GENERAL METADATA OPTIONS
       -te file
              Transplant Exif header from a JPEG (with Exif header) in file into
              the  image that is manipulated.  This option is useful if you like
              to edit the photos but still want the Exif header on your  photos.
              As most photo editing programs will wipe out the Exif header, this
              option can be used to re-copy them back from original copies after
              editing the photos.


              This  feature has an interesting &apos;relative path&apos; option for speci&#8208;
              fying the thumbnail name.  Whenever the &lt;name&gt; contains the  char&#8208;
              acters &apos;&amp;i&apos;, will substitute the original  filename for this name.
              This allows creating a jhead &apos;relative name&apos; when  doing  a  whole
              batch  of files. For example, the incantation:

              jhead -te &quot;originals/&amp;i&quot; *.jpg

              would transfer the exif header for each .jpg file in the originals
              directory by the same name, Both Win32 and most Unix shells  treat
              the  &apos;&amp;&apos;  character  in  a  special way, so you have to put quotes
              around that command line option for the &apos;&amp;&apos; to even be  passed  to
              the program.


       -dc    Delete  comment field from the JPEG header.  Note that the comment
              is not part of the Exif header.

       -de    Delete the Exif header entirely.  Leaves other  metadata  sections
              intact.

       -di    Delete  the  IPTC section, if present.  Leaves other metadata sec&#8208;
              tions intact.

       -dx    Delete the XMP section, if present.  Leaves  other  metadata  sec&#8208;
              tions intact.

       -du    Delete sections of jpeg that are not Exif, not comment, and other&#8208;
              wise not contributing to the image either - such as data that pho&#8208;
              toshop might leave in the image.
&#12;       -purejpg
              Delete  all  JPEG sections that aren&apos;t necessary for rendering the
              image.  Strips any metadata that  various  applications  may  have
              left in the image.  A combination of the -de -dc and -du options.

       -mkexif
              Creates  minimal  exif header. Exif header contains date/time, and
              empty thumbnail  fields  only.  Date/time  set  to  file  time  by
              default.  Use with -rgt option if you want the exif header to con&#8208;
              tain a thumbnail. Note that exif header creation is  very  limited
              at  this time, and no other fields can be added to the exif header
              this way.

       -ce    Edit the JPEG header comment field (note, this  comment  field  is
              outside  the  Exif  structure and can be part of Exif and non Exif
              style JPEG images).

              A temporary file containing the comment is created and a text edi&#8208;
              tor  is launched to edit the file.  The editor is specified in the
              EDITOR environment variable.  If none is specified notepad  or  vi
              are  used  under  Windows and Unix respectively.  After the editor
              exits, the data is transferred back into the image, and the tempo&#8208;
              rary file deleted.

       -cs file
              Save comment section to a file

       -ci file
              Replace comment with text from file

       -cl string
              Replace comment with specified string from command line file


DATE / TIME MANIPULATION OPTIONS
       -ft    Sets  the  file&apos;s  system time stamp to what is stored in the Exif
              header.

       -dsft  Sets the Exif timestamp to the file&apos;s timestamp. Requires an  Exif
              header to pre-exist. Use -mkexif option to create one if needed.

       -n[format_string]
              This  option  causes  files to be renamed and/ or mmoved using the
              date information from the Exif  header  &quot;DateTimeOriginal&quot;  field.
              If  the file is not an Exif file, or the DateTimeOriginal does not
              contain a valid value, the file date  is  used.   Renaming  is  by
              default restricted to files whose names consist largely of digits.
              This effectively restricts renaming to files that have not already
              been  manually renamed, as the default sequential names from digi&#8208;
              tal cameras consist largely of digits.  Use the -n option to force
              renaming  of all files.  If the new name contains a &apos;/&apos;, this will
              be interpreted as a new path, and the file will be  moved  accord&#8208;
              ingly.

              If the format_string is omitted, the file will be renamed to MMDD-
              HHMMSS.  Note that this scheme doesn&apos;t include the year  (I  never
              have photos from different years together anyway).

              If  a format_string is provided, it will be passed to the strftime
              function as the format string.  In addition, if the format  string
              contains  &apos;%f&apos;, this will substitute the original name of the file
              (minus extension).  &apos;%i&apos; will substitute a sequence number.  Lead&#8208;
              ing zeros can be specified like with printf - i.e. &apos;%04i&apos; pads the
              number to 4 digits using leading zeros.

              If the name includes &apos;/&apos;, this is interpreted as a  new  path  for
              the  file.   If the new path does not exist, the path will be cre&#8208;
              ated.

              If the target name already exists, the name will be appended  with
              &quot;a&quot;,  &quot;b&quot;,  &quot;c&quot;, etc, unless the name ends with a letter, in which
              case it will be appended with &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, etc.

              This feature is especially useful if more than one digital  camera
              was  used  to  take  pictures  of an event.  By renaming them to a
              scheme according to date, they will automatically appear in  order
              of taking in most directory listings and image browsers.  Alterna&#8208;
              tively, if your image browser supports listing by file  time,  you
              can  use the -ft option to set the file time to the time the photo
              was taken.

              Some of the more useful arguments for strftime are:

              %H Hour in 24-hour format (00 - 23)
              %j Day of year as decimal number (001 - 366)
              %m Month as decimal number (01 - 12)
              %M Minute as decimal number (00 - 59)
              %S Second as decimal number (00 - 59)
              %w Weekday as decimal number (0 - 6; Sunday is 0)
              %y Year without century, as decimal number (00 - 99)
              %Y Year with century, as decimal number

              Example:

              jhead -n%Y%m%d-%H%M%S *.jpg

              This will rename files matched  by  *.jpg  in  the  format  YYYYM&#8208;
              MDD-HHMMSS

              For  a full listing of strftime arguments, look up the strftime in
              them man pages.  Note that some arguments to the strftime function
              (not listed here) produce strings with characters such as &apos;:&apos; that
              may not be valid as part of a filename on some systems.


       -ta&lt;+|-&gt;&lt;timediff&gt;
              Adjust time stored in the Exif header by h:mm  backwards  or  for&#8208;
              wards.   Useful when having taken pictures with the wrong time set
              on the camera, such as after travelling across time zones, or when
              daylight savings time has changed.

              This  option  changes  all  Date/time  fields  in the exif header,
              including &quot;DateTimeOriginal&quot; (tag 0x9003) and  &quot;DateTimeDigitized&quot;
              (tag 0x9004).

       -da&lt;newdate&gt;-&lt;olddate&gt;

              Works  like -ta, but for specifying large date offsets, to be used
              when fixing dates from cameras where the date was set incorrectly,
              such as having date and time reset by battery removal on some cam&#8208;
              eras

              Because different months and years have different numbers of  days
              in  them,  a  simple  offset for months, days, years would lead to
              unexpected results at times.  The time offset is thus specified as
              a  difference  between  two  dates,  so  that jhead can figure out
              exactly how many days the  timestamp  needs  to  be  adjusted  by,
              including leap years and daylight savings time changes.  The dates
              are specified as yyyy:mm:dd.  For sub-day adjustments, a  time  of
              day  can  also  be  included,  by  specifying  yyyy:nn:dd/hh:mm or
              yyyy:mm:dd/hh:mm:ss
&#12;              Examples:

              Year on camera was set to 2005 instead of 2004 for pictures  taken
              in April
              jhead -da2004:03:01-2005:03:01

              Default   camera  date  is  2002:01:01,  and  date  was  reset  on
              2005:05:29 at 11:21 am
              jhead -da2005:05:29/11:21-2002:01:01

       -ts    Sets the time stored in the Exif header to what  is  specified  on
              the command line.  Time must be specified as: yyyy:mm:dd-hh:mm:ss

       -ds    Sets  the  date  stored in the Exif header to what is specified on
              the command line.  Can be used to set date, just year  and  month,
              or just year.  Date is specified as: yyyy:mm:dd, yyyy:mm, or yyyy


THUMBNAIL MANIPULATION OPTIONS
       -dt    Delete  thumbnails from the Exif header, but leave the interesting
              parts intact.  This option truncates the thumbnail from  the  Exif
              header,  provided  that the thumbnail is the last part of the Exif
              header (which so far as I know is always the case).  Exif  headers
              have  a built-in thumbnail, which typically occupies around 10k of
              space.  This thumbnail is used by digital cameras.  Windows XP may
              also  use this thumbnail if present (but it doesn&apos;t need it).  The
              thumbnails are too small to use even full screen on the  digicam&apos;s
              LCD.   I have not encountered any adverse side effects of deleting
              the thumbnails, even from the software provided with my old  Olym&#8208;
              pus digicam.  Use with caution.


       -st file
              Save the integral thumbnail to file The thumbnail lives inside the
              Exif header, and is a very low-res JPEG image.  Note  that  making
              any  changes  to a photo, except for with some programs, generally
              wipes out the Exif header and with it the thumbnail.

              The thumbnail is too low res to really use for very much.

              This feature has an interesting &apos;relative path&apos; option for  speci&#8208;
              fying the thumbnail name.  Whenever the name for file contains the
              characters  &apos;&amp;i&apos;, jhead will substitute the original filename  for
              this  name.   This  allows creating a &apos;relative name&apos; when doing a
              whole batch of files.  For example, the incantation:

              jhead -st &quot;thumbnails/&amp;i&quot; *.jpg

              would create a thumbnail for each  .jpg  file  in  the  thumbnails
              directory  by  the same name, (provided that the thumbnails direc&#8208;
              tory exists, of course).  Both Win32 and  UNIX  shells  treat  the
              &apos;&amp;&apos;character  in  a  special way, so you have to put quotes around
              that command line option for the &apos;&amp;&apos; to even be passed to the pro&#8208;
              gram.

              If  a  &apos;-&apos; is specified for the output file, the thumbnail is sent
              to stdout. (UNIX build only)


       -rt    Replace thumbnails from the Exif header.  This only works  if  the
              exif  header already contains a thumbnail, and the thumbnail is at
              the end of the header (both always the case if the photo came from
              a digital camera)

       -rgt size
              Regenerate  exif  thumbnail.   &apos;size&apos;  specifies maximum height or
              width of thumbnail.  Relies on &apos;mogrify&apos; program  (from  ImageMag&#8208;
              ick)  to  regenerate  the thumbnail.  This only works if the image
              already contains a thumbnail.


ROTATION OPTIONS
       -autorot
              Using the &apos;Orientation&apos; tag of the Exif header, rotate  the  image
              so  that  it  is upright.  The program jpegtran is used to perform
              the rotation. This program is present in most Linux distributions.
              For  windows,  you  need to get a copy of it.  After rotation, the
              orientation tag of the Exif header is set to &apos;1&apos; (normal  orienta&#8208;
              tion).   The  thumbnail  is also rotated. Other fields of the Exif
              header,  including  dimensions  are  untouched,   but   the   JPEG
              height/width are adjusted.  This feature is especially useful with
              newer Canon cameras, that set the  orientation  tag  automatically
              using a gravity sensor.

       -norot Clears  the rotation field in the Exif header without altering the
              image.  Useful if  the  images  were  previously  rotated  without
              clearing  the  Exif rotation tag, as some image browsers will auto
              rotate images when the rotation tag is set.  Sometimes, thumbnails
              and rotation  tags can get very out of sync from manipulation with
              various tools.  To reset it all use -norot with -rgt to clear this
              out.


OUTPUT VERBOSITY CONTROL
       -h     Displays summary of command line options.

       -v     Makes  the program even more verbose than it already is.  Like DOS
              programs, and unlike UNIX programs, Jhead  gives  feedback  as  to
              what it is doing, even when nothing goes wrong.  Windows user that
              I am, when something doesn&apos;t give me feedback for  20  seconds,  I
              assume its crashed.

       -q     No output on success, more like Unix programs.

       -V     Print  version  info and compilation date.  -exifmap Show a map of
              the bytes in the exif header. Useful when analyzing  strange  exif
              headers, not of much use to non software developers.

       -se    Suppress error messages relating to corrupt Exif header structure.

       -c     Concise  output.  This causes picture info to be summarized on one
              line instead of several.  Useful for grep-ing through  images,  as
              well as importing into spread sheets (data is space delimited with
              quotes as text qualifier).


FILE MATCHING OPTIONS
       -model Restricts processing of files to  those  whose  camera  model,  as
              indicated  by  the  Exif image information, contains the substring
              specified in the argument after &apos;-model&apos;.  For example,  the  fol&#8208;
              lowing command will list only images that are from an S100 camera:

              jhead -model S100 *.jpg

              I use this option to restrict my JPEG recompensing to those images
              that came from my Canon S100 digicam, (see the -cmd option).

       -exonly
              Skip all files that don&apos;t have an Exif  header.   Photos  straight
              from  a  digital  camera  have  an Exif header, whereas many photo
              manipulation tools discard the Exif header.

       -cmd   Executes the specified command on each JPEG file to be processed.
&#12;              The Exif section of each file is read before running the  command,
              and reinserted after the command finishes.

              The  specified  command  invoked  separately for each JPEG that is
              processed, even if multiple files are specified (explicitly or  by
              wild card).

              Example use:

              Having a whole directory of photos from my S100, I run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

              jhead -cmd &quot;mogrify -quality 80 &amp;i&quot; -model S100 *.jpg
              jhead -cmd &quot;jpegtran -progressive &amp;i &gt; &amp;o&quot; *.jpg

              The first command mogrifies all JPEGs in the  tree  that  indicate
              that  they are from a Canon S100 in their Exif header to 80% qual&#8208;
              ity at the same resolution.  This is a &apos;lossy&apos; process, so I  only
              run  it  on  files  that are from the Canon, and only run it once.
              The next command then takes a JPEGs and converts them to  progres&#8208;
              sive  JPEGs.   The  result is the same images, with no discernible
              differences, stored in half the space.  This produces  substantial
              savings on some cameras.

BUGS
       After jhead runs a program to rotate or resize an image, the image dimen&#8208;
       sions and thumbnail in the Exif header are not adjusted.

       Modifying of Exif header data is very limited, as Jhead  internally  only
       has  a  read only implementation of the file system contained in the Exif
       header.  For example, there is no way to replace the  thumbnail  or  edit
       the Exif comment in the Exif header.  There is also no way to create min&#8208;
       imal exif headers.

       Some Canon digital SLR cameras fail to adjust the effective sensor  reso&#8208;
       lution  when  shooting  at  less  than  full resolution, causing jhead to
       incorrectly miscalculate the  sensor  width  and  35mm  equivalent  focal
       length.   The  same can result from resizing photos with Photoshop, which
       will manipulate parts of the exif header.  This is often  reported  as  a
       bug in Jhead, but Jhead can&apos;t do much about incorrect data.
