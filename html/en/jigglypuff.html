jigglypuff(6x)                 XScreenSaver manual                jigglypuff(6x)



NAME
       jigglypuff - save your screen by tormenting your eyes.

SYNOPSIS
       jigglypuff  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual]  [-window]
       [-root] [-delay number] [-cycles number] [-wireframe] [-fps] [-color col&#8208;
       orspec]  [-spooky]  [-complexity  n]  [-speed  n] [-spherism n] [-hold n]
       [-distance n] [-damping n]

DESCRIPTION
       This draws all manners of obscene, spastic,  puffy,  vaguely  ball-shaped
       objects orbiting lazily about the screen, with a dizzying array of mostly
       pointless options.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  20000  (0.02  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid. Default: render solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -tetra | -no-tetra
               Whether  to  start  the  shape  in the form of a tetrahedron. The
               default is to start as a sphere.

       -color colorspec
               Available options for colorspec are: cycle, flowerbox, clownpuke,
               chrome  and  #xxxxxx  (i.e an (old-style) X color specification.)
               Default: cycle

       -spooky n
               This option controls a kind of  interesting  effect  obtained  by
               using  unnormalized  normal vectors (how&apos;s that for an oxymoron?)
               in OpenGL.  A value of zero disables  the  effect.  Other  values
               vary  the  lengths  of the normals proportionally.  Okay, so it&apos;s
               not very spooky. Sue me.  Default: 0

       -complexity n
               Valid options are 1, 2, and 3.  Everything  else  is  treated  as
               though  it were 2, which is the default. This controls the number
               of polygons in the &apos;thing&apos;. A value of 1  yields  1024,  and  the
               values go up in powers of 4. (i.e. 4096, 16384.)
                note:  There  is an inherent lack of stability at lower complex&#8208;
               ity, which can cause the shape to devolve  into  a  &apos;flying  sno&#8208;
               trag&apos;.

       -speed n
               Controls how fast the blob moves around the screen. Default: 500.

       -spherism, -hold, -distance, -damping
               These  options  control the &apos;jigglyness&apos;. The best way to explain
               these is to explain how jigglypuff works. Basically, the shape is
               a  tetrahedron whose faces are subdivided into a number of trian&#8208;
               gles, forming a mesh.  Each of the vertices of the mesh  has  two
               different  forces applied to it: one proportional to its distance
               from the surface of a sphere, and one proportional to the differ&#8208;
               ence  of  the  distance to each of its neighbors in the mesh to a
               given ideal distance. In short, one tries to move the points into
               the  configuration  of a sphere, and the other tries to push them
               back into a tetrahedron. The catch is that the points have  iner&#8208;
               tia, so they always overshoot their target, and hence they oscil&#8208;
               late. The magnitudes of the  two  forces  is  controlled  by  the
               options  &apos;spherism&apos; and &#180;hold&apos;; &apos;distance&apos; specifies the distance
               the vertices seek to keep from their neighbors, with  500  corre&#8208;
               sponding  to the size of the start tetrahedron.  e.g. if you were
               to give the options &apos;-tetra -spherism 0 -distance 500&apos;, you would
               end  up  with a stable tetrahedron. The &apos;damping&apos; option can help
               to keep the blob from collapsing  or  flying  apart.  The  option
               specifies  the  speed at which damping starts, hence lower values
               mean more damping.  Defaults: spherism: 75; hold: 800;  distance:
               100; damping: 500.

       -random Probably the only parameter you&apos;l ever need. Overrides almost all
               of the parameters with random values. The  values  affected  are:
               speed,  spherism,  hold,  distance, damping, spooky, color, wire&#8208;
               frame and tetra.  Default: off

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
