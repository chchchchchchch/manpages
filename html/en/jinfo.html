Name
       jinfo - Configuration Info

SYNOPSIS
       jinfo [ option ] pid
       jinfo [ option ] executable core
       jinfo [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP


PARAMETERS
          option
             Options  are  mutually  exclusive.  Option,  if used, should follow
             immediately after the command name.


          pid
             process id for which the configuration info is to be  printed.  The
             process  must  be  a  Java process. To get a list of Java processes
             running on a machine, jps(1) may be used.


          executable
             Java executable from which the core dump was produced.


          core
             core file for which the configuration info is to be printed.


          remote-hostname-or-IP
             remote debug server&apos;s (see jsadebugd(1)) hostname or IP address.


          server-id
             optional unique id, if multiple debug servers are  running  on  the
             same remote host.


DESCRIPTION
       jinfo  prints  Java configuration information for a given Java process or
       core file or a remote debug server.  Configuration  information  includes
       Java  System  properties  and Java virtual machine command line flags. If
       the given process is running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify  the
       -J-d64 option, e.g.:
       jinfo -J-d64 -sysprops pid

       NOTE  -  This  utility  is unsupported and may or may not be available in
       future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems where  dbgeng.dll  is  not
       present, &apos;Debugging Tools For Windows&apos; need to be installed to have these
       tools working. Also, PATH environment variable should contain  the  loca&#8208;
       tion of jvm.dll used by the target process or the location from which the
       Crash Dump file was produced.

       For example, set PATH=&lt;jdk&gt;\jre\bin\client;%PATH%

OPTIONS
          &lt;no option&gt;
             prints both command line flags as well as System  properties  name,
             value pairs.

          -flag name
             prints the name and value of the given command line flag.
&#12;          -flag [+|-]name
             enables or disables the given boolean command line flag.

          -flag name=value
             sets the given command line flag to the specified value.

          -flags
             prints command line flags passed to the JVM. pairs.

          -sysprops
             prints Java System properties as name, value pairs.

          -h prints a help message

          -help
             prints a help message
