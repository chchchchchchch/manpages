NAME
       jitsi - the Java VoIP and Instant Messaging client

SYNOPSIS
       jitsi [options] [uri-to-call]

DESCRIPTION
       Jitsi  is  an  audio/video Internet phone and instant messenger that sup&#8208;
       ports some of the most popular instant messaging and telephony  protocols
       such  as  SIP,  Jabber,  AIM/ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger, Bonjour, IRC and
       soon others like IAX.

       An optional uri-to-call expression can be specified to start a call  from
       the command-line. If Jitsi is already running then the call is handled by
       the running application, except when it is explicitly told to allow  mul&#8208;
       tiple instance launch.
