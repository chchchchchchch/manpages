NAME
       joy2key - Emulate keyboard events using a Joystick

SYNOPSIS
       joy2key Usage: joy2key [&quot;Window Name&quot;]
              [ -rawconsole ]
              [ -terminal ]
              [ -X ]
              [ -axis [(axis0) low hi] [(axis1) low hi]  ...]
              [ -thresh [(axis0) low hi] [(axis1) low hi]  ...]
              [ -buttons [(button0)] [(button1)] [(button2)] ...]
              [ -dev {/dev/input/js0} ]
              [ -rcfile {.joy2keyrc} ]
              [ -config {no default} ]
              [ -autorepeat {(freq) 5} ]
              [ -deadzone {(percent) 50} ]

       note: [] denotes `optional&apos; option or argument,
             () hints at the wanted arguments for options
             {} denotes default (compiled-in) parameters

       (note: defaults may have been changed by editing joy2key.c)

DESCRIPTION
       joy2key  monitors  the  joystick (normally /dev/input/js0) and sends key&#8208;
       board events to an X window, terminal, or raw console.  In the case of X,
       xwininfo(1) is used to retrive the window ID, which should not be a prob&#8208;
       lem as this is a standard utility in most X11 distributions.  To find the
       symbolic  name of a particular key, see include/X11/keysymdef.h.  In ter&#8208;
       minal mode, joy2key sends the ascii character given on the  command  line
       (that  is,  &quot;joy2key  -buttons a&quot; means send lowercase &apos;a&apos; when the first
       joystick button is pushed).  In raw console mode, please consult the doc&#8208;
       ument  &quot;rawscancodes&quot;  included in this distribution for the proper scan&#8208;
       codes.

   Options
       -X     Send X events.  May be compiled out of your copy of joy2key.

       -rawconsole
              For SVGALIB and similar programs that  put  the  keyboard  in  raw
              mode.   Sends  scancodes.   May  be  compiled  out of your copy of
              joy2key.

       -terminal
              Send ascii characters.  May  be  compiled  out  of  your  copy  of
              joy2key.

       -axis  Specifies  actions  to  send when passing low/high values for each
              axis.  Specified in pairs, from axis0 ... axisN, that  is,  the  X
              axis  is  axis0,  then the Y axis (axis1), then if you have a joy&#8208;
              stick hat that may be axis 2 and 3, etc.  To figure out which axis
              is  which,  use  the  jstest  program that comes with the joystick
              driver.

       -buttons
              Similar to -arrows, but for buttons.  Goes from button0  ...  but&#8208;
              tonN, specifying key to send for each button on joystick.  Use the
              jstest program to determine the numbering for each button.

       -thresh
              Specifies low/high thresholds to use (i.e. at  what  point  moving
              the stick or pressing the gamepad triggers an event) in pairs, for
              each joystick axis.

       -dev   Specifies joystick device to use.  Defaults /dev/input/js0  (first
              joystick)

       -autorepeat
              Turns  on and optionally specifies autorepeat frequency, i.e.  the
              number of times per second a button which is  held  down  will  be
              repeated.

       -deadzone
              Controls sensitivity when manually calibrating.

       -rcfile
              Sets the rc file to look in.

       -config
              Reads in a config in an rc file.

FILES
       /dev/js[01]  The joystick driver.  Must be installed for joy2key to work.
       Joy2key only supports versions 1.0+ of the joystick driver.   Older  ver&#8208;
       sions  of  joy2key  use  the 0.8.0 joystick driver.  If for some reason a
       1.0+ joystick driver does not work for you, use joy2key 1.2.

       The Linux joystick driver is available at

       http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/

       ~/.joy2keyrc Rc file searched for commands in -config.

BUGS
       I don&apos;t like writing man pages, so this man page may be buggy :)
