joystick_getaxis(3)            Svgalib User Manual           joystick_getaxis(3)



NAME
       joystick_getaxis,  joystick_getbutton - query the current state of a joy&#8208;
       stick.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgajoystick.h&gt;

       char joystick_getaxis(int joydev, int a);
       char joystick_getbutton(int joydev, int b);


DESCRIPTION
       These functions query the current state of the joystick joydev.  Actually
       this  is  the state found during the last call to joystick_update(3) with
       the default joystick event handler active.

       joystick_getaxis(joydev, a) return the current state of  the  given  axis
       (usually  it  is  x  - 0, y - 1, z - 1, ...)  in range -128 .. 127.  Some
       effort is made such that the center position is close to 0.

       Note that especially the version 0.*  protocol  joystick  calibration  is
       very  bad.  You  won&apos;t usually see the extrem values on the extreme posi&#8208;
       tion. Also, the center position will be close to zero but  often  not  be
       exactly  zero and return values will also vary slightly from call to call
       even when the user did not move the joystick.

       joystick_getbutton(joydev, b) returns the state of a button. It returns 1
       for  pressed  button  and 0 else. Note that no hardware checks for button
       clicks. The  button  press  is  only  detected  during  a  call  to  joy&#8208;
       stick_update(3) (at least in the 0.* protocol).

       NOTE: The functions simply return the data passed to the default joystick
       event handler!

       For your convenience, the following stortcuts have  been  established  by
       use of the preprocessor:

              joystick_button1(i) for joystick_getbutton(i, 0).
              joystick_button2(i) for joystick_getbutton(i, 1).
              joystick_button3(i) for joystick_getbutton(i, 2).
              joystick_button4(i) for joystick_getbutton(i, 3).

              joystick_x(i) for joystick_getaxis(i, 0).
              joystick_y(i) for joystick_getaxis(i, 1).
              joystick_z(i) for joystick_getaxis(i, 2).

              joystick_getb1() for joystick_getbutton(0, 0).
              joystick_getb2() for joystick_getbutton(0, 1).
              joystick_getb3() for joystick_getbutton(0, 2).
              joystick_getb4() for joystick_getbutton(0, 3).

              joystick_getx() for joystick_getaxis(0, 0).
              joystick_gety() for joystick_getaxis(0, 1).
              joystick_getz() for joystick_getaxis(0, 2).


CAVEATS
       This  function is only available in ELF versions of svgalib. Due to back&#8208;
       wards compatibility issues it cannot be used with shared a.out libs.
