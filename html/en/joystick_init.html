joystick_init(3)               Svgalib User Manual              joystick_init(3)



NAME
       joystick_init - open a joystick

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgajoystick.h&gt;
       typedef void (*__joystick_output) (const char *msg);

       int joystick_init(int joydev, __joystick_output jo);


DESCRIPTION
       This  function  opens  a joystick device. A negative value is returned on
       failure, otherwise the joystick  was  initialized.   svgalib(7)  supports
       several  joysticks. The corresponding device node names can be configured
       in libvga.config(5).

       The joydev parameter indicates which joystick is to be initialized. As of
       this  writing svgalib support up to four joysticks joydev = 0 to joydev =
       3, although I&apos;m not aware of hardware and  kernel  drivers  which  handle
       more than joysticks 0 and 1.

       It  is strongly encouraged that your program allows the user to calibrate
       the joystick. This is controlled by the jo parameter. If it is  NULL,  no
       calibration   is  performed.  Otherwise,  calibration  is  performed  and
       instructions are printed to the user by  calling  the  user  supplied  jo
       function.  It is the responsibility of this function to print the NUL and
       NL terminated message pointed to by msg to the user.  The  message  might
       contain embedded NL characters and will not extend 256 characters includ&#8208;
       ing the terminating NUL.

       Usually an fputs(msg, stdout); followed by fflush(stdout); will  do,  but
       for your convenience you can perform the same by passing JOY_CALIB_STDOUT
       for jo.  gl_printf(3) is well suited for this job as  well.  However,  it
       needs  some font setup first, so we do not provide a special preprocessor
       constant.

       It is valid to initialize an already initialized  joystick.  This  allows
       you  to  recalibrate  the joystick at any time. The module supports older
       version 0.* as well as newer version 1.* joystick device protocols.


GENERAL CONCEPT
       The joystick module is basically independent from the  rest  of  svgalib.
       You  can easily use it in text mode only (but why would you do that?). If
       used in a graphics mode, however, it will release  the  joystick  devices
       upon  a VC switch s.t. several applications can share joysticks. Unfortu&#8208;
       nately this does not work during  joystick  calibration.  Therefore,  you
       should lock the VC with vga_lockvc(3) while calibrating in graphics mode.

       Also,  when  using  joysticks  in  textmode only, svgalib won&apos;t detect VC
       switches and joysticks cannot be shared among applications.

       joystick_close(3) releases opened joysticks.

       joystick_update(3) queries the joysticks for position changes. Note  that
       you  must  busy wait for joystick events.  At least the older version 0.*
       joystick devices do not allow to sleep and get informed  about  new  joy&#8208;
       stick  events. Basically, this is a PC hardware issue in the first place.
       Therefore, vga_waitevent(3) does not know about joysticks. To use it, you
       must  make  it timeout after a few ms and actively query the joystick for
       updates.
&#12;       By default a handler deals with the joystick events.  joystick_getaxis(3)
       and  joystick_getbutton(3)  plus several convenience macros joystick_but&#8208;
       ton1|2|3|4, joystick_getb1|2|3|4, joystick_x|y|z,  and  joystick_getx|y|z
       allow  to  query the current status of the joystick (as it was determined
       during the last joystick_update() call).

       The functions joystick_getnumaxes(3) and joystick_getnumbuttons(3)  query
       the number of axes and buttons of a joystick.

       Finally, you can (un)register an own handler for the joystick events with
       joystick_sethandler(3) and joystick_setdefaulthandler(3)

       The  simple  text  demo  joytest(6)  and  the  more   complex   graphical
       mjoytest(6)  demo  show  the  use  of  the  joystick package in some more
       detail.


CAVEATS
       This function is only available in ELF versions of svgalib. Due to  back&#8208;
       wards compatibility issues it cannot be used with shared a.out libs.

       Certain  game  ports  seem to be unable to detect missing joysticks prop&#8208;
       erly.  (This might also be a linux device driver issue). Anyway, is using
       the  joystick  interface, allow a user of your application to specify the
       number of joysticks to be used as well as to bail out the joystick  cali&#8208;
       bration (when he is not able to press a button on a missing joystick).

       Usually &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C works, but you should not rely too much on it, as it can
       be disabled. As a general guideline, maybe try to open and calibrate joy&#8208;
       sticks while still in textmode. &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C will usually still work then. If
       this succeeds, you may assume a  joystick  is  there  for  any  following
       recalibrations in graphics mode.

       The  svgalib  joystick  handler  was  mostly  done  by  Daniel Engstr\&quot;om
       &lt;daniel.engstrom@riksnett.no&gt;.  Multiple joystick, VC  switching  support
       and  code to glue it into svgalib by Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. Part of the code is based on code from C.  Smith  and  Vojtech
       Pavlik.
