joystick_sethandler(3)         Svgalib User Manual        joystick_sethandler(3)



NAME
       joystick_sethandler,  joystick_setdefaulthandler - set the joystick event
       handler.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgajoystick.h&gt;
       typedef void (*__joystick_handler) (int event, int  number,  char  value,
       int joydev);

       void joystick_sethandler(int joydev, __joystick_handler jh);
       void joystick_setdefaulthandler(int joydev);


DESCRIPTION
       By default, each call to joystick_init(3) enables the default handler for
       the opened joystick. This handler maintains a state table  which  can  be
       read  by  the  joystick_getaxis(3),  joystick_getbutton(3), joystick_but&#8208;
       ton1|2|3|4(3),  joystick_getb1|2|3|4(3),   joystick_x|y|z(3)   and   joy&#8208;
       stick_getx|y|z(3) functions.

       If you define an own handler, the following parameters are passed:


              event one of the following values:

                     JOY_EVENTBUTTONDOWN a button was pressed.

                     JOY_EVENTBUTTONUP a button was released.

                     JOY_EVENTAXIS the joystick position was changed.


                     All other values are reserved for future use.


              number identifies the button or axis to which this event belongs.


              value  for  axis  events the new position in range -128 .. 127.See
                     joystick_getaxis(3) for further comments on the range.


              joydev identifies the joystick affected (this allows  to  use  one
                     handler for many joysticks).

       joydev  =  -1  modifies  the event handler of all currently open joystick
       devices.


CAVEATS
       This function is only available in ELF versions of svgalib. Due to  back&#8208;
       wards compatibility issues it cannot be used with shared a.out libs.

&#12;AUTHOR
       The  svgalib  joystick  handler  was  mostly  done  by  Daniel Engstr\&quot;om
       &lt;daniel.engstrom@riksnett.no&gt;.  Multiple joystick, VC  switching  support
       and  code to glue it into svgalib by Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. Part of the code is based on code from C.  Smith  and  Vojtech
       Pavlik.
