JPNEVULATOR(1)                    User Commands                   JPNEVULATOR(1)



NAME
       jpnevulator - Just another serial sniffer

SYNOPSIS
       jpnevulator [OPTION]... &lt;FILE&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       jpnevulator  is  a handy serial sniffer. You can use it to send data on a
       serial device too. You can read or  write  from/to  one  or  more  serial
       devices at the same time.

       In  write  (--write) mode data to be sent on the serial device(s) is read
       from a file or stdin in hexadecimal notation. The input format is  FD  or
       0xFD.  Of course all input is treated case-insensitive. Spaces may or may
       not be included in the input. So DEADBEEF is exactly the same  as  DE  AD
       BE  EF. Data is sent on the serial device(s) line by line.

       In  read (--read) mode data to be read from the serial device(s) is writ&#8208;
       ten to a file or stdout in hexadecimal notation. Skim through the options
       for   several   enhancements   in  the  output.  It&apos;s  even  possible  to
       pass(--pass) on the data between the several serial devices.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       Generic options:

       -f, --file=NAME
              In write mode read the contents of the file given and send them on
              the  serial  device(s)  and in read mode write the contents of the
              serial device(s) to the file given.

       -h, --help
              Shows a brief list of options.

       -l, --alias-separator
              Use the given string as the alias separator. See  --tty  for  more
              information.

       -r, --read
              Put  the program in read mode. This way you read the data from the
              given serial device(s) and write it to the file given or stdout if
              none  given.   See the read options section for more read specific
              options.

       -t, --tty=NAME:ALIAS
              The serial device to read from or write to. Use multiple times  to
              read/write  from/to more than one serial device(s). For handy ref&#8208;
              erence you can also separate an alias from the  tty  name  with  a
              collon  &apos;:&apos;.  If  a collon is for some strange reason part of your
              device name, you can use the --alias-separator option  to  specify
              another separation string. If an alias is given it will be used as
              the name of the serial device.

       -v, --version
              Output the version information, a small GPL notice and exit.

       -w, --write
              Put the program in write mode. This way you read data from a given
              file  or  stdin if none given and write it to the serial device(s)
              given. See the write  options  section  for  more  write  specific
              options.
&#12;       Read options:

       -a, --ascii
              Besides  the  hexadecimal output also display an extra column with
              the data in the ASCII representation. Non printable characters are
              displayed  as  a  dot  &apos;.&apos;.  The ASCII data is displayed after the
              hexadecimal data.

       -b, --byte-count
              Besides the hexadecimal output also display an extra  column  with
              the  current index number of the byte in the output. These numbers
              are displayed in front of the hexadecimal data. When  readin  from
              multiple  serial  devices  at  the same time the index number will
              increase per serial device.

       -e, --timing-delta=MICROSECONDS
              The timing delta is the amount of microseconds between  two  bytes
              that  the  latter  is  considered to be part of a new package. The
              default is 100 miliseconds. Use this option  in  conjunction  with
              the --timing-print option.

       -g, --timing-print
              Print  a  line of timing information before every continues stream
              of bytes. When multiple serial devices are given  also  print  the
              name or alias of the device where the data is coming from.

       -i, --width-delta=WIDTH
              The number of bytes to display on one line. The default is 16.

       -P, --pass
              This  one passes all the data between the serial devices. Handy if
              you want to put your serial sniffer in between the serial  devices
              you want to sniff.

       Write options:

       -c, --checksum
              Append  a  single checksum byte to the line of data written to the
              serial device(s) chosen. This checksum  is  a  simple  modulo  256
              addition of all input bytes on a line.

       -d, --delay-line=MICROSECONDS
              This  delay  is  an  optional  amount  of  microseconds to wait in
              between every input line is sent on the serial device(s).

       -k, --delay-byte=MICROSECONDS
              This delay is an  optional  amount  of  microseconds  to  wait  in
              between every input byte is sent on the serial device(s).

       -j, --fuck-up
              This  is  the  special  fuck  up option. When the calculation of a
              checksum is chosen (see checksum and  crc*  options)  the  checkum
              will be crippled on purpose. Carefully named after the special Jan
              Arie de Bruin &apos;fuck up crc&apos; button.

       -n, --no-send
              Do not actually send the bytes on  the  serial  device(s).  Rather
              pointless,  but  seemed one day long ago to be a rather handy fea&#8208;
              ture.

       -p, --print
              Besided sending the data on the serial device(s)  also  write  the
              data to stdout.

       -s, --size=SIZE
              The  maximum  number  of  bytes  per  line  to  send on the serial
              device(s). The default is 22, coming from back in the  Cham2  days
              of the program.

       -y, --crc16=POLY
              Append  a crc16 checksum to the line of data written to the serial
              device(s) chosen.  Use the optionally given poly  as  the  polyno&#8208;
              mial.  Specify  the  polynomial as hexadecimal value, as in 0xA001
              (the default).

       -z, --crc8=POLY
              Append a crc8 checksum to the line of data written to  the  serial
              device(s)  chosen.   Use  the optionally given poly as the polyno&#8208;
              mial. Specify the polynomial as hexadecimal value, as in 0x07 (the
              default).

DIAGNOSTICS
       Normally, exit status is 0 if the program did run with no problem whatso&#8208;
       ever. If the exit status is not equal to 0 an error message is printed on
       stderr which should help you solve the problem.

BUGS
       Order of bytes broke when reading several tty devices at once

       The  display  of  incoming  bytes  can  be  broke if you use multiple tty
       devices to read from. At the moment I do not have  a  solution  for  this
       problem.  Since I use select() to watch the several tty devices and after
       the select() I have to read() them one by one, I can not completely  100%
       display  which  bytes came after which on different tty devices. Take the
       example below:

              $ jpnevulator --ascii --timing-print --tty /dev/ttyS0 --tty /dev/ttyUSB0 --read
              2006-05-30 13:23:49.461075: /dev/ttyS0
              00 00 05 3B 0D 00 00 05                         ...;....
              2006-05-30 13:23:49.461113: /dev/ttyUSB0
              00 05 3B 0D 00 00 05 3B 0D                      ..;....;.
              2006-05-30 13:23:49.473074: /dev/ttyS0
              3B 0D 00 00 05 3B 0D                            ;....;.
              2006-05-30 13:23:49.473105: /dev/ttyUSB0
              00 12 05 06 39 00 12 05 06 39 1F 00 22 80 00 0E ....9....9..&quot;...
              $

       And now see the order in which things really got sent on the line:

              /dev/ttyS0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D
              /dev/ttyUSB0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D
              /dev/ttyS0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D
              /dev/ttyUSB0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D
              /dev/ttyS0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D
              /dev/ttyUSB0:
              00 00 05 3B 0D 00 12 05 06 39 00 12 05 06 39 ...

       As you can see /dev/ttyUSB0 receives the  echo  of  all  things  sent  by
       /dev/ttyS0.   This  is exactly what happens. But since there does exist a
       small time between the select() who  is  happy  expressing  something  is
       available and the read() who does get the available data, some extra data
       will be available. I have no idea on how I can use high level system call
       like  select()  and read() and be still able to put the bytes in the cor&#8208;
       rect order. Anyone an idea?
