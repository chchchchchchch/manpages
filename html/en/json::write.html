DESCRIPTION
       The json::write package provides a simple Tcl-only library for generation
       of text in the JSON http://www.json.org/ data exchange format  as  speci&#8208;
       fied in RFC 4627 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt.

COMMANDS
       ::json::write indented
              This method returns the current state of the indentation setting.

       ::json::write indented flag
              This  and the method aligned configure the layout of the JSON gen&#8208;
              erated by the package.

              If this flag is set (default) the package will break the generated
              JSON code across lines and indent it according to its inner struc&#8208;
              ture, with each key of an object on a separate line.

              If this flag is not set, the whole JSON object will be written  on
              a single line, with minimum spacing between all elements.

       ::json::write aligned
              This method returns the current state of the alignment setting.

       ::json::write aligned flag
              This and the method indented configure the layout of the JSON gen&#8208;
              erated by the package.

              If this flag is set (default) the package ensures that the  values
              for  the keys in an object are vertically aligned with each other,
              for a nice table effect. To make this work this also implies  that
              indented is set as well.

              If  this flag is not set, the output is formatted as per the value
              of indented, without trying to align the values for object keys.

       ::json::write string s
              This method takes the string s and returns it properly quoted  for
              JSON as its result.

       ::json::write array arg...
              This method takes a series of JSON formatted arguments and returns
              them as a properly formatted JSON array as its result.

       ::json::write object key value...
              This method takes a series  of  key/value  arguments,  the  values
              already formatted for JSON, and returns them as a properly format&#8208;
              ted JSON object as its result, with the  keys  formatted  as  JSON
              strings.
