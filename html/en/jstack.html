jstack(1)                                                              jstack(1)



Name
       jstack - Stack Trace


SYNOPSIS
       jstack [ option ] pid
       jstack [ option ] executable core
       jstack [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP


PARAMETERS
       Options  are  mutually  exclusive. Option, if used, should follow immedi&#8208;
       ately after the command name. See OPTIONS.

          pid
             process id for which the stack trace is to be printed. The  process
             must  be a Java process. To get a list of Java processes running on
             a machine, jps(1) may be used.


          executable
             Java executable from which the core dump was produced.

          core
             core file for which the stack trace is to be printed.

          remote-hostname-or-IP
             remote debug server&apos;s (see jsadebugd(1)) hostname or IP address.

          server-id
             optional unique id, if multiple debug servers are  running  on  the
             same remote host.


DESCRIPTION
       jstack  prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a given Java process
       or core file or a remote debug server. For  each  Java  frame,  the  full
       class  name,  method  name,  &apos;bci&apos;  (byte code index) and line number, if
       available, are printed. With the -m option, jstack prints both  Java  and
       native  frames  of all threads along with the &apos;pc&apos; (program counter). For
       each native frame, the closest native symbol to &apos;pc&apos;,  if  available,  is
       printed.  C++ mangled names are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the
       output of this command may be piped to c++filt. If the given  process  is
       running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64 option, e.g.:


       jstack -J-d64 -m pid


       NOTE  -  This  utility  is unsupported and may or may not be available in
       future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems where  dbgeng.dll  is  not
       present,  &apos;Debugging  Tools  For  Windows&apos;  needs to be installed to have
       these tools working. Also, PATH environment variable should  contain  the
       location of jvm.dll used by the target process or the location from which
       the Crash Dump file was produced.

       For example, set PATH=&lt;jdk&gt;\jre\bin\client;%PATH%

OPTIONS
          -F Force a stack dump when &apos;jstack [-l] pid&apos; does not respond.

          -l Long listing. Prints additional information  about  locks  such  as
             list of owned java.util.concurrent ownable synchronizers @
             http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concur&#8208;
             rent/locks/AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.html.

          -m prints mixed mode (both Java and native C/C++ frames) stack trace.

          -h prints a help message.

          -help
             prints a help message

KNOWN BUGS
       Mixed mode stack trace, the -m option, does not work with the remote
       debug server.
