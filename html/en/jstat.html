jstat(1)                                                                jstat(1)



Name
       jstat - Java Virtual Machine Statistics Monitoring Tool

SYNOPSIS
       jstat [ generalOption | outputOptions vmid [interval[s|ms] [count]] ]


PARAMETERS
          generalOption
             A single general command-line option (-help, -options, or -version)

          outputOptions
             One or more output options, consisting of a single statOption, plus
             any of the -t, -h, and -J options.

          vmid
             Virtual machine identifier, a string  indicating  the  target  Java
             virtual machine (JVM). The general syntax is
             [protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname[:port]/servername]
             The  syntax of the vmid string largely corresponds to the syntax of
             a URI. The vmid can vary from a simple integer representing a local
             JVM to a more complex construction specifying a communications pro&#8208;
             tocol, port number, and other implementation-specific  values.  See
             Virtual Machine Identifier for details.

          interval[s|ms]
             Sampling  interval in the specified units, seconds (s) or millisec&#8208;
             onds (ms). Default units are milliseconds. Must be a positive inte&#8208;
             ger. If specified, jstat will produce its output at each interval.

          count
             Number  of  samples to display. Default value is infinity; that is,
             jstat displays statistics until the target JVM  terminates  or  the
             jstat command is terminated. Must be a positive integer.


DESCRIPTION
       The  jstat  tool  displays  performance  statistics  for  an instrumented
       HotSpot Java virtual machine (JVM). The target JVM is identified  by  its
       virtual machine identifier, or vmid option described below.

       NOTE: This utility is unsupported and may not be available in future ver&#8208;
       sions of the JDK. It is not currently available on Windows 98 and Windows
       ME. platforms.


   VIRTUAL MACHINE IDENTIFIER
       The syntax of the vmid string largely corresponds to the syntax of a URI:

       [protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname][:port][/servername]


          protocol
             The communications protocol. If the protocol is omitted and a host&#8208;
             name is not specified, the default protocol is a platform  specific
             optimized local protocol. If the protocol is omitted and a hostname
             is specified, then the default protocol is rmi.

          lvmid
             The local virtual machine identifier for the target JVM. The  lvmid
             is  a  platform-specific  value that uniquely identifies a JVM on a
             system. The lvmid is the  only  required  component  of  a  virtual
             machine  identifier.  The  lvmid is typically, but not necessarily,
             the operating  system&apos;s  process  identifier  for  the  target  JVM
             process.  You  can  use  the jps(1) command to determine the lvmid.
             Also, you can determine lvmid on Unix platforms with  the  ps  com&#8208;
             mand, and on Windows with the Windows Task Manager.

          hostname
             A hostname or IP address indicating the target host. If hostname is
             omitted, then the target host is the local host.

          port
             The default port for communicating with the remote server.  If  the
             hostname  is  omitted or the protocol specifies an optimized, local
             protocol, then port is ignored. Otherwise, treatment  of  the  port
             parameter is implementation specific. For the default rmi protocol,
             the port indicates the port  number  for  the  rmiregistry  on  the
             remote  host.  If port is omitted, and protocol indicates rmi, then
             the default rmiregistry port (1099) is used.

          servername
             The treatment of this parameter depends on implementation. For  the
             optimized local protocol, this field is ignored. For the rmi proto&#8208;
             col, it represents the name of the RMI remote object on the  remote
             host.


OPTIONS
       The jstat command supports two types of options, general options and out&#8208;
       put options. General options cause jstat to display simple usage and ver&#8208;
       sion  information. Output options determine the content and format of the
       statistical output.


       NOTE: All options, and their  functionality  are  subject  to  change  or
       removal in future releases.

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       If  you  specify one of the general options, you cannot specify any other
       option or parameter.

          -help
             Display help message.

          -version
             Display version information.

          -options
             Display list of statistics options. See the Output Options  section
             below.


   OUTPUT OPTIONS
       If  you  do  not  specify  a  general option, then you can specify output
       options. Output options determine the content and format of jstat&apos;s  out&#8208;
       put,  and  consist  of  a single statOption, plus any of the other output
       options (-h, -t, and -J). The statOption must come first.

       Output is formatted as a table, with columns are separated by  spaces.  A
       header  row  with  titles describes the columns. Use the -h option to set
       the frequency at which the header is displayed. Column header  names  are
       generally  consistent  between  the different options. In general, if two
       options provide a column with the same name, then the data source for the
       two columns are the same.

       Use  the  -t  option to display a time stamp column, labeled Timestamp as
       the first column of output. The Timestamp  column  contains  the  elapsed
       time,  in seconds, since startup of the target JVM. The resolution of the
       time stamp is dependent on various factors and is  subject  to  variation
       due to delayed thread scheduling on heavily loaded systems.

       Use the interval and count parameters to determine how frequently and how
       many times, respectively, jstat displays its output.

       NOTE: You are advised not to write scripts to parse jstat&apos;s output  since
       the  format may change in future releases. If you choose to write scripts
       that parse jstat output, expect to modify them  for  future  releases  of
       this tool.

          -statOption
             Determines the statistics information that jstat displays. The fol&#8208;
             lowing table lists the available options. Use the -options  general
             option  to  display  the  list of options for a particular platform
             installation.

             Display a column header every n samples (output rows), where n is a
             positive integer. Default value is 0,  which  displays  the  column
             header above the first row of data.

          -t n
             Display a timestamp column as the first column of output. The time&#8208;
             stamp is the time since the start time of the target JVM.

       The output of this example  shows  that  a  young  generation  collection
       occurred  between  the 3rd and 4th sample. The collection took 0.001 sec&#8208;
       onds and promoted objects from the eden space (E) to the old  space  (O),
       resulting  in  an  increase of old space utilization from 9.49% to 9.51%.
       Before the collection, the survivor space was 12.44% utilized, but  after
       this collection it is only 7.74% utilized.

   Repeating the column header string
       This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes samples at 250 millisecond
       intervals and displays the output as  specified  by  -gcutil  option.  In
       addition,  it uses the -h3 option to output the column header after every
       3 lines of data.

       In addition to showing the repeating header string,  this  example  shows
       that  between  the 2nd and 3rd samples, a young GC occurred. Its duration
       was 0.001 seconds. The collection found enough live data  that  the  sur&#8208;
       vivor  space  0  utilization  (S0U) would would have exceeded the desired
       survivor Size (DSS). As a result, objects were promoted to the old gener&#8208;
       ation  (not  visible in this output), and the tenuring threshold (TT) was
       lowered from 31 to 2.

       Another collection occurs between the 5th and 6th samples.  This  collec&#8208;
       tion found very few survivors and returned the tenuring threshold to 31.

   Including a time stamp for each sample
       This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes 3 samples at 250 millisec&#8208;
       ond intervals. The -t option is used to generate a time  stamp  for  each
       sample in the first column.

       The  Timestamp column reports the elapsed time in seconds since the start
       of the target JVM. In addition, the -gcoldcapacity output shows  the  old
       generation  capacity  (OGC) and the old space capacity (OC) increasing as
       the heap expands to meet allocation and/or  promotion  demands.  The  old
       generation  capacity  (OGC)  has grown to from 11696 KB to 13820 KB after
       the 81st Full GC (FGC). The  maximum  capacity  of  the  generation  (and
       space) is 60544 KB (OGCMX), so it still has room to expand.

   Monitor instrumentation for a remote JVM
       This  example  attaches  to lvmid 40496 on the system named remote.domain
       using the -gcutil option, with samples taken every second indefinitely.

       jstat -gcutil 40496@remote.domain 1000




       The lvmid is combined with the name of the remote  host  to  construct  a
       vmid of 40496@remote.domain. This vmid results in the use of the rmi pro&#8208;
       tocol to communicate to the default jstatd server on the remote host. The
       jstatd  server  is located using the rmiregistry on remote.domain that is
       bound to the default rmiregistry port (port 1099).
