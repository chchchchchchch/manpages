Name
       jvisualvm - Java Virtual Machine Monitoring, Troubleshooting, and Profil&#8208;
       ing Tool

SYNOPSIS
               jvisualvm [ options ]


PARAMETERS
       Options, if used, should  follow  immediately  after  the  command  name.
       Options may be in any order. For a discussion of parameters that apply to
       a specific option, see OPTIONS below.

DESCRIPTION
       Java VisualVM is an intuitive  graphical  user  interface  that  provides
       detailed  information  about  Java  technology-based  applications  (Java
       applications) while they are running on  a  given  Java  Virtual  Machine
       (JVM(*)).  The  name Java VisualVM comes from the fact that Java VisualVM
       provides information about the JVM software visually.

       Java VisualVM combines several monitoring, troubleshooting, and profiling
       utilities  into  a  single  tool.  For example, most of the functionality
       offered by the standalone tools jmap, jinfo, jstat and jstack  have  been
       integrated  into  Java  VisualVM.  Other functionalities, such as some of
       those offered by the JConsole tool, can be added as optional plug-ins.

OPTIONS
       The following option is possible when you launch Java VisualVM.

          -J&lt;jvm_option&gt;
             Pass this &lt;jvm_option&gt; to the JVM software.


USAGE
       Java VisualVM is useful to Java application  developers  to  troubleshoot
       applications  and  to  monitor and improve the applications&apos; performance.
       Java VisualVM can allow developers to generate and  analyse  heap  dumps,
       track down memory leaks, perform and monitor garbage collection, and per&#8208;
       form lightweight memory and  CPU  profiling.  Plug-ins  also  exist  that
       expand the functionality of Java VisualVM. For example, most of the func&#8208;
       tionality of the JConsole tool is available via the MBeans Tab and  JCon&#8208;
       sole  Plug-in Wrapper plug-ins. You can choose from a catalog of standard
       Java VisualVM plug-ins by selecting &apos;Tools&apos; | &apos;Plugins&apos; in the Java Visu&#8208;
       alVM menus.

       Start Java VisualVM with the following command:

       %  jvisualvm &lt;options&gt;
