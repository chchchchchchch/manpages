KATE(1)                         KDE User&apos;s Manual                        KATE(1)



NAME
       kate - Advanced text editor for KDE

SYNOPSIS
       kate [-s, --start name] [--startanon] [-n, --new] [-b, --block] [-p,
            --pid pid] [-e, --encoding name] [-l, --line line] [-c, --column
            column] [-i, --stdin] [-u, --use] [KDE Generic Options]
            [Qt Generic Options]

DESCRIPTION
       Kate is the KDE Advanced Text Editor.

       Kate also provides the editor part for various applications, under the
       name KWrite.

       Some of Kate&apos;s many features include configurable syntax highlighting for
       languages ranging from C and C++ to HTML to bash scripts, the ability to
       create and maintain projects, a multiple document interface (MDI), and a
       self-contained terminal emulator.

       But Kate is more than a programmer&apos;s editor. Its ability to open several
       files at once makes it ideal for editing UNIX&#174;&apos;s many configuration
       files. This document was written in Kate.

OPTIONS
       -s, --start name
           Start Kate with a given session.

       --startanon
           Start Kate with a new anonymous session, implies -n.

       -n, --new
           Force start of a new Kate instance (is ignored if start is used and
           another Kate instance already has the given session opened), forced
           if no parameters and no URLs are given at all.

       -b, --block
           If using an already running Kate instance, block until it exits, if
           URLs given to open.

       -p, --pid  pid
           Only try to reuse kate instance with this pid (is ignored if start is
           used and another Kate instance already has the given session opened).

       -e, --encoding  name
           Set encoding for the file to open

           You can use this to force a file opened in utf-8 format, for
           instance. (The command iconv -l provides a list of encodings, which
           may be helpful to you.)

       -l, --line  line
           Navigate to this line

       -c, --column  column
           Navigate to this column

       -i, --stdin
           Read the contents of stdin

       -u, --use
           Use an already running Kate instance; default, only for compatibility

SEE ALSO
       More detailed user documentation is available from help:/kate (either
       enter this URL into Konqueror, or run khelpcenter help:/kate).

       There is also further information available at the Kate website[1].

EXAMPLES
       To open a file named source.cpp at column 15, line 25, in an existing
       Kate window, you could use:

           kate -c 15 -l
           25 -u source.cpp

       If you have an active internet connection, you can take advantage of
       KDE&apos;s network transparency to open a file from an ftp site. If you do not
       have write permission on the remote server, the file will be opened read
       only and you will be prompted for a local filename to save to if you make
       changes. If you do have write permission, changes will be saved
       transparently over the network.
