DESCRIPTION
       kbd is an Xorg input driver for keyboards.  The driver supports the stan&#8208;
       dard OS-provided keyboard interface, but these are currently only  avail&#8208;
       able  to  this driver module for Linux, BSD, and Solaris.  This driver is
       the replacement for the built-in keyboard  driver  formerly  included  in
       Xorg.

       The kbd driver functions as a keyboard input device.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Depending on the X server version in use, input device options may be set
       in either a xorg.conf file, an xorg.conf.d snippet, or in the  configura&#8208;
       tion files read by the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) daemon, hald(1).

       Please  refer  to  xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only  cov&#8208;
       ers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Specify  the  keyboard  device.  Default: the OS&apos;s default console
              keyboard input source.

       Option &quot;Protocol&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Specify the keyboard protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

                   Standard, Xqueue.

              Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.  Default: &quot;Stan&#8208;
              dard&quot;.

       Option &quot;XLeds&quot; &quot;ledlist&quot;
              makes  the keyboard LEDs specified in ledlist available for client
              use instead of their traditional function (Scroll Lock, Caps  Lock
              and  Num  Lock).  The numbers in the list are in the range 1 to 3.
              Default: empty list.

       Option &quot;XkbRules&quot; &quot;rules&quot;
              specifies which XKB rules file to use for  interpreting  the  Xkb&#8208;
              Model,  XkbLayout,  XkbVariant, and XkbOptions settings.  Default:
              &quot;base&quot; for most platforms.  If you use the &quot;base&quot; value  then  you
              can find listing of all valid values for these four options in the
              /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst file.

       Option &quot;XkbModel&quot; &quot;modelname&quot;
              specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: &quot;pc105&quot; for  most
              platforms.

       Option &quot;XkbLayout&quot; &quot;layoutname&quot;
              specifies the XKB keyboard layout name.  This is usually the coun&#8208;
              try or language type of the  keyboard.   Default:  &quot;us&quot;  for  most
              platforms.

       Option &quot;XkbVariant&quot; &quot;variants&quot;
              specifies  the XKB keyboard variant components.  These can be used
              to enhance the keyboard layout details.  Default: not set.

       Option &quot;XkbOptions&quot; &quot;options&quot;
              specifies the XKB keyboard option components.  These can  be  used
              to enhance the keyboard behaviour.  Default: not set.

       For a list of available XKB options, see xkeyboard-config(7).

EXAMPLE
       The following xorg.conf fragment ensures that user will be able to switch
       between us and sk layouts by pressing the &quot;menu&quot; key. The scroll lock LED
       shows which layout is currently active.

       The XkbVariant option defines which variants of the two layouts should be
       used. In case of the us layout its default variant is used.  In  case  of
       the sk layout its qwerty variant is used.
