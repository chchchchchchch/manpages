KBD_MODE(1)                                                          KBD_MODE(1)



NAME
       kbd_mode - report or set the keyboard mode

SYNOPSIS
       kbd_mode [ -a | -u | -k | -s ] [ -C CONSOLE ]

DESCRIPTION
       Without argument, kbd_mode prints the current keyboard mode (RAW, MEDIUM&#8208;
       RAW or XLATE).  With argument, it sets the keyboard mode as indicated:

       -s: scancode mode (RAW),

       -k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),

       -a: ASCII mode (XLATE),

       -u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).

       Of course the &quot;-a&quot; is only traditional, and the  code  used  can  be  any
       8-bit  character  set.  With &quot;-u&quot; a 16-bit character set is expected, and
       these chars are transmitted to the kernel as 1, 2, or 3 bytes  (following
       the  UTF-8 coding).  In these latter two modes the key mapping defined by
       loadkeys(1) is used.

       kbd_mode operates on the console specified by the &quot;-C&quot; option;  if  there
       is none, the console associated with stdin is used.

       Warning:  changing  the  keyboard mode, other than between ASCII and Uni&#8208;
       code, will probably make your keyboard unusable.  This  command  is  only
       meant for use (say via remote login) when some program left your keyboard
       in the wrong state.  Note that in some obsolete versions of this  program
       the &quot;-u&quot; option was a synonym for &quot;-s&quot;.
