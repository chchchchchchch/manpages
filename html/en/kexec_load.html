KEXEC_LOAD(2)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              KEXEC_LOAD(2)



NAME
       kexec_load - load a new kernel for later execution

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/kexec.h&gt;
       long kexec_load(unsigned long entry, unsigned long nr_segments,
                       struct kexec_segment *segments, unsigned long flags);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The  kexec_load()  system  call  loads  a new kernel that can be executed
       later by reboot(2).

       The flags argument is a mask whose high-order bits control the  operation
       of the call.  The following values can be specified in flags:

       KEXEC_ON_CRASH (since Linux 2.6.13)
              Execute the new kernel automatically on a system crash.

       KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Preserve  the system hardware and software states before executing
              the new kernel.  This could be used for system suspend.  This flag
              is   only  available  if  the  kernel  was  configured  with  CON&#8208;
              FIG_KEXEC_JUMP, and is only effective if  nr_segments  is  greater
              than 0.

       The  low-order  bits  of flags contain the architecture of the to-be-exe&#8208;
       cuted kernel.  Specify (OR) the constant KEXEC_ARCH_DEFAULT  to  use  the
       current  architecture,  or  one  of  the following architecture constants
       KEXEC_ARCH_386,  KEXEC_ARCH_X86_64,   KEXEC_ARCH_PPC,   KEXEC_ARCH_PPC64,
       KEXEC_ARCH_IA_64,    KEXEC_ARCH_ARM,    KEXEC_ARCH_S390,   KEXEC_ARCH_SH,
       KEXEC_ARCH_MIPS, and KEXEC_ARCH_MIPS_LE.  The architecture must  be  exe&#8208;
       cutable on the CPU of the system.

       The  entry  argument  is  the physical entry address in the kernel image.
       The nr_segments argument is the number of segments pointed to by the seg&#8208;
       ments pointer.  The segments argument is an array of kexec_segment struc&#8208;
       tures which define the kernel layout:

           struct kexec_segment {
               void   *buf;        /* Buffer in user space */
               size_t  bufsz;      /* Buffer length in user space */
               void   *mem;        /* Physical address of kernel */
               size_t  memsz;      /* Physical address length */
           };

       The kernel image defined by segments is copied from the  calling  process
       into previously reserved memory.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  kexec_load() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno
       is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBUSY  Another crash kernel is already being loaded or a crash kernel  is
              already in use.

       EINVAL flags is invalid; or nr_segments is too large

       EPERM  The caller does not have the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.
&#12;VERSIONS
       The kexec_load() system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.13.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Currently,  there  is  no  glibc support for kexec_load().  Call it using
       syscall(2).

       The required constants are in the Linux kernel source file linux/kexec.h,
       which  is  not  currently  exported to glibc.  Therefore, these constants
       must be defined manually.

       This system call is only available if the kernel was configured with CON&#8208;
       FIG_KEXEC.

SEE ALSO
       reboot(2), syscall(2)
