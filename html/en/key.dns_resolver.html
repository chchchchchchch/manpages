KEY.DNS_RESOLVER(8)      Linux Key Management Utilities      KEY.DNS_RESOLVER(8)



NAME
       key.dns_resolver - Upcall for request-key to handle dns_resolver keys

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver &lt;key&gt;
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver -D [-v] [-v] &lt;keydesc&gt; &lt;calloutinfo&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       This  program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel when ker&#8208;
       nel services (such as NFS, CIFS and  AFS)  want  to  perform  a  hostname
       lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.  It is not ordinarily
       intended to be called directly.

       It can be called in debugging mode to test its functionality by passing a
       -D  flag  on the command line.  For this to work, the key description and
       the callout information must be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased  by
       supplying one or more -v flags.

ERRORS
       All errors will be logged to the syslog.

SEE ALSO
