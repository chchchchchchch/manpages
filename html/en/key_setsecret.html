KEY_SETSECRET(3)            Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual           KEY_SETSECRET(3)



NAME
       key_decryptsession,    key_encryptsession,   key_setsecret,   key_gendes,
       key_secretkey_is_set - interfaces to rpc keyserver daemon

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;rpc/rpc.h&gt;

       int key_decryptsession(const char *remotename, des_block *deskey);

       int key_encryptsession(const char *remotename, des_block *deskey);

       int key_gendes(des_block *deskey);

       int key_setsecret(const char *key);

       int key_secretkey_is_set(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions here are used within the RPC&apos;s secure authentication mecha&#8208;
       nism  (AUTH_DES).   There should be no need for user programs to use this
       functions.

       The function key_decryptsession() uses the (remote)  server  netname  and
       takes  the  DES key for decrypting.  It uses the public key of the server
       and the secret key associated with  the  effective  UID  of  the  calling
       process.

       The function key_encryptsession() is the inverse of key_decryptsession().
       It encrypts the DES keys with the public key of the server and the secret
       key associated with the effective UID of the calling process.

       The  function key_gendes() is used to ask the keyserver for a secure con&#8208;
       versation key.

       The function key_setsecret() is used to set the key for the effective UID
       of the calling process.

       The  function  key_secretkey_is_set()  can be used to determine whether a
       key has been set for the effective UID of the calling process.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

NOTES
       Note that we talk about two types of encryption here.  One is  asymmetric
       using a public and secret key.  The other is symmetric, the 64-bit DES.

       These routines were part of the Linux/Doors-project, abandoned by now.
