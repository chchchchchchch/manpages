KEYBOARD(5)                Console-setup User&apos;s Manual               KEYBOARD(5)



NAME
       keyboard - keyboard configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The keyboard file describes the properties of the keyboard. It is read by
       setupcon(1) in order to configure the keyboard on the console.  In Debian
       systems the default keyboard layout is described in /etc/default/keyboard
       and it is shared between X and the console.

       The specification of the keyboard layout in the keyboard file is based on
       the XKB options XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions.  Unfortu&#8208;
       nately, there is little documentation how to use  them.   Description  of
       all possible values for these options can be found in the file xorg.lst.

       You  might  want to read &#8220;The XKB Configuration Guide&#8221; by Kamil Toman and
       Ivan U. Pascal:

              http://www.xfree86.org/current/XKB-Config.html

       Other possible readings are:

              http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/

       The complete XKB-specification can be found on

              http://xfree86.org/current/XKBproto.pdf

       The file keyboard consists of variable settings in POSIX format:

              VARIABLE=VALUE

       Only one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments  (starting  with  &apos;#&apos;)
       are also allowed.


OPTIONS
       The following variables can be set.


       XKBMODEL
              Specifies  the  XKB  keyboard model name.  Default: pc105 for most
              platforms.


       XKBLAYOUT
              Specifies the XKB keyboard layout name. This is usually the  coun&#8208;
              try  or  language type of the keyboard. Default: us for most plat&#8208;
              forms


       XKBVARIANT
              Specifies the XKB keyboard variant components. These can  be  used
              to further specify the keyboard layout details. Default: not set.


       XKBOPTIONS
              Specifies  the  XKB  keyboard  option components.  Options usually
              relate to the behavior of the special  keys  (&lt;Shift&gt;,  &lt;Control&gt;,
              &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;CapsLock&gt;, etc.)  Default: not set.
&#12;       BACKSPACE
              Determines  the  behavior  of &lt;BackSpace&gt; and &lt;Delete&gt; keys on the
              console.  Allowed values: bs, del and guess.  In  most  cases  you
              can  specify  guess  here, in which case the current terminal set&#8208;
              tings and the kernel of your operating system will be used to  de&#8208;
              termine  the  correct  value.  Value bs specifies VT100-conformant
              behavior: &lt;BackSpace&gt; will generate ^H  (ASCII  BS)  and  &lt;Delete&gt;
              will  generate ^?  (ASCII DEL).  Value del specifies VT220-confor&#8208;
              mant behavior: &lt;BackSpace&gt;  will  generate  ^?   (ASCII  DEL)  and
              &lt;Delete&gt; will generate a special function sequence.


       KMAP   Usually this variable will be unset but if you don&apos;t want to use a
              XKB layout on the console, you can specify an  alternative  keymap
              here.  Specify a file that is suitable as input for loadkeys(1) on
              Linux or for kbdcontrol(1) on FreeBSD.


FILES
       The standard location of the keyboard file is /etc/default/keyboard.  De&#8208;
       scription of all available keyboard models, layouts, variants and options
       is available in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst.   In  most  cases,  in
       /usr/share/keymaps/  or /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ you will find several
       keymaps that can be used with the variable KMAP.


NOTES
       In Debian systems, changes in /etc/default/keyboard do not become immedi&#8208;
       ately visible to X.  You should either reboot the system, or use

           udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change


BUGS
       When  a  triple-layout is used, i.e. a layout with three XKB groups, then
       the group toggling happens in the following  way:  Group1  -&gt;  Group2  -&gt;
       Group1 -&gt; Group3.

       On  FreeBSD  triple-  and  quadruple-layouts  are not supported (only the
       first and the second layout are taken into account).

       The option grp:shifts_toggle is not supported.


EXAMPLES
       The following configuration will give you the standard US  QWERTY  layout
       (us).   The  key  &lt;Menu&gt;  will  act  as  a compose key (compose:menu) and
       &lt;CapsLock&gt; will act as third control key (ctrl:nocaps).

           XKBLAYOUT=us
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=compose:menu,ctrl:nocaps

       In the following configuration the right &lt;Alt&gt; key (grp:toggle) will tog&#8208;
       gle  between  US  QWERTY  layout  (us) and Greek (gr) layout.  The option
       grp_led:scroll is ignored on the console but in X in  means  to  use  the
       ScrollLock  keyboard  led  as  indicator  for  the  current layout (US or
       Greek).

           XKBLAYOUT=us,gr
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:toggle,grp_led:scroll

       In the following configuration the &lt;Control&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt; key combination will
       toggle  (grp:ctrl_shift_toggle) between French keyboard (fr) without dead
       keys (nodeadkeys) and British (gb) &#8220;Dvorak&#8221; (dvorak) keyboard.  The right
       &lt;Win&gt;  key  will  be a compose-key (compose:rwin) and the right &lt;Alt&gt; key
       will function as AltGr (lv3:lalt_switch).

           XKBLAYOUT=fr,gb
           XKBVARIANT=nodeadkeys,dvorak
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:ctrl_shift_toggle,compose:rwin,lv3:ralt_switch
