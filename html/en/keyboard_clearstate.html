keyboard_clearstate(3)         Svgalib User Manual        keyboard_clearstate(3)



NAME
       keyboard_clearstate  -  reset  the state of all keys when in raw keyboard
       mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       void keyboard_clearstate(void);


DESCRIPTION
       When in raw keyboard mode, svgalib receives press and release events from
       the kernel and keeps track which keys are currently pressed. Calling key&#8208;
       board_clearstate() sets this information to all keys  released.  You  can
       use  this  for  cleanup  at  certain  places in your program. In addition
       svgalib resets the states of all keys when a VC switch occurs because  it
       does  not  know  the current state of keys when it regains control of the
       console.
