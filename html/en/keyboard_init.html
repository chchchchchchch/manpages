keyboard_init(3)               Svgalib User Manual              keyboard_init(3)



NAME
       keyboard_init,  keyboard_init_return_fd  - initialize the keyboard to raw
       mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       int keyboard_init(void);
       int keyboard_init_return_fd(void);


DESCRIPTION
       These routines initialize the keyboard to raw mode. No  ASCII  codes  are
       produced, instead svgalib keeps track of each single keypress or depress.
       The return_fd version returns the file descriptor of the  console  device
       to  allow  you to do further tricks with it (though it is unclear which).
       The other version just returns 0 if successful.  Both return -1 on error.

       keyboard_close(3) returns to normal operation.

       When in  raw  keyboard  mode  you  can  no  longer  use  vga_getch(3)  or
       vga_getkey(3)  but  you  must  use  keyboard_getstate(3) or keyboard_key&#8208;
       pressed(3).

       Depending on the setting of keyboard_translatekeys(3) even in raw mode  a
       &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C  will  cause  a  SIGINT.   In  any  case  svgalib will check for
       &lt;Alt&gt;-F1 - &lt;Alt&gt;-F10 and perform console switches accordingly.
