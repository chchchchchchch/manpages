keyboard_keypressed(3)         Svgalib User Manual        keyboard_keypressed(3)



NAME
       keyboard_keypressed - check if a key is pressed when in raw keyboard mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       int keyboard_keypressed(int scancode);


DESCRIPTION
       When in raw keyboard mode this routine checks if the key with scancode is
       pressed and returns KEY_PRESSED or KEY_NOTPRESSED  accordingly.  Actually
       KEY_PRESSED  is  1  and  KEY_NOTPRESSED is 0, s.t. you can use constructs
       like:

       if(keyboard_keypressed(SCANCODE_ENTER)) {
            /* do something */
       }

       Please note that keyboard events will only be processed  when  you  occa&#8208;
       sionally call keyboard_update(3) or keyboard_waitforupdate(3).

       keyboard_translatekeys(3) allows certain remap operations which make cer&#8208;
       tain keys (digits, enter) which might have several physical keys show  up
       under the same scancodes.

       Here  are  the  supported  scancodes. The names of the #defines originate
       from the US keyboard layout, for other countries, they&apos;ll  refer  to  the
       key  in  the same physical location, but the keycap will have a different
       inscription. For the list below, add SCANCODE_ in front of the  names  to
       get  the  right name for your C source. That means, if it lists BACKSLASH
       below, you shall use SCANCODE_BACKSLASH as symbol  in  your  program.  In
       addition  to  the names below we also have SCANCODE_0 - SCANCODE_9, SCAN&#8208;
       CODE_KEYPAD0 - SCANCODE_KEYPAD9, SCANCODE_A - SCANCODE_Z, and SCANCODE_F1
       - SCANCODE_F12.

       The   other   key   names  are  ESCAPE,  MINUS,  EQUAL,  BACKSPACE,  TAB,
       BRACKET_LEFT, BRACKET_RIGHT, ENTER, LEFTCONTROL,  SEMICOLON,  APOSTROPHE,
       GRAVE, LEFTSHIFT, BACKSLASH, COMMA, PERIOD, SLASH, RIGHTSHIFT, KEYPADMUL&#8208;
       TIPLY, LEFTALT, SPACE, CAPSLOCK, NUMLOCK, SCROLLLOCK, CURSORUPLEFT,  CUR&#8208;
       SORUP,  CURSORUPRIGHT,  KEYPADMINUS, CURSORLEFT, CURSORRIGHT, KEYPADPLUS,
       CURSORDOWNLEFT, CURSORDOWN,  CURSORDOWNRIGHT,  KEYPADPERIOD,  LESS,  KEY&#8208;
