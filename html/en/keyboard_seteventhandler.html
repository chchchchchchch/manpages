keyboard_seteventhandler(3)    Svgalib User Manual   keyboard_seteventhandler(3)



NAME
       keyboard_seteventhandler,  keyboard_setdefaulteventhandler  -  define  an
       event handler for keyboard events in raw mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       typedef void (*__keyboard_handler) (int scancode, int press);

       void keyboard_seteventhandler(__keyboard_handler handler);
       void keyboard_setdefaulteventhandler(void);


DESCRIPTION
       These functions allow to define a keyboard event handler which is  called
       by keyboard_update(3) and keyboard_waitforupdate(3) when a keyboard event
       occured.

       press is KEY_EVENTRELEASE or KEY_EVENTPRESS if key scancode was  released
       or  pressed.  Actually the first value is 0 and the second is 1 which are
       so intuitive s.t. you may use them in your program.

       Even you specify an own handler,  svgalib  will  check  for  &lt;Alt&gt;-F*  or
       &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C  for console switches or generation of SIGINT if allowed by key&#8208;
       board_translatekeys(3).

       Calling keyboard_setdefaulteventhandler() reinstates the default  handler
       which maintains the tables used by keyboard_getstate(3) and keyboard_key&#8208;
       pressed(3).  It is probably a good idea  to  call  keyboard_clearstate(3)
       after reenabling the default handler.

       Here  are  the  supported  scancodes. The names of the #defines originate
       from the US keyboard layout, for other countries, they&apos;ll  refer  to  the
       key  in  the same physical location, but the keycap will have a different
       inscription. For the list below, add SCANCODE_ in front of the  names  to
       get  the  right name for your C source. That means, if it lists BACKSLASH
       below, you shall use SCANCODE_BACKSLASH as symbol  in  your  program.  In
       addition  to  the names below we also have SCANCODE_0 - SCANCODE_9, SCAN&#8208;
       CODE_KEYPAD0 - SCANCODE_KEYPAD9, SCANCODE_A - SCANCODE_Z, and SCANCODE_F1
       - SCANCODE_F12.

       The   other   key   names  are  ESCAPE,  MINUS,  EQUAL,  BACKSPACE,  TAB,
       BRACKET_LEFT, BRACKET_RIGHT, ENTER, LEFTCONTROL,  SEMICOLON,  APOSTROPHE,
       GRAVE, LEFTSHIFT, BACKSLASH, COMMA, PERIOD, SLASH, RIGHTSHIFT, KEYPADMUL&#8208;
       TIPLY, LEFTALT, SPACE, CAPSLOCK, NUMLOCK, SCROLLLOCK, CURSORUPLEFT,  CUR&#8208;
       SORUP,  CURSORUPRIGHT,  KEYPADMINUS, CURSORLEFT, CURSORRIGHT, KEYPADPLUS,
       CURSORDOWNLEFT, CURSORDOWN,  CURSORDOWNRIGHT,  KEYPADPERIOD,  LESS,  KEY&#8208;
       PADENTER,  RIGHTCONTROL,  CONTROL,  KEYPADDIVIDE,  PRINTSCREEN, RIGHTALT,
       BREAK, BREAK_ALTERNATIVE, HOME, CURSORBLOCKUP,  PAGEUP,  CURSORBLOCKLEFT,
       CURSORBLOCKRIGHT, END, CURSORBLOCKDOWN, PAGEDOWN, INSERT, and REMOVE.
