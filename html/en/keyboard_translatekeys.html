keyboard_translatekeys(3)      Svgalib User Manual     keyboard_translatekeys(3)



NAME
       keyboard_translatekeys - modify scancode mappings in raw keyboard mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       void keyboard_translatekeys(int mask);


DESCRIPTION
       This  function sets several flags which control how certain scancodes are
       mapped. At startup a mask value of 0 is active.

       mask must be a logical or of zero or more of  the  following  #predefined
       integers to turn the features listed on:


       TRANSLATE_CURSORKEYS
              Translate the scancodes of the SCANCODE_CURSORBLOCK* keys to those
              of the cursor keys on the number pad,  s.t.   keyboard_getstate(3)
              and  keyboard_keypressed(3) report a keypress of the corresponding
              number pad cursor key and not the one on the cursor block.

       TRANSLATE_DIAGONAL
              Translates the scancodes of diagonal cursor keys (keypad 7, 9,  1,
              3)  to  presses of two of the ordinary up, down, left, right keys.
              For  example,  instead  of  reporting  a  press  of  SCANCODE_CUR&#8208;
              SORUPRIGHT  keyboard_getstate(3) and keyboard_keypressed(3) report
              a simultaneous press  of  SCANCODE_CURSORUP  and  SCANCODE_CURSOR&#8208;
              RIGHT.

       TRANSLATE_KEYPADENTER
              The  scancode  of  the  keypad  enter key is mapped to that of the
              ordinary enter key, s.t.  keyboard_getstate(3)  and  keyboard_key&#8208;
              pressed(3)  report  a press of SCANCODE_ENTER regardless if keypad
              enter or ordinary enter is pressed.

       DONT_CATCH_CTRLC
              Pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C does not raise a SIGINT.   On  contrary  to  the
              other  flags  this  has  also  effect when a user defined keyboard
              event handler is used. Svgalib  will  always  process  &lt;Alt&gt;-F1  -
              &lt;Alt&gt;-F10 and perform console switches accordingly.


BUGS
       The  TRANSLATE_* options above do really do simple scancode translations.
       For example, when TRANSLATE_KEYPADENTER is active and  the  user  presses
       both enter and keypad enter. Then, if he releases one of them (say keypad
       enter), it&apos;s release event will clear the common keyboard state, s.t.  no
       keypress is reported even though enter is still pressed.

       Similarly,  if TRANSLATE_DIAGONAL is active, the user holds cursor upleft
       (keypad 7) down and then  presses  and  release  cursor  up  (keypad  8),
       svgalib  will  only report a pressed cursor left but the simulated cursor
       up will be lost. You can easily try this with the keytest(6) demo to make
       the effect more clear to you.
