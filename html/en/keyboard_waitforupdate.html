keyboard_update(3)             Svgalib User Manual            keyboard_update(3)



NAME
       keyboard_update, keyboard_waitforupdate - process raw keyboard events

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgakeyboard.h&gt;

       int keyboard_update(void);
       void keyboard_waitforupdate(void);


DESCRIPTION
       These  routines check the keyboard buffer for any raw keyboard events and
       do  the   necessary   updates   to   the   internal   buffers   of   key&#8208;
       board_clearstate(3) and keyboard_keypressed(3).

       When  there  are  no such events, keyboard_update() returns 0 immediately
       (non-zero else) whereas keyboard_waitforupdate() blocks and  waits  until
       an event occurs.

       vga_waitevent(3) allows to wait for keyboard and other events at the same
       time.
