DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is  used to control the key management facility in various
       ways using a variety of subcommands.

KEY IDENTIFIERS
       The key identifiers passed to or returned from keyctl  are,  in  general,
       positive  integers.  There are, however, some special values with special
       meanings that can be passed as arguments:

       (*) No key: 0

       (*) Thread keyring: @t or -1

       Each thread may have its own keyring. This is searched first, before  all
       others. The thread keyring is replaced by (v)fork, exec and clone.

       (*) Process keyring: @p or -2

       Each  process  (thread  group)  may  have its own keyring. This is shared
       between all members of a group and will  be  searched  after  the  thread
       keyring. The process keyring is replaced by (v)fork and exec.

       (*) Session keyring: @s or -3

       Each  process  subscribes  to  a session keyring that is inherited across
       (v)fork, exec and clone. This is searched after the process keyring. Ses&#8208;
       sion  keyrings  can be named and an extant keyring can be joined in place
       of a process&apos;s current session keyring.

       (*) User specific keyring: @u or -4

       This keyring is shared between all the processes owned  by  a  particular
       user. It isn&apos;t searched directly, but is normally linked to from the ses&#8208;
       sion keyring.

       (*) User default session keyring: @us or -5

       This is the default session keyring for a  particular  user.  Login  pro&#8208;
       cesses  that  change to a particular user will bind to this session until
       another session is set.

       (*) Group specific keyring: @g or -6

       This is a place holder for a group specific keyring, but is not  actually
       implemented yet in the kernel.

       (*) Assumed request_key authorisation key: @a or -7

       This  selects  the authorisation key provided to the request_key() helper
       to permit it to access the callers keyrings and  instantiate  the  target
       key.

COMMAND SYNTAX
       Any non-ambiguous shortening of a command name may be used in lieu of the
       full command name. This facility should not be used in scripting  as  new
       commands may be added in future that then cause ambiguity.

       (*) Display the package version number

       keyctl --version

       This command prints the package version number and build date and exits:

              testbox&gt;keyctl --version
              keyctl from keyutils-1.5.3 (Built 2011-08-24)

       (*) Show process keyrings

       keyctl show [-x] [&lt;keyring&gt;]

       By default this command recursively shows what keyrings a process is sub&#8208;
       scribed to and what keys and keyrings they  contain.   If  a  keyring  is
       specified  then  that keyring will be dumped instead.  If -x is specified
       then the keyring IDs will be dumped in hex instead of decimal.

       (*) Add a key to a keyring

       keyctl add &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl padd &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;

       This command creates a key of the specified type and description; instan&#8208;
       tiates  it  with the given data and attaches it to the specified keyring.
       It then prints the new key&apos;s ID on stdout:

              testbox&gt;keyctl add user mykey stuff @u
              26

       The padd variant of the command reads the data  from  stdin  rather  than
       taking it from the command line:

              testbox&gt;echo -n stuff | keyctl padd user mykey @u
              26

       (*) Request a key

       keyctl request &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; [&lt;dest_keyring&gt;]
       keyctl request2 &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; &lt;info&gt; [&lt;dest_keyring&gt;]
       keyctl prequest2 &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; [&lt;dest_keyring&gt;]

       These  three  commands  request the lookup of a key of the given type and
       description. The process&apos;s keyrings will be searched, and if a  match  is
       found  the matching key&apos;s ID will be printed to stdout; and if a destina&#8208;
       tion keyring is given, the key will be added to that keyring also.

       If there is no key, the first command will simply return the error ENOKEY
       and  fail.  The  second and third commands will create a partial key with
       the type and description, and call out to /sbin/request-key with that key
       and the extra information supplied. This will then attempt to instantiate
       the key in some manner, such that a valid key is obtained.

       The third command is like the second, except that the callout information
       is read from stdin rather than being passed on the command line.

       If  a  valid key is obtained, the ID will be printed and the key attached
       as if the original search had succeeded.

       If there wasn&apos;t a valid key obtained, a temporary negative  key  will  be
       attached to the destination keyring if given and the error &quot;Requested key
       not available&quot; will be given.

              testbox&gt;keyctl request2 user debug:hello wibble
              23
              testbox&gt;echo -n wibble | keyctl prequest2 user debug:hello
              23
              testbox&gt;keyctl request user debug:hello
              23

       (*) Update a key

       keyctl update &lt;key&gt; &lt;data&gt;
       keyctl pupdate &lt;key&gt;

       This command replaces the data attached to a key with a new set of  data.
       If  the  type of the key doesn&apos;t support update then error &quot;Operation not
       supported&quot; will be returned.

              testbox&gt;keyctl update 23 zebra

       The pupdate variant of the command reads the data from stdin rather  than
       taking it from the command line:

              testbox&gt;echo -n zebra | keyctl pupdate 23

       (*) Create a keyring

       keyctl newring &lt;name&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;

       This  command creates a new keyring of the specified name and attaches it
       to the specified keyring. The ID of the new keyring will  be  printed  to
       stdout if successful.
&#12;              testbox&gt;keyctl newring squelch @us
              27

       (*) Revoke a key

       keyctl revoke &lt;key&gt;

       This command marks a key as being revoked. Any further operations on that
       key (apart from unlinking it) will return error &quot;Key has been revoked&quot;.

              testbox&gt;keyctl revoke 26
              testbox&gt;keyctl describe 26
              keyctl_describe: Key has been revoked

       (*) Clear a keyring

       keyctl clear &lt;keyring&gt;

       This command unlinks all the keys  attached  to  the  specified  keyring.
       Error  &quot;Not  a  directory&quot; will be returned if the key specified is not a
       keyring.

              testbox&gt;keyctl clear 27

       (*) Link a key to a keyring

       keyctl link &lt;key&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;

       This command makes a link from the key to the keyring if  there&apos;s  enough
       capacity to do so. Error &quot;Not a directory&quot; will be returned if the desti&#8208;
       nation is not a keyring. Error &quot;Permission denied&quot; will  be  returned  if
       the  key  doesn&apos;t  have link permission or the keyring doesn&apos;t have write
       permission. Error &quot;File table overflow&quot; will be returned if  the  keyring
       is full. Error &quot;Resource deadlock avoided&quot; will be returned if an attempt
       was made to introduce a recursive link.

              testbox&gt;keyctl link 23 27
              testbox&gt;keyctl link 27 27
              keyctl_link: Resource deadlock avoided

       (*) Unlink a key from a keyring or the session keyring tree

       keyctl unlink &lt;key&gt; [&lt;keyring&gt;]

       If the keyring is specified, this command removes a link to the key  from
       the  keyring. Error &quot;Not a directory&quot; will be returned if the destination
       is not a keyring. Error &quot;Permission  denied&quot;  will  be  returned  if  the
       keyring  doesn&apos;t have write permission. Error &quot;No such file or directory&quot;
       will be returned if the key is not linked to by the keyring.

       If the keyring is not specified,  this  command  performs  a  depth-first
       search of the session keyring tree and removes all the links to the nomi&#8208;
       nated key that it finds (and that it is permitted to remove).  It  prints
       the number of successful unlinks before exiting.

              testbox&gt;keyctl unlink 23 27

       (*) Search a keyring

       keyctl search &lt;keyring&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt; [&lt;dest_keyring&gt;]

       This command non-recursively searches a keyring for a key of a particular
       type and description. If found, the ID of the key will be printed on std&#8208;
       out  and  the key will be attached to the destination keyring if present.
       Error &quot;Requested key not available&quot; will be returned if the  key  is  not
       found.

              testbox&gt;keyctl search @us user debug:hello
              23
              testbox&gt;keyctl search @us user debug:bye
              keyctl_search: Requested key not available

       (*) Read a key

       keyctl read &lt;key&gt;
       keyctl pipe &lt;key&gt;
       keyctl print &lt;key&gt;

       These commands read the payload of a key. &quot;read&quot; prints it on stdout as a
       hex dump, &quot;pipe&quot; dumps the raw data to stdout and  &quot;print&quot;  dumps  it  to
       stdout  directly  if  it&apos;s entirely printable or as a hexdump preceded by
       &quot;:hex:&quot; if not.

       If the key type does not support  reading  of  the  payload,  then  error
       &quot;Operation not supported&quot; will be returned.

              testbox&gt;keyctl read 26
              1 bytes of data in key:
              62
              testbox&gt;keyctl print 26
              b
              testbox&gt;keyctl pipe 26
              btestbox&gt;

       (*) List a keyring

       keyctl list &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl rlist &lt;keyring&gt;

       These  commands  list  the  contents of a key as a keyring. &quot;list&quot; pretty
       prints the contents and &quot;rlist&quot; just produces a space-separated  list  of
       key IDs.

       No attempt is made to check that the specified keyring is a keyring.

              testbox&gt;keyctl list @us
              2 keys in keyring:
                     22: vrwsl----------  4043    -1 keyring: _uid.4043
                     23: vrwsl----------  4043  4043 user: debug:hello
              testbox&gt;keyctl rlist @us
              22 23

       (*) Describe a key

       keyctl describe &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl rdescribe &lt;keyring&gt; [sep]

       These commands fetch a description of a keyring. &quot;describe&quot; pretty prints
       the description in the same fashion as the  &quot;list&quot;  command;  &quot;rdescribe&quot;
       prints the raw data returned from the kernel.

              testbox&gt;keyctl describe @us
                     -5:  vrwsl----------   4043     -1  keyring:  _uid_ses.4043
              testbox&gt;keyctl                    rdescribe                    @us
              keyring;4043;-1;3f1f0000;_uid_ses.4043

       The  raw  string is &quot;&lt;type&gt;;&lt;uid&gt;;&lt;gid&gt;;&lt;perms&gt;;&lt;description&gt;&quot;, where uid
       and gid are the decimal user and group IDs, perms is the permissions mask
       in  hex,  type  and description are the type name and description strings
       (neither of which will contain semicolons).

       (*) Change the access controls on a key

       keyctl chown &lt;key&gt; &lt;uid&gt;
       keyctl chgrp &lt;key&gt; &lt;gid&gt;

       These two commands change the UID and GID associated  with  evaluating  a
       key&apos;s  permissions  mask. The UID also governs which quota a key is taken
       out of.

       The chown command is not currently supported; attempting it will earn the
       error &quot;Operation not supported&quot; at best.

       For  non-superuser users, the GID may only be set to the process&apos;s GID or
       a GID in the process&apos;s groups list. The superuser  may  set  any  GID  it
       likes.

              testbox&gt;sudo keyctl chown 27 0
              keyctl_chown: Operation not supported
              testbox&gt;sudo keyctl chgrp 27 0

       (*) Set the permissions mask on a key

       keyctl setperm &lt;key&gt; &lt;mask&gt;

       This  command  changes the permission control mask on a key. The mask may
       be specified as a hex number if it begins &quot;0x&quot;, an  octal  number  if  it
       begins &quot;0&quot; or a decimal number otherwise.

       The hex numbers are a combination of:

              Possessor UID       GID       Other     Permission Granted
              ========  ========  ========  ========  ==================
              01000000  00010000  00000100  00000001  View

       View  permits  the  type, description and other parameters of a key to be
       viewed.

       Read permits the payload (or keyring list) to be read if supported by the
       type.

       Write permits the payload (or keyring list) to be modified or updated.

       Search  on  a  key  permits  it to be found when a keyring to which it is
       linked is searched.

       Link permits a key to be linked to a keyring.

       Set Attribute permits a key to have its owner, group membership,  permis&#8208;
       sions mask and timeout changed.

              testbox&gt;keyctl setperm 27 0x1f1f1f00

       (*) Start a new session with fresh keyrings

       keyctl session
       keyctl session - [&lt;prog&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; ...]
       keyctl session &lt;name&gt; [&lt;prog&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; ...]

       These commands join or create a new keyring and then run a shell or other
       program with that keyring as the session key.
&#12;       The variation with no arguments just creates an anonymous session keyring
       and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec&apos;s $SHELL.

       The variation with a dash in place of a name creates an anonymous session
       keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec&apos;s the sup&#8208;
       plied command, or $SHELL if one isn&apos;t supplied.

       The variation with a name supplied creates or joins the named keyring and
       attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec&apos;s  the  supplied  com&#8208;
       mand, or $SHELL if one isn&apos;t supplied.

              testbox&gt;keyctl rdescribe @s
              keyring;4043;-1;3f1f0000;_uid_ses.4043

              testbox&gt;keyctl session

              testbox&gt;keyctl rdescribe @s
              keyring;4043;4043;3f1f0000;_ses.24082

              testbox&gt;keyctl session -

              testbox&gt;keyctl session - keyctl rdescribe @s
              Joined session keyring: 30
              keyring;4043;4043;3f1f0000;_ses.24185

              testbox&gt;keyctl session fish

              testbox&gt;keyctl rdescribe @s
              keyring;4043;4043;3f1f0000;fish

              testbox&gt;keyctl session fish keyctl rdesc @s
              Joined session keyring: 35
              keyring;4043;4043;3f1f0000;fish

       (*) Instantiate a key

       keyctl instantiate &lt;key&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl pinstantiate &lt;key&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl negate &lt;key&gt; &lt;timeout&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;
       keyctl reject &lt;key&gt; &lt;timeout&gt; &lt;error&gt; &lt;keyring&gt;

       These commands are used to attach data to a partially set up key (as cre&#8208;
       ated by the kernel and passed to /sbin/request-key).  &quot;instantiate&quot; marks
       a  key as being valid and attaches the data as the payload.  &quot;negate&quot; and
       &quot;reject&quot; mark a key as invalid and sets a timeout on it so that it&apos;ll  go
       away  after  a while.  This prevents a lot of quickly sequential requests
       from slowing the system down overmuch when they all fail, as  all  subse&#8208;
       quent  requests  will  then fail with error &quot;Requested key not found&quot; (if
       negated) or the specified error (if rejected) until the negative key  has
       expired.

       Reject&apos;s  error  argument  can  either  be  a UNIX error number or one of
       &apos;rejected&apos;, &apos;expired&apos; or &apos;revoked&apos;.

       The newly instantiated key will be attached to the specified keyring.

       These commands may only be run from the program run by  request-key  -  a
       special  authorisation  key  is  set up by the kernel and attached to the
       request-key&apos;s session keyring. This special key is revoked once  the  key
       to which it refers has been instantiated one way or another.

              testbox&gt;keyctl instantiate $1 &quot;Debug $3&quot; $4
              testbox&gt;keyctl negate $1 30 $4
              testbox&gt;keyctl reject $1 30 64 $4

       The  pinstantiate variant of the command reads the data from stdin rather
       than taking it from the command line:

              testbox&gt;echo -n &quot;Debug $3&quot; | keyctl pinstantiate $1 $4

       (*) Set the expiry time on a key

       keyctl timeout &lt;key&gt; &lt;timeout&gt;

       This command is used to set the timeout on a key, or  clear  an  existing
       timeout  if the value specified is zero. The timeout is given as a number
       of seconds into the future.

              testbox&gt;keyctl timeout $1 45

       (*) Retrieve a key&apos;s security context

       keyctl security &lt;key&gt;

       This command is used to retrieve a key&apos;s LSM security context.  The label
       is printed on stdout.

              testbox&gt;keyctl security @s
              unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

       (*) Give the parent process a new session keyring

       keyctl new_session

       This  command  is used to give the invoking process (typically a shell) a
       new session keyring, discarding its old session keyring.

              testbox&gt; keyctl session foo
              Joined session keyring: 723488146
              testbox&gt; keyctl show
              Session Keyring
                     -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: foo
              testbox&gt; keyctl new_session
              490511412
              testbox&gt; keyctl show
              Session Keyring
                     -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: _ses

       Note that this affects the parent of the process that invokes the  system
       call,  and  so may only affect processes with matching credentials.  Fur&#8208;
       thermore, the change does not take effect till the  parent  process  next
       transitions  from  kernel space to user space - typically when the wait()
       system call returns.

       (*) Remove dead keys from the session keyring tree

       keyctl reap

       This command performs  a  depth-first  search  of  the  caller&apos;s  session
       keyring  tree  and attempts to unlink any key that it finds that is inac&#8208;
       cessible due to expiry, revocation, rejection or negation.  It  does  not
       attempt  to remove live keys that are unavailable simply due to a lack of
       granted permission.

       A key that is designated reapable will only be removed from a keyring  if
       the  caller  has Write permission on that keyring, and only keyrings that
       grant Search permission to the caller will be searched.

       The command prints the number of keys reaped before it exits.  If the  -v
       flag  is  passed then the reaped keys are listed as they&apos;re being reaped,
       together with the success or failure of the unlink.

       (*) Remove matching keys from the session keyring tree

       keyctl purge &lt;type&gt;
       keyctl purge [-i] [-p] &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt;
       keyctl purge -s &lt;type&gt; &lt;desc&gt;

       These commands perform a depth-first search to find matching keys in  the
       caller&apos;s session keyring tree and attempts to unlink them.  The number of
       keys successfully unlinked is printed at the end.

       The keyrings must grant Read and View permission  to  the  caller  to  be
       searched,  and  the  keys  to be removed must also grant View permission.
       Keys can only be removed from keyrings that grant Write permission.

       The first variant purges all keys of the specified type.

       The second variant purges all keys of the specified type that also  match
       the  given  description literally.  The -i flag allows a case-independent
       match and the -p flag allows a prefix match.

       The third variant purges all keys of  the  specified  type  and  matching
       description  using  the  key type&apos;s comparator in the kernel to match the
       description.  This permits the key type to match a key with a variety  of
       descriptions.

ERRORS
       There are a number of common errors returned by this program:

       &quot;Not a directory&quot; - a key wasn&apos;t a keyring.

       &quot;Requested key not found&quot; - the looked for key isn&apos;t available.

       &quot;Key has been revoked&quot; - a revoked key was accessed.

       &quot;Key has expired&quot; - an expired key was accessed.

       &quot;Permission  denied&quot;  -  permission was denied by a UID/GID/mask combina&#8208;
       tion.
