NAME
       keyctl - manipulate the kernel&apos;s key management facility

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;

       long keyctl(int cmd, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl() has a number of functions available:

       KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID
              Ask for a keyring&apos;s ID.

       KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING
              Join or start named session keyring.

       KEYCTL_UPDATE
              Update a key.

       KEYCTL_REVOKE
              Revoke a key.

       KEYCTL_CHOWN
              Set ownership of a key.

       KEYCTL_SETPERM
              Set perms on a key.

       KEYCTL_DESCRIBE
              Describe a key.

       KEYCTL_CLEAR
              Clear contents of a keyring.

       KEYCTL_LINK
              Link a key into a keyring.

       KEYCTL_UNLINK
              Unlink a key from a keyring.

       KEYCTL_SEARCH
              Search for a key in a keyring.

       KEYCTL_READ
              Read a key or keyring&apos;s contents.

       KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE
              Instantiate a partially constructed key.

       KEYCTL_NEGATE
              Negate a partially constructed key.

       KEYCTL_SET_REQKEY_KEYRING
              Set default request-key keyring.

       KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT
              Set timeout on a key.

       KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY
              Assume authority to instantiate key.
&#12;       These are wrapped by libkeyutils into individual functions to permit com&#8208;
       piler the compiler to check types.  See the See Also section at the  bot&#8208;
       tom.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success  keyctl()  returns the serial number of the key it found.  On
       error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set  to  an
       appropriate error.

ERRORS
       EACCES A key operation wasn&apos;t permitted.

       EDQUOT The  key quota for the caller&apos;s user would be exceeded by creating
              a key or linking it to the keyring.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              An expired key was found or specified.

       EKEYREJECTED
              A rejected key was found or specified.

       EKEYREVOKED
              A revoked key was found or specified.

       ENOKEY No matching key was found or an invalid key was specified.

LINKING
       Although this is a Linux system call, it is not present in libc  but  can
       be found rather in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be spec&#8208;
       ified to the linker.
