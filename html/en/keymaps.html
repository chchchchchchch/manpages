KEYMAPS(5)                                                            KEYMAPS(5)



NAME
       keymaps - keyboard table descriptions for loadkeys and dumpkeys

DESCRIPTION
       These files are used by loadkeys(1) to modify the translation tables used
       by the kernel keyboard driver and generated  by  dumpkeys(1)  from  those
       translation tables.

       The  format  of  these  files  is  vaguely similar to the one accepted by
       xmodmap(1).  The file consists of charset or  key  or  string  definition
       lines interspersed with comments.

       Comments  are  introduced with !  or # characters and continue to the end
       of the line. Anything following one of these characters on that  line  is
       ignored.  Note  that  comments  need  not  begin  from column one as with
       xmodmap(1).

       The syntax of keymap files is line oriented; a complete  definition  must
       fit  on  a single logical line. Logical lines can, however, be split into
       multiple physical lines by ending each subline with the backslash charac&#8208;
       ter (\).

INCLUDE FILES
       A keymap can include other keymaps using the syntax

              include &quot;pathname&quot;

CHARSET DEFINITIONS
       A character set definition line is of the form:

              charset &quot;iso-8859-x&quot;

       It  defines how following keysyms are to be interpreted.  For example, in
       iso-8859-1 the symbol mu (or micro) has code 0265,  while  in  iso-8859-7
       the letter mu has code 0354.

COMPLETE KEYCODE DEFINITIONS
       Each complete key definition line is of the form:

              keycode keynumber = keysym keysym keysym...

       keynumber  is  the  internal  identification  number  of the key, roughly
       equivalent to the scan code of it.  keynumber can be  given  in  decimal,
       octal  or  hexadecimal  notation.  Octal is denoted by a leading zero and
       hexadecimal by the prefix 0x.

       Each of the keysyms represent keyboard actions, of which up to 256 can be
       bound to a single key. The actions available include outputting character
       codes or character sequences, switching consoles or keymaps, booting  the
       machine  etc. (The complete list can be obtained from dumpkeys(1) by say&#8208;
       ing  dumpkeys -l .)

       Each keysym may be prefixed by a &apos;+&apos;  (plus  sign),  in  wich  case  this
       keysym  is treated as a &quot;letter&quot; and therefore affected by the &quot;CapsLock&quot;
       the same way as by &quot;Shift&quot; (to be correct, the CapsLock inverts the Shift
       state).   The  ASCII letters (&apos;a&apos;-&apos;z&apos; and &apos;A&apos;-&apos;Z&apos;) are made CapsLock&apos;able
       by default.  If Shift+CapsLock should not produce a  lower  case  symbol,
       put lines like

              keycode 30 = +a  A

       in the map file.

       Which  of  the  actions  bound to a given key is taken when it is pressed
       depends on what modifiers are in effect at  that  moment.   The  keyboard
       driver  supports  9  modifiers.  These  modifiers are labeled (completely
       arbitrarily) Shift, AltGr, Control, Alt, ShiftL, ShiftR, CtrlL, CtrlR and
       CapsShift.   Each of these modifiers has an associated weight of power of
       two according to the following table:

              modifier                weight

              Shift
                                        1
              AltGr
                                        2
              Control
                                        4
              Alt
                                        8
              ShiftL
                                       16
              ShiftR
                                       32
              CtrlL
                                       64
              CtrlR                   128
              CapsShift               256

       The effective action of a key is found out by adding up  the  weights  of
       all  the  modifiers in effect. By default, no modifiers are in effect, so
       action number zero, i.e. the one in the first column in a key  definition
       line,  is  taken when the key is pressed or released. When e.g. Shift and
       Alt modifiers are in effect, action number nine (from the 10th column) is
       the effective one.

       Changing  the  state  of  what modifiers are in effect can be achieved by
       binding appropriate key actions to desired keys. For example, binding the
       symbol  Shift to a key sets the Shift modifier in effect when that key is
       pressed and cancels the effect of that modifier when the key is released.
       Binding  AltGr_Lock to a key sets AltGr in effect when the key is pressed
       and cancels the effect when the key is pressed again.  (By default Shift,
       AltGr,  Control  and Alt are bound to the keys that bear a similar label;
       AltGr may denote the right Alt key.)

       Note that you should be very careful when binding the modifier keys, oth&#8208;
       erwise you can end up with an unusable keyboard mapping. If you for exam&#8208;
       ple define a key to have Control in its first column and leave  the  rest
       of  the  columns  to  be  VoidSymbols, you&apos;re in trouble. This is because
       pressing the key puts  Control  modifier  in  effect  and  the  following
       actions  are  looked  up from the fifth column (see the table above). So,
       when you release the key, the action from the fifth column is  taken.  It
       has  VoidSymbol  in  it,  so nothing happens. This means that the Control
       modifier is still in effect, although you have  released  the  key.   Re-
       pressing  and  releasing the key has no effect. To avoid this, you should
       always define all the columns to have the same modifier symbol. There  is
       a handy short-hand notation for this, see below.

       keysyms  can be given in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, unicode or symbolic
       notation.  The numeric notations use the same format as  with  keynumber.
       Unicode  notation  is &quot;U+&quot; followed by four hexadecimal digits.  The sym&#8208;
       bolic notation resembles that used by  xmodmap(1).   Notable  differences
       are  the  number symbols. The numeric symbols &apos;0&apos;, ..., &apos;9&apos; of xmodmap(1)
       are replaced with the corresponding words &apos;zero&apos;, &apos;one&apos;,  ...  &apos;nine&apos;  to
       avoid confusion with the numeric notation.

       It  should be noted that using numeric notation for the keysyms is highly
       unportable as the key action numbers may vary from one kernel version  to
       another  and  the  use of numeric notations is thus strongly discouraged.
       They are intended to be used only when you know there is a supported key&#8208;
       board action in your kernel for which your current version of loadkeys(1)
       has no symbolic name.

       There is a number of short-hand notations to add readability  and  reduce
       typing work and the probability of typing-errors.

       First of all, you can give a map specification line, of the form

              keymaps 0-2,4-5,8,12

       to  indicate  that  the lines of the keymap will not specify all 256 col&#8208;
       umns, but only the indicated ones.  (In  the  example:  only  the  plain,
       Shift,  AltGr, Control, Control+Shift, Alt and Control+Alt maps, that is,
       7 columns instead of 256.)  When no such line is given, the  keymaps  0-M
       will  be defined, where M+1 is the maximum number of entries found in any
       definition line.

       Next, you can leave off any trailing VoidSymbol entries from a key  defi&#8208;
       nition  line. VoidSymbol denotes a keyboard action which produces no out&#8208;
       put and has no other effects either. For example, to define key number 30
       to  output &apos;a&apos; unshifted, &apos;A&apos; when pressed with Shift and do nothing when
       pressed with AltGr or other modifiers, you can write

              keycode  30 = a     A

       instead of the more verbose

              keycode  30 = a     A    VoidSymbol     VoidSymbol \
                        VoidSymbol VoidSymbol VoidSymbol ...

       For added convenience, you can usually get off with still more terse def&#8208;
       initions.  If  you  enter a key definition line with only and exactly one
       action code after the equals sign, it has a special meaning. If the  code
       (numeric  or  symbolic)  is  not  an  ASCII  letter, it means the code is
       implicitly replicated through all columns  being  defined.   If,  on  the
       other  hand, the action code is an ASCII character in the range &apos;a&apos;, ...,
       &apos;z&apos; or &apos;A&apos;, ..., &apos;Z&apos; in the ASCII collating sequence, the following defi&#8208;
       nitions  are made for the different modifier combinations, provided these
       are actually being defined.  (The table lists  the  two  possible  cases:
       either  the  single action code is a lower case letter, denoted by &apos;x&apos; or
       an upper case letter, denoted by &apos;Y&apos;.)

           modifier                symbol

           none                    x              Y
           Shift                   X              y
           AltGr                   x              Y
           Shift+AltGr             X              y
           Control                 Control_x      Control_y
           Shift+Control           Control_x      Control_y
           AltGr+Control           Control_x      Control_y
           Shift+AltGr+Control     Control_x      Control_y
           Alt                     Meta_x         Meta_Y
           Shift+Alt               Meta_X         Meta_y
           AltGr+Alt               Meta_x         Meta_Y
           Shift+AltGr+Alt         Meta_X         Meta_y
           Control+Alt             Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           Shift+Control+Alt       Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           AltGr+Control+Alt       Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           Shift+AltGr+Control+Alt Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y

SINGLE MODIFIER DEFINITIONS
       All the previous forms of key definition lines always define all the  M+1
       possible  modifier  combinations being defined, whether the line actually
       contains that many action codes or not.  There is, however,  a  variation
       of the definition syntax for defining only single actions to a particular
       modifier combination of a key. This is especially useful, if you  load  a
       keymap which doesn&apos;t match your needs in only some modifier combinations,
       like AltGr+function keys. You can then make a small local file redefining
       only those modifier combinations and loading it after the main file.  The
       syntax of this form is:

       { plain | &lt;modifier sequence&gt; } keycode keynumber = keysym

       , e.g.,
              plain keycode 14 = BackSpace
              control alt keycode 83 = Boot
              alt keycode 105 = Decr_Console
              alt keycode 106 = Incr_Console
       Using &quot;plain&quot; will define only the base entry of a key (i.e. the one with
       no  modifiers in effect) without affecting the bindings of other modifier
       combinations of that key.

STRING DEFINITIONS
       In addition to comments and key definition lines, a  keymap  can  contain
       string  definitions.  These  are  used  to  define what each function key
       action code sends. The syntax of string definitions is:

              string keysym = &quot;text&quot;

       text can contain literal characters, octal character codes in the  format
       of  backslash  followed by up to three octal digits, and the three escape
       sequences \n, \\, and \&quot;, for newline, backslash and quote, respectively.

COMPOSE DEFINITIONS
       Then there may also be compose definitions. They have syntax

              compose &apos;char&apos; &apos;char&apos; to &apos;char&apos;
       and describe how two bytes are combined to form a third one (when a  dead
       accent or compose key is used).  This is used to get accented letters and
       the like on a standard keyboard.

ABBREVIATIONS
       Various abbreviations can be used with kbd-0.96 and later.

       strings as usual
              Defines the usual values of the strings (but not the keys they are
              bound to).

       compose as usual for &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
              Defines the usual compose combinations.

       To  find out what keysyms there are available for use in keymaps, use the
       command

              dumpkeys --long-info

       Unfortunately, there is currently no  description  of  what  each  symbol
       does.  It  has to be guessed from the name or figured out from the kernel
       sources.

EXAMPLES
       (Be careful to use a keymaps line, like the first line of `dumpkeys`,  or
       &quot;keymaps 0-15&quot; or so.)

       The  following entry exchanges the left Control key and the Caps Lock key
       on the keyboard:

              keycode  58 = Control
              keycode  29 = Caps_Lock

       Key number 58 is normally the Caps Lock key, and key number  29  is  nor&#8208;
       mally the Control key.

       The  following  entry  sets  the  Shift and Caps Lock keys to behave more
       nicely, like in older typewriters. That is, pressing Caps Lock  key  once
       or  more  sets  the keyboard in CapsLock state and pressing either of the
       Shift keys releases it.

              keycode  42 = Uncaps_Shift
              keycode  54 = Uncaps_Shift
              keycode  58 = Caps_On

       The following entry sets the layout of the edit pad in the enhanced  key&#8208;
       board to be more like that in the VT200 series terminals:

              keycode 102 = Insert
              keycode 104 = Remove
              keycode 107 = Prior
              shift keycode 107 = Scroll_Backward
              keycode 110 = Find
              keycode 111 = Select
              control alt   keycode 111 = Boot
              control altgr keycode 111 = Boot

       Here&apos;s  an  example  to bind the string &quot;du\ndf\n&quot; to the key AltGr-D. We
       use the &quot;spare&quot; action code F100 not normally bound to any key.

              altgr keycode 32 = F100
              string F100 = &quot;du\ndf\n&quot;
