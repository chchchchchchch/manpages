KILL(1)                           User Commands                          KILL(1)



NAME
       kill - send a signal to a process

SYNOPSIS
       kill [options] &lt;pid&gt; [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The default signal for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available sig&#8208;
       nals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT,  KILL,  STOP,  CONT,
       and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in three ways: -9, -SIGKILL or
       -KILL.  Negative PID values may be used to choose whole  process  groups;
       see  the  PGID  column  in ps command output.  A PID of -1 is special; it
       indicates all processes except the kill process itself and init.

OPTIONS
       &lt;pid&gt; [...]
              Send signal to every &lt;pid&gt; listed.

       -&lt;signal&gt;
       -s &lt;signal&gt;
       --signal &lt;signal&gt;
              Specify the signal to be sent.  The signal  can  be  specified  by
              using  name  or  number.   The behavior of signals is explained in
              signal(7) manual page.

       -l, --list [signal]
              List signal names.  This option has optional argument, which  will
              convert signal number to signal name, or other way round.

       -L, --table
              List signal names in a nice table.


       NOTES  Your  shell  (command  line  interpreter) may have a built-in kill
              command.  You may need  to  run  the  command  described  here  as
              /bin/kill to solve the conflict.

EXAMPLES
       kill -9 -1
              Kill all processes you can kill.

       kill -l 11
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       kill -L
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       kill 123 543 2341 3453
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.

STANDARDS
       This command meets appropriate standards. The -L flag is Linux-specific.

AUTHOR
       Albert  Cahalan  &#10216;albert@users.sf.net&#10217;  wrote  kill  in 1999 to replace a
       bsdutils one that was not standards compliant.  The util-linux one  might
       also work correctly.
