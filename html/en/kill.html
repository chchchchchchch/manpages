KILL(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    KILL(2)



NAME
       kill - send signal to a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       kill(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  kill()  system  call  can  be used to send any signal to any process
       group or process.

       If pid is positive, then signal sig is sent to the process  with  the  ID
       specified by pid.

       If  pid  equals 0, then sig is sent to every process in the process group
       of the calling process.

       If pid equals -1, then sig is sent to every process for which the calling
       process  has permission to send signals, except for process 1 (init), but
       see below.

       If pid is less than -1, then sig is sent to every process in the  process
       group whose ID is -pid.

       If  sig  is  0,  then no signal is sent, but error checking is still per&#8208;
       formed; this can be used to check for the existence of a  process  ID  or
       process group ID.

       For a process to have permission to send a signal it must either be priv&#8208;
       ileged (under Linux: have the CAP_KILL capability), or the real or effec&#8208;
       tive  user  ID  of  the sending process must equal the real or saved set-
       user-ID of the target process.  In the case of SIGCONT it  suffices  when
       the sending and receiving processes belong to the same session.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success  (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned.  On error,
       -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.

       EPERM  The process does not have permission to send the signal to any  of
              the target processes.

       ESRCH  The  pid  or  process group does not exist.  Note that an existing
              process might be a zombie, a process which already committed  ter&#8208;
              mination, but has not yet been wait(2)ed for.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the init process, are
       those for which init has explicitly installed signal handlers.   This  is
       done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.
&#12;       POSIX.1-2001  requires  that  kill(-1,sig) send sig to all processes that
       the calling process may send signals to, except possibly for some  imple&#8208;
       mentation-defined  system  processes.   Linux  allows a process to signal
       itself, but on Linux the call kill(-1,sig) does not  signal  the  calling
       process.

       POSIX.1-2001 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself, and the
       sending thread does not have the signal blocked, and no other thread  has
       it  unblocked  or is waiting for it in sigwait(3), at least one unblocked
       signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the kill() returns.

   Linux Notes
       Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules  for
       the  permissions required for an unprivileged process to send a signal to
       another process.  In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if  the
       effective user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver, or the real
       user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver.   From  kernel  1.2.3
       until  1.3.77,  a  signal  could  be sent if the effective user ID of the
       sender matched either the real or effective user ID of the receiver.  The
       current  rules,  which  conform  to  POSIX.1-2001, were adopted in kernel
       1.3.78.

BUGS
       In 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.7, there was a bug that meant that
       when  sending  signals  to  a process group, kill() failed with the error
       EPERM if the caller did have permission to send the signal to any (rather
       than  all)  of  the  members  of the process group.  Notwithstanding this
       error return, the signal was still delivered to all of the processes  for
       which the caller had permission to signal.
