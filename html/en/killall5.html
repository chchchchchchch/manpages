KILLALL5(8)            Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual           KILLALL5(8)



NAME
       killall5 -- send a signal to all processes.

SYNOPSIS
       killall5   -signalnumber  [-o  omitpid[,omitpid..]]   [-o  omitpid[,omit&#8208;
       pid..]..]

DESCRIPTION
       killall5 is the SystemV killall command. It sends a signal  to  all  pro&#8208;
       cesses  except kernel threads and the processes in its own session, so it
       won&apos;t kill the shell that is running the script it was called  from.  Its
       primary  (only)  use is in the rc scripts found in the /etc/init.d direc&#8208;
       tory.

OPTIONS
       -o omitpid
              Tells killall5 to omit processes with that process id.

NOTES
       killall5 can also be invoked as pidof, which is simply a (symbolic)  link
       to the killall5 program.

EXIT STATUS
       The  program  return  zero  if  it  killed  processes.  It return 2 if no
       process were killed, and 1 if it was unable to find any processes (/proc/
       is missing).

SEE ALSO
       halt(8), reboot(8), pidof(8)
