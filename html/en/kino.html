NAME
       kino - non-linear editing of Digital Video data

SYNOPSIS
       kino [ ( file | playlist ) ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       kino  allows  you  to import movies from DV camcorders, to edit, and play
       them.  file may be a DV encoded file that  will  be  loaded  at  startup.
       Alternatively,  you can specify a SMIL playlist of DV files that was pre&#8208;
       viously created with kino.

       DV is a special kind of video encoding, commonly  used  in  digital  cam&#8208;
       corders.   Differently  coded movies, like DivX or mjpeg, need to be con&#8208;
       verted to DV before they can be fed into kino.

       A video file either holds the raw DV-coded data, or wraps it in a certain
       container  format. Kino currently supports AVI, and QuickTime containers,
       and distinguishes  between  the  different  formats  by  file  extension.
       Therefore,  file names need to end in .dv or .dif for raw files, .avi for
       AVI, and .mov for QuickTime files, respectively. Anything else is treated
       as a SMIL playlist.

KEYSTROKES
       Unlike  other  editors, kino uses many keyboard commands for fast naviga&#8208;
       tion and editing inside the movie.  It acts on  frames  that  are  single
       images  from a movie, scenes that are defined as groupings of one or more
       frames with recording times differing by no more  than  one  second,  and
       movies  that  are  groups of one or more scenes. The following keystrokes
       can be used for moving and editing. Some of them are  also  available  as
       buttons  in  a graphical menu bar. (Also note the deliberate similarities
       between kino commands and the text editor vi.) The following is  a  brief
       list  of  the  commands.  A more complete list is available in the online
       help.
