KINO2RAW(1)                                                          KINO2RAW(1)



NAME
       kino2raw - output a Kino SMIL as raw DV to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       kino2raw smil-file [ ( aspect | normalisation ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       kino2raw  reads a smil-file created by kino and the video files it refer&#8208;
       ences and outputs the presentation as raw DV to  stdout  suitable  for  a
       pipe.

OPTIONS
       kino2raw optionally accepts a metadata option that outputs the meta value
       as text on stdout instead of the raw DV. It only outputs raw  DV  in  the
       absence of a metadata option. There are currently two metadata options:

       aspect returns the display aspect ratio of the movie based upon the first
              frame as either &quot;4:3&quot; or &quot;16:9&quot;

       normalisation
              returns the video standard of the movie based upon the  the  first
              frame as either &quot;ntsc&quot; or &quot;pal&quot;
