SYSLOG(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  SYSLOG(2)



NAME
       syslog,  klogctl - read and/or clear kernel message ring buffer; set con&#8208;
       sole_loglevel

SYNOPSIS
       int syslog(int type, char *bufp, int len);
                       /* No wrapper provided in glibc */

       /* The glibc interface */
       #include &lt;sys/klog.h&gt;

       int klogctl(int type, char *bufp, int len);

DESCRIPTION
       If you need the C library function syslog() (which talks to  syslogd(8)),
       then  look  at syslog(3).  The system call of this name is about control&#8208;
       ling the kernel printk() buffer, and the glibc wrapper function is called
       klogctl().

       The  type  argument determines the action taken by this function, as fol&#8208;
       lows:

             0 -- Close the log.  Currently a NOP.
             1 -- Open the log. Currently a NOP.
             2 -- Read from the log.
             3 -- Read all messages remaining in the ring buffer.
             4 -- Read and clear all messages remaining in the ring buffer
             5 -- Clear ring buffer.
             6 -- Disable printk to console
             7 -- Enable printk to console
             8 -- Set level of messages printed to console
             9 -- Return number of unread characters in the log buffer
            10 -- Return size of the log buffer

       Type 9 was added in Linux 2.4.10; type 10 in Linux 2.6.6.

       In Linux kernels before 2.6.37, only command types 3 and 10  are  allowed
       to  unprivileged  processes.   Since Linux 2.6.37, command types 3 and 10
       are  only   allowed   to   unprivileged   processes   if   /proc/sys/ker&#8208;
       nel/dmesg_restrict  has  the  value 0.  Before Linux 2.6.37, &quot;privileged&quot;
       means that the caller has  the  CAP_SYS_ADMIN  capability.   Since  Linux
       2.6.37,  &quot;privileged&quot;  means that the caller has either the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
       capability (now deprecated for this  purpose)  or  the  (new)  CAP_SYSLOG
       capability.

   The kernel log buffer
       The  kernel  has  a cyclic buffer of length LOG_BUF_LEN in which messages
       given as arguments to the kernel function printk() are stored (regardless
       of  their  loglevel).   In early kernels, LOG_BUF_LEN had the value 4096;
       from kernel 1.3.54, it was 8192; from kernel 2.1.113 it was 16384;  since
       2.4.23/2.6 the value is a kernel configuration option.  In recent kernels
       the size can be queried with command type 10.

       The  call  syslog(2,buf,len)  waits  until  this  kernel  log  buffer  is
       nonempty,  and  then  reads  at  most  len bytes into the buffer buf.  It
       returns the number of bytes read.  Bytes read from the log disappear from
       the log buffer: the information can only be read once.  This is the func&#8208;
       tion executed by the kernel when a user program reads /proc/kmsg.

       The call syslog(3,buf,len) will read the last len bytes from the log buf&#8208;
       fer  (nondestructively), but will not read more than was written into the
       buffer since the last &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; command (which does  not  clear
       the buffer at all).  It returns the number of bytes read.

       The call syslog(4,buf,len) does precisely the same, but also executes the
       &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; command.

       The call syslog(5,dummy,dummy) executes just the &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; com&#8208;
       mand.   (In  each call where buf or len is shown as &quot;dummy&quot;, the value of
       the argument is ignored by the call.)

       The call syslog(6,dummy,dummy) sets the console log level to minimum,  so
       that no messages are printed to the console.

       The  call syslog(7,dummy,dummy) sets the console log level to default, so
       that messages are printed to the console.

       The call syslog(8,dummy,level) sets the console log level to level, which
       must be an integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive).  See the loglevel section
       for details.

       The call syslog(9,dummy,dummy) returns  the  number  of  bytes  currently
       available to be read on the kernel log buffer.

       The  call syslog(10,dummy,dummy) returns the total size of the kernel log
       buffer.

   The loglevel
       The kernel routine printk() will only print a message on the console,  if
       it  has  a loglevel less than the value of the variable console_loglevel.
       This variable initially has the value DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL  (7),  but
       is set to 10 if the kernel command line contains the word &quot;debug&quot;, and to
       15 in case of a kernel fault (the 10 and 15 are just silly,  and  equiva&#8208;
       lent  to  8).   This variable is set (to a value in the range 1-8) by the
       call syslog(8,dummy,value).  The calls syslog(type,dummy,dummy) with type
       equal to 6 or 7, set it to 1 (kernel panics only) or 7 (all except debug&#8208;
       ging messages), respectively.

       Every text line in a  message  has  its  own  loglevel.   This  level  is
       DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL  - 1 (6) unless the line starts with &lt;d&gt; where d
       is a digit in the range 1-7, in which case the level is d.   The  conven&#8208;
       tional meaning of the loglevel is defined in &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; as follows:

       #define KERN_EMERG    &quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;  /* system is unusable               */
       #define KERN_ALERT    &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;  /* action must be taken immediately */
       #define KERN_CRIT     &quot;&lt;2&gt;&quot;  /* critical conditions              */
       #define KERN_ERR      &quot;&lt;3&gt;&quot;  /* error conditions                 */
       #define KERN_WARNING  &quot;&lt;4&gt;&quot;  /* warning conditions               */
       #define KERN_NOTICE   &quot;&lt;5&gt;&quot;  /* normal but significant condition */
       #define KERN_INFO     &quot;&lt;6&gt;&quot;  /* informational                    */
       #define KERN_DEBUG    &quot;&lt;7&gt;&quot;  /* debug-level messages             */

RETURN VALUE
       For  type  equal to 2, 3, or 4, a successful call to syslog() returns the
       number of bytes read.  For type 9, syslog() returns the number  of  bytes
       currently  available  to  be read on the kernel log buffer.  For type 10,
       syslog() returns the total size of the kernel log buffer.  For other val&#8208;
       ues of type, 0 is returned on success.

       In case of error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL Bad  arguments  (e.g.,  bad  type;  or for type 2, 3, or 4, buf is
              NULL, or len is less than zero; or for type 8, the level  is  out&#8208;
              side the range 1 to 8).

       ENOSYS This syslog() system call is not available, because the kernel was
              compiled with the CONFIG_PRINTK kernel-configuration  option  dis&#8208;
              abled.

       EPERM  An attempt was made to change console_loglevel or clear the kernel
              message ring buffer by  a  process  without  sufficient  privilege
              (more  precisely: without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYSLOG capabil&#8208;
              ity).

       ERESTARTSYS
              System call was interrupted by a signal; nothing was read.   (This
              can be seen only during a trace.)

CONFORMING TO
       This  system  call  is  Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       From the very start people noted that it is  unfortunate  that  a  system
       call  and  a library routine of the same name are entirely different ani&#8208;
       mals.
