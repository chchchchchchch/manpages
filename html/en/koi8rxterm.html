koi8rxterm(1)                                                      koi8rxterm(1)



NAME
       koi8rxterm - X terminal emulator for KOI8-R environments

SYNOPSIS
       koi8rxterm [ xterm-options ]

DESCRIPTION
       koi8rxterm is a wrapper around the xterm(1) program that invokes the lat&#8208;
       ter program with the &#8216;KOI8RXTerm&#8217; X resource class set.  All arguments to
       koi8rxterm  are  passed  to  xterm without processing; the -class and -k8
       options should not be specified because they are  used  by  the  wrapper.
       See the xterm manual page for more information on xterm-options.

       The  environment&apos;s  locale settings (see &#8220;ENVIRONMENT&#8221; below) are used to
       discern the locale&apos;s character set.  If no current locale can  be  deter&#8208;
       mined,  the  locale  &#8216;ru_RU.KOI8-R&#8217;  (the Russian language as used in the
       territory of Russia, with the KOI8-R  character  set)  is  assumed.   The
       locale(1)  utility  is  used to determine whether the system supports the
       selected locale.  If it does not, koi8rxterm will exit with an error  and
       report the output of locale.

       Note:  koi8rxterm may produce unexpected results if the current locale is
       set to one in which the KOI8-R character encoding is not supported, or if
       fonts  using  that encoding are not available.  In the Debian system, the
       &#8216;xfonts-cyrillic&#8217; package provides the  fonts  that  koi8rxterm  uses  by
       default.   To  change  the  fonts koi8rxterm uses, edit the /etc/X11/app-
       defaults/KOI8RXTerm file.

       A similar wrapper, uxterm(1), is available  for  Unicode  UTF-8  environ&#8208;
       ments.

ENVIRONMENT
       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
              The  values of these variables are checked, in order, to determine
              the character set used by the current locale.

AUTHOR
       koi8rxterm was written by Branden Robinson and is very heavily  based  on
       uxterm,  by Thomas Dickey.  The assistance of Jurij Smakov was invaluable
       in sanity-checking its operation.
