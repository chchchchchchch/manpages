KPARTX(8)                 Linux Administrator&apos;s Manual                 KPARTX(8)



NAME
       kpartx - Create device maps from partition tables

SYNOPSIS
       kpartx [-a | -d | -l] [-v] wholedisk

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool,  derived  from  util-linux&apos;  partx, reads partition tables on
       specified  device  and  create  device  maps  over  partitions   segments
       detected.  It  is called from hotplug upon device maps creation and dele&#8208;
       tion.

OPTIONS
       -a     Add partition mappings

       -r     Readonly partition mappings

       -r     Read-only partition mappings

       -d     Delete partition mappings

       -u     Update partition mappings

       -l     List partition mappings that would be added -a

       -p     set device name-partition number delimiter

       -f     force creation of mappings; overrides &apos;no_partitions&apos; feature

       -g     force GUID partition table (GPT)

       -v     Operate verbosely

       -s     Sync mode. Don&apos;t return until the partitions are created

EXAMPLE
       To mount all the partitions in a raw disk image:

              kpartx -av disk.img

       This will output lines such as:

              loop3p1 : 0 20964762 /dev/loop3 63

       The loop3p1 is the name of a device file under /dev/mapper which you  can
       use to access the partition, for example to fsck it:

              fsck /dev/mapper/loop3p1

       When you&apos;re done, you need to remove the devices:

              kpartx -d disk.img
