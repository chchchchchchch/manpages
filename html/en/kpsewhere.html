NAME
       kpsewhere  -  Expanding  kpsewhich  to separately iterate over each texmf
       tree listed in $TEXMF.

SYNOPSIS
       kpsewhere  [ kpsewhich-OPTIONS... ] COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       kpsewhere is an extension to kpsewhich (as where is for which  in  tcsh).
       The  intention is to provide a way to check for conflicts/shadowed files.
       It will, however, only find one file per TEXMF tree.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              show a short help message

       *      all other options are directly handed to kpsewhich
