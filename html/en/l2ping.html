L2PING(8)                  Linux System Administration                 L2PING(8)



NAME
       l2ping - Send L2CAP echo request and receive answer

SYNOPSIS
       l2ping [-i &lt;hciX&gt;] [-s size] [-c count] [-t timeout] [-d delay] [-f] [-r]
       [-v] bd_addr


DESCRIPTION
       L2ping sends a L2CAP echo request to the Bluetooth  MAC  address  bd_addr
       given in dotted hex notation.

OPTIONS
       -i &lt;hciX&gt;
              The  command is applied to device hciX , which must be the name of
              an installed Bluetooth device (X = 0, 1, 2, ...)   If  not  speci&#8208;
              fied,  the  command  will be sent to the first available Bluetooth
              device.

       -s size
              The size of the data packets to be sent.

       -c count
              Send count number of packets then exit.

       -t timeout
              Wait timeout seconds for the response.

       -d delay
              Wait delay seconds between pings.

       -f     Kind of flood ping. Use with  care!  It  reduces  the  delay  time
              between packets to 0.

       -r     Reverse ping (gnip?). Send echo response instead of echo request.

       -v     Verify response payload is identical to request payload. It is not
              required for remote stacks to return the request payload, but most
              stacks do (including Bluez).

       bd_addr
              The Bluetooth MAC address to be pinged in dotted hex notation like
              01:02:03:ab:cd:ef or 01:EF:cd:aB:02:03
