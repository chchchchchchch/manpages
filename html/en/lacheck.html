LaCheck(1)                                                            LaCheck(1)



NAME
       lacheck - A consistency checker for LaTeX documents.

SYNOPSIS
       lacheck filename [ .tex ]

DESCRIPTION
       LaCheck is a general purpose consistency checker for LaTeX documents.  It
       reads a LaTeX document and displays warning messages,  if  it  finds  bad
       sequences.  It  should  be  noted,  that  the badness is very subjective.
       LaCheck is designed to help find  common  mistakes  in  LaTeX  documents,
       especially those made by beginners.

       The things checked are:

       Mismatched  groups (braces), environments and math mode delimiters.  When
       a mismatch is found, line numbers for both start and end of the  mismatch
       is  given.  The  error messages comes in pairs, one for the end match and
       one for the beginning, marked with `&lt;-&#180; and `-&gt;&#180; respectively.

       Bad spacing including missing a `\ &#180; after an  abbreviation,  missing  an
       `\@&#180; before a punctuation mark in a paragraph that is ended by an capital
       letter, double spaces like `  &#180;, bad usage of ellipsis  (like  using  ...
       instead  of \ldots, or using \ldots where \cdots should be used), missing
       before a \cite or \ref commands, space before footnotes,  italic  correc&#8208;
       tions before comma, point, or italic text, italic correction after normal
       text, missing italic correction when  switching  from  italic  to  normal
       text, and double italic correction.

       Badly  placed  punctuation marks around end of math mode delimiters. This
       is, punctuation placed right after display math end or punctuation placed
       right before text math end.  Sequences of whitespace followed by punctua&#8208;
       tion marks are also caught.

       Bad use of quotation characters, i.e. constructs like &quot;&#180;word&quot; or  &quot;word`&quot;
       are  warned  about, tabs in verbatim environments are caught, certain TeX
       primitives are frowned upon, attempts to give font  specifiers  arguments
       such as \em{text} are noted, and use of @ in LaTeX macros are reported.

       LaCheck  will  read files that are input using \input or \include.  Files
       with suffix `.sty&#180; are omitted, as they probably will  cause  LaCheck  to
       crash.

       LaCheck may be invoked from within Emacs(1) using compile:

       To  run:  M-x  compile RET lacheck RET , and then C-x ` to parse the mes&#8208;
       sages


OUTPUT
       The output is UNIX-error like, and may be parsed using  Emacs(1)  compile
       mode. Here is a sample:

       lacheck compiler
       &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 34: missing `\\\\ &#180; after &quot;etc.&quot;
       &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 179: double space at &quot; ~&quot;
       &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 186: &lt;- unmatched &quot;}&quot;
       &quot;/usr/mef/compiler.tex&quot;, line 181: -&gt; unmatched &quot;$$&quot;

       A control space `\ &#180; should be inserted at line 34, to prevent an end-of-
       sentence space.  Also, at line 179, the first space of the sequence &quot;  ~&quot;
       should  probably be deleted.  The last two lines is an example, where the
       user mistyped, and probably inserted an extra &quot;}&quot; somewhere.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Some special cases should be explained. In cases where  a  sentence  ends
       with  something  that  LaCheck  thinks is an abbreviation an missing `\ &#180;
       error may also occur, if the following sentence begins with  a  lowercase
       letter.

       A  mismatch  error may cause more to follow, due to the chosen algorithm.
       In such cases just correct the first error and run LaCheck again

       Braces, environments and math mode must be balanced within a file.

       LaCheck may be confused by unmatched stuff  placed  inside  verbatim-like
       environments called something else than exactly `verbatim&#180;.

FILES
       /usr/bin/lacheck

SEE ALSO
       tex(1), emacs(1), latex(1)

BUGS
       LaCheck  gets  confused  by  advanced macros, is fooled by simple macros,
       can&apos;t figure out if you use a non-standard way to  switch  italic  on  or
       off,  does  not like TeX at all, does not provide any options to turn off
       specific warnings, and is at best a crude approximation.

       Ideas for improvements and bug reports are very welcome.  Such should  be
       directed  to  the  maintainers,  their email address is &lt;auc-tex_mgr@sun&#8208;
