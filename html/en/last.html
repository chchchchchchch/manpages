LAST,LASTB(1)          Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual         LAST,LASTB(1)



NAME
       last, lastb - show listing of last logged in users

SYNOPSIS
       last  [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [-adFiowx] [ -f file ] [ -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS ]
       [name...]  [tty...]
       lastb [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [ -f file ] [-adFiowx] [name...]  [tty...]

DESCRIPTION
       Last searches back through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated
       by  the  -f  flag)  and  displays a list of all users logged in (and out)
       since that file was created.  Names of users and tty&apos;s can be  given,  in
       which  case  last  will  show  only those entries matching the arguments.
       Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0.

       When last catches a SIGINT signal (generated by the interrupt  key,  usu&#8208;
       ally  control-C)  or a SIGQUIT signal (generated by the quit key, usually
       control-\), last will show how far it has searched through the  file;  in
       the case of the SIGINT signal last will then terminate.

       The  pseudo  user  reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted.  Thus
       last reboot will show a log of all reboots since the log  file  was  cre&#8208;
       ated.

       Lastb  is  the same as last, except that by default it shows a log of the
       file /var/log/btmp, which contains all the bad login attempts.

OPTIONS
       -f file
              Tells last to use a specific file instead of /var/log/wtmp.

       -num   This is a count telling last how many lines to show.

       -n num The same.

       -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
              Display the state of logins as of the  specified  time.   This  is
              useful,  e.g., to determine easily who was logged in at a particu&#8208;
              lar time -- specify that time with -t and look for  &quot;still  logged
              in&quot;.

       -R     Suppresses the display of the hostname field.

       -a     Display  the  hostname  in  the last column. Useful in combination
              with the next flag.

       -d     For non-local logins, Linux stores not only the host name  of  the
              remote  host but its IP number as well. This option translates the
              IP number back into a hostname.

       -F     Print full login and logout times and dates.

       -i     This option is like -d in that it displays the IP  number  of  the
              remote  host,  but  it  displays the IP number in numbers-and-dots
              notation.

       -o     Read an old-type wtmp file (written by linux-libc5 applications).

       -w     Display full user and domain names in the output.

       -x     Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.
&#12;NOTES
       The files wtmp and btmp might not be found. The system only logs informa&#8208;
       tion  in  these  files if they are present. This is a local configuration
       issue. If you want the files to be used, they can be created with a  sim&#8208;
       ple touch(1) command (for example, touch /var/log/wtmp).

FILES
       /var/log/wtmp
       /var/log/btmp
