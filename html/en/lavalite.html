DESCRIPTION
       The lavalite program displays a 3D simulation of the famous lamp  of  the
       same name.  It requires a fast computer with fast OpenGL support.

OPTIONS
       lavalite accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -style style
               Specify which model of lamp to draw.  Available models are: Clas&#8208;
               sic, Giant, Cone, and Rocket.  Default: random.

       -spin xyz
               Around which axes the model should auto-spin.  Defaults  to  &quot;Z&quot;,
               meaning it rotates horizontally, but otherwise pitch or roll.

       -no-spin
               Same as -spin &apos;&apos;.

       -speed float
               A number controlling the frequency at which new blobs launch: you
               can think of this as being related to the the heat of the  light&#8208;
               bulb in the base.  Default: 0.003.

       -delay usecs
               The  delay between steps of the animation; default is 30000 (0.03
               second.)

       -resolution integer
               The size of the grid from which the mesh is created that is  used
               to  polygonize  the  blobs.   higher values will give very smooth
               looking blobs, at the expense of speed.  Default: 40.

               The options &quot;-resolution 10 -no-smooth&quot; look kind of interesting.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -count integer
               The maximum number of blobs  that  can  be  in  motion  at  once.
               Default: 3.

       -no-smooth
               Turn off smoothing: the objects in the scene will be facetted.
&#12;       -wireframe
               Render all objects in wireframe instead of as solids.

       -impatient
               Provide  this option if you are.  This will pre-warm the lamp, so
               when it starts up, the first frame will show a blob already half&#8208;
               way up the lamp.

       -lava-color color
               Specifies the color of the blobbies.  Default: red.

       -fluid-color color
               Specifies  the  color  of  the  fluid that the blobbies float in.
               Default: light blue.

       -base-color color
               Specifies the color of the lamp base, and the cap on top  of  the
               bottle.  Default: very dark gray.

       -table-color color
               Specifies  the  color  of  the table that the lamp is sitting on.
               Default: black (meaning it is invisible.)

       -fluid-texture filename
               An image file to wrap around the glass.

               Note that on most systems, GL textures must have dimensions  that
               are a power of two.

               Note  also  that colors and textures are both applied: so, if you
               apply a texture and it isn&apos;t showing up, try specifying the  cor&#8208;
               responding  color  as &quot;white&quot;.  Otherwise, the combination of the
               two might be too dark to see.

       -base-texture filename
               An image file to wrap around the base of the lamp, and the cap on
               top of the bottle.

       -table-texture texture
               An image file to spread across the table that the lamp is sitting
               on.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
