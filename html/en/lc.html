NAME
       lc - Mono License Compiler

SYNOPSIS
       lc  -c  filename -t targetassembly [-i reference...] [-v] [-o outputpath]
       [-nologo]

DESCRIPTION
       lc tool  is  a  license  compiler  for  Mono.  It&apos;s  used  to  convert  a
       licenses.licx file to a resource that can be embedded into an executable.

       When  using  commercial  components for .NET they often require a license
       resource at runtime to make sure the developer was licensed to  use  this
       control.  The  most  common way of making sure the component was properly
       licensed is by using license resources. At  compile  time  the  developer
       uses  the  lc  tool  to  convert  a  licenses.licx  file  to  a  program&#8208;
       name.exe.licenses file and embed that as a managed resource during compi&#8208;
       lation.

RUNTIME OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       --complist=filename, -c filename
              This  option  is used to specify the input file, the licenses.licx
              file to create a license reesource for. This option  is  required.
              The  license  compiler will read each line in this file and try to
              load the types specified on that line.

       --target=assemblyname, -t targetassembly
              full assembly name with file extension for  the  target  assembly.
              The  license  compiler  uses  this  as  a  key  when compiling the
              licenses. It has to match the assembly the resource will be embed&#8208;
              ded in. This option is required.

       --load=reference, -i reference
              Assembly  reference  to  load  before trying to compile a license.
              This option is needed for assemblies where the references are  not
              in  the  gac.  Compilers should pass all references to the license
              compiler.

       --verbose,, -v
              Gives more verbose output about the license compiling process.

       --help, -h
              Displays usage instructions.

       --outdir=path, -o path
              Target path file the licenses resource.  By  default  the  license
              compiler emits the resource in the current directory. The filename
              will always match the target  assembly  passed  to  --target  with
              .licenses added.

       --nologo
              Do not emit the &quot;Mono License Compiler&quot; logo  on stdout while com&#8208;
              pilng.


LICENSE FILES
       The format for the license files (licenses.licx) is the following:
            # comment
            namespace.type, assemblyname
            namespace.type, full-assemblyname

       All lines starting with a # are ignored. the first form requires that the
       assembly was loaded through the --load,-i option but does not require the
       full assembly name, only the first part.

       The second form requires the full assembly name including locale, version
       and publickeytoken.
