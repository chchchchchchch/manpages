NAME
       lcf - Determine which of the historical versions of a config is installed

SYNOPSIS
       lcf  [options]  &lt;Destination  File Name&gt; &lt;Historical MD5SUM source direc&#8208;
       tory&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       This script, given a destination file name, and  a  directory  containing
       md5sums  of historical versions of the file, attempts to determine if the
       installed version corresponds to a historical version. lcf uses the  same
       algorithm that ucf uses, and should exhibit the same behaviour.

       The  source  directory is the place where historical md5sums are expected
       to live. Specifically, the historical md5sums are looked  for  in  either
       the file ${filename}.md5sum, or the subdirectory ${filename}.md5sum.d/

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message

       -n, --no-action
              Dry  run.  Print  the actions that would be taken if the script is
              invoked, but take no action.

       -d [n], --debug [n]
              Set the debug level to the (optional) level n (n defaults  to  1).
              This turns on copious debugging information.

       -v,  --verbose
              Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables.

FILES
       /var/lib/ucf/hashfile, /etc/ucf.conf

SEE ALSO
       ucf(1) ucf.conf(5).

BUGS
       There are no bugs.  Any resemblance thereof is delirium. Really.
