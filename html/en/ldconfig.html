ldconfig(8)                                                          ldconfig(8)



NAME
       ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run-time bindings

SYNOPSIS
       ldconfig [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       ldconfig creates, updates, and removes the necessary links and cache (for
       use by the run-time linker, ld.so) to the most  recent  shared  libraries
       found  in  the  directories  specified  on  the command line, in the file
       /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the  trusted  directories  (/usr/lib  and  /lib).
       ldconfig  checks the header and file names of the libraries it encounters
       when determining which versions should have their links updated.   ldcon&#8208;
       fig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.

       ldconfig  will  attempt  to  deduce the type of ELF libs (ie. libc 5.x or
       libc 6.x (glibc)) based on what C libraries if any the library was linked
       against,  therefore  when making dynamic libraries, it is wise to explic&#8208;
       itly link against libc (use -lc).  ldconfig is capable of storing  multi&#8208;
       ple  ABI  types  of  libraries into a single cache on architectures which
       allow  native  running  of  multiple  ABIs,  like   ia32/ia64/x86_64   or
       sparc32/sparc64.

       Some  existing libs do not contain enough information to allow the deduc&#8208;
       tion of their type, therefore the /etc/ld.so.conf file format allows  the
       specification  of an expected type.  This is only used for those ELF libs
       which we can not work out. The format is like this &quot;dirname=TYPE&quot;,  where
       type  can  be libc4, libc5 or libc6.  (This syntax also works on the com&#8208;
       mand line).  Spaces are not allowed. Also see the -p option.

       Directory names containing an = are no longer legal unless they also have
       an expected type specifier.

       ldconfig should normally be run by the super-user as it may require write
       permission on some root owned directories and files. If you use -r option
       to  change  the root directory, you don&apos;t have to be super-user though as
       long as you have sufficient right to that directory tree.

OPTIONS
       -v --verbose
              Verbose mode.  Print current version  number,  the  name  of  each
              directory as it is scanned and any links that are created.

       -n     Only  process  directories  specified  on the command line.  Don&apos;t
              process the trusted directories  (/usr/lib  and  /lib)  nor  those
              specified in /etc/ld.so.conf.  Implies -N.

       -N     Don&apos;t  rebuild  the cache.  Unless -X is also specified, links are
              still updated.

       -X     Don&apos;t update links.  Unless -N is also  specified,  the  cache  is
              still rebuilt.

       -f conf
              Use conf instead of /etc/ld.so.conf.

       -C cache
              Use cache instead of /etc/ld.so.cache.

       -r root
              Change to and use root as the root directory.
&#12;       -l     Library  mode.   Manually link individual libraries.  Intended for
              use by experts only.

       -p --print-cache
              Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries  stored  in
              the current cache.

       -c --format=FORMAT
              Use  FORMAT  for  the  cache file. Choices are old, new and compat
              (the default).

       -i --ignore-aux-cache
              Ignore auxiliary cache file.

       -? --help --usage
              Print usage information.

       -V --version
              Print version and exit.

EXAMPLES
              # /sbin/ldconfig -v
       will set up the correct links for the shared  binaries  and  rebuild  the
       cache.
              # /sbin/ldconfig -n /lib
       as  root  after  the  installation  of a new shared library will properly
       update the shared library symbolic links in /lib.

FILES
       /lib/ld-linux.so.*  execution time linker/loader
       /etc/ld.so.conf     File containing a list of newline separated  directo&#8208;
                           ries in which to search for libraries.
       /etc/ld.so.cache    File containing an ordered list of libraries found in
                           the directories specified in  /etc/ld.so.conf.   This
                           file  is  not  in  human  readable format, and is not
                           intended to be edited.
       lib*.so.version     shared libraries

       ldd(1), ld.so(8).

BUGS
       ldconfig, being a user process, must be run manually and has no means  of
       dynamically  determining  and relinking shared libraries for use by ld.so
       when a new shared library is installed.
