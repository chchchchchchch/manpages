NAME
       ldd - print shared library dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       ldd [OPTION]...  FILE...

DESCRIPTION

       library specified on the command line.

              tion.

       -d --data-relocs
              Perform relocations and report any missing objects (ELF only).

       -r --function-relocs
              Perform  relocations  for  both  data  objects  and functions, and
              report any missing objects or functions (ELF only).

       -u --unused

       --help Usage information.

BUGS
       ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       ldd does not work with some extremely old a.out programs which were built
       before ldd support was added to the compiler releases.  If you use ldd on
       one of these programs, the program will attempt to run with argc = 0  and
       the results will be unpredictable.
