ENDIAN(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  ENDIAN(3)



NAME
       htobe16,  htole16,  be16toh, le16toh, htobe32, htole32, be32toh, le32toh,
       htobe64, htole64, be64toh, le64toh -  convert  values  between  host  and
       big-/little-endian byte order

SYNOPSIS
       #define _BSD_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;endian.h&gt;

       uint16_t htobe16(uint16_t host_16bits);
       uint16_t htole16(uint16_t host_16bits);
       uint16_t be16toh(uint16_t big_endian_16bits);
       uint16_t le16toh(uint16_t little_endian_16bits);

       uint32_t htobe32(uint32_t host_32bits);
       uint32_t htole32(uint32_t host_32bits);
       uint32_t be32toh(uint32_t big_endian_32bits);
       uint32_t le32toh(uint32_t little_endian_32bits);

       uint64_t htobe64(uint64_t host_64bits);
       uint64_t htole64(uint64_t host_64bits);
       uint64_t be64toh(uint64_t big_endian_64bits);
       uint64_t le64toh(uint64_t little_endian_64bits);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions convert the byte encoding of integer values from the byte
       order that the current CPU (the &quot;host&quot;) uses, to and  from  little-endian
       and big-endian byte order.

       The  number, nn, in the name of each function indicates the size of inte&#8208;
       ger handled by the function, either 16, 32, or 64 bits.

       The functions with names of the form &quot;htobenn&quot;  convert  from  host  byte
       order to big-endian order.

       The  functions  with  names  of the form &quot;htolenn&quot; convert from host byte
       order to little-endian order.

       The functions with names of the form &quot;benntoh&quot;  convert  from  big-endian
       order to host byte order.

       The functions with names of the form &quot;lenntoh&quot; convert from little-endian
       order to host byte order.

VERSIONS
       These functions were added to glibc in version 2.9.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are nonstandard.  Similar functions are  present  on  the
       BSDs,  where  the  required  header  file  is  &lt;sys/endian.h&gt;  instead of
       &lt;endian.h&gt;.  Unfortunately, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and glibc  haven&apos;t  followed
       the  original  OpenBSD naming convention for these functions, whereby the
       nn component always appears at the end of the function  name  (thus,  for
       example,  in  NetBSD,  FreeBSD,  and  glibc,  the  equivalent of OpenBSDs
       &quot;betoh32&quot; is &quot;be32toh&quot;).

NOTES
       These functions are similar to the older  byteorder(3)  family  of  func&#8208;
       tions.  For example, be32toh() is identical to ntohl().

       The  advantage  of  the  byteorder(3) functions is that they are standard
       functions available on all UNIX systems.  On the  other  hand,  the  fact
       that  they were designed for use in the context of TCP/IP means that they
       lack the 64-bit and little-endian variants described in this page.

EXAMPLE
       The program below display the results of converting an integer from  host
       byte  order  to both little-endian and big-endian byte order.  Since host
       byte order is either little-endian or big-endian, only one of these  con&#8208;
       versions  will  have  an  effect.   When we run this program on a little-
       endian system such as x86-32, we see the following:

           $ ./a.out
           x.u32 = 0x44332211
           htole32(x.u32) = 0x44332211
           htobe32(x.u32) = 0x11223344

   Program source

       #include &lt;endian.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           union {
            uint32_t u32;
            uint8_t arr[4];
           } x;

           x.arr[0] = 0x11;     /* Lowest-address byte */
           x.arr[1] = 0x22;
           x.arr[2] = 0x33;
           x.arr[3] = 0x44;     /* Highest-address byte */

           printf(&quot;x.u32 = 0x%x\n&quot;, x.u32);
           printf(&quot;htole32(x.u32) = 0x%x\n&quot;, htole32(x.u32));
           printf(&quot;htobe32(x.u32) = 0x%x\n&quot;, htobe32(x.u32));

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
