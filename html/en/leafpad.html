NAME
       leafpad - GTK+ based simple text editor

DESCRIPTION
       leafpad is a simple GTK+ based text editor. The user interface is similar
       to Windows(tm) notepad. It aims to be lighter than GEdit and KWrite and
       to be as useful as them.

       WARNING: The encoding feature is derived from built-in Glib&apos;s iconv
       feature (g_convert), which you can check with command &quot;iconv -l&quot;.
       Leafpad can use only the listed encoding. Any other encoding cause
       serious data loss.
