LESSOPEN(1)                                                          LESSOPEN(1)



NAME
       lessfile, lesspipe - &quot;input preprocessor&quot; for  less.

SYNOPSIS
       lessfile, lesspipe

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the lessfile, and lesspipe commands.
       This manual page  was  written  for  the  Debian  GNU/Linux  distribution
       because  the  input preprocessor scripts are provided by Debian GNU/Linux
       and are not part of the original program.

       lessfile and lesspipe are programs that can be used to modify the way the
       contents  of  a file are displayed in less.  What this means is that less
       can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped files,  and  even
       display something reasonable for graphics files.

       lesspipe will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and less will read them as
       they come across.  This means that you do not have to wait for the decod&#8208;
       ing  to  finish before less shows you the file.  This also means that you
       will get a &apos;byte N&apos; instead of an N% as your file position.  You can seek
       to the end and back to get the N% but that means you have to wait for the
       pipe to finish.

       lessfile will toss the contents/info on a file which less will then read.
       After  you are done, lessfile will then delete the file.  This means that
       the process has to finish before you see it, but you get nice percentages
       (N%) up front.

USAGE
       Just  put  one  of  the following two commands in your login script (e.g.
       ~/.bash_profile):

         eval &quot;$(lessfile)&quot;

       or

         eval &quot;$(lesspipe)&quot;

FILE TYPE RECOGNITION
       File types are recognized by their extensions.  This is a  list  of  cur&#8208;
       rently supported extensions (grouped by the programs that handle them):

         *.a
         *.arj
         *.tar.bz2
         *.bz
         *.bz2
         *.deb, *.udeb
         *.doc
         *.gif, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.pcd, *.png, *.tga, *.tiff, *.tif
         *.iso, *.raw, *.bin
         *.lha, *.lzh
         *.tar.lz, *.tlz
         *.lz
         *.7z
         *.pdf
         *.rar, *.r[0-9][0-9]
         *.rpm
         *.tar.gz, *.tgz, *.tar.z, *.tar.dz
         *.gz, *.z, *.dz
         *.tar
         *.tar.xz, *.xz
         *.jar, *.war, *.xpi, *.zip
         *.zoo

USER DEFINED FILTERS
       It  is possible to extend and overwrite the default lesspipe and lessfile
       input processor if you have  specialized  requirements.  Create  an  exe&#8208;
       cutable  program  with  the  name  .lessfilter  and put it into your home
       directory. This can be a shell script or a binary program.


       It is important that this program returns the correct exit code: return 0
       if your filter handles the input, return 1 if the standard lesspipe/less&#8208;
       file filter should handle the input.


       Here is an example script:

         #!/bin/sh

         case &quot;$1&quot; in
             *.extension)
                 extension-handler &quot;$1&quot;
                 ;;
             *)
                 # We don&apos;t handle this format.
                 exit 1
         esac

         # No further processing by lesspipe necessary
         exit 0


FILES
       ~/.lessfilter
              Executable file that can do user defined processing.  See  section
              USER DEFINED FILTERS for more information.

BUGS
       When  trying  to  open  compressed 0 byte files, less displays the actual
       binary file contents. This is not a bug.  less is  designed  to  do  that
       (see  manual  page  less(1),  section  INPUT  PREPROCESSOR).  This is the
       answer of Mark Nudelman &lt;markn@greenwoodsoftware.com&gt;:

              &quot;I recognized when I designed it that  a  lesspipe  filter  cannot
              output  an  empty file and have less display nothing in that case;
              it&apos;s a side effect of using the &quot;no output&quot; case to mean &quot;the fil&#8208;
              ter  has nothing to do&quot;.  It could have been designed to have some
              other mechanism to indicate  &quot;nothing  to  do&quot;,  but  &quot;no  output&quot;
              seemed the simplest and most intuitive for lesspipe writers.&quot;


       Sometimes,  less  does not display the contents file you want to view but
       output that is produced by your login scripts (~/.bashrc or  ~/.bash_pro&#8208;
       file).  This  happens  because  less  uses  your current shell to run the
       lesspipe filter. Bash first looks for the variable $BASH_ENV in the envi&#8208;
       ronment  expands  its value and  uses the expanded value as the name of a
       file to read and execute. If this file produces any output less will dis&#8208;
       play  this.  A way to solve this problem is to put the following lines on
       the top of your login script that produces output:

         if [ -z &quot;$PS1&quot; ]; then
             exit
         fi

       This tests whether the prompt variable $PS1 is set and if it isn&apos;t (which
       is the case for non-interactive shells) it will exit the script.
