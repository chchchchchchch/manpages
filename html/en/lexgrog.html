LEXGROG(1)                     Manual pager utils                     LEXGROG(1)



NAME
       lexgrog - parse header information in man pages

SYNOPSIS
       lexgrog [-m|-c] [-fhwV] [-E encoding] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       lexgrog  is an implementation of the traditional &#8220;groff guess&#8221; utility in
       lex.  It reads the list of files on its command line as either  man  page
       source  files  or  preformatted  &#8220;cat&#8221; pages, and displays their name and
       description as used by apropos and whatis, the list of preprocessing fil&#8208;
       ters  required  by the man page before it is passed to nroff or troff, or
       both.

       If its input is badly formatted, lexgrog will print &#8220;parse failed&#8221;;  this
       may be useful for external programs that need to check man pages for cor&#8208;
       rectness.  If one of lexgrog&apos;s input files is  &#8220;-&#8221;,  it  will  read  from
       standard  input;  if any input file is compressed, a decompressed version
       will be read automatically.

OPTIONS
       -m, --man
              Parse input as man page source files.  This is the default if nei&#8208;
              ther --man nor --cat is given.

       -c, --cat
              Parse  input  as  preformatted man pages (&#8220;cat pages&#8221;).  --man and
              --cat may not be given simultaneously.

       -w, --whatis
              Display the name and description from the man  page&apos;s  header,  as
              used  by  apropos  and  whatis.   This  is  the default if neither
              --whatis nor --filters is given.

       -f, --filters
              Display the list of filters needed  to  preprocess  the  man  page
              before formatting with nroff or troff.

       -E encoding, --encoding encoding
              Override the guessed character set for the page to encoding.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage error.

       2      lexgrog failed to parse one or more of its input files.

EXAMPLES
         $ lexgrog man.1
         man.1: &quot;man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals&quot;
         $ lexgrog -fw man.1
         man.1 (t): &quot;man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals&quot;
         $ lexgrog -c whatis.cat1
         whatis.cat1: &quot;whatis - display manual page descriptions&quot;
         $ lexgrog broken.1
         broken.1: parse failed

WHATIS PARSING
       mandb  (which  uses  the same code as lexgrog) parses the NAME section at
       the top of each manual page looking for names  and  descriptions  of  the
       features  documented  in each.  While the parser is quite tolerant, as it
       has to cope with a number of different forms that have historically  been
       used, it may sometimes fail to extract the required information.

       When  using  the  traditional man macro set, a correct NAME section looks
       something like this:

              .SH NAME
              foo \- program to do something

       Some manual pagers require the &#8216;\-&#8217; to be exactly as shown; mandb is more
       tolerant,  but  for compatibility with other systems it is nevertheless a
       good idea to retain the backslash.

       On the left-hand side, there may be several names, separated  by  commas.
       Names  containing whitespace will be ignored to avoid pathological behav&#8208;
       iour on certain ill-formed NAME sections.  The  text  on  the  right-hand
       side  is  free-form,  and  may be spread over multiple lines.  If several
       features with different descriptions are being  documented  in  the  same
       manual page, the following form is therefore used:

              .SH NAME
              foo, bar \- programs to do something
              .br
              baz \- program to do nothing

       (A  macro  which starts a new paragraph, like .PP, may be used instead of
       the break macro .br.)

       When using the BSD-derived mdoc macro set, a correct NAME  section  looks
       something like this:

              .Sh NAME
              .Nm foo
              .Nd program to do something

       There  are  several  common  reasons why whatis parsing fails.  Sometimes
       authors of manual pages replace &#8216;.SH NAME&#8217; with &#8216;.SH MYPROGRAM&#8217;, and then
       mandb  cannot  find  the section from which to extract the information it
       needs.  Sometimes authors include a NAME  section,  but  place  free-form
       text there rather than &#8216;name \- description&#8217;.  However, any syntax resem&#8208;
       bling the above should be accepted.

NOTES
       lexgrog attempts to parse files containing .so requests, but will only be
       able  to  do so correctly if the files are properly installed in a manual
       page hierarchy.

       as well as this man page.
