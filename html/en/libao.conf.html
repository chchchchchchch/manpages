libao.conf(5)                  libao configuration                 libao.conf(5)



NAME
       libao.conf - configuration for libao.


SYNOPSIS
       /etc/libao.conf

       ~/.libao


DESCRIPTION
       libao.conf and .libao are configuration files for libao, the audio output
       library.  They specify various options  to  libao,  as  described  below.
       libao.conf  sets system-wide options, whereas ~/.libao sets user-specific
       options.  When an option is set in both places, the  option  in  ~/.libao
       takes precedence.


FILE FORMAT
       The file consists of comments and key-value pairs.  Comments are on sepa&#8208;
       rate lines that start with a # symbol.  The key-value pairs  are  of  the
       form:
               key=value
       where  key  contains no whitespace and no equal signs.  value will be all
       of the text after the equal sign until (but  not  including)  the  ending
       newline.  Beware of extra spaces at the end of the line!  They will prob&#8208;
       ably be interpreted as part of the option value.

       The following is a list of valid global option keys. Any driver  specific
       option may be used as well as those keys.

              default_driver
                     The  short  name of the driver libao should use by default.
                     Valid values include (not all are available on every  plat&#8208;
                     form):  oss,  esd,  arts,  alsa, nas, irix, sun, and sndio.
                     Note that &quot;sun&quot; is used on many  BSD  systems  as  well  as
                     Solaris.

              debug (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets  all  the  drivers as well as AO itself into debugging
                     output mode.  Unlike passing the debug option to a  driver,
                     debug  will  also  print  debugging information from driver
                     loading and testing.

              quiet (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into silent mode.
                     Errors  will  return  only  error codes; neither ao nor the
                     drivers will print any output whatsoever to stderr.

              verbose (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets all the drivers as well  as  AO  itself  into  verbose
                     mode.


EXAMPLE
       Here  is  an  example libao.conf that forces the OSS driver to be used by
       default:

           # This is a comment.
           default_driver=oss
&#12;BUGS
       libao.conf is missing a number of potentially useful options.
