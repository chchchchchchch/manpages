NAME
       libc - overview of standard C libraries on Linux

DESCRIPTION
       The  term  &quot;libc&quot;  is  commonly  used  as a shorthand for the &quot;standard C
       library&quot;, a library of standard functions that can be used by all C  pro&#8208;
       grams  (and  sometimes  by programs in other languages).  Because of some
       history (see below), use of the term &quot;libc&quot; to refer to  the  standard  C
       library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux.

   glibc
       By  far  the  most  widely  used  C library on Linux is the GNU C Library
       &#10216;http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/&#10217;, often referred to as glibc.  This is
       the C library that is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions.  It
       is also the C library whose details are documented in the relevant  pages
       of  the  man-pages project (primarily in Section 3 of the manual).  Docu&#8208;
       mentation of glibc is also available in the glibc manual,  available  via
       the  command info libc.  Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September 1992.
       (There were earlier 0.x releases.)  The next major release of  glibc  was
       2.0, at the beginning of 1997.

       The pathname /lib/libc.so.6 (or something similar) is normally a symbolic
       link that points to the location of the glibc library, and executing this
       pathname  will  cause glibc to display various information about the ver&#8208;
       sion installed on your system.

   Linux libc
       In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while Linux libc,  a  fork  of
       glibc  1.x created by Linux developers who felt that glibc development at
       the time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux.  Often,  this  library
       was  referred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;.  Linux libc released major
       versions 2, 3, 4, and  5  (as  well  as  many  minor  versions  of  those
       releases).   For  a  while, Linux libc was the standard C library in many
       Linux distributions.  However, notwithstanding the  original  motivations
       of  the  Linux  libc  effort,  by the time glibc 2.0 was released, it was
       clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major  Linux  distributions  that
       had  been  using  Linux  libc  soon  switched back to glibc.  (Since this
       switch occurred over a decade ago, man-pages no longer takes care to doc&#8208;
       ument  Linux  libc details.  Nevertheless, the history is visible in ves&#8208;
       tiges of information about Linux libc that remain in some  manual  pages,
       in particular, references to libc4 and libc5.)

   Other C libraries
       There  are  various  other less widely used C libraries for Linux.  These
       libraries are generally smaller than glibc, both in terms of features and
       memory footprint, and often intended for building small binaries, perhaps
       targeted at development for embedded Linux systems.  Among such libraries
       are        uClibc       (http://www.uclibc.org/)       and       dietlibc
       (http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/).  Details of these libraries are generally
       not covered by the man-pages project.
