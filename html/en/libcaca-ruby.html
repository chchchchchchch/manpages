libcaca-ruby(3caca)                  libcaca                 libcaca-ruby(3caca)



NAME
       libcaca-ruby - Libcaca ruby bindings There is no real documentation yet
       for the Ruby binding but methods on any object should help you :)

       I tried to follow Ruby spirit meaning that :

       &#183; most of the methods return self

       &#183; the methods set_foo with only an argument are also available as foo=
         (returning the value instead of self)

       &#183; the methods originally named get_foo are available only as foo

       For the list of methods and some sample code, read:

       Libcaca Ruby API



Version 0.99.beta18              Fri Apr 6 2012              libcaca-ruby(3caca)
