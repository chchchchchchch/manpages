libcaca-style(3caca)                 libcaca                libcaca-style(3caca)



NAME
       libcaca-style - Libcaca coding style

General guidelines
       A pretty safe rule of thumb is: look at what has already been done and
       try to do the same.

       &#183; Tabulations should be avoided and replaced with eight spaces.

       &#183; Indentation is generally 4 spaces.

       &#183; Lines should wrap at most at 79 characters.

       &#183; Do not leave whitespace at the end of lines.

       &#183; Do not use multiple spaces for anything else than indentation.

       &#183; Code qui fait des warnings == code de porc == deux baffes dans ta
         gueule

C coding style
       Try to use short names whenever possible (i for indices, w for width, cv
       for canvas...). Macros are always uppercase, variable and function names
       are always lowercase. Use the underscore to separate words within names:

       #define BROKEN 0
       #define MAX(x, y) ((x &gt; y) ? (x) : (y))

       unsigned int x, y, w, h;
       char *font_name;
       void frobulate_every_three_seconds(void);

       const is a suffix. It&apos;s char const *foo, not const char *foo.

       Use spaces after commas and between operators. Do not use spaces after an
       opening parenthesis or before a closing one:

       a += 2;
       b = (a * (c + d));
       x = min(x1, x2, x3);

       Do not put a space between functions and the corresponding opening
       parenthesis:

       int function(int);

       A space can be inserted after keywords such as for, while or if, but
       consistency with the rest of the page is encouraged:

       if(a == b)
           return;

       if (p == NULL)

       Do not put parentheses around return values:

       return a + (b &amp; x) + d[10];

       Opening braces should be on a line of their own, aligned with the current
       block. Braces are optional for one-liners:

       int function(int a)
       {
           if(a &amp; 0x84)
               return a;

           if(a &lt; 0)
           {
               return -a;
           }
           else
           {
               a /= 2;

               switch(a)
               {
                   case 0:
                   case 1:
                       return -1;
                       break;
                   default:
                       return a;
               }
           }
       }

C++ coding style
       Nothing here yet.
