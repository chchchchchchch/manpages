LIBGCRYPT(1)                          1.4.1                         LIBGCRYPT(1)



NAME
       libgcrypt-config  - script to get information about the installed version
       of libgcrypt.

SYNOPSIS
       libgcrypt-config   [--prefix[=DIR]]   [--exec-prefix[=DIR]]   [--version]
       [--libs] [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       libgcrypt-config  is  a  tool  that is used to configure to determine the
       compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile  and  link  pro&#8208;
       grams  that  use  libgcrypt. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros
       for GNU autoconf that are included with libgcrypt.

OPTIONS
       libgcrypt-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libgcrypt on  the  stan&#8208;
               dard output.

       --libs  Print  the  linker  flags  that are necessary to link a libgcrypt
               program.

       --cflags
               Print  the  compiler  flags  that  are  necessary  to  compile  a
               libgcrypt program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
               libgcrypt was built  with  when  computing  the  output  for  the
               --cflags  and  --libs  options.  This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option  must
               be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix
               that libgcrypt was built with when computing the output  for  the
               --cflags  and  --libs  options.   This  option  must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
