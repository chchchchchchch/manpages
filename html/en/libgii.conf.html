libgii.conf(5)                         GGI                        libgii.conf(5)



NAME
       libgii.conf - LibGII configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/ggi/libgii.conf  is  the  configuration file that defines what input
       module are available and where libgii is supposed to find them.  It  con&#8208;
       sists  of  lines defining target locations (mapping a target name a func&#8208;
       tion name) and target aliases (fake targets  that  actually  calls  other
       target with a specific set of parameters).

       The  format  is common to all GGI libraries. It is defined by libgg.  See
       ggLoadConfig(3) for additional information on file inclusions  and  other
       generic options.

EXAMPLES
       These  examples  show how to use the generic configuration mechanism pro&#8208;
       posed by LibGG with LibGII.

       The first example defines three input modules (or targets) for which ini&#8208;
       tialization  function  is found in three different dynamic libraries (.so
       files), under the default LibGII input symbol: GIIdlinit:

       input-stdin                   input/stdin.so
       input-x                       input/x.so
       input-xwin                    input/xwin.so

       In the second example, the two inputs are implemented in a single dynamic
       library,  but  they  each have their own initialization functions in this
       library. Their name is separated from the path by a :.
              input-x                          input/x.so:GIIdl_x     input-xwin
              input/x.so:GIIdl_xwin
       The third example defines only one real target input-x, located in shared
       object input/x.so under the symbol GIIdl_x.  input-xwin is an alias  that
       will  resolve  to  target  input-x  with the option string -be-xwin to be
       passed to the target function (GIIdl_x in input/x.so).
              input-x                             input/x.so:GIIdl_x       alias
              input-xwin      input-x:-be-xwin
       The  last  examples  defines  two  inputs, with two possible location for
       their implementation.  The first two lines are the same as in example  2.
       The other two states that these two inputs can also be found (if the pre&#8208;
       vious fail) as a built-in modules. The /gii-builtins path points  to  the
       LibGII built-in symbol namespace.  In this case both input would be found
       in this namespace under the default symbol GIIdlinit.  The initialization
       function  will be given the requested target name to know which implemen&#8208;
       tation to use.

       input-x                               input/x.so:GIIdl_x       input-xwin
       input/x.so:GIIdl_xwin

       input-x                                  /gii-builtins         input-xwin
       /gii-builtins
