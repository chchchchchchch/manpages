NAME
       libgii - A flexible library for input handling

DESCRIPTION
       LibGII is an input library developed by the GGI Project.  Its design phi&#8208;
       losophy is similar to LibGGI, which deals with graphics  output.   LibGII
       is  based on the concept of input streams, which virtualize access to the
       underlying  input  drivers.  Events  from  various  input   devices   are
       abstracted  into  easy-to-use structures. LibGII also allows the applica&#8208;
       tion to join streams together, receiving input from an arbitrary combina&#8208;
       tion of devices.

       LibGII  is  a  separate component from LibGGI, although LibGGI depends on
       LibGII for input purposes.  (LibGGI&apos;s input functions are simply wrappers
       for LibGII functions.)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following outlines the environment variables, intended for the user,
       which affect the behaviour of LibGII:

       GII_INPUT
              The default input source(s) and/or filter(s) to use when giiOpen()
              is  called  with a NULL argument.  The format is: input:inputargs.
              Multiple inputs can be specified by this notation: (i1):(i2) ....
              Note: This setting does not affect  LibGGI  visuals  automatically
              opening inputs. Use the GGI_INPUTx variable instead.


       GII_DEBUG
              The debug level for LibGII:

              &#183;   0 or unset : debug output is off; debugging is off

              &#183;   255 : all debug output is on

              You may also bitwise &apos;or&apos; any of the following together:

              &#183;   2   : debug core

              &#183;   32  : misc debugging output

              &#183;   64  : debug dynamic library handling

              &#183;   128 : debug event handling

       GII_DEBUGSYNC
              Turn  on  synchronous  debug  output,  flushing the output buffers
              before returning from DPRINT calls.


       GII_CONFDIR
              Override compiled-in path to global config files (Win32 only,  but
              not Cygwin).


       Other environment variables specific to filters and inputs are documented
       in the corresponding manual page.
