LIBSMBCLIENT(7)                         7                        LIBSMBCLIENT(7)



NAME
       libsmbclient - An extension library for browsers and that can be used as
       a generic browsing API.

SYNOPSIS


       Browser URL:
       smb://[[[domain:]user[:password@]]server[/share[/path[/file]]]]
       [?options]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       libsmbclient is a library toolset that permits applications to manipulate
       CIFS/SMB network resources using many of the standards POSIX functions
       available for manipulating local UNIX/Linux files. It permits much more
       than just browsing, files can be opened and read or written, permissions
       changed, file times modified, attributes and ACL&#180;s can be manipulated,
       and so on. Of course, its functionality includes all the capabilities
       commonly called browsing.

       libsmbclient can not be used directly from the command line, instead it
       provides an extension of the capabilities of tools such as file managers
       and browsers. This man page describes the configuration options for this
       tool so that the user may obtain greatest utility of use.

OPTIONS
       What the URLs mean:

       smb://
           Shows all workgroups or domains that are visible in the network. The
           behavior matches that of the Microsoft Windows Explorer.

           The method of locating the list of workgroups (domains also) varies
           depending on the setting of the context variable
           (context-&gt;options.browse_max_lmb_count). It is the responsibility of
           the application that calls this library to set this to a sensible
           value. This is a compile-time option. This value determines the
           maximum number of local master browsers to query for the list of
           workgroups. In order to ensure that the list is complete for those
           present on the network, all master browsers must be queried. If there
           are a large number of workgroups on the network, the time spent
           querying will be significant. For small networks (just a few
           workgroups), it is suggested to set this value to 0, instructing
           libsmbclient to query all local master browsers. In an environment
           that has many workgroups a more reasonable setting may be around 3.

       smb://name/
           This command causes libsmbclient to perform a name look-up. If the
           NAME&lt;1D&gt; or NAME&lt;1B&gt; exists (workgroup name), libsmbclient will list
           all servers in the workgroup (or domain). Otherwise, a name look-up
           for the NAME&lt;20&gt; (machine name) will be performed, and the list of
           shared resources on the server will be displayed.

       When libsmbclient is invoked by an application it searches for a
       directory called .smb in the $HOME directory that is specified in the
       users shell environment. It then searches for a file called smb.conf
       which, if present, will fully over-ride the system /etc/samba/smb.conf
       file. If instead libsmbclient finds a file called ~/.smb/smb.conf.append,
       it will read the system /etc/samba/smb.conf and then append the contents
       of the ~/.smb/smb.conf.append to it.

       libsmbclient will check the users shell environment for the USER
       parameter and will use its value when if the user parameter was not
       included in the URL.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
       Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source
       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The libsmbclient manpage page was written by John H Terpstra.
