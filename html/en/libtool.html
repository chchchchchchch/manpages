       Description of compile mode:

       Compile a source file into a libtool library object.

       This mode accepts the following additional options:

       -o OUTPUT-FILE
              set the output file name to OUTPUT-FILE

       -no-suppress
              do not suppress compiler output for multiple passes

       -prefer-pic
              try to build PIC objects only

       -prefer-non-pic
              try to build non-PIC objects only

       -shared
              do not build a `.o&apos; file suitable for static linking

       -static
              only build a `.o&apos; file suitable for static linking

       -Wc,FLAG
              pass FLAG directly to the compiler

       COMPILE-COMMAND is a command to be used in creating a  `standard&apos;  object
       file from the given SOURCEFILE.

       The  output  file  name is determined by removing the directory component
       from SOURCEFILE, then substituting the C source code suffix `.c&apos; with the
       library object suffix, `.lo&apos;.

       Description of link mode:

       Link  object  files  or libraries together to form another library, or to
       create an executable program.

       LINK-COMMAND is a command using the C compiler that you would use to cre&#8208;
       ate a program from several object files.

       The following components of LINK-COMMAND are treated specially:

       -all-static
              do not do any dynamic linking at all

       -avoid-version
              do not add a version suffix if possible

       -bindir BINDIR
              specify  path  to  binaries directory (for systems where libraries
              must be found in the PATH setting at runtime)

       -dlopen FILE
              `-dlpreopen&apos; FILE if it cannot be dlopened at runtime

       -dlpreopen FILE
              link in FILE and add its symbols to lt_preloaded_symbols

       -export-dynamic
              allow symbols from OUTPUT-FILE to be resolved with dlsym(3)

       -export-symbols SYMFILE
              try to export only the symbols listed in SYMFILE

       -export-symbols-regex REGEX
              try to export only the symbols matching REGEX

       -LLIBDIR
              search LIBDIR for required installed libraries

       -lNAME OUTPUT-FILE requires the installed library libNAME

       -module
              build a library that can dlopened

       -no-fast-install
              disable the fast-install mode

       -no-install
              link a not-installable executable

       -no-undefined
              declare that a library does not refer to external symbols

       -o OUTPUT-FILE
              create OUTPUT-FILE from the specified objects

       -objectlist FILE
              Use a list of object files found in FILE to specify objects

       -precious-files-regex REGEX
              don&apos;t remove output files matching REGEX

       -release RELEASE
              specify package release information

       -rpath LIBDIR
              the created library will eventually be installed in LIBDIR

       -R[ ]LIBDIR
              add LIBDIR to the runtime path of programs and libraries

       -shared
              only do dynamic linking of libtool libraries

       -shrext SUFFIX
              override the standard shared library file extension
&#12;       -static
              do not do any dynamic linking of uninstalled libtool libraries

       -static-libtool-libs
              do not do any dynamic linking of libtool libraries

       -version-info CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]
              specify library version info [each variable defaults to 0]

       -weak LIBNAME
              declare that the target provides the LIBNAME interface

       -Wc,FLAG

       -Xcompiler FLAG
              pass linker-specific FLAG directly to the compiler

       -Wl,FLAG

       -Xlinker FLAG
              pass linker-specific FLAG directly to the linker

       -XCClinker FLAG
              pass link-specific FLAG to the compiler driver (CC)

       All other options (arguments beginning with `-&apos;) are ignored.

       Every other argument is treated as a filename.  Files ending in `.la&apos; are
       treated  as  uninstalled  libtool  libraries, other files are standard or
       library object files.

       If the OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.la&apos;, then a libtool library is created, only
       library objects (`.lo&apos; files) may be specified, and `-rpath&apos; is required,
       except when creating a convenience library.

       If OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.a&apos; or `.lib&apos;, then a standard library is created
       using `ar&apos; and `ranlib&apos;, or on Windows using `lib&apos;.

       If  OUTPUT-FILE  ends  in `.lo&apos; or `.o&apos;, then a reloadable object file is
       created, otherwise an executable program is created.

       Description of execute mode:

       Automatically set library path, then run a program.

       This mode accepts the following additional options:

       -dlopen FILE
              add the directory containing FILE to the library path

       This mode  sets  the  library  path  environment  variable  according  to
       `-dlopen&apos; flags.

       If  any of the ARGS are libtool executable wrappers, then they are trans&#8208;
       lated into their corresponding  uninstalled  binary,  and  any  of  their
       required library directories are added to the library path.

       Then, COMMAND is executed, with ARGS as arguments.

       Description of install mode:

       Install executables or libraries.

       INSTALL-COMMAND  is the installation command.  The first component should
       be either the `install&apos; or `cp&apos; program.

       The following components of INSTALL-COMMAND are treated specially:

       -inst-prefix-dir PREFIX-DIR
              Use PREFIX-DIR as a staging area for installation

       The rest of the components are interpreted as arguments to  that  command
       (only BSD-compatible install options are recognized).

       Description of finish mode:

       Complete the installation of libtool libraries.

       Each LIBDIR is a directory that contains libtool libraries.

       The  commands  that  this mode executes may require superuser privileges.
       Use the `--dry-run&apos; option if you just want to see  what  would  be  exe&#8208;
       cuted.

       Description of uninstall mode:

       Remove libraries from an installation directory.

       RM is the name of the program to use to delete files associated with each
       FILE (typically `/bin/rm&apos;).  RM-OPTIONS are options (such as `-f&apos;) to  be
       passed to RM.

       If  FILE  is  a  libtool  library,  all  the files associated with it are
       deleted.  Otherwise, only FILE itself is deleted using RM.

       Description of clean mode:

       Remove files from the build directory.

       RM is the name of the program to use to delete files associated with each
       FILE  (typically `/bin/rm&apos;).  RM-OPTIONS are options (such as `-f&apos;) to be
       passed to RM.

       If FILE is a libtool library, object or program, all the files associated
       with it are deleted. Otherwise, only FILE itself is deleted using RM.
