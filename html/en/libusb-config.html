LIBUSB-CONFIG(1)                                                LIBUSB-CONFIG(1)



NAME
       libusb-config  - script to get information about the installed version of
       libusb

SYNOPSIS
       libusb-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs]
       [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       libusb-config  is  a tool that is used to configure to determine the com&#8208;
       piler and linker flags that should be used to compile and  link  programs
       that use libusb.

OPTIONS
       libusb-config accepts the following options:

       LIBRARIES
               This argument is currently ignored as libusb as only one library.

       --version
               Print  the  currently installed version of libusb on the standard
               output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a  libusb  pro&#8208;
               gram.

       --cflags
               Print  the  compiler flags that are necessary to compile a libusb
               program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix  that
               libusb  was built with when computing the output for the --cflags
               and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec  prefix
               if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec  prefix
               that  libusb  was  built  with  when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs  options.   This  option  must  be  specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
