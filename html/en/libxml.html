libxml(3)                                                              libxml(3)



NAME
       libxml - library used to parse XML files

DESCRIPTION
       The  libxml  library  is  used to parse XML files.  Its internal document
       repesentation is as close as possible to the DOM (Document Object  Model)
       interface, an API for accessing XML or HTML structured documents.

       The libxml library also has a SAX-like interface, which is designed to be
       compatible with expat(1).  NOTE: SAX, the Simple API for XML, is a  stan&#8208;
       dard  interface for event-based XML parsing, developed collaboratively by
       the members of the XML-DEV mailing list, currently hosted by OASIS.   The
       expat  library  is  a XML 1.0 parser written in C, which aims to be fully
       conforming.  It is currently not a validating XML processor.

       The libxml library now includes a nearly complete  XPath  implementation.
       The  XPath  (XML  Path Language) is a language for addressing parts of an
       XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer.

       The libxml library exports Push and Pull type parser interfaces for  both
       XML and html.
