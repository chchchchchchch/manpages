NAME
       licensecheck - simple license checker for source files

SYNOPSIS
       licensecheck --help|--version

       licensecheck [--no-conf] [--verbose] [--copyright] [-l|--lines=N]
       [-i|--ignore=regex] [-c|--check=regex] [-m|--machine] [-r|--recursive]
       list of files and directories to check

DESCRIPTION
       licensecheck attempts to determine the license that applies to each file
       passed to it, by searching the start of the file for text belonging to
       various licenses.

       If any of the arguments passed are directories, licensecheck will add the
       files contained within to the list of files to process.

OPTIONS
       --verbose, --no-verbose
           Specify whether to output the text being processed from each file
           before the corresponding license information.

           Default is to be quiet.

       -l=N, --lines=N
           Specify the number of lines of each file&apos;s header which should be
           parsed for license information. (Default is 60).

       -i=regex, --ignore=regex
           When processing the list of files and directories, the regular
           expression specified by this option will be used to indicate those
           which should not be considered (e.g. backup files, VCS metadata).

       -r, --recursive
           Specify that the contents of directories should be added recursively.

       -c=regex, --check=regex
           Specify a pattern against which filenames will be matched in order to
           decide which files to check the license of.

           The default includes common source files.

       --copyright
           Also display copyright text found within the file

       -m, --machine
           Display the information in a machine readable way, i.e. in the form
           &lt;file&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;license&gt;[&lt;tab&gt;&lt;copyright&gt;] so that it can be easily
           sorted and/or filtered, e.g. with the awk and sort commands.  Note
           that using the --verbose option will kill the readability.

       --no-conf, --noconf
           Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used as the
           first option given on the command-line.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
       sourced by a shell in that order to set configuration variables.  Command
       line options can be used to override configuration file settings.
       Environment variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The
       currently recognised variables are:

       LICENSECHECK_VERBOSE
           If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --verbose command
           line parameter being used. The default is no.

       LICENSECHECK_PARSELINES
           If this is set to a positive number then the specified number of
           lines at the start of each file will be read whilst attempting to
           determine the license(s) in use.  This is equivalent to the --lines
           command line option.
