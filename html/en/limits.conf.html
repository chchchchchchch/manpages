LIMITS.CONF(5)                  Linux-PAM Manual                  LIMITS.CONF(5)



NAME
       limits.conf - configuration file for the pam_limits module

DESCRIPTION
       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       &lt;domain&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;value&gt;

       The fields listed above should be filled as follows:

       &lt;domain&gt;

           &#183;   a username

           &#183;   a groupname, with @group syntax. This should not be confused with
               netgroups.

           &#183;   the wildcard *, for default entry.

           &#183;   the wildcard %, for maxlogins limit only, can also be used with
               %group syntax.


           NOTE: group and wildcard limits are not applied to the root user. To
           set a limit for the root user, this field must contain the literal
           username root.

       &lt;type&gt;

           hard
               for enforcing hard resource limits. These limits are set by the
               superuser and enforced by the Kernel. The user cannot raise his
               requirement of system resources above such values.

           soft
               for enforcing soft resource limits. These limits are ones that
               the user can move up or down within the permitted range by any
               pre-existing hard limits. The values specified with this token
               can be thought of as default values, for normal system usage.

           -
               for enforcing both soft and hard resource limits together.

               Note, if you specify a type of &apos;-&apos; but neglect to supply the item
               and value fields then the module will never enforce any limits on
               the specified user/group etc. .

       &lt;item&gt;

           core
               limits the core file size (KB)

           data
               maximum data size (KB)

           fsize
               maximum filesize (KB)

           memlock
               maximum locked-in-memory address space (KB)

           nofile
               maximum number of open files

           rss
               maximum resident set size (KB) (Ignored in Linux 2.4.30 and
               higher)

           stack
               maximum stack size (KB)

           cpu
               maximum CPU time (minutes)

           nproc
               maximum number of processes

           as
               address space limit (KB)

           maxlogins
               maximum number of logins for this user except for this with uid=0

           maxsyslogins
               maximum number of logins on system

           priority
               the priority to run user process with (negative values boost
               process priority)

           locks
               maximum locked files (Linux 2.4 and higher)

           sigpending
               maximum number of pending signals (Linux 2.6 and higher)

           msqqueue
               maximum memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes) (Linux 2.6
               and higher)

           nice
               maximum nice priority allowed to raise to (Linux 2.6.12 and
               higher) values: [-20,19]

           rtprio
               maximum realtime priority allowed for non-privileged processes
               (Linux 2.6.12 and higher)

           chroot
               the directory to chroot the user to

       All items support the values -1, unlimited or infinity indicating no
       limit, except for priority and nice.

       If a hard limit or soft limit of a resource is set to a valid value, but
       outside of the supported range of the local system, the system may reject
       the new limit or unexpected behavior may occur. If the control value
       required is used, the module will reject the login if a limit could not
       be set.

       In general, individual limits have priority over group limits, so if you
       impose no limits for admin group, but one of the members in this group
       have a limits line, the user will have its limits set according to this
       line.

       Also, please note that all limit settings are set per login. They are not
       global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the duration of the
       session.

       In the limits configuration file, the &apos;#&apos; character introduces a comment
       - after which the rest of the line is ignored.

       The pam_limits module does report configuration problems found in its
       configuration file and errors via syslog(3).

EXAMPLES
       These are some example lines which might be specified in
       /etc/security/limits.conf.

           *               soft    core            0
           root            hard    core            100000
           *               hard    rss             10000
           @student        hard    nproc           20
           @faculty        soft    nproc           20
           @faculty        hard    nproc           50
           ftp             hard    nproc           0
           @student        -       maxlogins       4
