       introduces the concept of a translation &quot;context&quot; which means a group  of
       phrases  that appear together on the screen e.g. in the same menu or dia&#8208;
       log.

       The only parameter accepted on the command line is  TRANSLATION  wich  is
       the name of the translation file you wish to open.

       format. If your system is properly configured, you can  access  the  full
       documentation within Qt Linguist under the Help menu.
