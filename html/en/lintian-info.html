LINTIAN-INFO(1)        User Contributed Perl Documentation       LINTIAN-INFO(1)



NAME
       lintian-info - give detailed information about Lintian&apos;s error tags

SYNOPSIS
       lintian-info [log-file...]

       lintian-info --tags tag ...

DESCRIPTION
       The lintian-info command parses the output of the lintian command and
       gives verbose information about the listed Lintian error tags, parses a
       Lintian override file and gives verbose information about the tags
       included, or (if given the -t or --tags option) explains a given tag or
       tags.

       If no log-file is specified on the command line, this command expects its
       input on stdin. Thus, the output of lintian can either be piped through
       lintian-info or a log file produced by lintian can be processed with this
       command.  (Note, though, that the lintian command has a command line
       option -i to display the same results as lintian-info, so you will not
       normally need to pipe the output of lintian into this command.)

OPTIONS
       -a, --annotate
           Read from standard input or any files specified on the command line
           and search the input for lines formatted like Lintian override
           entries.  For each one that was found, display verbose information
           about that tag.

       -h, --help
           Display usage information and exit.

       --profile prof
           Use the severities from the vendor profile prof when displaying tags.
           If the profile name does not contain a slash, the default profile for
           than vendor is chosen.

           If not specified, lintian-info loads the best profile for the current
           vendor.

           Please Refer to the Lintian User Manual for the full documentation of
           profiles.

       -t, --tags
           Rather than treating them as log file names, treat any command-line
           options as tag names and display the descriptions of each tag.

EXIT STATUS
       If -t or --tags was given and one or more of the tags specified were
       unknown, this command returns the exit code 1.  Otherwise, it always
       returns with exit code 0.
