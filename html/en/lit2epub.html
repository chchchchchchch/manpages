NAME
       lit2epub - simple LIT to EPub conversion

SYNOPSIS
       lit2epub  lit-document [epub-document]

DESCRIPTION
       lit2epub  is a command line tool for converting a LIT document to an EPub
       document. It uses clit and zip for the conversion.

       lit2epub needs to be run with at least one arguments, the LIT document to
       be  converted.  The second argument, epub-document, is the resulting EPub
       document. If it is not specified, the output  EPub  is  named  after  the
       input  LIT document, with the .lit extension changed in .epub, and placed
       in the same directory as the LIT document.
