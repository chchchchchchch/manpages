LIVE-BOOT(7)                   Debian Live Project                  LIVE-BOOT(7)



NAME
       live-boot - System Boot Scripts


DESCRIPTION
       live-boot contains the scripts that configure a Debian Live system during
       the boot process (early userspace).

       live-boot is a hook for the initramfs-tools, used to generate a initramfs
       capable  to  boot  live systems, such as those created by live-helper(7).
       This includes the Debian Live  isos,  netboot  tarballs,  and  usb  stick
       images.

       At  boot  time  it will look for a (read-only) media containing a &quot;/live&quot;
       directory where a root filesystems (often a compressed  filesystem  image
       like  squashfs)  is  stored. If found, it will create a writable environ&#8208;
       ment, using aufs, for Debian like systems to boot from.


CONFIGURATION
       live-boot can be configured through a boot parameter or  a  configuration
       file.

       To  configure  the  live-boot parameters used by default in a live image,
       see the --bootappend-live option in the lb_config(1) manual page.


   Kernel Parameters
       live-boot is only activated if &apos;boot=live&apos; was used as a  kernel  parame&#8208;
       ter.

       In  addition, there are some more boot parameters to influence the behav&#8208;
       iour, see below.


   Configuration Files
       live-boot can be configured (but  not  activated)  through  configuration
       files.  Those  files  can  be placed either in the root filesystem itself
       (/etc/live/boot.conf,   /etc/live/boot/*),   or   on   the   live   media
       (live/boot.conf, live/boot/*).


OPTIONS
       live-boot currently features the following parameters.

       access=ACCESS
           Set  the  accessibility  level  for  physically  or visually impaired
           users. ACCESS must be one of v1, v2, v3, m1, or m2. v1=lesser  visual
           impairment,  v2=moderate  visual  impairment,  v3=blindness, m1=minor
           motor difficulties, m2=moderate motor difficulties.

       console=TTY,SPEED
           Set the default console to be  used  with  the  &quot;live-getty&quot;  option.
           Example: &quot;console=ttyS0,115200&quot;

       debug
           Makes initramfs boot process more verbose.
           Use: debug=1
           Without setting debug to a value the messages may not be shown.

       fetch=URL

       httpfs=URL
           Another  form of netboot by downloading a squashfs image from a given
           url.  The fetch method copies the image to ram and the httpfs  method
           uses  fuse  and  httpfs2  to mount the image in place. Copying to ram
           requires more memory and might take a long  time  for  large  images.
           However,  it  is  more  likely  to work correctly because it does not
           require networking afterwards and the  system  operates  faster  once
           booted because it does not require to contact the server anymore.
           Due  to  current limitations in busybox&apos;s wget and DNS resolution, an
           URL can not contain a hostname but an IP only.
           Not working: http://example.com/path/to/your_filesystem.squashfs
           Working: http://1.2.3.4/path/to/your_filesystem.squashfs
           Also note that therefore it&apos;s currently  not  possible  to  fetch  an
           image  from  a namebased virtualhost of an httpd if it is sharing the
           ip with the main httpd instance.
           You may also use the live iso image in place of the squashfs image.

       iscsi=server-ip[,server-port];target-name
           Boot from an iSCSI target that has an iso or disk live image  as  one
           of  its  LUNs. The specified target is searched for a LUN which looks
           like a live media. If you use the iscsitarget software  iSCSI  target
           solution  which  is packaged in Debian your ietd.conf might look like
           this:
           # The target-name you specify in the iscsi= parameter
           Target &lt;target-name&gt;
             Lun 0 Path=&lt;path-to-your-live-image.iso&gt;,Type=fileio,IOMode=ro
             # If you want to boot multiple machines you might want to  look  at
           tuning some parameters like
             # Wthreads or MaxConnections

       findiso=/PATH/TO/IMAGE
           Look  for  the specified ISO file on all disks where it usually looks
           for the .squashfs file (so you don&apos;t have to know the device name  as
           in fromiso=....).

       fromiso=/PATH/TO/IMAGE
           Allows  to use a filesystem from within an iso image that&apos;s available
           on live-media.

       ignore_uuid
           Do not check that any UUID embedded in the initramfs matches the dis&#8208;
           covered  medium.  live-boot may be told to generate a UUID by setting
           LIVE_GENERATE_UUID=1 when building the initramfs.

       verify-checksums
           If specified, an MD5 sum is calculated on the live media during  boot
           and  compared  to  the  value  found  in md5sum.txt found in the root
           directory of the live media.

       ip=[DEVICE]:[CLIENT_IP]:[SERVER_IP]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NETMASK]:[HOST&#8208;
       NAME]:[AUTOCONF]    [,[DEVICE]:[CLIENT_IP]:[SERVER_IP]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NET&#8208;
       MASK]:[HOSTNAME]:[AUTOCONF]]
           Let you specify the name(s) and the options of the interface(s)  that
           should be configured at boot time. Do not specify this if you want to
           use dhcp (default). It will be changed in a future release to  mimick
           official      kernel      boot      param     specification     (e.g.
           ip=10.0.0.1::10.0.0.254:255.255.255.0::eth0,:::::eth1:dhcp).

       ip=[frommedia]
           If this variable is set,  dhcp  and  static  configuration  are  just
           skipped  and  the  system  will use the (must be) media-preconfigured
           /etc/network/interfaces instead.

       {live-media|bootfrom}=DEVICE
           If you specify one of this two equivalent forms, live-boot will first
           try to find this device for the &quot;/live&quot; directory where the read-only
           root filesystem should reside. If it did not find  something  usable,
           the normal scan for block devices is performed.
           Instead  of  specifing an actual device name, the keyword &apos;removable&apos;
           can be used to limit the search of acceptable live media to removable
           type only. Note that if you want to further restrict the media to usb
           mass storage only, you can use the &apos;removable-usb&apos; keyword.

       {live-media-encryption|encryption}=TYPE
           live-boot  will  mount  the  encrypted  rootfs   TYPE,   asking   the
           passphrase, useful to build paranoid live systems :-). TYPE supported
           so far are &quot;aes&quot; for loop-aes encryption type.

       live-media-offset=BYTES
           This way you could tell live-boot that your image  starts  at  offset
           BYTES  in the above specified or autodiscovered device, this could be
           useful to hide the Debian Live iso or image  inside  another  iso  or
           image, to create &quot;clean&quot; images.

       live-media-path=PATH
           Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium. By default, it is
           set to &apos;/live&apos; and you should not change that unless you have custom&#8208;
           ized your media accordingly.

       live-media-timeout=SECONDS
           Set  the timeout in seconds for the device specified by &quot;live-media=&quot;
           to become ready before giving up.

       module=NAME
           Instead of using the default optional file  &quot;filesystem.module&quot;  (see
           below)  another  file could be specified without the extension &quot;.mod&#8208;
           ule&quot;; it should be placed on &quot;/live&quot; directory of the live medium.

       netboot[=nfs|cifs]
           This tells live-boot to perform a network mount. The parameter  &quot;nfs&#8208;
           root=&quot;  (with optional &quot;nfsopts=&quot;), should specify where is the loca&#8208;
           tion of the root filesystem.  With no args, will try cifs first,  and
           if it fails nfs.

       nfsopts=
           This lets you specify custom nfs options.

       nofastboot
           This parameter disables the default disabling of filesystem checks in
           /etc/fstab. If you have static filesystems on your harddisk  and  you
           want  them  to be checked at boot time, use this parameter, otherwise
           they are skipped.

       nopersistence
           disables the &quot;persistence&quot; feature, useful if  the  bootloader  (like
           syslinux) has been installed with persistence enabled.

       noprompt
           Do  not  prompt  to  eject  the  CD  or remove the USB flash drive on
           reboot.

       noprompt=TYPE
           This tells live-boot not to prompt to eject the CD (when noprompt=cd)
           or remove the USB flash drive (when noprompt=usb) on reboot.

       ramdisk-size
           This  parameters  allows  to  set a custom ramdisk size (it&apos;s the &apos;-o
           size&apos; option of tmpfs mount). By default, there is  no  ramdisk  size
           set,  so  the  default  of  mount applies (currently 50% of available
           RAM). Note that this option has no currently no effect  when  booting
           with toram.

       swapon
           This parameter enables usage of local swap partitions.

       persistence
           live-boot will probe devices for persistence media. These can be par&#8208;
           titions (with the correct GPT name), filesystems  (with  the  correct
           label)  or  image  files  (with  the correct file name). Overlays are
           labeled/named &quot;persistence&quot; (see  live-persistence.conf(5)).  Overlay
           image  files  have extensions which determines their filesystem, e.g.
           &quot;persistence.ext4&quot;.

       persistence-encryption=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This option determines which types of encryption that we allow to  be
           used  when probing devices for persistence media. If &quot;none&quot; is in the
           list, we allow unencrypted media; if &quot;luks&quot; is in the list, we  allow
           LUKS-encrypted media. Whenever a device containing encrypted media is
           probed the user will be prompted  for  the  passphrase.  The  default
           value is &quot;none&quot;.

       persistence-media={removable|removable-usb}
           If  you  specify  the keyword &apos;removable&apos;, live-boot will try to find
           persistence partitions on removable media only. Note that if you want
           to  further  restrict the media to usb mass storage only, you can use
           the &apos;removable-usb&apos; keyword.

       persistence-method=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This option determines which types of persistence media we allow.  If
           &quot;overlay&quot;  is  in  the list, we consider overlays (i.e. &quot;live-rw&quot; and
           &quot;home-rw&quot;). The default is &quot;overlay&quot;.

       persistence-path=PATH
           live-boot will look for persistency files in the root directory of  a
           partition,  with  this  parameter, the path can be configured so that
           you can have multiple directories on the same partition to store per&#8208;
           sistency files.

       persistence-read-only
           Filesystem  changes  are not saved back to persistence media. In par&#8208;
           ticular, overlays and netboot NFS mounts are mounted read-only.

       persistence-storage=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This option determines which types of persistence storage to consider
           when  probing  for persistence media. If &quot;filesystem&quot; is in the list,
           filesystems with matching labels will be used; if &quot;file&quot;  is  in  the
           list,  all  filesystems  will  be probed for archives and image files
           with matching filenames. The default is &quot;file,filesystem&quot;.

       persistence-subtext=SUFFIX
           Add a suffix when searching for  the  image  filenames  or  partition
           labels to use for the above mentioned persistence feature, the SUFFIX
           will be added after a dash (e.g.: &quot;live-sn&quot; would transform to &quot;live-
           sn-SUFFIX&quot;). This is handy to test multiple live-boot based live-sys&#8208;
           tems with different persistence storage choices.

       quickreboot
           This option causes live-boot to reboot without  attempting  to  eject
           the media and without asking the user to remove the boot media.

       showmounts
           This  parameter will make live-boot to show on &quot;/&quot; the ro filesystems
           (mostly compressed) on  &quot;/live&quot;.  This  is  not  enabled  by  default
           because  could  lead  to  problems  by applications like &quot;mono&quot; which
           store binary paths on installation.

       silent
           If you boot with the normal quiet  parameter,  live-boot  hides  most
           messages of its own. When adding silent, it hides all.

       todisk=DEVICE
           Adding  this  parameter,  live-boot  will  try  to  copy  the  entire
           read-only media to the specified  device  before  mounting  the  root
           filesystem.  It  probably needs a lot of free space. Subsequent boots
           should then skip this step and just specify  the  &quot;live-media=DEVICE&quot;
           boot parameter with the same DEVICE used this time.

       toram
           Adding this parameter, live-boot will try to copy the whole read-only
           media to the computer&apos;s RAM before mounting the root filesystem. This
           could need a lot of ram, according to the space used by the read-only
           media.

       union=aufs|unionfs
           By default, live-boot uses aufs. With this parameter, you can  switch
           to unionfs.


FILES (old)
       /etc/live.conf
           Some  variables  can  be  configured via this config file (inside the
           live system).

       live/filesystem.module
           This optional file  (inside  the  live  media)  contains  a  list  of
           white-space  or carriage-return-separated file names corresponding to
           disk images in the &quot;/live&quot;  directory.  If  this  file  exists,  only
           images  listed  here will be merged into the root aufs, and they will
           be loaded in the order listed here. The first entry in this file will
           be  the  &quot;lowest&quot;  point  in the aufs, and the last file in this list
           will be on the &quot;top&quot; of the aufs, directly below  /overlay.   Without
           this file, any images in the &quot;/live&quot; directory are loaded in alphanu&#8208;
           meric order.
