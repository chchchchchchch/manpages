LMHOSTS(5)                File Formats and Conventions                LMHOSTS(5)



NAME
       lmhosts - The Samba NetBIOS hosts file

SYNOPSIS
       lmhosts is the samba(7) NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file.

DESCRIPTION
       This file is part of the samba(7) suite.

       lmhosts is the Samba NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file. It is very
       similar to the /etc/hosts file format, except that the hostname component
       must correspond to the NetBIOS naming format.

FILE FORMAT
       It is an ASCII file containing one line for NetBIOS name. The two fields
       on each line are separated from each other by white space. Any entry
       beginning with &#180;#&#180; is ignored. Each line in the lmhosts file contains the
       following information:

       &#183;   IP Address - in dotted decimal format.

       &#183;   NetBIOS Name - This name format is a maximum fifteen character host
           name, with an optional trailing &#180;#&#180; character followed by the NetBIOS
           name type as two hexadecimal digits.

           If the trailing &#180;#&#180; is omitted then the given IP address will be
           returned for all names that match the given name, whatever the
           NetBIOS name type in the lookup.


       An example follows:

           #
           # Sample Samba lmhosts file.
           #
           192.9.200.1    TESTPC
           192.9.200.20   NTSERVER#20
           192.9.200.21   SAMBASERVER

       Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings. The first and third will be
       returned for any queries for the names &quot;TESTPC&quot; and &quot;SAMBASERVER&quot;
       respectively, whatever the type component of the NetBIOS name requested.

       The second mapping will be returned only when the &quot;0x20&quot; name type for a
       name &quot;NTSERVER&quot; is queried. Any other name type will not be resolved.

       The default location of the lmhosts file is in the same directory as the
       smb.conf(5) file.

FILES
       lmhosts is loaded from the configuration directory. This is /etc/samba.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
       Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source
       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
       sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
       Source software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and
       updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
       DocBook XML 4.2 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
