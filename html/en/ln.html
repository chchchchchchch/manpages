NAME
       ln - make links between files

SYNOPSIS
       ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET                  (2nd form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY     (3rd form)
       ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...  (4th form)

DESCRIPTION
       In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In the
       2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In  the  3rd
       and  4th  forms,  create  links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create hard
       links by default, symbolic links with  --symbolic.   When  creating  hard
       links,  each  TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text;
       if later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its par&#8208;
       ent directory.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d, -F, --directory
              allow  the  superuser  to  attempt to hard link directories (note:
              will probably fail due to system restrictions, even for the  supe&#8208;
              ruser)

       -f, --force
              remove existing destination files

       -i, --interactive
              prompt whether to remove destinations

       -L, --logical
              make hard links to symbolic link references

       -n, --no-dereference
              treat destination that is a symlink to a directory as if it were a
              normal file

       -P, --physical
              make hard links directly to symbolic links

       -s, --symbolic
              make symbolic links instead of hard links

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file

       -v, --verbose
              print name of each linked file

       --help display this help and exit
&#12;       --version
              output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is `~&apos;, unless set with --suffix or  SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUF&#8208;
       FIX.   The version control method may be selected via the --backup option
       or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are  the  val&#8208;
       ues:

       Using  -s  ignores  -L and -P.  Otherwise, the last option specified con&#8208;
       trols behavior when the source is a symbolic link, defaulting to -P.

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups
