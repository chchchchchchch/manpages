LNEATO(1)                                                              LNEATO(1)



NAME
       lneato - A Customizable Graph Editor

SYNOPSIS
       lneato [ -V ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       lneato  is  a  graph  editor for the X Window System.  It may be run as a
       standalone editor, or as a front end for applications  that  use  graphs.
       It can control multiple windows viewing different graphs.

       lneato  is written on top of neato and lefty.  lefty is a general-purpose
       programmable editor for technical pictures.  It has an interpretive  pro&#8208;
       gramming  language  similar  to  AWK and C.  The user interface and graph
       editing operations of lneato are written as lefty functions.  Programmer-
       defined  graph  operations may be loaded as well.  Graph layouts are made
       by neato, which runs as a separate process that communicates  with  lefty
       through pipes.

USAGE
       The  file  name is optional. If present, the graph contained in that file
       is displayed in the lneato window.

OPTIONS
       -V     Prints the version.
