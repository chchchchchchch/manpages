LOADUNIMAP(8)                                                      LOADUNIMAP(8)



NAME
       loadunimap - load the kernel unicode-to-font mapping table

SYNOPSIS
       loadunimap [ -C console ] [ -o oldmap ] [ map ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  loadunimap  command  is obsolete - its function is now built-in into
       setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still available as a
       separate command.

       The  program loadunimap loads the specified map in the kernel unicode-to-
       font mapping table.  If no map is given  def  is  assumed.   The  default
       extension (that can be omitted) is .uni.

       If the -o oldmap option is given, the old map is saved in the file speci&#8208;
       fied.

       On Linux 2.6.1 and later one can specify the console device using the  -C
       option.

       Usually  one  does  not  call  loadunimap directly - its function is also
       built into setfont.

FILES
       /usr/share/unimaps is the default directory for unicode mappings.
