LOCALEDEF(1)                                                        LOCALEDEF(1)



NAME
       localedef - compile locale definition files

SYNOPSIS
       localedef [options] outputpath
       localedef --list-archive [options]
       localedef --delete-from-archive [options] localename ...
       localedef --add-to-archive [options] compiledpath
       localedef --version
       localedef --help
       localedef --usage

DESCRIPTION
       The  localedef  program reads the indicated charmap and input files, com&#8208;
       piles them to a binary form quickly usable by the locale(7) functions  in
       the C library, and places the output in outputpath.

       If  outputpath  contains a slash character (&apos;/&apos;), it is directly the name
       of the output directory.  In this case, there is a separate  output  file
       for each locale category (LC_CTIME, LC_NUMERIC, and so on).

       Otherwise,  if the --no-archive option is used, outputpath is the name of
       a subdirectory in /usr/lib/locale where per-category compiled  files  are
       placed.

       Otherwise, outputpath is the name of a locale and the compiled locale da&#8208;
       ta is added to the archive file /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.

       In any case, localedef aborts if the directory in which it tries to write
       locale files has not already been created.

       If  no  charmapfile  is given, the value POSIX is used by default.  If no
       inputfile is given, or if it is given as a dash (-), localedef reads from
       standard input.

OPTIONS
       Most  options can have either short or long forms.  If multiple short op&#8208;
       tions are used, they can be combined in one word  (for  example,  -cv  is
       identical to -c -v).

       If a short option takes an argument, the argument can be given separately
       as the next word (-f foo), or it can be written together with the  option
       letter  (-ffoo).  If a long option takes an argument, the argument can be
       given separately as the next word, or it can be written  as  option=argu&#8208;
       ment (--charmap=foo).

   Operation selection options
       A  few  options direct localedef to do something else than compile locale
       definitions.  Only one of these should be used at a time.

       --delete-from-archive
              Delete the named locales from the locale archive file.

       --list-archive
              List the locales contained in the locale archive file.

       --add-to-archive
              Add the compiledpath directories to the locale archive file.   The
              directories  should  have  been  created  by  previous runs of lo&#8208;
              caledef, using --no-archive.

   Other options
       Some of the following options are  only  sensible  for  some  operations;
       hopefully it is self-evident which ones.

       -f charmapfile, --charmap=charmapfile
              Specify  the  file  that defines the symbolic character names that
              are used by the input file.  If the file is in the default  direc&#8208;
              tory  for  character maps, it is not necessary to specify the full
              pathname.  This default directory is printed by localedef --help.

       -i inputfile, --inputfile=inputfile
              Specify the locale definition file to compile.   If  inputfile  is
              not  absolute,  localedef will also look in the directories speci&#8208;
              fied by the environment variable I18NPATH and in the  default  di&#8208;
              rectory  for  locale  definition files.  This default directory is
              printed by localedef --help.

       -u repertoirefile, --repertoire-map=repertoirefile
              Read mappings from symbolic names  to  Unicode  UCS4  values  from
              repertoirefile.

       -A aliasfile, --alias-file=aliasfile
              Use  aliasfile  to  look up aliases for locale names.  There is no
              default aliases file.

       --prefix=pathname
              Set prefix to be prepended to the full archive pathname.   By  de&#8208;
              fault,  the  prefix  is empty.  Setting the prefix to foo, the ar&#8208;
              chive would be placed in foo/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.

       -c, --force
              Write the output files even if warnings were generated  about  the
              input file.

       --old-style
              Create old-style tables.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate extra warnings about errors that are normally ignored.

       --quiet
              Suppress all notifications and warnings, and report only fatal er&#8208;
              rors.

       --posix
              Conform strictly to POSIX.  Implies --verbose.  This  option  cur&#8208;
              rently  has  no other effect.  Posix conformance is assumed if the
              environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

       --replace
              Replace a locale in the locale archive file.  Without this option,
              if the locale is in the archive file already, an error occurs.

       --no-archive
              Do not use the locale archive file, instead create outputpath as a
              subdirectory in the same directory as the locale archive file, and
              create separate output files for locale categories in it.

       --help Print  a  usage  summary  and exit.  Also prints the default paths
              used by localedef.

       --usage
              Print a short usage summary and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number, license, and disclaimer of warranty  for
              localedef.

ENVIRONMENT
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              The --posix flag is assumed if this environment variable is set.
&#12;       I18NPATH
              A  colon  separated list of default directories for locale defini&#8208;
              tion files.

EXAMPLES
       Compile  the  locale files for Finnish in the UTF-8 character set and add
       it to the default locale archive with the name fi_FI.UTF-8:

              localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI fi_FI.UTF-8

       The same, but generate files into the current directory  (note  that  the
       last argument must then contain a slash):

              localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI ./

AUTHOR
       The program was written by Ulrich Drepper.

       This  manual page was written by Richard Braakman &lt;dark@xs4all.nl&gt; on be&#8208;
       half of the Debian GNU/Linux Project and anyone else who  wants  it.   It
       was amended by Alastair McKinstry &lt;mckinstry@computer.org&gt; to explain new
       ISO 14652 elements, and amended further by Lars Wirzenius &lt;liw@iki.fi&gt; to
       document  new  functionality (as of GNU C library 2.3.5).  The manpage is
       not supported by the GNU libc maintainers and may be out of date.

STANDARDS
       This program conforms to the POSIX standard P1003.2
