LOG1P(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   LOG1P(3)



NAME
       log1p, log1pf, log1pl -  logarithm of 1 plus argument

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double log1p(double x);
       float log1pf(float x);
       long double log1pl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       log1p():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED || _ISOC99_SOURCE ||
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99
       log1pf(), log1pl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
           || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       log1p(x) returns a value equivalent to

           log (1 + x)

       It is computed in a way that is accurate even if the value of x  is  near
       zero.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of (1 + x).

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If  x  is  -1,  a  pole error occurs, and the functions return -HUGE_VAL,
       -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       If x is less than  -1  (including  negative  infinity),  a  domain  error
       occurs, and a NaN (not a number) is returned.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7)  for  information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is less than -1
              An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

       Pole error: x is -1
              A  divide-by-zero  floating-point  exception   (FE_DIVBYZERO)   is
              raised.

       These functions do not set errno.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.
