LOGIN(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   LOGIN(3)



NAME
       login, logout - write utmp and wtmp entries

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;utmp.h&gt;

       void login(const struct utmp *ut);

       int logout(const char *ut_line);

       Link with -lutil.

DESCRIPTION
       The  utmp  file records who is currently using the system.  The wtmp file
       records all logins and logouts.  See utmp(5).

       The function login() takes the supplied struct utmp, ut, and writes it to
       both the utmp and the wtmp file.

       The function logout() clears the entry in the utmp file again.

   GNU Details
       More  precisely,  login()  takes  the argument ut struct, fills the field
       ut-&gt;ut_type (if there is such a field) with the value  USER_PROCESS,  and
       fills the field ut-&gt;ut_pid (if there is such a field) with the process ID
       of the calling process.  Then it tries to fill the field ut-&gt;ut_line.  It
       takes  the  first  of stdin, stdout, stderr that is a tty, and stores the
       corresponding pathname minus a possible leading /dev/  into  this  field,
       and  then  writes  the struct to the utmp file.  On the other hand, if no
       tty name was found, this field is filled with &quot;???&quot;  and  the  struct  is
       not  written  to the utmp file.  After this, the struct is written to the
       wtmp file.

       The logout() function searches the utmp file for an  entry  matching  the
       ut_line argument.  If a record is found, it is updated by zeroing out the
       ut_name and ut_host fields, updating the ut_tv timestamp field  and  set&#8208;
       ting ut_type (if there is such a field) to DEAD_PROCESS.

RETURN VALUE
       The  logout() function returns 1 if the entry was successfully written to
       the database, or 0 if an error occurred.

FILES
       /var/run/utmp
              user  accounting  database,  configured  through   _PATH_UTMP   in
              &lt;paths.h&gt;

       /var/log/wtmp
              user   accounting  log  file,  configured  through  _PATH_WTMP  in
              &lt;paths.h&gt;

CONFORMING TO
       Not in POSIX.1-2001.  Present on the BSDs.

NOTES
       Note that the member ut_user of struct utmp is  called  ut_name  in  BSD.
       Therefore, ut_name is defined as an alias for ut_user in &lt;utmp.h&gt;.
