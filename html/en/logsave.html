LOGSAVE(8)                                                            LOGSAVE(8)



NAME
       logsave - save the output of a command in a logfile

SYNOPSIS
       logsave [ -asv ] logfile cmd_prog [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified argument(s),
       and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If  the  containing  directory
       for  logfile does not exist, logsave will accumulate the output in memory
       until it can be written out.  A copy of the output will also  be  written
       to standard output.

       If  cmd_prog  is  a single hyphen (&apos;-&apos;), then instead of executing a pro&#8208;
       gram, logsave will take its input from standard input and save it in log&#8208;
       file

       logsave is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts until the
       /var partition is mounted, so the output can be written to /var/log.

OPTIONS
       -a     This option will cause the  output  to  be  appended  to  logfile,
              instead of replacing its current contents.

       -s     This  option  will  cause  logsave to skip writing to the log file
              text which is bracketed with a control-A (ASCII 001  or  Start  of
              Header)  and  control-B (ASCII 002 or Start of Text).  This allows
              progress bar information to be visible to the user on the console,
              while not being written to the log file.

       -v     This  option will make logsave to be more verbose in its output to
              the user.
