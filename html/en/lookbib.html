LOOKBIB(1)                                                            LOOKBIB(1)



NAME
       lookbib - search bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
       lookbib [ -v ] [ -istring ] [ -tn ] filename...

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       lookbib prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard  input
       is not a terminal), reads from the standard input a line containing a set
       of keywords, searches the bibliographic databases filename... for  refer&#8208;
       ences containing those keywords, prints any references found on the stan&#8208;
       dard output, and repeats this process until the end of input.   For  each
       database  filename  to  be  searched,  if  an index filename.i created by
       indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover
       multiple databases.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -istring
              When  searching  files  for which no index exists, ignore the con&#8208;
              tents of fields whose names are in string.

       -tn    Only require the first n characters of keys  to  be  given.   Ini&#8208;
              tially n is 6.
