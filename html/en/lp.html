DESCRIPTION
       lp submits files for printing or alters a pending job. Use a filename  of
       &quot;-&quot; to force printing from the standard input.

THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS  provides many ways to set the default destination. The &quot;LPDEST&quot; and
       &quot;PRINTER&quot; environment variables are consulted first. If neither are  set,
       the  current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used, followed
       by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lp:

       --
            Marks the end of options; use this to print a file whose name begins
            with a dash (-).

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

       -c
            This option is provided for backwards-compatibility only. On systems
            that support it, this option forces the print file to be  copied  to
            the spool directory before printing. In CUPS, print files are always
            sent to the scheduler via IPP which has the same effect.

       -d destination
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -i job-id
            Specifies an existing job to modify.

       -m
            Sends an email when the job is completed.

       -n copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -o &quot;name=value [name=value ...]&quot;
            Sets one or more job options.

       -q priority
            Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest). The  default
            priority is 50.

       -s
            Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent mode.)

       -t &quot;name&quot;
            Sets the job name.

       -H hh:mm

       -H hold

       -H immediate

       -H restart

       -H resume
            Specifies  when the job should be printed. A value of immediate will
            print the file immediately, a value of hold will hold the job indef&#8208;
            initely,  and  a  UTC time value (HH:MM) will hold the job until the
            specified UTC (not local) time. Use a value of resume  with  the  -i
            option  to  resume  a  held job.  Use a value of restart with the -i
            option to restart a completed job.

       -P page-list
            Specifies which pages to print in the document. The list can contain
            a  list  of  numbers  and  ranges  (#-#)  separated  by commas (e.g.
            1,3-5,16). The page numbers refer to the output pages  and  not  the
            document&apos;s  original pages - options like &quot;number-up&quot; can affect the
            numbering of the pages.

COMMON JOB OPTIONS
       Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the lpoptions(1) com&#8208;
       mand, the following generic options are available:

       -o media=size
            Sets  the page size to size. Most printers support at least the size
            names &quot;a4&quot;, &quot;letter&quot;, and &quot;legal&quot;.

       -o landscape

       -o orientation-requested=4
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees).

       -o sides=one-sided

       -o sides=two-sided-long-edge

       -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
            Prints on one or two sides of the paper. The value  &quot;two-sided-long-
            edge&quot;  is  normally  used  when printing portrait (unrotated) pages,
            while &quot;two-sided-short-edge&quot; is used for landscape pages.

       -o fitplot
            Scales the print file to fit on the page.

       -o number-up=2

       -o number-up=4

       -o number-up=6

       -o number-up=9

       -o number-up=16
            Prints multiple document pages on each output page.
&#12;       -o scaling=number
            Scales image files to use up to number percent of the page.   Values
            greater  than 100 cause the image file to be printed across multiple
            pages.

       -o cpi=N
            Sets the number of characters per inch to use when printing  a  text
            file. The default is 10.

       -o lpi=N
            Sets  the number of lines per inch to use when printing a text file.
            The default is 6.

       -o page-bottom=N

       -o page-left=N

       -o page-right=N

       -o page-top=N
            Sets the page margins when printing text files. The  values  are  in
            points - there are 72 points to the inch.

EXAMPLES
       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called &quot;foo&quot;:
           lp -d foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print an image across 4 pages:
           lp -d bar -o scaling=200 filename

       Print  a text file with 12 characters per inch, 8 lines per inch, and a 1
       inch left margin:
           lp -d bar -o cpi=12 -o lpi=8 -o page-left=72 filename

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any  printable  character  except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, or &quot;#&quot;.  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The &quot;q&quot; option accepts a different range of values than  the  Solaris  lp
       command, matching the IPP job priority values (1-100, 100 is highest pri&#8208;
       ority) instead of the Solaris values (0-39, 0 is highest priority).
