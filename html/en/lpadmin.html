lpadmin(8)                         Apple Inc.                         lpadmin(8)



NAME
       lpadmin - configure cups printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destination
       lpadmin  [  -E  ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -p destination [ -R
       name-default ] option(s)
       lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination

DESCRIPTION
       lpadmin configures printer and class queues provided by CUPS. It can also
       be used to set the server default printer or class.

       When  specified  before  the  -d, -p, or -x options, the -E option forces
       encryption when connecting to the server.

       The first form of the command (-d) sets the default printer or  class  to
       destination.   Subsequent  print  jobs  submitted via the lp(1) or lpr(1)
       commands will use this destination unless the  user  specifies  otherwise
       with the lpoptions(1) command.

       The  second  form  of  the  command  (-p) configures the named printer or
       class.  The additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command (-x) deletes the printer or class  destina&#8208;
       tion.  Any  jobs that are pending for the destination will be removed and
       any job that is currently printed will be aborted.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized when configuring a printer queue:

       -c class
            Adds the named printer to class.  If class does not exist it is cre&#8208;
            ated automatically.

       -i interface
            Sets  a System V style interface script for the printer. This option
            cannot be specified with the -P option (PPD file)  and  is  intended
            for providing support for legacy printer drivers.

       -m model
            Sets  a  standard  System  V  interface  script  or PPD file for the
            printer from the model directory or using one of the  driver  inter&#8208;
            faces. Use the -m option with the lpinfo(8) command to get a list of
            supported models.

       -o cupsIPPSupplies=true

       -o cupsIPPSupplies=false
            Specifies whether IPP supply level values should be reported.

       -o cupsSNMPSupplies=true

       -o cupsSNMPSupplies=false
            Specifies whether SNMP supply level  (RFC  3805)  values  should  be
            reported.

       -o job-k-limit=value
            Sets the kilobyte limit for per-user quotas. The value is an integer
            number of kilobytes; one kilobyte is 1024 bytes.

       -o job-page-limit=value
            Sets the page limit for per-user quotas. The value  is  the  integer
            number  of pages that can be printed; double-sided pages are counted
            as two pages.

       -o job-quota-period=value
            Sets the accounting period for per-user  quotas.  The  value  is  an
            integer number of seconds; 86,400 seconds are in one day.

       -o job-sheets-default=banner

       -o job-sheets-default=banner,banner
            Sets the default banner page(s) to use for print jobs.

       -o name=value
            Sets  a  PPD option for the printer. PPD options can be listed using
            the -l option with the lpoptions(1) command.

       -o name-default=value
            Sets a default server-side option for the  destination.  Any  print-
            time  option  can  be defaulted, e.g. &quot;-o cpi-default=17&quot; to set the
            default &quot;cpi&quot; option value to 17.

       -o port-monitor=name
            Sets the binary communications program to use when printing, &quot;none&quot;,
            &quot;bcp&quot;,  or &quot;tbcp&quot;. The default program is &quot;none&quot;. The specified port
            monitor must be listed in the printer&apos;s PPD file.

       -o printer-error-policy=name
            Sets the error policy to be used when the printer backend is  unable
            to send the job to the printer. The name must be one of &quot;abort-job&quot;,
            &quot;retry-job&quot;, &quot;retry-current-job&quot;,  or  &quot;stop-printer&quot;.  The  default
            error  policy is &quot;stop-printer&quot; for printers and &quot;retry-current-job&quot;
            for classes.

       -o printer-is-shared=true/false
            Sets the destination to  shared/published  or  unshared/unpublished.
            Shared/published  destinations  are publicly announced by the server
            on the LAN based on the browsing configuration in cupsd.conf,  while
            unshared/unpublished  destinations  are  not  announced. The default
            value is &quot;true&quot;.

       -o printer-op-policy=name
            Sets the IPP operation policy associated with the  destination.  The
            name  must  be  defined  in the cupsd.conf in a Policy section.  The
            default operation policy is &quot;default&quot;.

       -R name-default
            Deletes the named option from printer.

       -r class
            Removes the named  printer  from  class.   If  the  resulting  class
            becomes empty it is removed.

       -u allow:user,user,@group

       -u deny:user,user,@group

       -u allow:all

       -u deny:none
            Sets user-level access control on a destination. Names starting with
            &quot;@&quot; are interpreted as UNIX groups. The latter two forms turn  user-
            level access control off.

       -v &quot;device-uri&quot;
            Sets  the  device-uri attribute of the printer queue.  If device-uri
            is  a  filename  it  is  automatically   converted   to   the   form
            file:///file/name.  Use  the -v option with the lpinfo(8) command to
            get a list of supported device URIs and schemes.
&#12;       -D &quot;info&quot;
            Provides a textual description of the destination.

       -E
            Enables the destination and accepts jobs; this is the same  as  run&#8208;
            ning  the  cupsaccept(8)  and cupsenable(8) programs on the destina&#8208;
            tion.

       -L &quot;location&quot;
            Provides a textual location of the destination.

       -P ppd-file
            Specifies a PostScript Printer Description  file  to  use  with  the
            printer.  If  specified, this option overrides the -i option (inter&#8208;
            face script).

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any  printable  character  except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, or &quot;#&quot;.  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.  Finally,  the  CUPS  version  of
       lpadmin may ask the user for an access password depending on the printing
       system configuration. This  differs  from  the  System  V  version  which
       requires the root user to execute this command.

LIMITATIONS
       The  CUPS  version  of  lpadmin  does  not support all of the System V or
       Solaris printing system configuration options.
