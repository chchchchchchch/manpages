NAME
       lpr - print files

SYNOPSIS
       lpr  [  -E  ]  [  -H  server[:port]  ]  [  -U  username  ]  [ -P destina&#8208;
       tion[/instance] ]  [  -#  num-copies  [  -h  ]  [  -l  ]  [  -m  ]  [  -o
       option[=value] ] [ -p] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C/J/T title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr  submits files for printing. Files named on the command line are sent
       to the named printer (or the default destination  if  no  destination  is
       specified).  If  no  files  are listed on the command-line, lpr reads the
       print file from the standard input.

THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The &quot;LPDEST&quot;  and
       &quot;PRINTER&quot;  environment variables are consulted first. If neither are set,
       the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used,  followed
       by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -C &quot;name&quot;

       -J &quot;name&quot;

       -T &quot;name&quot;
            Sets the job name.

       -P destination[/instance]
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -# copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -h
            Disables  banner  printing.  This  option  is equivalent to &quot;-o job-
            sheets=none&quot;.

       -l
            Specifies that the print file is already formatted for the  destina&#8208;
            tion and should be sent without filtering. This option is equivalent
            to &quot;-o raw&quot;.

       -m
            Send an email on job completion.

       -o option[=value]
            Sets a job option.

       -p
            Specifies that the print file should  be  formatted  with  a  shaded
            header  with  the date, time, job name, and page number. This option
            is equivalent to &quot;-o prettyprint&quot; and is only useful  when  printing
            text files.

       -q
            Hold job for printing.

       -r
            Specifies  that the named print files should be deleted after print&#8208;
            ing them.

COMPATIBILITY
       The &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;w&quot; options are not  sup&#8208;
       ported by CUPS and produce a warning message if used.
