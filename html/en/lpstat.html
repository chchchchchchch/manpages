NAME
       lpstat - print cups status information

SYNOPSIS
       lpstat  [  -E ] [ -H ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -l ] [ -W
       which-jobs ] [ -a [ destination(s) ] ] [ -c [ class(es) ] ] [ -d ] [ -o [
       destination(s) ] ] [ -p [ printer(s) ] ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -u
       [ user(s) ] ] [ -v [ printer(s) ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpstat displays status information about the current classes,  jobs,  and
       printers. When run with no arguments, lpstat will list jobs queued by the
       current user.

OPTIONS
       The lpstat command supports the following options:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H
            Shows the server hostname and port.

       -R
            Shows the ranking of print jobs.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -W which-jobs
            Specifies which  jobs  to  show,  completed  or  not-completed  (the
            default).  This  option  must appear before the -o option and/or any
            printer names, otherwise the default (not-completed) value  will  be
            used in the request to the scheduler.

       -a [printer(s)]
            Shows  the  accepting  state  of  printer queues. If no printers are
            specified then all printers are listed.

       -c [class(es)]
            Shows the printer classes and the printers that belong to them.   If
            no classes are specified then all classes are listed.

       -d
            Shows the current default destination.

       -h server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -l
            Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.

       -o [destination(s)]
            Shows  the  jobs queue on the specified destinations. If no destina&#8208;
            tions are specified all jobs are shown.

       -p [printer(s)]
            Shows the printers and whether or not they are enabled for printing.
            If no printers are specified then all printers are listed.

       -r
            Shows whether the CUPS server is running.

       -s
            Shows a status summary, including the default destination, a list of
            classes and their member printers, and a list of printers and  their
            associated  devices. This is equivalent to using the &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, and
            &quot;-v&quot; options.

       -t
            Shows all status information. This is equivalent to using the  &quot;-r&quot;,
            &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-v&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-p&quot;, and &quot;-o&quot; options.

       -u [user(s)]
            Shows  a  list  of  print  jobs queued by the specified users. If no
            users are specified, lists the jobs queued by the current user.

       -v [printer(s)]
            Shows the printers and what device  they  are  attached  to.  If  no
            printers are specified then all printers are listed.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any printable character except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, and &quot;#&quot;.   Also,  printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The &quot;-h&quot;, &quot;-E&quot;, &quot;-U&quot;, and &quot;-W&quot; options are unique to CUPS.

       The Solaris &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-P&quot;, and &quot;-S&quot; options are silently ignored.
