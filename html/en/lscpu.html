LSCPU(1)                          User Commands                         LSCPU(1)



NAME
       lscpu - display information on CPU architecture

SYNOPSIS
       lscpu [-hpx] [-s directory]

DESCRIPTION
       lscpu  gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs, threads,
       cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about  CPU  caches,  CPU  family,
       model,  bogoMIPS,  byte  order and stepping from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo,
       and prints it in a human-readable format.  It supports  both  online  and
       offline  CPUs.  It can also print out in a parsable format, including how
       different caches are shared by different CPUs, which can be fed to  other
       programs.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a help message.

       -p, --parse [=list]
              Print out in parsable instead of human-readable format.

              If the list argument is not given then the default backwardly com&#8208;
              patible output is printed.  The backwardly compatible format  uses
              two  commas  to  separate  CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches are
              identified, then the cache columns are not printed at all.

              The list argument is comma delimited list  of  the  columns.  Cur&#8208;
              rently  supported are CPU, Core, Node, Socket, Book and Cache col&#8208;
              umns. If the list argument is given then always all requested col&#8208;
              umns are printed in the defined order. The Cache columns are sepa&#8208;
              rated by &apos;:&apos;.

              Note that the optional list argument cannot be separated from  the
              option  by  a space, the correct form is for example &apos;-p=cpu,node&apos;
              or &apos;--parse=cpu,node&apos;.

       -s, --sysroot directory
              Use the specified directory as system root.  This  allows  you  to
              inspect a snapshot from a different system.

       -x, --hex
              Use  hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3).  The default is to
              print the sets in list format (e.g. 0,1).

BUGS
       The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always based  on  the
       first CPU only.

       Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
