lspci(8)                        The PCI Utilities                       lspci(8)



NAME
       lspci - list all PCI devices

SYNOPSIS
       lspci [options]

DESCRIPTION
       lspci is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the sys&#8208;
       tem and devices connected to them.

       By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the  options  described
       below  to  request  either  a  more verbose output or output intended for
       parsing by other programs.

       If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or in lspci itself,
       please include output of &quot;lspci -vvx&quot; or even better &quot;lspci -vvxxx&quot; (how&#8208;
       ever, see below for possible caveats).

       Some parts of the output, especially in the  highly  verbose  modes,  are
       probably  intelligible only to experienced PCI hackers. For exact defini&#8208;
       tions of the fields, please consult either the PCI specifications or  the
       header.h and /usr/include/linux/pci.h include files.

       Access to some parts of the PCI configuration space is restricted to root
       on many operating systems, so the features of lspci available  to  normal
       users  are  limited.  However, lspci tries its best to display as much as
       available and mark all other information with &lt;access denied&gt; text.


OPTIONS
   Basic display modes
       -m     Dump PCI device data in  a  backward-compatible  machine  readable
              form.  See below for details.

       -mm    Dump  PCI  device data in a machine readable form for easy parsing
              by scripts.  See below for details.

       -t     Show a tree-like diagram containing all  buses,  bridges,  devices
              and connections between them.


   Display options
       -v     Be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.

       -vv    Be  very  verbose  and  display  more details. This level includes
              everything deemed useful.

       -vvv   Be even more verbose and display everything we are able to  parse,
              even if it doesn&apos;t look interesting at all (e.g., undefined memory
              regions).

       -k     Show kernel drivers handling each device and also  kernel  modules
              capable  of handling it.  Turned on by default when -v is given in
              the normal mode of output.  (Currently works only  on  Linux  with
              kernel 2.6 or newer.)

       -x     Show  hexadecimal  dump  of the standard part of the configuration
              space (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).

       -xxx   Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration space. It  is
              available  only  to root as several PCI devices crash when you try
              to read some parts of the config  space  (this  behavior  probably
              doesn&apos;t  violate the PCI standard, but it&apos;s at least very stupid).
              However, such devices are rare, so you needn&apos;t worry much.

       -xxxx  Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte)  PCI  configura&#8208;
              tion space available on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.

       -b     Bus-centric  view.  Show  all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by
              the cards on the PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.

       -D     Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci suppresses  them
              on machines which have only domain 0.


   Options to control resolving ID&apos;s to names
       -n     Show  PCI  vendor  and  device codes as numbers instead of looking
              them up in the PCI ID list.

       -nn    Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.

       -q     Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a  device  is  not
              found  in  the  local pci.ids file. If the DNS query succeeds, the
              result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in subse&#8208;
              quent  runs  even  if  -q  is  not given any more. Please use this
              switch inside automated scripts only with caution to  avoid  over&#8208;
              loading the database servers.

       -qq    Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.

       -Q     Query  the  central database even for entries which are recognized
              locally.  Use this if you suspect  that  the  displayed  entry  is
              wrong.


   Options for selection of devices
       -s [[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;slot&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]
              Show  only  devices  in the specified domain (in case your machine
              has several host bridges, they can either share a common bus  num&#8208;
              ber  space  or  each  of them can address a PCI domain of its own;
              domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff),  slot  (0  to
              1f)  and  function (0 to 7).  Each component of the device address
              can be omitted or set to &quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any value&quot;.  All  num&#8208;
              bers  are hexadecimal.  E.g., &quot;0:&quot; means all devices on bus 0, &quot;0&quot;
              means all functions of device 0 on any bus,  &quot;0.3&quot;  selects  third
              function  of  device 0 on all buses and &quot;.4&quot; shows only the fourth
              function of each device.

       -d [&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;]
              Show only devices with specified vendor and device ID.  Both  ID&apos;s
              are  given in hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as &quot;*&quot;, both
              meaning &quot;any value&quot;.


   Other options
       -i &lt;file&gt;
              Use &lt;file&gt; as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/misc/pci.ids.

       -p &lt;file&gt;
              Use &lt;file&gt; as the map of PCI ID&apos;s handled by  kernel  modules.  By
              default,  lspci  uses  /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.
              Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

       -M     Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all  PCI
              devices,  including  those behind misconfigured bridges, etc. This
              option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware access
              mode,  which  usually  requires root privileges.  Please note that
              the bus mapper only scans PCI domain 0.

       --version
              Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone.


   PCI access options
       The PCI utilities use the  PCI  library  to  talk  to  PCI  devices  (see
       pcilib(7)  for  details).  You can use the following options to influence
       its behavior:

       -A &lt;method&gt;
              The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI  hard&#8208;
              ware.   By default, it uses the first access method available, but
              you can use this option to override this decision. See -A help for
              a list of available methods and their descriptions.

       -O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
              The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parame&#8208;
              ters.  This option allows to set the value of any of  the  parame&#8208;
              ters. Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their default
              values.

       -H1    Use direct hardware access via Intel  configuration  mechanism  1.
              (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)

       -H2    Use  direct  hardware  access via Intel configuration mechanism 2.
              (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)

       -F &lt;file&gt;
              Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of  devices  and
              values  of  their configuration registers from the given file pro&#8208;
              duced by an earlier run of lspci -x.   This  is  very  useful  for
              analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the
              hardware configuration in any way you want without disturbing  the
              user with requests for more dumps.

       -G     Increase debug level of the library.


MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT
       If  you  intend  to process the output of lspci automatically, please use
       one of the machine-readable output formats (-m, -vm, -vmm)  described  in
       this  section. All other formats are likely to change between versions of
       lspci.


       All numbers are always printed in hexadecimal. If  you  want  to  process
       numeric ID&apos;s instead of names, please add the -n switch.


   Simple format (-m)
       In the simple format, each device is described on a single line, which is
       formatted as parameters suitable for passing to  a  shell  script,  i.e.,
       values  separated  by whitespaces, quoted and escaped if necessary.  Some
       of the arguments are positional: slot, class, vendor name,  device  name,
       subsystem  vendor  name and subsystem name (the last two are empty if the
       device has no subsystem); the remaining arguments are option-like:


       -rrev  Revision number.


       -pprogif
              Programming interface.
&#12;       The relative order of positional arguments and options is undefined.  New
       options can be added in future versions, but they will always have a sin&#8208;
       gle argument not separated from the option by any spaces, so they can  be
       easily ignored if not recognized.


   Verbose format (-vmm)
       The  verbose  output  is  a sequence of records separated by blank lines.
       Each record describes a single device by a sequence of lines,  each  line
       containing  a  single  `tag: value&apos; pair. The tag and the value are sepa&#8208;
       rated by a single tab character.   Neither  the  records  nor  the  lines
       within a record are in any particular order.  Tags are case-sensitive.


       The following tags are defined:


       Slot   The    name    of    the    slot    where   the   device   resides
              ([domain:]bus:device.function).  This tag is always the first in a
              record.


       Class  Name of the class.


       Vendor Name of the vendor.


       Device Name of the device.


       SVendor
              Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).


       SDevice
              Name of the subsystem (optional).


       PhySlot
              The physical slot where the device resides (optional, Linux only).


       Rev    Revision number (optional).


       ProgIf Programming interface (optional).


       Driver Kernel  driver  currently  handling  the  device  (optional, Linux
              only).


       Module Kernel module reporting that it is capable of handling the  device
              (optional, Linux only).


       New  tags  can be added in future versions, so you should silently ignore
       any tags you don&apos;t recognize.


   Backward-compatible verbose format (-vm)
       In this mode, lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with  its  old  ver&#8208;
       sions.   It&apos;s  almost  the  same  as  the regular verbose format, but the
       Device tag is used for both the slot and the device name,  so  it  occurs
       twice in a single record. Please avoid using this format in any new code.


FILES
       /usr/share/misc/pci.ids
              A  list  of all known PCI ID&apos;s (vendors, devices, classes and sub&#8208;
              classes). Maintained at  http://pciids.sourceforge.net/,  use  the
              update-pciids utility to download the most recent version.

       /usr/share/misc/pci.ids.gz
              If  lspci  is  compiled with support for compression, this file is
              tried before pci.ids.

       ~/.pciids-cache
              All ID&apos;s found in the DNS query mode are cached in this file.


BUGS
       Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the configuration  registers  com&#8208;
       pletely.   This  usually happens when not enough documentation was avail&#8208;
       able to the authors.  In such cases, it at least prints the &lt;?&gt;  mark  to
       signal  that  there is potentially something more to say. If you know the
       details, patches will be of course welcome.

       Access to the extended configuration space is currently supported only by
       the linux_sysfs back-end.
