lsusb(8)                       Linux USB Utilities                      lsusb(8)



NAME
       lsusb - list USB devices

SYNOPSIS
       lsusb [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       lsusb is a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the sys&#8208;
       tem and the devices connected to them.


OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Tells lsusb to be verbose and display detailed  information  about
              the  devices  shown.   This includes configuration descriptors for
              the device&apos;s current speed.  Class descriptors will be shown, when
              available,  for USB device classes including hub, audio, HID, com&#8208;
              munications, and chipcard.

       -s [[bus]:][devnum]
              Show only devices in specified bus and/or devnum.  Both  ID&apos;s  are
              given in decimal and may be omitted.

       -d [vendor]:[product]
              Show  only devices with the specified vendor and product ID.  Both
              ID&apos;s are given in hexadecimal.

       -D device
              Do not scan  the  /dev/bus/usb  directory,  instead  display  only
              information  about  the  device  whose  device file is given.  The
              device file should be something like  /dev/bus/usb/001/001.   This
              option  displays  detailed information like the v option; you must
              be root to do this.

       -t     Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as  a  tree.
              This overrides the v option.

       -V, --version
              Print   version information on standard output, then exit success&#8208;
              fully.


RETURN VALUE
       If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.


FILES
       /var/lib/usbutils/usb.ids
              A list of all known USB ID&apos;s  (vendors,  products,  classes,  sub&#8208;
              classes and protocols).


SEE ALSO
       lspci(8), usbview(8).
