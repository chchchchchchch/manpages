ltrace(1)                                                              ltrace(1)



NAME
       ltrace - A library call tracer


SYNOPSIS
       ltrace  [-CfhiLrStttV]  [-a column] [-A maxelts] [-D level] [-e expr] [-l
       filename] [-n nr] [-o filename] [-p pid] ... [-s strsize]  [-u  username]
       [-X extern] [-x extern] ... [--align=column] [--debug=level] [--demangle]
       [--help] [--indent=nr] [--library=filename]  [--output=filename]  [--ver&#8208;
       sion] [command [arg ...]]


DESCRIPTION
       ltrace  is  a  program  that  simply  runs the specified command until it
       exits.  It intercepts and records the dynamic  library  calls  which  are
       called by the executed process and the signals which are received by that
       process.  It can also intercept and print the system  calls  executed  by
       the program.

       Its use is very similar to strace(1).


OPTIONS
       -a, --align column
              Align return values in a specific column (default column is 5/8 of
              screen width).

       -A maxelts
              Maximum number of array elements to print before  suppressing  the
              rest with an ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;)

       -c     Count time and calls for each library call and report a summary on
              program exit.

       -C, --demangle
              Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names  into  user-level  names.
              Besides removing any initial underscore prefix used by the system,
              this makes C++ function names readable.

       -D, --debug level
              Show debugging output of ltrace itself.  level must be  a  sum  of
              some of the following numbers:

              01     DEBUG_GENERAL.  Shows helpful progress information

              010    DEBUG_EVENT.   Shows  every event received by a traced pro&#8208;
                     gram

              020    DEBUG_PROCESS.  Shows every action ltrace  carries  upon  a
                     traced process

              040    DEBUG_FUNCTION.  Shows every entry to internal functions

       -e expr
              A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace.  The
              format of the expression is:
              [!]value1[,value2]...
              where the values are the functions to trace.  Using an exclamation
              mark  negates  the  set of values.  For example -e printf means to
              trace only the printf library call.  By contrast, -e !printf means
              to trace every library call except printf.
&#12;              Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expan&#8208;
              sion; even inside quoted arguments.  If so, you  must  escape  the
              exclamation point with a backslash.

       -f     Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced pro&#8208;
              cesses as a result of the fork(2) or clone(2) system  calls.   The
              new process is attached immediately.

       -F     Load  an  alternate  config  file.  Normally, /etc/ltrace.conf and
              ~/.ltrace.conf will be read (the latter only if it  exists).   Use
              this  option  to load the given file or files instead of those two
              default files.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit.

       -i     Print the instruction pointer at the time of the library call.

       -l, --library filename
              Display only the symbols included in the library filename.  Up  to
              30  library  names can be specified with several instances of this
              option.

       -L     DON&apos;T display library calls (use it with the -S option).

       -n, --indent nr
              Indent trace output by nr number of spaces  for  each  new  nested
              call.  Using this option makes the program flow visualization easy
              to follow.

       -o, --output filename
              Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.

       -p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing.

       -r     Print a relative timestamp with each  line  of  the  trace.   This
              records  the  time  difference between the beginning of successive
              lines.

       -s strsize
              Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).

       -S     Display system calls as well as library calls

       -t     Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

       -tt    If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       -ttt   If given thrice, the time printed will  include  the  microseconds
              and  the  leading portion will be printed as the number of seconds
              since the epoch.

       -T     Show  the  time  spent inside each call.  This  records  the  time
              difference between the beginning and the end of each call.

       -u username
              Run  command  with the userid, groupid and supplementary groups of
              username.  This option is only useful when  running  as  root  and
              enables the correct execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.

       -X extern
              Some  architectures  need  to  know where to set a breakpoint that
              will be hit after the dynamic linker has run.   If  this  flag  is
              used,  then  the  breakpoint  is  set  at extern, which must be an
              external function.  By default, &apos;_start&apos; is used.  NOTE: this flag
              is only available on the architectures that need it.

       -x extern
              Trace the external function extern.  This option may be repeated.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number of ltrace and exit.


BUGS
       It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).

       Manual page and documentation are not very up-to-date.

       Option -f sometimes fails to trace some children.

       It only works on Linux and in a small subset of architectures.

       Only ELF32 binaries are supported.

       Calls to dlopen()ed libraries will not be traced.

       If  you  would  like  to report a bug, send a message to the mailing list
       (ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org), or use the  reportbug(1)  program
       if you are under the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.


FILES
       /etc/ltrace.conf
              System configuration file

       ~/.ltrace.conf
              Personal config file, overrides /etc/ltrace.conf
