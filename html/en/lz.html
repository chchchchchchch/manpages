LZ(1)                          Mtools Users Manual                         LZ(1)



NAME
       lz - gunzips and shows a listing of a gzip&apos;d tar&apos;d archive

SYNOPSIS
       lz file

DESCRIPTION
       lz provides a listing of a gzip&apos;d tar&apos;d archive, that is a tar(1) archive
       compressed with the gzip(1) utility.  It is  not  strictly  necessary  on
       Debian  GNU/Linux, because the GNU tar(1) program provides the same capa&#8208;
       bility with the command

       tar -tzf file

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package  for  other  platforms
       and is retained here for completeness.
