NAME
       macpack - Macintosh OS X Packager for managed gui assemblies

SYNOPSIS
       macpack [options] assembly

DESCRIPTION
       macpack  is  a  tool used to package managed assemblies (like System.Win&#8208;
       dows.Forms or Cocoa#) that require gui availability for deployment on Mac
       OS X.

       macpack  will prepare a OS X compatible bundle from the provided assembly
       and resources.  The bundle will include the specified assembly as well as
       any of the provided resources (specified with the -resource: switch).

       Developers  can  specify  the  kind  of  application to produce using the
       -mode: argument.  This controls how the environment  in  the  Mono  class
       libraries is setup.

OPTIONS
       -a assembly

       This  option  tells  macpack  where the managed assembly that you want to
       bundle resides.  This option is also used to point to the shell script to
       launch in the case of a X11/Gtk# application.

       This is the same as just passing the assembly as an argument.

       -m [winforms,x11,console,cocoa] or -mode:[winforms,x11,console,cocoa]

       A value indicating the kind of application: WinForms is a Winforms appli&#8208;
       cation running on Quartz;  X11 is an application that  requires  the  X11
       server  to  run;   console  is  a non-graphical application;  cocoa is an
       application based on Cocoa#

       -n NAME or -appname:NAME

       This option specifies the application name of the emitted  bundle.   This
       is what you will see in Finder.

       -o DIRECTORY or -output:DIRECTORY

       This option specifies the path to output the generated Application.

       -r RESOURCE or -resource:RESOURCE

       This  option  can  be  specified multiple times.  It will place a copy of
       each resource into the bundles resources directory.   Alternatively,  you
       can use a comma separated list of resources.
