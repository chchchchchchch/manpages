MAILNAME(5)                Linux System Administration               MAILNAME(5)



NAME
       mailname - the visible mail name of the system

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/mailname  is a plain ASCII configuration file, which on a
       Debian system contains the visible mail name of the system.  It  is  used
       by  many  different programs, usually programs that wish to send or relay
       mail, and need to know the name of the system.

       The file contains only one line describing  the  fully  qualified  domain
       name  that  the program wishing to get the mail name should use (that is,
       everything after the @).
