NAME
       MakeCert - Create X.509 certificates for test purposes

SYNOPSIS
       makecert [options] certificate

DESCRIPTION
       Create an X.509 certificate using the provided informations. This is use&#8208;
       ful for testing Authenticode signatures, SSL and S/MIME technologies.

PARAMETERS
       -# num Specify the certificate serial number.

       -n dn  Specify the subject Distinguished Name (DN).

       -in dn Specify the issuer Distinguished Name (DN).

       -r     Create a self-signed, also called root, certificate.

       -iv pvkfile
              Specify the private key file (.PVK) for the  issuer.  The  private
              key  in  the  specified file will be used to sign the new certifi&#8208;
              cate.

       -ic certfile
              Extract the issuer&apos;s name from the specified  certificate  file  -
              i.e.  the  subject  name  of the specified certificate becomes the
              issuer name of the new certificate.

       -in name
              Use the issuer&apos;s name from the specified parameter.

       -ik container
              Specify the key container name to be used for the issuer.

       -iky [signature | exchange | #]
              Specify the key number to be used in the provider (when used  with
              -ik).

       -ip provider
              Specify the cryptographic provider to be used for the issuer.

       -ir [localmachine | currentuser]
              Specify the provider will search the user or the machine keys con&#8208;
              tainers for the issuer.

       -iy number
              Specify the provider type to be used for the issuer.

       -sv pkvfile
              Specify the private key file (.PVK) for the  subject.  The  public
              part  of the key will be inserted into the created certificate. If
              non-existant the specified file will be created  with  a  new  key
              pair (default to 1024 bits RSA key pair).

       -sk container
              Specify the key container name to be used for the subject.

       -sky [signature | exchange | #]
              Specify  the key number to be used in the provider (when used with
              -sk).
&#12;       -sp provider
              Specify the cryptographic provider to be used for the subject.

       -sr [localmachine | currentuser]
              Specify the provider will search the user or the machine keys con&#8208;
              tainers for the subject.

       -sy number
              Specify the provider type to be used for the issuer.

       -a hash
              Select hash algorithm. Only MD5 and SHA1 algorithms are supported.

       -b date
              The date since when the certificate is valid (notBefore).

       -e date
              The date until when the certificate is valid (notAfter).

       -m number
              Specify  the  certificate validity period in months. This is added
              to the notBefore validity date which can be set with  -b  or  will
              default to the current date/time.

       -cy [authority|end]
              Basic  constraints.  Select  Authority  or End-Entity certificate.
              Only Authority certificates can be used to sign other certificates
              (-ic).  End-Entity  can  be  used  by  clients (e.g. Authenticode,
              S/MIME) or servers (e.g. SSL).

       -h number
              Add a path length restriction to the certificate  chain.  This  is
              only  applicable for certificates that have BasicConstraint set to
              Authority (-cy authority). This is used to limit the chain of cer&#8208;
              tificates than can be issued under this authority.

       -eku oid[,oid]
              Add some extended key usage OID to the certificate.

       -p12 pkcs12file password
              Create  a  new  PKCS#12 file containing both the certificates (the
              subject and possibly  the  issuer&apos;s)  and  the  private  key.  The
              PKCS#12 file is protected with the specified password. This option
              is mono exclusive.

EXAMPLES
       To create a SSL test (i.e. non trusted) certificate  is  easy  once  your
       know  your host&apos;s name. The following command will create a test certifi&#8208;
       cate for an SSL server:
            $ hostname
            pollux

            $ makecert -r -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 -n &quot;CN=pollux&quot; -sv pollux.pvk pollux.cer
            Success

       In particular in the above example, the parameters  used  to  build  this
       test certificate were:

       -r     Create a self-signed certificate (i.e. without an hierarchy).

       -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
              Optional  (as  sadly most client don&apos;t require it). This indicates
              that your certificate is intended for server-side authentication.

       -n     Common Name (CN) = Host name. This is verified the SSL client  and
              must  match  the  connected  host (or else you&apos;ll get a warning or
              error or *gasp* nothing).

       -sv private.key
              The private key file. The key (1024 bits RSA  key  pair)  will  be
              automatically generated if the specified file isn&apos;t present.

       pollux.cer
              The SSL certificate to be created for your host.

KNOWN RESTRICTIONS
       Compared  to  the  Windows version some options aren&apos;t supported (-$, -d,
       -l, -nscp, -is, -sc, -ss). Also PVK  files  with  passwords  aren&apos;t  sup&#8208;
       ported.
