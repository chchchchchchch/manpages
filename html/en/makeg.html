MAKEG(1)                                                                MAKEG(1)



NAME
       makeg - make a debuggable executable

SYNOPSIS
       makeg [ make-options ...  ] [ targets ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  makeg  script  runs  make,  passing it variable settings to create a
       debuggable target when used with a  Makefile  generated  by  imake.   For
       example, it arranges for the C compiler to be called with the -g option.

ENVIRONMENT
       MAKE    The make program to use.  Default ``make&apos;&apos;.

       GDB     Set  to  a non-null value if using the gdb debugger on Solaris 2,
               which requires additional debugging options to be passed  to  the
               compiler.

SEE ALSO
       make (1), imake (1)



X Version 11                       imake 1.0.5                          MAKEG(1)
