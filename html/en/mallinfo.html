MALLINFO(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                MALLINFO(3)



NAME
       mallinfo - obtain memory allocation information

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;

       struct mallinfo mallinfo(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The mallinfo() function returns a copy of a structure containing informa&#8208;
       tion about memory allocations performed by malloc(3)  and  related  func&#8208;
       tions.  This structure is defined as follows:

           struct mallinfo {
               int arena;     /* Non-mmapped space allocated (bytes) */
               int ordblks;   /* Number of free chunks */
               int smblks;    /* Number of free fastbin blocks */
               int hblks;     /* Number of mmapped regions */
               int hblkhd;    /* Space allocated in mmapped regions (bytes) */
               int usmblks;   /* Maximum total allocated space (bytes) */
               int fsmblks;   /* Space in freed fastbin blocks (bytes) */
               int uordblks;  /* Total allocated space (bytes) */
               int fordblks;  /* Total free space (bytes) */
               int keepcost;  /* Top-most, releasable space (bytes) */
           };

       The fields of the mallinfo structure contain the following information:


       arena     The  total  amount  of  memory  allocated  by  means other than
                 mmap(2) (i.e., memory allocated  on  the  heap).   This  figure
                 includes both in-use blocks and blocks on the free list.

       ordblks   The number of ordinary (i.e., non-fastbin) free blocks.

       smblks    The number of fastbin free blocks (see mallopt(3)).

       hblks     The  number  of blocks currently allocated using mmap(2).  (See
                 the discussion of M_MMAP_THRESHOLD in mallopt(3).)

       hblkhd    The  number  of  bytes  in  blocks  currently  allocated  using
                 mmap(2).

       usmblks   The  &quot;highwater  mark&quot; for allocated space&#8212;that is, the maximum
                 amount of space that was ever allocated.  This field  is  main&#8208;
                 tained only in nonthreading environments.

       fsmblks   The total number of bytes in fastbin free blocks.

       uordblks  The total number of bytes used by in-use allocations.

       fordblks  The total number of bytes in free blocks.

       keepcost  The  total  amount  of  releasable free space at the top of the
                 heap.  This is the maximum number of bytes that  could  ideally
                 (i.e.,  ignoring  page  alignment  restrictions,  and so on) be
                 released by malloc_trim(3).

CONFORMING TO
       This function is not specified by POSIX or the C  standards.   A  similar
       function  exists  on  many System V derivatives, and was specified in the
       SVID.

BUGS
       Information is returned for only the main memory allocation area.   Allo&#8208;
       cations  in  other  arenas  are  excluded.   See malloc_stats(3) and mal&#8208;
       loc_info(3) for alternatives that include information about other arenas.

       The fields of the mallinfo structure are typed as int.  However,  because
       some internal bookkeeping values may be of type long, the reported values
       may wrap around zero and thus be inaccurate.

EXAMPLE
       The program below employs mallinfo() to retrieve memory  allocation  sta&#8208;
       tistics  before  and  after allocating and freeing some blocks of memory.
       The statistics are displayed on standard output.

       The first two command-line arguments  specify  the  number  and  size  of
       blocks to be allocated with malloc(3).

       The  remaining  three  arguments  specify  which  of the allocated blocks
       should be freed with free(3).  These three arguments  are  optional,  and
       specify  (in  order):  the  step  size  to be used in the loop that frees
       blocks (the default is 1, meaning free all  blocks  in  the  range);  the
       ordinal  position  of the first block to be freed (default 0, meaning the
       first allocated block); and a number one greater than the  ordinal  posi&#8208;
       tion of the last block to be freed (default is one greater than the maxi&#8208;
       mum block number).  If  these  three  arguments  are  omitted,  then  the
       defaults cause all allocated blocks to be freed.

       In  the  following  example  run  of the program, 1000 allocations of 100
       bytes are performed, and then every second allocated block is freed:

           $ ./a.out 1000 100 2
