MALLOC_USABLE_SIZE(3)       Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual      MALLOC_USABLE_SIZE(3)



NAME
       malloc_usable_size - obtain size of block of memory allocated from heap

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;

       size_t malloc_usable_size (void *ptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  malloc_usable_size()  function returns the number of usable bytes in
       the block pointed to by ptr, a pointer to a block of memory allocated  by
       malloc(3) or a related function.

RETURN VALUE
       malloc_usable_size()  returns  the number of usable bytes in the block of
       allocated memory pointed to by ptr.  If ptr is NULL, 0 is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       The value returned  by  malloc_usable_size()  may  be  greater  than  the
       requested  size  of  the allocation because of alignment and minimum size
       constraints.  Although the excess bytes can be overwritten by the  appli&#8208;
       cation  without  ill  effects, this is not good programming practice: the
       number of excess bytes in an allocation depends on the underlying  imple&#8208;
       mentation.

       The main use of this function is for debugging and introspection.
