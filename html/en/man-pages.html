MAN-PAGES(7)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               MAN-PAGES(7)



NAME
       man-pages - conventions for writing Linux man pages

SYNOPSIS
       man [section] title

DESCRIPTION
       This  page describes the conventions that should be employed when writing
       man pages for the Linux man-pages project, which comprises Sections 2, 3,
       4, 5, and 7 of the Linux manual pages.  The conventions described on this
       page may also be useful for authors writing man pages for other projects.

   Sections of the Manual Pages
       The manual Sections are traditionally defined as follows:

       1 Commands (Programs)
                 Those commands that can be executed by the user from  within  a
                 shell.

       2 System calls
                 Those functions which must be performed by the kernel.

       3 Library calls
                 Most of the libc functions.

       4 Special files (devices)
                 Files found in /dev.

       5 File formats and conventions
                 The format for /etc/passwd and other human-readable files.

       6 Games

       7 Conventions and miscellaneous
                 Overviews of various topics, conventions and protocols, charac&#8208;
                 ter set standards, and miscellaneous other things.

       8 System management commands
                 Commands like mount(8), many of which only root can execute.

   Macro package
       New manual pages should be marked up  using  the  groff  an.tmac  package
       described  in  man(7).   This  choice is mainly for consistency: the vast
       majority of existing Linux manual pages are marked up using these macros.

   Conventions for source file layout
       Please limit source code line length to no more than about 75  characters
       wherever  possible.   This helps avoid line-wrapping in some mail clients
       when patches are submitted inline.

       New sentences should be started on new lines.  This makes  it  easier  to
       see the effect of patches, which often operate at the level of individual
       sentences.

   Title line
       The first command in a man page should be a TH command:

              .TH title section date source manual

       where:

              title     The title of the man page, written in  all  caps  (e.g.,
                        MAN-PAGES).

              section   The  section  number  in  which  the  man page should be
                        placed (e.g., 7).

              date      The date of the last revision&#8212;remember  to  change  this
                        every  time a change is made to the man page, since this
                        is the most general way of doing version control.  Dates
                        should be written in the form YYYY-MM-DD.

              source    The source of the command, function, or system call.

                        For those few man-pages pages in Sections 1 and 8, prob&#8208;
                        ably you just want to write GNU.

                        For system calls, just write Linux.  (An  earlier  prac&#8208;
                        tice  was to write the version number of the kernel from
                        which the manual page was being  written/checked.   How&#8208;
                        ever, this was never done consistently, and so was prob&#8208;
                        ably worse than including  no  version  number.   Hence&#8208;
                        forth, avoid including a version number.)

                        For  library  calls that are part of glibc or one of the
                        other common GNU libraries, just use GNU C Library, GNU,
                        or an empty string.

                        For Section 4 pages, use Linux.

                        In cases of doubt, just write Linux, or GNU.

              manual    The title of the manual (e.g., for Section 2 and 3 pages
                        in the man-pages package, use  Linux  Programmer&apos;s  Man&#8208;
                        ual).

   Sections within a manual page
       The  list  below  shows  conventional or suggested sections.  Most manual
       pages should include at least the highlighted sections.   Arrange  a  new
       manual page so that sections are placed in the order shown in the list.

       Where a traditional heading would apply, please use it; this kind of con&#8208;
       sistency can make the information easier to understand.  If you must, you
       can  create  your  own  headings if they make things easier to understand
       (this can be especially useful for pages in Sections 4 and 5).   However,
       before  doing  this, consider whether you could use the traditional head&#8208;
       ings, with some subsections (.SS) within those sections.

       The following list elaborates on the contents of each of the  above  sec&#8208;
       tions.

       NAME          The  name  of  this  manual page.  See man(7) for important
                     details of the line(s) that should follow the .SH NAME com&#8208;
                     mand.   All  words in this line (including the word immedi&#8208;
                     ately following the &quot;\-&quot;) should be  in  lowercase,  except
                     where  English  or technical terminological convention dic&#8208;
                     tates otherwise.

       SYNOPSIS      briefly describes the command or function&apos;s interface.  For
                     commands,  this  shows  the  syntax  of the command and its
                     arguments (including options); boldface is used  for  as-is
                     text  and  italics  are  used to indicate replaceable argu&#8208;
                     ments.  Brackets ([]) surround optional arguments, vertical
                     bars  (|)  separate  choices,  and  ellipses  (...)  can be
                     repeated.  For functions, it shows any required data decla&#8208;
                     rations  or  #include  directives, followed by the function
                     declaration.

                     Where a feature test macro must  be  defined  in  order  to
                     obtain the declaration of a function (or a variable) from a
                     header file, then the SYNOPSIS  should  indicate  this,  as
                     described in feature_test_macros(7).

       CONFIGURATION Configuration  details for a device.  This section normally
                     only appears in Section 4 pages.

       DESCRIPTION   gives an explanation of what the program, function, or for&#8208;
                     mat does.  Discuss how it interacts with files and standard
                     input, and what it produces on standard output or  standard
                     error.   Omit  internals  and implementation details unless
                     they&apos;re critical for understanding the interface.  Describe
                     the  usual case; for information on command-line options of
                     a program use the OPTIONS section.

       OPTIONS       describes the command-line options accepted  by  a  program
                     and how they change its behavior.  This section should only
                     appear for Section 1 and 8 manual pages.

       EXIT STATUS   lists the possible exit status values of a program and  the
                     conditions  that  cause  these values to be returned.  This
                     section should only appear  for  Section  1  and  8  manual
                     pages.

       RETURN VALUE  For Section 2 and 3 pages, this section gives a list of the
                     values the library routine will return to  the  caller  and
                     the conditions that cause these values to be returned.

       ERRORS        For  Section  2  and  3 manual pages, this is a list of the
                     values that may be placed in  errno  in  the  event  of  an
                     error,  along  with  information  about  the  cause  of the
                     errors.  The error list should be in alphabetical order.

       ENVIRONMENT   lists all environment variables that affect the program  or
                     function and how they affect it.

       FILES         lists  the files the program or function uses, such as con&#8208;
                     figuration files, startup  files,  and  files  the  program
                     directly  operates  on.   Give  the  full pathname of these
                     files, and use  the  installation  process  to  modify  the
                     directory  part  to  match user preferences.  For many pro&#8208;
                     grams, the default installation location is in  /usr/local,
                     so your base manual page should use /usr/local as the base.

       VERSIONS      A brief summary of the Linux kernel or glibc versions where
                     a system call or library function appeared, or changed sig&#8208;
                     nificantly  in its operation.  As a general rule, every new
                     interface should include a VERSIONS section in  its  manual
                     page.   Unfortunately,  many  existing  manual  pages don&apos;t
                     include this information (since there was no policy  to  do
                     so  when  they  were  written).  Patches to remedy this are
                     welcome, but, from the perspective of  programmers  writing
                     new  code,  this  information  probably only matters in the
                     case of kernel interfaces that have been added in Linux 2.4
                     or  later  (i.e.,  changes  since  kernel 2.2), and library
                     functions that have been added to glibc since  version  2.1
                     (i.e., changes since glibc 2.0).

                     The syscalls(2) manual page also provides information about
                     kernel  versions  in  which  various  system  calls   first
                     appeared.

       CONFORMING TO describes  any  standards or conventions that relate to the
                     function or command described by the manual  page.   For  a
                     page  in  Section  2  or  3,  this  section should note the
                     POSIX.1 version(s) that the  call  conforms  to,  and  also
                     whether  the  call  is  specified in C99.  (Don&apos;t worry too
                     much about other standards like SUS, SUSv2, and XPG, or the
                     SVr4  and  4.xBSD implementation standards, unless the call
                     was specified in those standards, but isn&apos;t in the  current
                     version of POSIX.1.)  (See standards(7).)

                     If  the  call is not governed by any standards but commonly
                     exists on other systems, note them.  If the call is  Linux-
                     specific, note this.

                     If this section consists of just a list of standards (which
                     it commonly does), terminate the list with a period (&apos;.&apos;).

       NOTES         provides miscellaneous notes.  For  Section  2  and  3  man
                     pages  you  may  find it useful to include subsections (SS)
                     named Linux Notes and Glibc Notes.

       BUGS          lists limitations, known  defects  or  inconveniences,  and
                     other questionable activities.

       EXAMPLE       provides one or more examples describing how this function,
                     file or command is used.  For details  on  writing  example
                     programs, see Example Programs below.

       AUTHORS       lists  authors  of the documentation or program.  Use of an
                     AUTHORS section is strongly discouraged.  Generally, it  is
                     better  not to clutter every page with a list of (over time
                     potentially numerous) authors; if  you  write  or  signifi&#8208;
                     cantly amend a page, add a copyright notice as a comment in
                     the source file.  If you are the author of a device  driver
                     and  want  to  include an address for reporting bugs, place
                     this under the BUGS section.

       SEE ALSO      provides a  comma-separated  list  of  related  man  pages,
                     ordered  by section number and then alphabetically by name,
                     possibly followed by other related pages or documents.   Do
                     not terminate this with a period.

                     Where  the  SEE  ALSO  list  contains many long manual page
                     names, to improve the visual result of the output,  it  may
                     be useful to employ the .ad l (don&apos;t right justify) and .nh
                     (don&apos;t hyphenate) directives.   Hyphenation  of  individual
                     page  names  can  be  prevented by preceding words with the
                     string &quot;\%&quot;.

   Font conventions
       For functions, the arguments are always specified using italics, even  in
       the  SYNOPSIS  section,  where  the  rest of the function is specified in
       bold:

           int myfunction(int argc, char **argv);
&#12;       Variable names should, like argument names, be specified in italics.

       Filenames (whether pathnames, or references to files in the  /usr/include
       directory)  are always in italics (e.g., &lt;stdio.h&gt;), except in the SYNOP&#8208;
       SIS section, where included files are in bold (e.g., #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;).
       When referring to a standard include file under /usr/include, specify the
       header file surrounded by angle brackets,  in  the  usual  C  way  (e.g.,
       &lt;stdio.h&gt;).

       Special  macros, which are usually in upper case, are in bold (e.g., MAX&#8208;
       INT).  Exception: don&apos;t boldface NULL.

       When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold (this  list
       usually uses the .TP macro).

       Complete  commands  should, if long, be written as in an indented line on
       their own, for example

           man 7 man-pages

       If the command is short, then it can be included inline in the  text,  in
       italic  format,  for  example,  man 7 man-pages.  In this case, it may be
       worth using nonbreaking spaces (&quot;\ &quot;) at suitable places in the  command.
       Command options should be written in italics, e.g., -l.

       Expressions, if not written on a separate indented line, should be speci&#8208;
       fied in italics.  Again, the use of nonbreaking spaces may be appropriate
       if the expression is inlined with normal text.

       Any reference to the subject of the current manual page should be written
       with the name in bold.  If the subject is a function  (i.e.,  this  is  a
       Section  2  or  3  page),  then  the name should be followed by a pair of
       parentheses in Roman (normal) font.  For example,  in  the  fcntl(2)  man
       page, references to the subject of the page would be written as: fcntl().
       The preferred way to write this in the source file is:

           .BR fcntl ()

       (Using this format, rather than the use of &quot;\fB...\fP()&quot; makes it  easier
       to write tools that parse man page source files.)

       Any  reference  to  another  man  page should be written with the name in
       bold, always followed by the section number, formatted in Roman  (normal)
       font,  without any separating spaces (e.g., intro(2)).  The preferred way
       to write this in the source file is:

           .BR intro (2)

       (Including the  section  number  in  cross  references  lets  tools  like
       man2html(1) create properly hyperlinked pages.)

   Spelling
       Starting  with  release 2.59, man-pages follows American spelling conven&#8208;
       tions; please write all new pages and patches according to these  conven&#8208;
       tions.

   Example Programs and Shell Sessions
       Manual pages can include example programs demonstrating how to use a sys&#8208;
       tem call or library function.  However, note the following:

       *  Example programs should be written in C.

       *  An example program is only necessary and  useful  if  it  demonstrates
          something  beyond what can easily be provided in a textual description
          of the interface.  An example program that  does  nothing  other  than
          call an interface usually serves little purpose.
&#12;       *  Example  programs  should  be  fairly  short (preferably less than 100
          lines; ideally less than 50 lines).

       *  Example programs should do  error  checking  after  system  calls  and
          library function calls.

       *  Example programs should be complete, and compile without warnings when
          compiled with cc -Wall.

       *  Where possible and appropriate, example programs should allow  experi&#8208;
          mentation,  by  varying  their  behavior based on inputs (ideally from
          command-line arguments, or alternatively, via input read by  the  pro&#8208;
          gram).

       *  Example programs should be laid out according to Kernighan and Ritchie
          style, with 4-space indents.  (Avoid the  use  of  TAB  characters  in
          source code!)

       For  some examples of what example programs should look like, see wait(2)
       and pipe(2).

       If you include a shell session demonstrating the  use  of  a  program  or
       other  system  feature,  boldface  the user input text, to distinguish it
       from output produced by the system.

   Indentation of structure definitions, shell session logs, etc.
       When structure definitions, shell session logs, and so on are included in
       running  text, indent them by 4 spaces (i.e., a block enclosed by .in +4n
       and .in).

EXAMPLE
       For canonical examples of how man pages in the man-pages  package  should
       look, see pipe(2) and fcntl(2).
