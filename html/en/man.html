MAN(7)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     MAN(7)



NAME
       man - macros to format man pages

SYNOPSIS
       groff -Tascii -man file ...

       groff -Tps -man file ...

       man [section] title

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page explains the groff an.tmac macro package (often called
       the man macro package).  This macro package should be used by  developers
       when  writing  or  porting  man pages for Linux.  It is fairly compatible
       with other versions of this macro package, so porting  man  pages  should
       not  be  a major problem (exceptions include the NET-2 BSD release, which
       uses a totally different macro package called mdoc; see mdoc(7)).

       Note that NET-2 BSD mdoc man pages can be used with groff simply by spec&#8208;
       ifying  the  -mdoc  option instead of the -man option.  Using the -mandoc
       option is, however, recommended, since  this  will  automatically  detect
       which macro package is in use.

       For  conventions  that  should be employed when writing man pages for the
       Linux man-pages package, see man-pages(7).

   Title line
       The first command in a man page (after comment lines, that is, lines that
       start with .\&quot;) should be

              .TH title section date source manual

       For  details  of the arguments that should be supplied to the TH command,
       see man-pages(7).

       Note that BSD mdoc-formatted pages begin with the Dd command, not the  TH
       command.

   Sections
       Sections are started with .SH followed by the heading name.

       The only mandatory heading is NAME, which should be the first section and
       be followed on the next line by a one-line description of the program:

              .SH NAME
              item \- description

       It is extremely important that this format is followed, and that there is
       a  backslash  before  the  single dash which follows the item name.  This
       syntax is used by the mandb(8) program to  create  a  database  of  short
       descriptions  for the whatis(1) and apropos(1) commands.  (See lexgrog(1)
       for further details on the syntax of the NAME section.)

       For a list of other sections that might appear in a manual page, see man-
       pages(7).

   Fonts
       The commands to select the type face are:

       .B  Bold

       .BI Bold  alternating with italics (especially useful for function speci&#8208;
           fications)

       .BR Bold alternating with Roman (especially useful for referring to other
           manual pages)

       .I  Italics

       .IB Italics alternating with bold

       .IR Italics alternating with Roman

       .RB Roman alternating with bold

       .RI Roman alternating with italics

       .SB Small alternating with bold

       .SM Small (useful for acronyms)

       Traditionally,  each  command  can  have up to six arguments, but the GNU
       implementation removes this limitation (you might  still  want  to  limit
       yourself to 6 arguments for portability&apos;s sake).  Arguments are delimited
       by spaces.  Double quotes can be used to specify an argument  which  con&#8208;
       tains  spaces.   All  of the arguments will be printed next to each other
       without intervening spaces, so that the .BR command can be used to  spec&#8208;
       ify  a  word  in  bold followed by a mark of punctuation in Roman.  If no
       arguments are given, the command is applied  to  the  following  line  of
       text.

   Other Macros and Strings
       Below  are  other  relevant  macros and predefined strings.  Unless noted
       otherwise, all macros cause a break (end the current line of text).  Many
       of  these  macros  set  or  use the &quot;prevailing indent.&quot;  The &quot;prevailing
       indent&quot; value is set by any macro with the parameter i below; macros  may
       omit  i  in  which case the current prevailing indent will be used.  As a
       result, successive indented paragraphs can use the  same  indent  without
       respecifying  the  indent value.  A normal (nonindented) paragraph resets
       the prevailing indent value  to  its  default  value  (0.5  inches).   By
       default a given indent is measured in ens; try to use ens or ems as units
       for indents, since these will automatically adjust to font size  changes.
       The other key macro definitions are:

   Normal Paragraphs
       .LP      Same as .PP (begin a new paragraph).

       .P       Same as .PP (begin a new paragraph).

       .PP      Begin a new paragraph and reset prevailing indent.

   Relative Margin Indent
       .RS i    Start  relative  margin  indent:  moves the left margin i to the
                right (if i is omitted, the prevailing indent value is used).  A
                new  prevailing  indent  is set to 0.5 inches.  As a result, all
                following paragraph(s) will be indented until the  corresponding
                .RE.

       .RE      End  relative  margin  indent and restores the previous value of
                the prevailing indent.

   Indented Paragraph Macros
       .HP i    Begin paragraph with a hanging indent (the  first  line  of  the
                paragraph  is  at  the left margin of normal paragraphs, and the
                rest of the paragraph&apos;s lines are indented).

       .IP x i  Indented paragraph with optional hanging tag.  If the tag  x  is
                omitted,  the  entire  following paragraph is indented by i.  If
                the tag x is provided, it is hung at the left margin before  the
                following  indented  paragraph (this is just like .TP except the
                tag is included with the command instead of being on the follow&#8208;
                ing  line).  If the tag is too long, the text after the tag will
                be moved down to the next line (text will not be  lost  or  gar&#8208;
                bled).  For bulleted lists, use this macro with \(bu (bullet) or
                \(em (em dash) as the tag, and for numbered lists, use the  num&#8208;
                ber  or  letter followed by a period as the tag; this simplifies
                translation to other formats.

       .TP i    Begin paragraph with hanging tag.  The tag is given on the  next
                line, but its results are like those of the .IP command.

   Hypertext Link Macros
       (Feature  supported  with  groff  only.)   In order to use hypertext link
       macros, it is necessary to load the  www.tmac  macro  package.   Use  the
       request .mso www.tmac to do this.

       .URL url link trailer
                Inserts  a hypertext link to the URI (URL) url, with link as the
                text of the link.   The  trailer  will  be  printed  immediately
                afterward.   When generating HTML this should translate into the
                HTML command &lt;A HREF=&quot;url&quot;&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;trailer.

                This and other related macros are new, and many tools  won&apos;t  do
                anything  with them, but since many tools (including troff) will
                simply ignore undefined macros (or at worst insert  their  text)
                these are safe to insert.

                It  can  be  useful to define your own URL macro in manual pages
                for the benefit of those viewing it with  a  roff  viewer  other
                than  groff.  That way, the URL, link text, and trailer text (if
                any) are still visible.

                Here&apos;s an example:
                      .de URL
                      \\$2 \(laURL: \\$1 \(ra\\$3
                      ..
                      .if \n[.g] .mso www.tmac
                      .TH ...
                      (later in the page)
                      This software comes from the
                      .URL &quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot; &quot;GNU Project&quot; &quot; of the&quot;
                      .URL &quot;http://www.fsf.org/&quot; &quot;Free Software Foundation&quot; .

                In the above, if groff is being used, the www.tmac  macro  pack&#8208;
                age&apos;s  definition  of  the  URL macro will supersede the locally
                defined one.

       A number of other link macros are available.  See groff_www(7)  for  more
       details.

   Miscellaneous Macros
       .DT      Reset  tabs  to  default tab values (every 0.5 inches); does not
                cause a break.

       .PD d    Set inter-paragraph vertical distance to d (if omitted, d=0.4v);
                does not cause a break.

       .SS t    Subheading  t (like .SH, but used for a subsection inside a sec&#8208;
                tion).

   Predefined Strings
       The man package has the following predefined strings:

       \*R    Registration Symbol: &#174;

       \*S    Change to default font size
&#12;       \*(Tm  Trademark Symbol: &#8482;

       \*(lq  Left angled double quote: &#8220;

       \*(rq  Right angled double quote: &#8221;

   Safe Subset
       Although technically man is a troff macro package,  in  reality  a  large
       number  of other tools process man page files that don&apos;t implement all of
       troff&apos;s abilities.  Thus, it&apos;s best to avoid some of troff&apos;s more  exotic
       abilities  where  possible to permit these other tools to work correctly.
       Avoid using the various troff preprocessors (if you must,  go  ahead  and
       use  tbl(1), but try to use the IP and TP commands instead for two-column
       tables).  Avoid using computations; most other tools can&apos;t process  them.
       Use  simple  commands  that  are easy to translate to other formats.  The
       following troff macros are believed to be safe (though in many cases they
       will  be  ignored by translators): \&quot;, ., ad, bp, br, ce, de, ds, el, ie,
       if, fi, ft, hy, ig, in, na, ne, nf, nh, ps, so, sp, ti, tr.

       You may also use many troff escape sequences (those  sequences  beginning
       with  \).   When  you  need  to include the backslash character as normal
       text, use \e.  Other sequences you may use, where x or xx are any charac&#8208;
       ters  and  N  is  any digit, include: \&apos;, \`, \-, \., \&quot;, \%, \*x, \*(xx,
       \(xx, \$N, \nx, \n(xx, \fx, and \f(xx.  Avoid using the escape  sequences
       for drawing graphics.

       Do not use the optional parameter for bp (break page).  Use only positive
       values for sp (vertical space).  Don&apos;t define a macro (de) with the  same
       name  as a macro in this or the mdoc macro package with a different mean&#8208;
       ing; it&apos;s likely that such redefinitions will be ignored.  Every positive
       indent  (in)  should  be paired with a matching negative indent (although
       you should be using the RS and RE macros instead).   The  condition  test
       (if,ie)  should only have &apos;t&apos; or &apos;n&apos; as the condition.  Only translations
       (tr) that can be ignored should be used.  Font changes  (ft  and  the  \f
       escape  sequence)  should only have the values 1, 2, 3, 4, R, I, B, P, or
       CW (the ft command may also have no parameters).

       If you use capabilities beyond these, check the results carefully on sev&#8208;
       eral  tools.   Once  you&apos;ve  confirmed  that the additional capability is
       safe, let the maintainer of this document know about the safe command  or
       sequence that should be added to this list.

FILES
       /usr/share/groff/[*/]tmac/an.tmac
       /usr/man/whatis

NOTES
       By  all  means include full URLs (or URIs) in the text itself; some tools
       such as man2html(1) can automatically turn  them  into  hypertext  links.
       You  can also use the new URL macro to identify links to related informa&#8208;
       tion.    If   you   include   URLs,   use    the    full    URL    (e.g.,
       &#10216;http://www.kernelnotes.org&#10217;) to ensure that tools can automatically find
       the URLs.

       Tools processing these files should open the file and examine  the  first
       nonwhitespace  character.  A period (.) or single quote (&apos;) at the begin&#8208;
       ning of a line indicates a troff-based file (such as  man  or  mdoc).   A
       left  angle bracket (&lt;) indicates an SGML/XML-based file (such as HTML or
       Docbook).  Anything else suggests simple ASCII  text  (e.g.,  a  &quot;catman&quot;
       result).

       Many  man  pages begin with &#180;\&quot; followed by a space and a list of charac&#8208;
       ters, indicating how the page is to be preprocessed.   For  portability&apos;s
       sake  to non-troff translators we recommend that you avoid using anything
       other than tbl(1), and Linux can detect that automatically.  However, you
       might want to include this information so your man page can be handled by
       other (less capable) systems.  Here are the definitions of the preproces&#8208;
       sors invoked by these characters:

       e  eqn(1)

       g  grap(1)

       p  pic(1)

       r  refer(1)

       t  tbl(1)

       v  vgrind(1)

BUGS
       Most  of  the  macros  describe  formatting (e.g., font type and spacing)
       instead of marking semantic content (e.g., this text is  a  reference  to
       another  page),  compared to formats like mdoc and DocBook (even HTML has
       more semantic markings).  This situation makes it harder to vary the  man
       format for different media, to make the formatting consistent for a given
       media, and to automatically insert cross-references.  By sticking to  the
       safe  subset described above, it should be easier to automate transition&#8208;
       ing to a different reference page format in the future.

       The Sun macro TX is not implemented.
