man2html(1)                                                          man2html(1)



NAME
       man2html - format a manual page in html

SYNOPSIS
       man2html [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       man2html  converts  a  manual page as found in file (or stdin, in case no
       file argument, or the argument &quot;-&quot;, is given) from man-style  nroff  into
       html,  and prints the result on stdout.  It does support tbl but does not
       know about eqn.  The exit status is 0. If something goes wrong, an  error
       page is printed on stdout.

       This  can  be used as a stand-alone utility, but is mainly intended as an
       auxiliary, to enable users to browse their man pages using a html browser
       like lynx(1), xmosaic(1) or netscape(1).

       The  main part of man2html is the troff-to-html engine written by Richard
       Verhoeven (rcb5@win.tue.nl).  It adds hyperlinks for the  following  con&#8208;
       structs:

       l       l.       foo(3x)   &quot;http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3x+foo&quot;
       method://string     &quot;method://string&quot;
       www.host.name  &quot;http://www.host.name&quot;
       ftp.host.name  &quot;ftp://ftp.host.name&quot;         name@host &quot;mailto:name@host&quot;
       &lt;string.h&gt;     &quot;file:/usr/include/string.h&quot;

       (The  first  of these can be tuned by options - see below.)  No lookup is
       done - the links generated need not exist.  Also an index  with  internal
       hyperlinks  to the various sections is generated, so that it is easier to
       find one&apos;s way in large man pages like bash(1).


OPTIONS
       When reading from stdin, it is not always clear how to do .so  expansion.
       The -D option allows a script to define the working directory.

       -D pathname
              Strip  the  last  two parts from the pathname, and do a chdir(dir)
              before starting the conversion.

       The -E option allows the easy generation of error  messages  from  a  cgi
       script.

       -E string
              Output an error page containing the given error message.

       The general form of a hyperlink generated for a man page reference is

              &lt;method:cgipath&gt;&lt;man2htmlpath&gt;&lt;separator&gt;&lt;manpage&gt;

       with  a default as shown above. The parts of this hyperlink are set using
       the various options.

       -h     Set method:cgipath to http://localhost.

       -H host[.domain][:port]
              Set method:cgipath to http://host.domain:port.

       -l     Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:/usr/lib.

       -L dir Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:dir.
&#12;       -M man2htmlpath
              Set the man2htmlpath to use. The default is /cgi-bin/man/man2html.

       -p     Set separator to &apos;/&apos;.

       -q     Set separator to &apos;?&apos;. This is the default.

       -r     Use relative html paths, instead of cgi-bin paths.

       On a machine without running httpd, one can use lynx to  browse  the  man
       pages, using the lynxcgi method.  When some http daemon is running, lynx,
       or any other browser, can be used to browse the man pages, using the http
       method.   The  option  -l  (for  `lynxcgi&apos;) selects the former behaviour.
       With it, the default cgipath is /usr/lib.

       In general, a cgi script can be called by

              &lt;path_to_script&gt;/&lt;more_path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;

       and the environment variables PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING will be  set  to
       &lt;more_path&gt; and &lt;query&gt;, respectively.  Since lynxcgi does not handle the
       PATH_INFO part, we  generate  hyperlinks  with  `?&apos;  as  a  separator  by
       default.   The  option  -p (for `path&apos;) selects &apos;/&apos; as a separator, while
       the option -q (for `query&apos;) selects &apos;?&apos; as a separator.

       The option -H host will specify the host to use (instead  of  localhost).
       A cgi script could use

              man2html -H $SERVER_NAME

       if the variable SERVER_NAME is set.  This would allow your machine to act
       as a server and export man pages.


BUGS
       There are many heuristics.  The output will not always be  perfect.   The
       lynxcgi  method will not work if lynx was compiled without selecting sup&#8208;
       port for it.  There may be problems with security.
