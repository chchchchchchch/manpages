MANDB(8)                       Manual pager utils                       MANDB(8)



NAME
       mandb - create or update the manual page index caches

SYNOPSIS
       mandb [-dqsucpt|-h|-V] [-C file] [manpath]
       mandb [-dqsut] [-C file] -f filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       mandb is used to initialise or manually update index database caches that
       are usually maintained by man.  The caches contain  information  relevant
       to the current state of the manual page system and the information stored
       within them is used by the man-db utilities to enhance  their  speed  and
       functionality.

       When  creating  or  updating  an  index,  mandb will warn of bad ROFF .so
       requests, bogus manual page filenames and manual  pages  from  which  the
       whatis cannot be parsed.

       Supplying  mandb  with an optional colon-delimited path will override the
       internal system manual page hierarchy search path, determined from infor&#8208;
       mation found within the man-db configuration file.

DATABASE CACHES
       mandb  can be compiled with support for any one of the following database
       types.


       tab (@); l l l l.  Name@Type@Async@Filename _ Berkeley db@T{ Binary  tree
       T}@Yes@index.bt  GNU gdbm v &gt;= 1.6@T{ Hashed T}@Yes@index.db GNU gdbm v &lt;
       1.6@T{ Hashed T}@No@index.db UNIX ndbm@T{ Hashed T}@No@index.(dir|pag)

       Those database types that support asynchronous updates  provide  enhanced
       speed at the cost of possible corruption in the event of unusual termina&#8208;
       tion.  In an unusual case where this has occurred, it may be necessary to
       rerun mandb with the -c option to re-create the databases from scratch.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -q, --quiet
              Produce no warnings.

       -s, --no-straycats
              Do  not  spend time looking for or adding information to the data&#8208;
              bases regarding stray cats.

       -p, --no-purge
              Do not spend time checking for deleted manual  pages  and  purging
              them from the databases.

       -c, --create
              By  default, mandb will try to update any previously created data&#8208;
              bases.  If a database does not exist, it  will  create  it.   This
              option  forces  mandb  to  delete previous databases and re-create
              them from scratch, and implies --no-purge.  This may be  necessary
              if  a database becomes corrupt or if a new database storage scheme
              is introduced in the future.

       -u, --user-db
              Create user databases only, even with write permissions  necessary
              to create system databases.

       -t, --test
              Perform correctness checks on manual pages in the hierarchy search
              path.  With this option, mandb will not alter existing databases.

       -f, --filename
              Update only the entries for the given filename.   This  option  is
              not for general use; it is used internally by man when it has been
              compiled with the MAN_DB_UPDATES option and finds that a  page  is
              out of date.  It implies -p and disables -c and -s.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use  this  user  configuration  file  rather  than  the default of
              ~/.manpath.

       -h, --help
              Show the usage message, then exit.

       -V, --version
              Show the version, then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax, or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process failed.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following warning messages can be emitted during database building.

       &lt;filename&gt;: whatis parse for page(sec) failed
              An attempt to extract whatis line(s)  from  the  given  &lt;filename&gt;
              failed.   This is usually due to a poorly written manual page, but
              if many such messages are emitted it is  likely  that  the  system
              contains non-standard manual pages which are incompatible with the
              man-db whatis parser.  See the  WHATIS  PARSING  section  in  lex&#8208;
              grog(1) for more information.

       &lt;filename&gt;: is a dangling symlink
              &lt;filename&gt;  does  not  exist but is referenced by a symbolic link.
              Further diagnostics are usually emitted to identify the &lt;filename&gt;
              of the offending link.

       &lt;filename&gt;: bad symlink or ROFF `.so&apos; request
              &lt;filename&gt;  is  either  a  symbolic  link  to,  or contains a ROFF
              include request to, a non existent file.

       &lt;filename&gt;: ignoring bogus filename
              The &lt;filename&gt; may or may not be a valid manual page but its  name
              is  invalid.   This is usually due to a manual page with sectional
              extension &lt;x&gt; being put in manual page section &lt;y&gt;.

       &lt;filename_mask&gt;: competing extensions
              The wildcard &lt;filename_mask&gt;  is  not  unique.   This  is  usually
              caused by the existence of both a compressed and uncompressed ver&#8208;
              sion of the same  manual  page.   All  but  the  most  recent  are
              ignored.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /var/cache/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An FHS compliant global index database cache.
&#12;       Older locations for the database cache included:

       /usr/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              A traditional global index database cache.

       /var/catman/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An alternate or FSSTND compliant global index database cache.
