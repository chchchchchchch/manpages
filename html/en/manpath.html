MANPATH(5)                     /etc/manpath.config                    MANPATH(5)



NAME
       manpath - format of the /etc/manpath.config file

DESCRIPTION
       The  manpath  configuration  file is used by the manual page utilities to
       assess users&apos; manpaths at run time, to indicate which manual page hierar&#8208;
       chies  (manpaths)  are  to be treated as system hierarchies and to assign
       them directories to be used for storing cat files.

       If the environment variable $MANPATH is already set, the information con&#8208;
       tained within /etc/manpath.config will not override it.

FORMAT
       The following field types are currently recognised:

       # comment
              Blank  lines  or  those beginning with a # will be treated as com&#8208;
              ments and ignored.

       MANDATORY_MANPATH manpath_element
              Lines of this form indicate manpaths that every automatically gen&#8208;
              erated  $MANPATH  should  contain.   This  will  typically include
              /usr/man.

       MANPATH_MAP path_element manpath_element
              Lines of this form set up $PATH to $MANPATH  mappings.   For  each
              path_element  found  in  the user&apos;s $PATH, manpath_element will be
              added to the $MANPATH.

       MANDB_MAP manpath_element [ catpath_element ]
              Lines of this form indicate which manpaths are to  be  treated  as
              system  manpaths,  and  optionally where their cat files should be
              stored.  This field type is particularly important  if  man  is  a
              setuid   program,  as  (when  in  the  system  configuration  file
              /etc/manpath.config rather than the  per-user  configuration  file
              .manpath)  it indicates which manual page hierarchies to access as
              the setuid user and which as the invoking user.

              The system manual page hierarchies are usually those stored  under
              /usr such as /usr/man, /usr/local/man and /usr/X11R6/man.

              If  cat  pages  from  a  particular  manpath_element are not to be
              stored or are to be  stored  in  the  traditional  location,  cat&#8208;
              path_element may be omitted.

              Traditional  cat  placement  would  be  impossible  for  read only
              mounted manual page hierarchies and because of this it is possible
              to  specify  any  valid directory hierarchy for their storage.  To
              observe the Linux FSSTND the keyword `FSSTND can be used in  place
              of an actual directory.

              Unfortunately,  it  is  necessary  to  specify all system man tree
              paths,  including  alternate  operating  system  paths   such   as
              /usr/man/sun    and    any    NLS    locale    paths    such    as
              /usr/man/de_DE.88591.

              As the information is parsed line by line in the order written, it
              is  necessary  for  any manpath that is a sub-hierarchy of another
              hierarchy to be listed first, otherwise an incorrect match will be
              made.   An  example  is that /usr/man/de_DE.88591 must come before
              /usr/man.
&#12;       DEFINE key value
              Lines of this form define miscellaneous  configuration  variables;
              see the default configuration file for those variables used by the
              manual pager utilities.  They include  default  paths  to  various
              programs  (such as grep and tbl), and default sets of arguments to
              those programs.

       SECTION section ...
              Lines of this form define  the  order  in  which  manual  sections
              should  be  searched.   If  there are no SECTION directives in the
              configuration file, the default is:

                     SECTION 1 n l 8 3 0 2 5 4 9 6 7

              If multiple SECTION directives are given, their section lists will
              be concatenated.

              If  a  particular extension is not in this list (say, 1mh) it will
              be displayed with the rest of the  section  it  belongs  to.   The
              effect of this is that you only need to explicitly list extensions
              if you want to force a particular order.  Sections with extensions
              should  usually  be  adjacent to their main section (e.g. &quot;1 1mh 8
              ...&quot;).

              SECTIONS is accepted as an alternative name for this directive.

       MINCATWIDTH width
              If the terminal width is less than width, cat pages  will  not  be
              created (if missing) or displayed.  The default is 80.

       MAXCATWIDTH width
              If the terminal width is greater than width, cat pages will not be
              created (if missing) or displayed.  The default is 80.

       CATWIDTH width
              If width is non-zero, cat pages will always  be  formatted  for  a
              terminal of the given width, regardless of the width of the termi&#8208;
              nal actually being used.  This  should  generally  be  within  the
              range set by MINCATWIDTH and MAXCATWIDTH.

       NOCACHE
              This flag prevents man(1) from creating cat pages automatically.

BUGS
       Unless  the  rules  above are followed and observed precisely, the manual
       pager utilities will not function as desired.  The rules are overly  com&#8208;
       plicated.
