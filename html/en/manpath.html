MANPATH(1)                     Manual pager utils                     MANPATH(1)



NAME
       manpath - determine search path for manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       manpath [-qgdchV] [-m system[,...]] [-C file]

DESCRIPTION
       If  $MANPATH is set, manpath will simply display its contents and issue a
       warning.  If not, manpath will determine a suitable manual page hierarchy
       search path and display the results.

       The  colon-delimited path is determined using information gained from the
       man-db configuration file - (/etc/manpath.config) and the user&apos;s environ&#8208;
       ment.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue warnings.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -c, --catpath
              Produce  a  catpath  as opposed to a manpath.  Once the manpath is
              determined, each path element is converted to  its  relative  cat&#8208;
              path.

       -g, --global
              Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as `global&apos; within
              the man-db configuration file.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system&apos;s manual hier&#8208;
              archies,  this option can be used to include them in the output of
              manpath.  To include  NewOS&apos;s  manual  page  hierarchies  use  the
              option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited oper&#8208;
              ating system names.  To include the native operating system&apos;s man&#8208;
              ual  page hierarchies, the system name man must be included in the
              argument string.  This option will override the  $SYSTEM  environ&#8208;
              ment variable.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use  this  user  configuration  file  rather  than  the default of
              ~/.manpath.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, manpath displays its value rather than  deter&#8208;
              mining  it  on  the fly.  If $MANPATH is prefixed by a colon, then
              the value of the variable is appended to the list determined  from
              the content of the configuration files.  If the colon comes at the
              end of the value in the variable,  then  the  determined  list  is
              appended  to  the  content  of  the variable.  If the value of the
              variable contains a double colon (::), then the determined list is
              inserted in the middle of the value, between the two colons.

       SYSTEM If  $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been
              specified as the argument to the -m option.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config  man-db configuration file.
