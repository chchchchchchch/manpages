MAPSCRN(8)                    International Support                   MAPSCRN(8)



NAME
       mapscrn - load screen output mapping table

SYNOPSIS
       mapscrn [-v] [-o map.orig] mapfile

DESCRIPTION
       The  mapscrn command is obsolete - its function is now built-in into set&#8208;
       font.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still  available  as  a
       separate command.

       The  mapscrn  command loads a user defined output character mapping table
       into the console driver. The console driver may be  later  put  into  use
       user-defined  mapping  table mode by outputting a special escape sequence
       to the console device.  This sequence is &lt;esc&gt;(K for the G0 character set
       and  &lt;esc&gt;)K  for the G1 character set.  When the -o option is given, the
       old map is saved in map.orig.

USE
       There are two kinds of mapping tables: direct-to-font tables, that give a
       font  position  for each user byte value, and user-to-unicode tables that
       give a unicode value for each user byte. The corresponding glyph  is  now
       found using the unicode index of the font.  The command
              mapscrn trivial
       sets  up  a  one-to-one  direct-to-font  table  where user bytes directly
       address the font. This is useful for fonts that are in the same order  as
       the character set one uses.  A command like
              mapscrn 8859-2
       sets  up  a  user-to-unicode  table  that  assumes that the user uses ISO
       8859-2.

INPUT FORMAT
       The mapscrn command can read the map in either of two formats:
       1. 256 or 512 bytes binary data
       2. two-column text file
       Format (1) is a direct image of  the  translation  table.  The  256-bytes
       tables  are  direct-to-font,  the  512-bytes  tables  are user-to-unicode
       tables.  Format (2) is used to fill the table as follows: cell with  off&#8208;
       set  mentioned  in the first column is filled with the value mentioned in
       the second column.  When values larger than  255  occur,  or  values  are
       written  using the U+xxxx notation, the table is assumed to be a user-to-
       unicode table, otherwise it is a direct-to-font table.

       Values in the file may be specified in one of several formats:
       1. Decimal: String of decimal digits not starting with &apos;0&apos;
       2. Octal: String of octal digits beginning with &apos;0&apos;.
       3. Hexadecimal: String of hexadecimal digits preceded by &quot;0x&quot;.
       4. Unicode: String of four hexadecimal digits preceded by &quot;U+&quot;.
       5. Character: Single character enclosed in single quotes. (And the binary
       value  is used.)  Note that blank, comma, tab character and &apos;#&apos; cannot be
       specified with this format.
       6.  UTF-8  Character:  Single  (possibly  multi-byte)  UTF-8   character,
       enclosed in single quotes.

       Note  that  control characters (with codes &lt; 32) cannot be re-mapped with
       mapscrn because they have special meaning for the driver.

FILES
       /usr/share/consoletrans is the default directory for screen mappings.
