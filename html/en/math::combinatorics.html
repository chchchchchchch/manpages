DESCRIPTION
       The  math package contains implementations of several functions useful in
       combinatorial problems.

COMMANDS
       ::math::ln_Gamma z
              Returns the natural logarithm of the Gamma function for the  argu&#8208;
              ment z.

              The  Gamma  function is defined as the improper integral from zero
              to positive infinity of


                t**(x-1)*exp(-t) dt


       The approximation used in the Tcl Math Library is from Lanczos, ISIAM  J.
       Numerical Analysis, series B, volume 1, p. 86.  For &quot;x &gt; 1&quot;, the absolute
       error of the result is claimed to be smaller than 5.5*10**-10 -- that is,
       the resulting value of Gamma when


                exp( ln_Gamma( x) )


              is computed is expected to be precise to better than nine signifi&#8208;
              cant figures.

       ::math::factorial x
              Returns the factorial of the argument x.

              For integer x, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 12, an exact integer result is returned.

              For integer x, 13 &lt;= x &lt;= 21, an exact  floating-point  result  is
              returned on machines with IEEE floating point.

              For integer x, 22 &lt;= x &lt;= 170, the result is exact to 1 ULP.

              For  real  x,  x  &gt;=  0,  the  result is approximated by computing
              Gamma(x+1) using the ::math::ln_Gamma function, and the result  is
              expected to be precise to better than nine significant figures.
&#12;              It is an error to present x &lt;= -1 or x &gt; 170, or a value of x that
              is not numeric.

       ::math::choose n k
              Returns the binomial coefficient C(n, k)


                 C(n,k) = n! / k! (n-k)!


              If both parameters are integers and the result fits  in  32  bits,
              the result is rounded to an integer.

              Integer  results  are exact up to at least n = 34.  Floating point
              results are precise to better than nine significant figures.

       ::math::Beta z w
              Returns the Beta function of the parameters z and w.


                 Beta(z,w) = Beta(w,z) = Gamma(z) * Gamma(w) / Gamma(z+w)


              Results are returned as a floating point number precise to  better
              than  nine  significant  digits  provided that w and z are both at
              least 1.
