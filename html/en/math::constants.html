NAME
       math::constants - Mathematical and numerical constants

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  ?8.3?

       package require math::constants  ?1.0.1?

       ::math::constants::constants args

       ::math::constants::print-constants args

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  defines  some common mathematical and numerical constants.
       By using the package you get consistent values for numbers  like  pi  and
       ln(10).

       It defines two commands:

       &#183;      One for importing the constants

       &#183;      One for reporting which constants are defined and what values they
              actually have.

       The motivation for this package is that quite often, with  (mathematical)
       computations, you need a good approximation to, say, the ratio of degrees
       to radians. You can, of course, define this like:


                  variable radtodeg [expr {180.0/(4.0*atan(1.0))}]

       and use the variable radtodeg whenever you need the conversion.

       This has two drawbacks:

       &#183;      You need to remember the proper  formula  or  value  and  that  is
              error-prone.

       &#183;      Especially  with  the  use of mathematical functions like atan you
              assume that they have been accurately implemented. This is  seldom
              or never the case and for each platform you can get subtle differ&#8208;
              ences.

       Here is the way you can do it with the math::constants package:


                  package require math::constants
                  ::math::constants::constants radtodeg degtorad

       which creates two variables, radtodeg and (its  reciprocal)  degtorad  in
       the calling namespace.

       Constants  that  have  been  defined  (their values are mostly taken from
       mathematical tables with more precision  than  usually  can  be  handled)
       include:

       &#183;      basic constants like pi, e, gamma (Euler&apos;s constant)
&#12;       &#183;      derived values like ln(10) and sqrt(2)

       &#183;      purely  numerical  values such as 1/3 that are included for conve&#8208;
              nience and for the fact that certain  seemingly  trivial  computa&#8208;
              tions like:


                  set value [expr {3.0*$onethird}]


              give  exactly  the  value you expect (if IEEE arithmetic is avail&#8208;
              able).

PROCEDURES
       The package defines the following public procedures:

       ::math::constants::constants args
              Import the constants whose names are given as arguments


       ::math::constants::print-constants args
              Print the constants whose names are  given  as  arguments  on  the
              screen  (name,  value  and  description)  or,  if no arguments are
              given, print all defined constants. This is mainly  a  convenience
              procedure.
