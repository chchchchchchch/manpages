DESCRIPTION
       The  math::fourier  package  implements  two versions of discrete Fourier
       transforms, the ordinary transform and the  fast  Fourier  transform.  It
       also  provides  a few simple filter procedures as an illustrations of how
       such filters can be implemented.

       The purpose of this document is to describe  the  implemented  procedures
       and provide some examples of their usage. As there is ample literature on
       the algorithms involved, we refer to relevant text books for more  expla&#8208;
       nations.  We  also  refer  to the original Wiki page on the subject which
       describes some of the considerations behind the current implementation.

GENERAL INFORMATION
       The two top-level procedures defined are

       &#183;      dft data-list

       &#183;      inverse_dft data-list

       Both take a list of complex numbers and apply a Discrete  Fourier  Trans&#8208;
       form  (DFT)  or  its  inverse  respectively to these lists of numbers.  A
       &quot;complex number&quot; in this case is either (i) a pair (two element list)  of
       numbers,  interpreted as the real and imaginary parts of the complex num&#8208;
       ber, or (ii) a single number, interpreted as the real part of  a  complex
       number  whose  imaginary  part is zero. The return value is always in the
       first format. (The DFT generally produces complex  results  even  if  the
       input  is  purely  real.)  Applying first one and then the other of these
       procedures to a list of complex numbers will (modulo rounding errors  due
       to floating point arithmetic) return the original list of numbers.

       If  the  input length N is a power of two then these procedures will uti&#8208;
       lize the O(N log N) Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. If input length  is
       not  a  power  of  two  then the DFT will instead be computed using a the
       naive quadratic algorithm.

       Some examples:


                  % dft {1 2 3 4}
                  {10 0.0} {-2.0 2.0} {-2 0.0} {-2.0 -2.0}
                  % inverse_dft {{10 0.0} {-2.0 2.0} {-2 0.0} {-2.0 -2.0}}
                  {1.0 0.0} {2.0 0.0} {3.0 0.0} {4.0 0.0}
                  % dft {1 2 3 4 5}
                  {15.0 0.0} {-2.5 3.44095480118} {-2.5 0.812299240582} {-2.5 -0.812299240582} {-2.5 -3.44095480118}
                  % inverse_dft {{15.0 0.0} {-2.5 3.44095480118} {-2.5 0.812299240582} {-2.5 -0.812299240582} {-2.5 -3.44095480118}}
                  {1.0 0.0} {2.0 8.881784197e-17} {3.0 4.4408920985e-17} {4.0 4.4408920985e-17} {5.0 -8.881784197e-17}


       In the last case, the imaginary parts &lt;1e-16  would  have  been  zero  in
       exact arithmetic, but aren&apos;t here due to rounding errors.

       Internally,  the procedures use a flat list format where every even index
       element of a list is a real part and every odd index element is an imagi&#8208;
       nary  part.  This  is reflected in the variable names by Re_ and Im_ pre&#8208;
       fixes.

       The package includes two simple filters. They have an analogue equivalent
       in  a  simple electronic circuit, a resistor and a capacitance in series.
       Using these filters requires the math::complexnumbers package.

PROCEDURES
       The public Fourier transform procedures are:

       ::math::fourier::dft in_data
              Determine the Fourier transform of the given list of complex  num&#8208;
              bers.  The  result  is  a list of complex numbers representing the
              (complex) amplitudes of the Fourier components.

              list in_data
                     List of data


       ::math::fourier::inverse_dft in_data
              Determine the inverse Fourier transform of the given list of  com&#8208;
              plex  numbers (interpreted as amplitudes). The result is a list of
              complex numbers representing the original (complex) data

              list in_data
                     List of data (amplitudes)


       ::math::fourier::lowpass cutoff in_data
              Filter the (complex) amplitudes so that high-frequency  components
              are  suppressed.  The implemented filter is a first-order low-pass
              filter, the discrete equivalent of  a  simple  electronic  circuit
              with a resistor and a capacitance.

              float cutoff
                     Cut-off frequency

              list in_data
                     List of data (amplitudes)


       ::math::fourier::highpass cutoff in_data
              Filter  the  (complex) amplitudes so that low-frequency components
              are suppressed. The implemented filter is a  first-order  low-pass
              filter,  the  discrete  equivalent  of a simple electronic circuit
              with a resistor and a capacitance.

              float cutoff
                     Cut-off frequency

              list in_data
