       math::numtheory::isprime N ?option value ...?

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  is  for  collecting  various  number-theoretic operations,
       though at the moment it only provides that of testing whether an  integer
       is a prime.

       math::numtheory::isprime N ?option value ...?
              The  isprime  command  tests  whether  the  integer  N is a prime,
              returning a boolean true value for prime N  and  a  boolean  false
              value  for  non-prime  N. The formal definition of &#180;prime&apos; used is
              the conventional, that the number being tested is greater  than  1
              and only has trivial divisors.

              To  be  precise,  the return value is one of 0 (if N is definitely
              not a prime), 1 (if N is definitely a prime),  and  on  (if  N  is
              probably  prime); the latter two are both boolean true values. The
              case that an integer may be classified as &quot;probably prime&quot;  arises
              because the Miller-Rabin algorithm used in the test implementation
              is basically probabilistic, and may if  we  are  unlucky  fail  to
              detect  that a number is in fact composite. Options may be used to
              select the risk of such  &quot;false  positives&quot;  in  the  test.  1  is
              returned  for  &quot;small&quot; N (which currently means N &lt; 118670087467),
              where it is known that no false positives are possible.

              The only option currently defined is:

              -randommr repetitions
                     which controls how many times the Miller-Rabin test  should
                     be  repeated  with  randomly  chosen bases. Each repetition
                     reduces the probability of a false positive by a factor  at
                     least 4. The default for repetitions is 4.

              Unknown options are silently ignored.
