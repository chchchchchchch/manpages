Name
       mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       Mattrib is used to change MS-DOS file attribute flags. It has the follow&#8208;
       ing syntax:

       mattrib [-a|+a] [-h|+h] [-r|+r]  [-s|+s]  [-/]   [-p]  [-X]  msdosfile  [
       msdosfiles ... ]

       Mattrib adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file (with the `+&apos; operator) or
       remove attribute flags (with the `-&apos; operator).

       Mattrib supports the following attribute bits:

       a      Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate a new file.

       r      Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a  read-only  file.   Files  with
              this bit set cannot be erased by DEL nor modified.

       s      System bit.  Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating system file.

       h      Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.

       Mattrib supports the following command line flags:

       /      Recursive.   Recursively  list  the attributes of the files in the
              subdirectories.

       X      Concise. Prints the attributes without any whitespace padding.  If
              neither  the  &quot;/&quot;  option  is  given, nor the msdosfile contains a
              wildcard, and there is only one MS-DOS file parameter on the  com&#8208;
              mand  line,  only  the attribute is printed, and not the filename.
              This option is convenient for scripts

       p      Replay mode.  Outputs a  series  of  mformat  commands  that  will
              reproduce the current situation, starting from a situation as left
              by untarring the MS-DOS file system.  Commands are only output for
              attribute  settings  that differ from the default (archive bit set
              for files, unset for directories).  This option is intended to  be
              used  in addition to tar. The readonly attribute is not taken into
              account, as tar can set that one itself.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
