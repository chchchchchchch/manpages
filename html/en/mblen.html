MBLEN(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   MBLEN(3)



NAME
       mblen - determine number of bytes in next multibyte character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int mblen(const char *s, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       If s is not a NULL pointer, the mblen() function inspects at most n bytes
       of the multibyte string starting at s  and  extracts  the  next  complete
       multibyte  character.   It uses a static anonymous shift state only known
       to the mblen() function.  If the multibyte character is not the null wide
       character,  it returns the number of bytes that were consumed from s.  If
       the multibyte character is the null wide character, it returns 0.

       If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete multibyte  charac&#8208;
       ter,  mblen()  returns  -1.  This can happen even if n is greater than or
       equal to MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte  string  contains  redundant  shift
       sequences.

       If  the  multibyte  string  starting  at  s contains an invalid multibyte
       sequence before the next complete character, mblen() also returns -1.

       If s is a NULL pointer, the mblen() function resets the shift state, only
       known  to this function, to the initial state, and returns nonzero if the
       encoding has nontrivial shift state, or zero if the  encoding  is  state&#8208;
       less.

RETURN VALUE
       The  mblen()  function returns the number of bytes parsed from the multi&#8208;
       byte sequence starting at s, if a non-null wide character was recognized.
       It returns 0, if a null wide character was recognized.  It returns -1, if
       an invalid multibyte sequence was encountered or if it couldn&apos;t  parse  a
       complete multibyte character.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of mblen() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current
       locale.

       The function mbrlen(3) provides a better interface to the same  function&#8208;
       ality.
