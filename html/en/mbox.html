NAME
       mbox - Format for mail message storage.

DESCRIPTION
       This  document  describes  the format traditionally used by Unix hosts to
       store mail messages locally.  mbox files typically reside in the system&apos;s
       mail spool, under various names in users&apos; Mail directories, and under the
       name mbox in users&apos; home directories.

       An mbox is a text file containing an arbitrary number of e-mail messages.
       Each  message  consists of a postmark, followed by an e-mail message for&#8208;
       matted according to RFC822, RFC2822. The file  format  is  line-oriented.
       Lines are separated by line feed characters (ASCII 10).

       A  postmark  line  consists  of the four characters &quot;From&quot;, followed by a
       space character, followed by the message&apos;s envelope sender address,  fol&#8208;
       lowed  by  whitespace,  and  followed by a time stamp. This line is often
       called From_ line.

       The sender address is expected to be  addr-spec  as  defined  in  RFC2822
       3.4.1. The date is expected to be date-time as output by asctime(3).  For
       compatibility reasons with legacy software, two-digit years greater  than
       or  equal to 70 should be interpreted as the years 1970+, while two-digit
       years less than 70 should be interpreted as the years 2000-2069. Software
       reading  files  in  this  format  should  also be prepared to accept non-
       numeric timezone information such as &quot;CET DST&quot; for Central European Time,
       daylight saving time.

       Example:

        &gt;From example@example.com Fri Jun 23 02:56:55 2000

       In  order  to  avoid  misinterpretation  of lines in message bodies which
       begin with the four characters &quot;From&quot;, followed by a space character, the
       mail  delivery agent must quote any occurrence of &quot;From &quot; at the start of
       a body line.

       There are two different quoting schemes, the first  (MBOXO)  only  quotes
       plain &quot;From &quot; lines in the body by prepending a &apos;&gt;&apos; to the line; the sec&#8208;
       ond (MBOXRD) also quotes already quoted &quot;From &quot; lines by prepending a &apos;&gt;&apos;
       (i.e.  &quot;&gt;From  &quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;From &quot;, ...). The later has the advantage that lines
       like

        &gt;From the command line you can use the &apos;-p&apos; option

       aren&apos;t dequoted wrongly as a MBOXRD-MDA would turn the line into

        &gt;&gt;From the command line you can use the &apos;-p&apos; option

       before storing it. Besides MBOXO and MBOXRD there is also MBOXCL which is
       MBOXO with a &quot;Content-Length:&quot;-field with the number of bytes in the mes&#8208;
       sage body; some MUAs (like  mutt(1))  do  automatically  transform  MBOXO
       mailboxes  into  MBOXCL ones when ever they write them back as MBOXCL can
       be read by any MBOXO-MUA without any problems.

       If the modification-time (usually determined via stat(2)) of  a  nonempty
       mbox  file  is  greater  than the access-time the file has new mail. Many
       MUAs place a Status: header in each message to  indicate  which  messages
       have already been read.

LOCKING
       Since  mbox  files are frequently accessed by multiple programs in paral&#8208;
       lel, mbox files should generally not be accessed without locking.

       Three different locking mechanisms (and combinations thereof) are in gen&#8208;
       eral use:

       &#183;      fcntl(2)  locking  is  mostly used on recent, POSIX-compliant sys&#8208;
              tems. Use of this locking method is, in particular,  advisable  if
              mbox  files  are  accessed  through the Network File System (NFS),
              since it seems the only way to reliably  invalidate  NFS  clients&apos;
              caches.

       &#183;      flock(2) locking is mostly used on BSD-based systems.

       &#183;      Dotlocking  is  used  on all kinds of systems. In order to lock an
              mbox file named folder, an application first creates  a  temporary
              file  with  a  unique  name  in  the directory in which the folder
              resides. The application then tries to use the link(2) system call
              to create a hard link named folder.lock to the temporary file. The
              success of the link(2) system call should be additionally verified
              using stat(2) calls. If the link has succeeded, the mail folder is
              considered dotlocked.  The  temporary  file  can  then  safely  be
              unlinked.

              In  order  to  release  the  lock, an application just unlinks the
              folder.lock file.

       If multiple methods are combined, implementors should make  sure  to  use
       the  non-blocking  variants  of the fcntl(2) and flock(2) system calls in
       order to avoid deadlocks.

       If multiple methods are combined, an mbox file must not be considered  to
       have  been successfully locked before all individual locks were obtained.
       When one of the individual locking methods fails, an  application  should
       release  all locks it acquired successfully, and restart the entire lock&#8208;
       ing procedure from the beginning, after a suitable delay.

       The locking mechanism used on a particular system is a  matter  of  local
       policy,  and should be consistently used by all applications installed on
       the system which access mbox files. Failure to do so may result  in  loss
       of e-mail data, and in corrupted mbox files.

FILES
       /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME
              $LOGNAME&apos;s incoming mail folder.

       $HOME/mbox
              user&apos;s archived mail messages, in his $HOME directory.

       $HOME/Mail/
              A  directory  in  user&apos;s $HOME directory which is commonly used to
              hold mbox format folders.

HISTORY
       The mbox format occurred in Version 6 AT&amp;T Unix.
       A variant of this format was documented in RFC976.
