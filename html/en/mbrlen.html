MBRLEN(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  MBRLEN(3)



NAME
       mbrlen - determine number of bytes in next multibyte character

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t mbrlen(const char *s, size_t n, mbstate_t *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       The  mbrlen()  function  inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte string
       starting at s and extracts the next  complete  multibyte  character.   It
       updates  the shift state *ps.  If the multibyte character is not the null
       wide character, it returns the number of bytes that were consumed from s.
       If  the  multibyte  character  is  the null wide character, it resets the
       shift state *ps to the initial state and returns 0.

       If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete multibyte  charac&#8208;
       ter,  mbrlen()  returns  (size_t) -2.   This  can  happen  even  if  n &gt;=
       MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte string contains redundant shift sequences.

       If the multibyte string starting  at  s  contains  an  invalid  multibyte
       sequence before the next complete character, mbrlen() returns (size_t) -1
       and sets errno to EILSEQ.  In this case, the effects  on  *ps  are  unde&#8208;
       fined.

       If  ps  is  a  NULL  pointer,  a static anonymous state only known to the
       mbrlen() function is used instead.

RETURN VALUE
       The mbrlen() function returns the number of bytes parsed from the  multi&#8208;
       byte sequence starting at s, if a non-null wide character was recognized.
       It returns 0, if a  null  wide  character  was  recognized.   It  returns
       (size_t) -1  and  sets  errno to EILSEQ, if an invalid multibyte sequence
       was encountered.  It returns (size_t) -2 if it couldn&apos;t parse a  complete
       multibyte character, meaning that n should be increased.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior of mbrlen() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current
       locale.
