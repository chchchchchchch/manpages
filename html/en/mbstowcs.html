MBSTOWCS(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                MBSTOWCS(3)



NAME
       mbstowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       If  dest  is  not  a  NULL  pointer, the mbstowcs() function converts the
       multibyte string src to a wide-character string  starting  at  dest.   At
       most n wide characters are written to dest.  The conversion starts in the
       initial state.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. An invalid multibyte sequence has  been  encountered.   In  this  case
          (size_t) -1 is returned.

       2. n  non-L&apos;\0&apos;  wide  characters have been stored at dest.  In this case
          the number of wide characters written to dest  is  returned,  but  the
          shift state at this point is lost.

       3. The multibyte string has been completely converted, including the ter&#8208;
          minating null wide character (&apos;\0&apos;).  In this case the number of  wide
          characters  written to dest, excluding the terminating null wide char&#8208;
          acter, is returned.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide charac&#8208;
       ters at dest.

       If  dest  is  NULL,  n  is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above,
       except that the converted wide characters are not written out to  memory,
       and that no length limit exists.

       In  order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should make sure n is
       greater or equal to mbstowcs(NULL,src,0)+1.

RETURN VALUE
       The mbstowcs() function returns the number of wide characters  that  make
       up  the  converted  part  of the wide-character string, not including the
       terminating null wide character.  If an invalid  multibyte  sequence  was
       encountered, (size_t) -1 is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of mbstowcs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       The function mbsrtowcs(3) provides a better interface to the  same  func&#8208;
       tionality.
