Name
       mcat - dump raw disk image



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mcat  command  is  used  to copy an entire disk image from or to the
       floppy device. It uses the following syntax:

       mcat [-w] drive:

       Mcat performs the same task as the Unix cat command. It is included  into
       the mtools package, since cat cannot access remote floppy devices offered
       by the mtools floppy daemon.  Now it is possible to create boot  floppies
       remotely.

       The default operation is reading. The output is written to stdout.

       If  the  -w  option  is specified, mcat reads a disk-image from stdin and
       writes it to the given device.  Use this carefully! Because of  the  low-
       level  nature  of  this command, it will happily destroy any data written
       before on the disk without warning!

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
