Name
       mcd - change MSDOS directory



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mcd command is used to change the mtools working directory on the MS-
       DOS disk. It uses the following syntax:

          mcd [msdosdirectory]



       Without arguments, mcd reports the current device and working  directory.
       Otherwise,  mcd  changes the current device and current working directory
       relative to an MS-DOS file system.

       The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the file where  the
       device  and current working directory information is stored.  The default
       is `$HOME/.mcwd&apos;.  Information in this file is ignored  if  the  file  is
       more than 6 hours old.

       Mcd returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

       Unlike  MS-DOS  versions  of  CD,  mcd  can  be used to change to another
       device. It may be wise to remove old `.mcwd&apos; files at logout.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
