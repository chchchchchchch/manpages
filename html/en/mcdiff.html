NAME
       mc - Visual shell for Unix-like systems.

USAGE
       mc [-abcCdfhPstuUVx] [-l log] [dir1 [dir2]] [-e [file]] [-v file]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  Midnight Commander is a directory browser/file manager for Unix-like
       operating systems.

OPTIONS
       -a, --stickchars
              Disable usage of graphic characters for line drawing.

       -b, --nocolor
              Force black and white display.

       -c, --color

              documented in the Skins.  section.

       -d, --nomouse
              Disable mouse support.

       -e [file], --edit[=file]
              Start  the  internal editor.  If the file is specified, open it on
              startup.  See also mcedit (1).

       -f, --datadir
              Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.

       -F, --datadir-info
              Display extended info about compiled-in paths for Midnight Comman&#8208;
              der.

       --configure-options
              Display configure options.

       -k, --resetsoft
              Reset  softkeys  to  their default from the termcap/terminfo data&#8208;
              base. Only useful on HP terminals when  the  function  keys  don&apos;t
              work.

       -K file
              Specify a name of keymap file in the command line.

       --nokeymap
              Don&apos;t load key bindings from any file, use default hardcoded keys.

       -l file, --ftplog=file
              Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.

       -P file, --printwd=file
              Print  the  last  working  directory  to the specified file.  This
              option is not meant to be used directly.  Instead, it&apos;s used  from
              a  special  shell  script  that  automatically changes the current
              directory of the shell to the last directory the Midnight  Comman&#8208;
              der  was  in.   Source  the  file  /usr/lib/mc/mc.sh (bash and zsh
              users) or /usr/lib/mc/mc.csh (tcsh users) respectively  to  define
              mc as an alias to the appropriate shell script.

       -s     Set  alternative  mode  drawing  of  frameworks.   If  the section
              [Lines] is not filled, the symbol for the pseudographics frame  is
              a  space,  otherwise  the  frame  characters are taken from follow
              params.

              You can redefine the following variables:

       lefttop
              left-top corner

       righttop
              right-top corner

       centertop
              center-top cross

       centerbottom
              center-bottom cross

       leftbottom
              left-bottom corner

       rightbottom
              right-bottom corner

       leftmiddle
              left-middle cross

       rightmiddle
              right-middle cross

       centermiddle
              center cross

       horiz  default horizontal line

       vert   default vertical line

       thinhoriz
              thin horizontal line

       thinvert
              thin vertical line

       -t, --termcap
              Used only if the code was compiled with  Slang  and  terminfo:  it
              makes the Midnight Commander use the value of the TERMCAP variable
              for the terminal information instead of  the  information  on  the
              system wide terminal database

       -u, --nosubshell
              Disable  use of the concurrent shell (only makes sense if the Mid&#8208;
              night Commander has been built with concurrent shell support).

       -U, --subshell
              Enable use of the concurrent shell support (only  makes  sense  if
              the  Midnight Commander was built with the subshell support set as
              an optional feature).

       -v file, --view=file
              Start the internal viewer to view the specified  file.   See  also
              mcview (1).

       -V, --version
              Display the version of the program.

       -x, --xterm
              Force  xterm  mode.   Used when running on xterm-capable terminals
              (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

       -X, --no-x11
              Do not use X11 to get the state of modifiers Alt, Ctrl, Shift

       -g, --oldmouse
              Force a  &quot;normal  tracking&quot;  mouse  mode.  Used  when  running  on
              xterm-capable terminals (tmux/screen).

       If  specified,  the  first  path  name  is  the  directory to show in the
       selected panel; the second path name is the directory to be shown in  the
       other panel.

Overview
       The  screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.  Almost
       all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels.  By default,
       the  second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line,
       and the bottom line shows the function key labels.  The topmost  line  is
       the  menu bar line.  The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if
       you click the topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.

       The Midnight Commander provides a view of two  directories  at  the  same
       time.  One  of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the
       current panel). Almost all operations take place on  the  current  panel.
       Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of
       the unselected panel as a destination (don&apos;t worry, they always  ask  you
       for  confirmation  first).  For more information, see the sections on the
       Directory Panels, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.

       You can execute system commands from the  Midnight  Commander  by  simply
       typing  them.  Everything you type will appear on the shell command line,
       and when you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the  command
       line  you typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sections
       to learn more about the command line.

Mouse Support
       The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is  activated  when&#8208;
       ever you are running on an xterm(1) terminal (it even works if you take a
       telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if
       you are running on a Linux console and have the gpm mouse server running.

       When  you  left  click  on  a  file in the directory panels, that file is
       selected; if you click with the right button,  the  file  is  marked  (or
       unmarked, depending on the previous state).

       Double-clicking  on  a  file  will try to execute the command if it is an
       executable program; and if the extension file has a program specified for
       the file&apos;s extension, the specified program is executed.

       Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key
       labels by clicking on them.

       The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is  400  milliseconds.
       This  may be changed to other values by editing the ~/.config/mc/ini file
       and changing the mouse_repeat_rate parameter.

       If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can
       get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down
       the Shift key.


Keys
       Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use  of  the  Control
       (sometimes  labeled  CTRL  or CTL) and the Meta (sometimes labeled ALT or
       even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use  the  following  abbrevia&#8208;
       tions:

       C-&lt;chr&gt;
              means hold the Control key while typing the character &lt;chr&gt;.  Thus
              C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.

       Alt-&lt;chr&gt;
              means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.  If  there
              is no Meta or Alt key, type ESC, release it, then type the charac&#8208;
              ter &lt;chr&gt;.

       S-&lt;chr&gt;
              means hold the Shift key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.

       All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU
       Emacs editor&apos;s key bindings (default).

       You may redefine key bindings. See redefine hotkey bindings

       for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) relative
       to default behavior.


       There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are  the
       most important.

       The  File  Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands
       appearing in the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most
       of  these  commands  perform some action, usually on the selected file or
       the tagged files.

       The Directory Panels section documents the keys which select  a  file  or
       tag  files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one from
       the file menu).

       The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for  entering
       and  editing  command  lines. Most of these copy file names and such from
       the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive  typing)  or
       access the command line history.

       Input  Line  Keys  are  used for editing input lines. This means both the
       command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.


  Redefine hotkey bindings
       Hotkey  bindings  may  be  read  from  external  file  (keymap-file).   A
       keymap-file  is  searched  on  the  following algorithm (to the first one
       found):

              1) command line option -K &lt;keymap&gt; or --keymap=&lt;keymap&gt;
              2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP
              3) Parameter keymap  in  section  [Midnight-Commander]  of  config
              file.
              4) File ~/.config/mc/mc.keymap
              5) File /etc/mc/mc.keymap
              6) File /usr/share/mc/mc.keymap

       Command  line  option,  environment variable and parameter in config file
       may contain the absolute path to  the  keymap-file  (with  the  extension
       .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first
       one found):

              1) ~/.config/mc
              2) /etc/mc/
              3) /usr/share/mc/


  Miscellaneous Keys
       Here are some keys which don&apos;t fall into any of the other categories:
&#12;       Enter  if there is some text in the command line (the one at  the  bottom
              of the panels), then that command is executed. If there is no text
              in the command line then if the selection bar is over a  directory
              the  Midnight  Commander does a chdir(2) to the selected directory
              and reloads the information on the panel; if the selection  is  an
              executable  file then it is executed. Finally, if the extension of
              the selected file name matches one of the extensions in the exten&#8208;
              sions file then the corresponding command is executed.

       C-l    repaint all the information in the Midnight Commander.

       C-x c  run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged files.

       C-x o  run the Chown command on the current file or on the tagged files.

       C-x l  run the hard link command.

       C-x s  run the absolute symbolic link command.

       C-x v  run  the relative symbolic link command. See the File Menu section
              for more information about symbolic links.

       C-x i  set the other panel display mode to information.

       C-x q  set the other panel display mode to quick view.

       C-x !  execute the External panelize command.

       C-x h  run the add directory to hotlist command.

       Alt-!  executes the Filtered view command, described in the view command.

       Alt-?  executes the Find file command.

       Alt-c  pops up the quick cd dialog.

       C-o    when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD  console  or
              under  an  xterm, it will show you the output of the previous com&#8208;
              mand.  When ran on the Linux console, the Midnight Commander  uses
              an external program (cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of
              information on the screen.

       When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o  at  any  time
       and  you  will  be  taken  back to the Midnight Commander main screen, to
       return to your application just type C-o.  If  you  have  an  application
       suspended  by  using  this trick, you won&apos;t be able to execute other pro&#8208;
       grams from the Midnight  Commander  until  you  terminate  the  suspended
       application.

  Directory Panels
       This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you
       want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take  a  look  at
       the section on Left and Right Menus.

       Tab, C-i
              change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new cur&#8208;
              rent panel and the old current panel becomes the new other  panel.
              The selection bar moves from the old current panel to the new cur&#8208;
              rent panel.

       Insert, C-t
              to tag files you may  use  the  Insert  key  (the  kich1  terminfo
              sequence).  To untag files, just retag a tagged file.

       M-e    to  change  charset of panel you may use M-e (Alt-e).  Recoding is
              made from selected codepage into system codepage.  To  cancel  the
              recoding  you  may select &quot;directory up&quot; (..) in active panel.  To
              cancel the charsets in all directories, select &quot;No  translation  &quot;
              in the dialog of encodings.

       Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j
              used  to  select  the top file in a panel, the middle file and the
              bottom one, respectively.

       Alt-t  toggle the current display listing to show the next display  list&#8208;
              ing  mode.   With  this  it is possible to quickly switch to brief
              listing, long listing, user defined listing mode, and back to  the
              default.

       C-\ (control-backslash)
              show the directory hotlist and change to the selected directory.

       +  (plus)
              this  is used to select (tag) a group of files.  The Midnight Com&#8208;
              mander will prompt for a selection options. When Files only check&#8208;
              box  is on, only files will be selected.  If Files only is off, as
              files as directories will be selected.  When Shell Patterns check&#8208;
              box  is on, the regular expression is much like the filename glob&#8208;
              bing in the shell (* standing for zero or more  characters  and  ?
              standing  for  one  character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the
              tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions  (see  ed
              (1)).  When  Case  sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be
              case sensitive characters.  If Case sensitive  is  off,  the  case
              will be ignored.

       \ (backslash)
              use the &quot;\&quot; key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite
              of the Plus key.

       up-key, C-p
              move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.

       down-key, C-n
              move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.

       home, a1, Alt-&lt;
              move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.

       end, c1, Alt-&gt;
              move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.

       next-page, C-v
              move the selection bar one page down.

       prev-page, Alt-v
              move the selection bar one page up.

       Alt-o  If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory
              on  the  other  panel and moves the selection to the next file. If
              the currently selected file is not a directory,  load  the  parent
              directory  on  the other panel and moves the selection to the next
              file.

       Alt-i  make the current directory of the current panel also  the  current
              directory  of the other panel.  Put the other panel to the listing
              mode if needed.  If the current  panel  is  panelized,  the  other
              panel doesn&apos;t become panelized.

       C-PageUp, C-PageDown
              only  when  supported  by  the terminal: change to &quot;..&quot; and to the
              currently selected directory respectively.

       Alt-y  moves to the previous directory  in  the  history,  equivalent  to
              clicking the &lt; with the mouse.

       Alt-u  moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking
              the &gt; with the mouse.

       Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H
              displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing  the  &apos;v&apos;
              with the mouse.

  Quick search
       The  Quick  search  mode  allows  you to perform fast file search in file
       panel.  Press C-s or Alt-s to start a filename search  in  the  directory
       listing.

       When  the  search  is  active, the user input will be added to the search
       string instead of the command line. If the  Show  mini-status  option  is
       enabled  the search string is shown on the mini-status line. When typing,
       the selection bar will move to the next file starting with the typed let&#8208;
       ters.  The  Backspace or DEL keys can be used to correct typing mistakes.
       If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.

       If quick search is started with double  pressing  of  C-s,  the  previous
       quick search pattern will be used for current search.

       Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters &apos;*&apos;
       and &apos;?&apos;.

  Shell Command Line
       This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive  typing  when
       entering shell commands.

       Alt-Enter
              copy the currently selected file name to the command line.

       C-Enter
              same  a Alt-Enter.  May not work on remote systems and some termi&#8208;
              nals.

       C-Shift-Enter
              copy the full path name of the currently selected file to the com&#8208;
              mand line.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

       Alt-Tab
              does  the  filename, command, variable, username and hostname com&#8208;
              pletion for you.

       C-x t, C-x C-t
              copy the tagged files (or  if  there  are  no  tagged  files,  the
              selected  file) of the current panel (C-x t) or of the other panel
              (C-x C-t) to the command line.

       C-x p, C-x C-p
              the first key sequence copies the current path name to the command
              line,  and  the second one copies the unselected panel&apos;s path name
              to the command line.

       C-q    the quote command can be used to insert characters that are other&#8208;
              wise interpreted by the Midnight Commander (like the &apos;+&apos; symbol)

       Alt-p, Alt-n
              use  these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes
              you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

       Alt-h  displays the history for the current input line.

  General Movement Keys
       The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use  common  code
       to  handle  moving.  Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each of
       them also accepts some keys of its own.

       Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some of the same movement keys,
       so this section may be of use for those parts too.

       Up, C-p
              moves one line backward.

       Down, C-n
              moves one line forward.

       Prev Page, Page Up, Alt-v
              moves one page up.

       Next Page, Page Down, C-v
              moves one page down.

       Home, A1
              moves to the beginning.
&#12;       End, C1
              move to the end.

       The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in addition
       the to ones mentioned above:

       b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
              moves one page up.

       Space bar
              moves one page down.

       u, d   moves one half of a page up or down.

       g, G   moves to the beginning or to the end.

  Input Line Keys
       The input lines (they are used for the command line  and  for  the  query
       dialogs in the program) accept these keys:

       C-a    puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

       C-e    puts the cursor at the end of the line.

       C-b, move-left
              move the cursor one position left.

       C-f, move-right
              move the cursor one position right.

       Alt-f  moves one word forward.

       Alt-b  moves one word backward.

       C-h, Backspace
              delete the previous character.

       C-d, Delete
              delete the character in the point (over the cursor).

       C-@    sets the mark for cutting.

       C-w    copies  the  text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer
              and removes the text from the input line.

       Alt-w  copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer.

       C-y    yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

       C-k    kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       Alt-p, Alt-n
              Use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p  takes
              you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

       Alt-C-h, Alt-Backspace
              delete one word backward.

       Alt-Tab
              does  the  filename, command, variable, username and hostname com&#8208;
              pletion for you.


Menu Bar
       The menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top  row
       of  the  screen.  The menu bar has five menus: &quot;Left&quot;, &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Command&quot;,
       &quot;Options&quot; and &quot;Right&quot;.

       The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of  the  left
       and right directory panels.

       The File Menu lists the actions you can perform on the currently selected
       file or the tagged files.

       The Command Menu lists the actions which are more  general  and  bear  no
       relation to the currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The  Options Menu lists the actions which allow you to customize the Mid&#8208;
       night Commander.

  Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus
       The outlook of the directory panels can be  changed  from  the  Left  and
       Right  menus  (they  are  named Above and Below when the horizontal panel
       split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).

    Listing Mode...
       The listing mode view is used to display a listing of  files,  there  are
       four  different listing modes available: Full, Brief, Long and User.  The
       full directory view shows the file name, the size of  the  file  and  the
       modification time.

       The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns (therefore
       showing twice as many files as other views). The long view is similar  to
       the output of ls -l command. The long view takes the whole screen width.

       If  you  choose  the  &quot;User&quot; display format, then you have to specify the
       display format.

       The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may
       be  &quot;half&quot;  or  &quot;full&quot;,  and  they specify a half screen panel and a full
       screen panel respectively.

       After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the  panel,
       this is done by adding the number &quot;2&quot; to the user format string.

       After  this  you  add the name of the fields with an optional size speci&#8208;
       fier.  This are the available fields you may display:

       name   displays the file name.

       size   displays the file size.

       bsize  is an alternative form of the size format. It displays the size of
              the files and for directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.

       type   displays a one character wide type field.  This character is simi&#8208;
              lar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - * for executable
              files,  / for directories, @ for links, = for sockets, - for char&#8208;
              acter devices, + for block devices, | for pipes,  ~  for  symbolic
              links  to  directories and !  for stale symlinks (links that point
              nowhere).

       mark   an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it&apos;s not.

       mtime  file&apos;s last modification time.

       atime  file&apos;s last access time.

       ctime  file&apos;s status change time.

       perm   a string representing the current permission bits of the file.

       mode   an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.

       nlink  the number of links to the file.

       ngid   the GID (numeric).

       nuid   the UID (numeric).

       owner  the owner of the file.

       group  the group of the file.

       inode  the inode of the file.

       Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:

       space  a space in the display format.
&#12;       |      add a vertical line to the display format.

       To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier),  you  just  add  :
       followed  by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the
       number is followed by the symbol +, then the size specifies  the  minimal
       field  size  -  if  the program finds out that there is more space on the
       screen, it will then expand that field.

       For example, the Full display corresponds to this format:

       half type name | size | mtime

       And the Long display corresponds to this format:

       full perm space nlink space owner space  group  space  size  space  mtime
       space name

       This is a nice user display format:

       half name | size:7 | type mode:3

       Panels may also be set to the following modes:

       Info   The  info  view  display  information  related  to  the  currently
              selected file and if possible information about the  current  file
              system.

       Tree   The  tree view is quite similar to the directory tree feature. See
              the section about it for more information.

       Quick View
              In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewer that  dis&#8208;
              plays  the  contents of the currently selected file, if you select
              the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access to
              the usual viewer commands.

    Sort Order...
       The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time, by
       access time, and by inode information  modification  time,  by  size,  by
       inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the sort
       order and you may also specify if you want to sort in  reverse  order  by
       checking the reverse box.

       By  default  directories  are sorted before files but this can be changed
       from the Panel options menu (option Mix all files).

    Filter...
       The filter command allows you to specify a  shell  pattern  (for  example
       *.tar.gz)  which the files must match to be shown. Regardless of the fil&#8208;
       ter pattern, the directories and the  links  to  directories  are  always
       shown in the directory panel.

    Reread
       The  reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is use&#8208;
       ful if other processes have created or removed files.

  File Menu
       The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard  shortcuts  for
       commands  appearing in the file menu.  The escape sequences for the func&#8208;
       tion keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals  with&#8208;
       out  function  key  support,  you  can  achieve the same functionality by
       pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1  through  9  and  0
       (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

       The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parenthe&#8208;
       ses):

       Help (F1)

       Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help  viewer,  you
       can  use  the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to follow
       that link. The keys Space and Backspace are  used  to  move  forward  and
       backward  in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted
       keys.
&#12;       Menu (F2)

       Invoke the user menu.  The user menu provides  an  easy  way  to  provide
       users with a menu and add extra features to the Midnight Commander.

       View (F3, F13)

       View  the  currently  selected file. By default this invokes the Internal
       File Viewer but if the option &quot;Use internal view&quot; is off, it  invokes  an
       external  file  viewer  specified by the VIEWER environment variable.  If
       VIEWER is undefined, the PAGER environment variable is tried.   If  PAGER
       is  also  undefined,  the  &quot;view&quot;  command  is  invoked.   If you use F13
       instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or  pre&#8208;
       processing to the file.

       Filtered View (Alt-!)

       This  command  prompts  for  a  command  and  its arguments (the argument
       defaults to the currently selected file name), the output from such  com&#8208;
       mand is shown in the internal file viewer.

       Edit (F4, F14)

       Press  F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14) to start
       the editor with a new, empty file.  Currently they invoke the vi  editor,
       or the editor specified in the EDITOR environment variable, or the Inter&#8208;
       nal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.

       Copy (F5, F15)

       Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the  currently  selected  file
       (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the direc&#8208;
       tory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The  destination  defaults
       to  the  directory  in the non-selected panel. Space for destination file
       may be preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option.  Dur&#8208;
       ing  this  process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation.  For
       details about source mask (which will be usually  either  *  or  ^\(.*\)$
       depending on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the
       destination see Mask copy/rename.

       F15 (usually F15) is similar,  but  defaults  to  the  directory  in  the
       selected  panel.  It  always operates on the selected file, regardless of
       any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do  the  copy  in  the  background  by
       clicking  on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).
       The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Link (C-x l)

       Create a hard link to the current file.

       Absolute symlink (C-x s)

       Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.

       Relative symLink (C-x v)

       Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.

       To those of you who don&apos;t know what links are: creating a link to a  file
       is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and the des&#8208;
       tination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit
       one  of these files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some
       people call links aliases or shortcuts.

       A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no  way  of
       telling  which  one  is the original and which is the link. If you delete
       either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to
       notice  that  the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you
       don&apos;t even want to know.

       A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file.  If  the
       original  file  is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy
       to notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight Commander
       shows  an  &quot;@&quot;-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to
       somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).  The  origi&#8208;
       nal  file  which  the  link points to is shown on mini-status line if the
       Show mini-status option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you  want  to
       avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links.

       When  you press &quot;C-x s&quot; Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the
       complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a  name  for  the
       link.  You can change either one.

       Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a
       relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory:

       /home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; /home/frodo/new/mc

       A relative link describes the original file&apos;s location starting from  the
       location of the link itself:

       /home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; ../new/mc

       You  can  force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing
       &quot;C-x v&quot; instead of &quot;C-x s&quot;.

       Rename/Move (F6, F16)

       Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the  currently  selected  file
       (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the direc&#8208;
       tory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination  defaults
       to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy
       (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.

       F16 (usually F16) is similar,  but  defaults  to  the  directory  in  the
       selected  panel.  It  always operates on the selected file, regardless of
       any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do  the  copy  in  the  background  by
       clicking  on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).
       The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Mkdir (F7)

       Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.

       Delete (F8)

       Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in  the  currently
       selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the
       operation.

       Quick cd (Alt-c) Use the quick cd command if you have full  command  line
       and want to cd somewhere.

       Select group (+)

       This  is  used  to  select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander
       will prompt for a selection options. When Files only checkbox is on, only
       files  will  be  selected.  If Files only is off, as files as directories
       will be selected.  When  Shell  Patterns  checkbox  is  on,  the  regular
       expression  is  much  like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing
       for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one character). If  Shell
       Patterns  is  off,  then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
       expressions (see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the  selec&#8208;
       tion  will  be  case sensitive characters.  If Case sensitive is off, the
       case will be ignored.

       Unselect group (\)

       Used to unselect a group of files. This is the  opposite  of  the  Select
       group command.

       Quit (F10, Shift-F10)

       Terminate  the  Midnight  Commander.   Shift-F10 is used when you want to
       quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you to
       the  last  directory  you visited with the Midnight Commander, instead it
       will stay at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.

    Quick cd
       This command is useful if you have a full command line  and  want  to  cd
       somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This command
       pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter  after
       cd  on  the  command line and then you press enter. This features all the
       things that are already in the internal cd command.

  Command Menu
       The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.

       The &quot;Find file&quot; command allows you to search for a specific file.

       The &quot;Swap panels&quot; command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.

       The &quot;Switch panels on/off&quot; command shows the output  of  the  last  shell
       command.  This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.

       The &quot;Compare directories&quot; command compares the directory panels with each
       other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make the panels  identi&#8208;
       cal. There are three compare methods. The quick method compares only file
       size and file date. The thorough method makes a  full  byte-by-byte  com&#8208;
       pare.  The  thorough method is not available if the machine does not sup&#8208;
       port the mmap(2) system call.  The size-only compare method just compares
       the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date times, it just
       checks the file size.

       The &quot;External panelize&quot; allows you to execute an  external  program,  and
       make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       The  &quot;Command  history&quot;  command  shows  a  list  of  typed commands. The
       selected command is copied to the command line. The command  history  can
       also be accessed by typing Alt-p or Alt-n.

       The  &quot;Directory  hotlist&quot; command makes changing of the current directory
       to often used directories faster.

       The &quot;Screen list&quot; command shows a dialog window with  the  list  of  cur&#8208;
       rently  running  internal editors, viewers and other MC modules that sup&#8208;
       port this mode.

       The &quot;Edit extension file&quot; command allows you to specify programs to  exe&#8208;
       cuted  when  you try to execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing
       on files with certain extensions (filename endings).

       The &quot;Edit menu file&quot; command may be used for editing the user menu (which
       appears by pressing F2).

    Directory Tree
       The  Directory  Tree  command shows a tree figure of the directories. You
       can select a directory from the figure and the  Midnight  Commander  will
       change to that directory.

       There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is
       available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree  view  from
       the Left or Right menu.

       To  get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree figure
       by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the  directory
       which  you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press
       C-r (or F2).

       You can use the following keys:

       General movement keys are accepted.

       Enter.  In the directory tree, exits the directory tree  and  changes  to
       this  directory  in  the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this
       directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in  the  current
       panel.

       C-r,  F2  (Rescan).  Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure
       is out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories
       which don&apos;t exist any more.

       F3  (Forget).   Delete  this  directory from the tree figure. Use this to
       remove clutter from the figure. If you want the  directory  back  to  the
       tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.

       F4   (Static/Dynamic).    Toggle  between  the  dynamic  navigation  mode
       (default) and the static navigation mode.

       In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to  select
       a directory. All known directories are shown.

       In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select
       a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the  parent  directory,  and
       the  Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and
       children directories are shown, others are  left  out.  The  tree  figure
       changes dynamically as you traverse.

       F5 (Copy).  Copy the directory.

       F6 (RenMov).  Move the directory.

       F7 (Mkdir).  Make a new directory below this directory.

       F8 (Delete).  Delete this directory from the file system.

       C-s,  Alt-s.   Search  the  next directory matching the search string. If
       there is no such directory these keys will move one line down.

       C-h, Backspace.  Delete the last character of the search string.

       Any other character.  Add the character to the search string and move  to
       the  next  directory which starts with these characters. In the tree view
       you must first activate the search  mode  by  pressing  C-s.  The  search
       string is shown in the mini status line.

       The  following  actions  are  available  only in the directory tree. They
       aren&apos;t supported in the tree view.

       F1 (Help).  Invoke the help viewer and show this section.

       Esc, F10.  Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.

       The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See  also  the
       section on mouse support.

    Find File
       The  Find  File feature first asks for the start directory for the search
       and the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree button you  can
       select the start directory from the directory tree figure.

       Option form whole words. Like grep -w.

       You  can  start  the search by pressing the OK button.  During the search
       you can stop from the Stop button and continue from the Start button.

       You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow  keys.  The  Chdir
       button  will  change to the directory of the currently selected file. The
       Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit  but&#8208;
       ton  quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found
       files to the current directory panel so that you can do additional opera&#8208;
       tions  on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). After panelizing you
       can press C-r to return to the normal file listing.

       The &apos;Enable ignore directories&apos; checkbox and input field below  it  allow
       to  set  up the list of directories that should be skip during the search
       files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM  or  on  a
       NFS  directory  that is mounted across a slow link). List components must
       be separated with a colon, here is an example:

       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

       Relative paths are supported also. The following  example  shows  how  to
       skip special directories of version control systems:
       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS
&#12;       Attention:  input  field  can  contain  a dot (.), this means the current
       absolute path.

       You may consider using the External panelize command for some operations.
       Find file command is for simple queries only, while using External panel&#8208;
       ize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.

    External panelize
       The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make
       the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       For  example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the sym&#8208;
       bolic links in the current directory, you can use  external  panelization
       to run the following command:

       find . -type l -print

       Upon  command  completion,  the  directory  contents of the panel will no
       longer be the directory listing of the current  directory,  but  all  the
       files that are symbolic links.

       If  you  want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from
       your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract  the  file  name
       from the transfer log files:

       awk &apos;$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }&apos; &lt; /var/log/xferlog

       You  may  want  to  save often used panelize commands under a descriptive
       name, so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the com&#8208;
       mand on the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name
       under which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just  choose
       that command from the list and do not have to type it again.

    Hotlist
       The  Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories in the
       directory hotlist.  The Midnight Commander will change to  the  directory
       corresponding  to  the  selected label.  From the hotlist dialog, you can
       remove already created label/directory pairs and add new  ones.   To  add
       new  directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command (C-x h),
       which adds the current directory into the directory hotlist, asking  just
       for the label for the directory.

       This  makes  cd  to often used directories faster. You may consider using
       the CDPATH variable as described in internal cd command description.

    Extension File Edit
       This will invoke your editor on the file ~/.config/mc/mc.ext.  The format
       of this file following:

       All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.

       Lines starting in the first column should have following format:

       keyword/expr, i.e. everything after the slash until new line is expr.

       keyword can be:

       shell  -  expr  is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name
              ends with expr.  Example: shell/.tar matches *.tar.

       regex  - expr is a regular expression.  File matches if its name  matches
              the regular expression.

       directory
              - expr is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a directory
              and its name matches the regular expression.

       type   - expr is a regular expression.  File matches  if  the  output  of
              file  %f  without  the  initial  &quot;filename:&quot;  part matches regular
              expression expr.

       default
              - matches any file.  expr is ignored.

       include
              - denotes a common section.  expr is the name of the section.
&#12;       Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format:
       keyword=command  (with no spaces around =), where keyword should be: Open
       (invoked on Enter or double click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or  Include  (to
       add  rules  from the common section).  command is any one-line shell com&#8208;
       mand, with the simple macro substitution.

       Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order  is  important.   If
       the  appropriate  action  is  missing,  search  continues as if this rule
       didn&apos;t match (i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and  View
       action  is  missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View action
       from the second entry will  be  used).   default  should  match  all  the
       actions.

    Background Jobs
       This  lets  you  control  the  state of any background Midnight Commander
       process (only copy and move files operations can be  done  in  the  back&#8208;
       ground).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.

    Menu File Edit
       The  user  menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the
       user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from  the  current
       directory  is  used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root
       and is not world-writable.  If no such file found,  ~/.config/mc/menu  is
       tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu
       /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.

       The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that  start  with  any&#8208;
       thing  but  space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to
       be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should  be  a  let&#8208;
       ter).  All  the  lines  that start with a space or a tab are the commands
       that will be executed when the entry is selected.

       When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied
       to  a  temporary  file  in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and
       then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell con&#8208;
       structs  in  the menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before
       executing the menu code. For more information, see macro substitution.

       Here is a sample mc.menu file:

       A    Dump the currently selected file
            od -c %f

       B    Edit a bug report and send it to root
            I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            vi $I
            mail -s &quot;Midnight Commander bug&quot; root &lt; $I
            rm -f $I

       M    Read mail
            emacs -f rmail

       N    Read Usenet news
            emacs -f gnus

       H    Call the info hypertext browser
            info

       J    Copy current directory to other panel recursively
            tar cf - . | (cd %D &amp;&amp; tar xvpf -)

       K    Make a release of the current subdirectory
            echo -n &quot;Name of distribution file: &quot;
            read tar
            ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
            cd ..
            tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
            tar xzvf %f

       Default Conditions

       Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must  start
       from the first column with a &apos;=&apos; character. If the condition is true, the
       menu entry will be the default entry.

       Condition syntax:   = &lt;sub-cond&gt;
         or:               = &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...
         or:               = &lt;sub-cond&gt; &amp; &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...

       Sub-condition is one of following:

         y &lt;pattern&gt;       syntax of current file matching pattern?
                      (for edit menu only)
         f &lt;pattern&gt;       current file matching pattern?
         F &lt;pattern&gt;       other file matching pattern?
         d &lt;pattern&gt;       current directory matching pattern?
         D &lt;pattern&gt;       other directory matching pattern?
         t &lt;type&gt;          current file of type?
         T &lt;type&gt;          other file of type?
         x &lt;filename&gt;      is it executable filename?
         ! &lt;sub-cond&gt;      negate the result of sub-condition

       Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression,  according  to
       the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the shell
       patterns option by writing &quot;shell_patterns=x&quot; on the first  line  of  the
       menu file (where &quot;x&quot; is either 0 or 1).

       Type is one or more of the following characters:

         n  not a directory
         r  regular file
         d  directory
         l  link
         c  character device
         b  block device
         f  FIFO (pipe)
         s  socket
         x  executable file
         t  tagged

       For  example  &apos;rlf&apos; means either regular file, link or fifo. The &apos;t&apos; type
       is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the file. The
       condition  &apos;=t  t&apos; is true if there are tagged files in the current panel
       and false if not.

       If the condition starts with &apos;=?&apos; instead of &apos;=&apos; a debug  trace  will  be
       shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.

       The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
            = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       is calculated as
            ( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) &amp; (t n)

       Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       L    List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
            gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

       Addition Conditions

       If the condition begins with &apos;+&apos; (or &apos;+?&apos;) instead of &apos;=&apos; (or &apos;=?&apos;) it is
       an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu  entry  will  be
       included  in  the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not
       be included in the menu.

       You can combine default and addition  conditions  by  starting  condition
       with  &apos;+=&apos;  or  &apos;=+&apos;  (or &apos;+=?&apos; or &apos;=+?&apos; if you want debug trace). If you
       want to use two different conditions, one  for  adding  and  another  for
       defaulting,  you  can  precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one
       starting with &apos;+&apos; and another starting with &apos;=&apos;.

       Comments are started with &apos;#&apos;. The additional comment  lines  must  start
       with &apos;#&apos;, space or tab.

  Options Menu
       The Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled on and off in
       several dialogs which are accessible from this menu. Options are  enabled
       if they have an asterisk or &quot;x&quot; in front of them.

       The Configuration command pops up a dialog from which you can change most
       of settings of the Midnight Commander.

       The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you  specify  a  bunch  of
       options how mc looks like on the screen.

       The Panel options command pops up a dialog from which you specify options
       of file manager panels.

       The Confirmation command pops up a dialog from which  you  specify  which
       actions you want to confirm.

       The Display bits command pops up a dialog from which you may select which
       characters is your terminal able to display.

       The Learn keys command pops up a dialog from which  you  test  some  keys
       which are not working on some terminals and you may fix them.

       The  Virtual  FS command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS
       related options.

       The Save setup command saves the current settings of the Left, Right  and
       Options menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.

    Configuration
       The  options in this dialog are divided into several groups: &quot;File opera&#8208;
       tion options&quot;, &quot;Esc key mode&quot;, &quot;Pause after run&quot; and &quot;Other options&quot;.

       File operation options

       Verbose operation.  This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete
       operations  are  verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation).
       If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the  verbose  opera&#8208;
       tion.  It  is  automatically  turned off if the speed of your terminal is
       less than 9600 bps.

       Compute totals.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight  Commander  com&#8208;
       putes  total  byte  sizes  and  total  number of files prior to any Copy,
       Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more  accurate
       progress  bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if
       Verbose operation is disabled.

       Classic progressbar.  If this  option  is  enabled,  the  progressbar  of
       Copy/Move/Delete  operations  is always grown form left to right. If dis&#8208;
       abled, the growing direction  of  progressbar  follows  to  direction  of
       Copy/Move/Delete  operation: from left panel to right one and vice versa.
       Enabled by default.

       Mkdir autoname When you press F7 to create a  new  directory,  the  input
       line  in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or directory
       in active panel.  Disabled by default.

       Preallocate space Preallocate space for whole target file,  if  possible,
       before copy operation.  Disabled by default.

       Esc key mode.

       By  default  the  Midnight  Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix.
       Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is
       a possibility to use a single press of ESC key for that action.

       Single  press.   By default this option is disabled. If you&apos;ll enable it,
       the ESC key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see  Time&#8208;
       out option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is
       interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).

       Timeout.  This options is used to setup the time interval  (in  microsec&#8208;
       onds)  for single press of ESC key. By default, this inrerval is one sec&#8208;
       ond (1000000  microseconds).  Also  the  timeout  can  be  set  via  KEY&#8208;
       BOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US  environment  variable (also in microseconds), which
       has higher priority than Timeout option value.

       Pause after run

       After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander can pause, so  that
       you can examine the output of the command.  There are three possible set&#8208;
       tings for this variable:
&#12;       Never.  Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If
       you  are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able
       to see the output of the command by typing C-o.

       Ondumbterminals.  You will get the pause message on  terminals  that  are
       not  capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any ter&#8208;
       minal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).

       Always.  The program will pause after executing all of your commands.

       Other options

       Use internal editor.  If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor
       is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in
       the EDITOR environment variable is used.  If no editor is  specified,  vi
       is used.  See the section on the internal file editor.

       Use internal viewer.  If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer
       is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified  in
       the  PAGER  environment  variable is used.  If no pager is specified, the
       view command is used.  See the section on the internal file viewer.

       Auto menus.  If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked  at
       startup.  Useful for building menus for non-unixers.

       Drop  down  menus.  When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will
       be activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise,  you  will  only
       get  the  menu  title, and you will have to activate the menu either with
       the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if  you  are  using
       hotkeys.

       Shell Patterns.  By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will
       use shell-like regular expressions. The following  conversions  are  per&#8208;
       formed to achieve this: the &apos;*&apos; is replaced by &apos;.*&apos; (zero or more charac&#8208;
       ters); the &apos;?&apos;  is replaced by &apos;.&apos; (exactly one character) and &apos;.&apos; by the
       literal  dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are
       the ones described in ed(1).

       Complete: show all.  By default the Midnight Commander pops up all possi&#8208;
       ble  completions  if  the  completion  is  ambiguous  only when you press
       Alt-Tab for the second time.  For the first time, it  just  completes  as
       much  as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option
       if you want to see all possible completions even after  pressing  Alt-Tab
       the first time.

       Rotating dash.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a
       rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indicator.

       Cd follows links.  This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander  to
       follow  the  logical chain of directories when changing current directory
       either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behav&#8208;
       ior  of  bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the real direc&#8208;
       tory structure, so cd .. if you&apos;ve entered that directory through a  link
       will  move  you  to  the  current  directory&apos;s real parent and not to the
       directory where the link was present.

       Safe delete.  If this option is enabled,  deleting  files  and  directory
       hotlist  entries  unintentionally  becomes  more  difficult.  The default
       selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from &quot;Yes&quot;  to
       &quot;No&quot;.  This option is disabled by default.

       Auto  save  setup.  If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight
       Commander the configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in
       the ~/.config/mc/ini file.

    Layout
       The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout of
       screen. The options in this  dialog  are  divided  into  several  groups:
       &quot;Panel split&quot;, &quot;Console output&quot; and &quot;Other options&quot;.

       Panel split

       The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You can
       specify whether the area is split to the panels in Vertical
        or Horizontal  direction.  Panel  layout  can  be  changed  using  Alt-,
       (Alt-comma) shortcut.
&#12;       Equal  split.  By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you
       can specify an unequal split.

       Console output

       On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are  shown
       in the output window. This option is available if Midnight Commander runs
       on native console only.

       Other options

       Menu bar visible.  If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is  always
       visible on the top row of screen above panels. Enabled by default.

       Command  prompt.   If  enabled,  command  line  is  avalable.  Enabled by
       default.

       Keybar visible.  If enabled, 10 lables associated with  F1-F10  keys  are
       located at the bottom row of screen. Enabled by default.

       Hintbar  visible.   If enabled, the one-line hints are visible below pan&#8208;
       els. Enabled by default.

       XTerm window title.  When run in a terminal emulator  for  X11,  Midnight
       Commander sets the terminal window title to the current working directory
       and updates it when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is  broken  and
       you  see  some incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off
       this option.  Enabled by default.

       Show free space.  If enabled, free space and total space of current  file
       system is shown at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default.

    Panel options
       Main panel options

       Show  mini-status.   If enabled, one line of status information about the
       currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels. Enabled  by
       default.

       Use  SI  size  units.  If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will
       use SI units (powers of 1000) when displaying any byte  sizes.  The  suf&#8208;
       fixes (k, m ...) are shown in lowercase.  If disabled (default), Midnight
       Commander will use binary units (powers of 1024)  and  the  suffixes  are
       shown in upper case (K, M ...)

       Mix  all files.  If this option is enabled, all files and directories are
       shown mixed together.  If the option is desabled  (default),  directories
       (and links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and
       other files below.

       Show backup files.  If enabled, the Midnight Commander  will  show  files
       ending  with  a  tilde.   Otherwise,  they  won&apos;t be shown (like GNU&apos;s ls
       option -B). Enabled by default.

       Show hidden files.  If enabled, the  Midnight  Commander  will  show  all
       files that start with a dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default.

       Fast directory reload.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander
       will use a trick to determine if the  directory  contents  have  changed.
       The  trick is to reload the directory only if the i-node of the directory
       has changed; this means that reloads only happen when files  are  created
       or  deleted.   If  what changes is the i-node for a file in the directory
       (file size changes, mode or  owner  changes,  etc)  the  display  is  not
       updated.   In  these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan
       the directory manually (with C-r). Disabled by default.

       Mark moves down.  If enabled, the selection bar will move down  when  you
       mark a file (with Insert key). Enabled by default.

       Reverse  files  only.   Allow  revert selection of files only. Enabled by
       default.  If enabled, the reverse selection is applied to files only, not
       to  directories.   The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the
       reverse selection is applied to files as well to directories:  all  unse&#8208;
       lected items become selected, and vice versa.

       Simple swap.  If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means that
       panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become  right  one,  and
       vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange its
       content keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.

       Auto save panels setup.  If this option is enabled,  when  you  exit  the
       Midnight  Commander  the  current  settings  of  panels  are saved in the
       ~/.config/mc/panels.ini file.  Disabled by default.

       Navigation

       Lynx-like motion.  If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys
       to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the
       shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.

       Page scrolling.  If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the dis&#8208;
       play  when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, oth&#8208;
       erwise it will just scroll a file at a time.

       Mouse page scrolling.  Controls whenever scrolling with the  mouse  wheel
       is done by pages or line by line on the panels.

       File highlight

       You  can specify whether permissions and file types should be highlighted
       with distinctive Colors.  If the permission highlighting is enabled,  the
       parts of the perm and mode display fields which apply to the user running
       Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color defined by the selected
       keyword.   If  the file type highlighting is enabled, file names are col&#8208;
       ored according to rules described in /etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file.  See
       Filenames Highlight for more info.

       Quick search

       You  can  specify  how  the Quick search mode should works: case insensi&#8208;
       tively, case sensitively or be matched to the the panel sort order:  case
       sensitive or not.

    Confirmation
       In  this dialog you configure the confirmation options for file deletion,
       overwriting files, execution by pressing  enter,  quitting  the  program,
       directory hotlist entries deletion and history cleanup.
        and.

    Display bits
       This  is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen.
       This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses  supports  only  seven
       output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map
       and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8 bit  char&#8208;
       acters.

    Learn keys
       This  dialog  allows  you  to  test  and redefine functional keys, cursor
       arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on  your  terminal.
       They often don&apos;t, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.

       You  can  move  around  with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys (&apos;h&apos;
       left, &apos;j&apos; down, &apos;k&apos; up and &apos;l&apos; right).  Once you press any  cursor  move&#8208;
       ment key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.

       You  can  test  keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a key
       and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of  that
       key.   Once  a  key  is  marked  OK it starts working as usually, e.g. F1
       pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works,  but  after
       that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.  The Tab key
       should be working always.

       If some keys do not work properly then you  won&apos;t  see  OK  appear  after
       pressing  one  of  these.   Then  you  may want to redefine it.  Do it by
       pressing the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or  by
       Enter  or  Space  after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a
       message box will appear asking you to press that key.   Do  it  and  wait
       until  the  message  box  disappears.   If  you want to abort, just press
       Escape once and wait.

       When you finish with all the keys, you can Save  them.   The  definitions
       for  the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM]
       section of your ~/.config/mc/ini file (where TERM is  the  name  of  your
       current terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working
       properly are not saved.

    Virtual FS
       This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File  Sys&#8208;
       tem.

       The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of
       the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the  file
       system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).

       Also,  in  order to access the contents of compressed files (for example,
       compressed tar files) the Midnight Commander needs  to  create  temporary
       uncompressed files on your disk.

       Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take
       up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached  informa&#8208;
       tion  to  decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access
       to frequently used file systems.

       Because of the format of the tar archives, the Tar  filesystem  needs  to
       read  the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most tar files
       are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in  extinction),
       the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary
       location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.

       Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over  the  disk,
       it&apos;s  common  that  you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it later.
       Since decompression is slow, the Midnight Commander will cache the infor&#8208;
       mation  in  memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all the
       resources associated with the file  system  are  released.   The  default
       timeout is set to one minute.

       The  FTP  File  System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote
       FTP servers.  It has several options.

       ftp anonymous password is the password used when  you  login  as  &quot;anony&#8208;
       mous&quot;.   Some  sites  require a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand,
       you probably don&apos;t want to give your real  e-mail  address  to  untrusted
       sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.

       ftpfs  keeps  the  directory  listing  it  fetches from a FTP server in a
       cache.  The cache expire time is configurable with  the  ftpfs  directory
       cache  timeout  option.   A low value for this option may slow down every
       operation on the ftpfs because every operation would  require  sending  a
       request to the FTP server.

       You  can  define  an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern
       firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below),  so
       FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

       If  Always  use ftp proxy is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to
       enable proxy for certain hosts.  See FTP File System for examples.

       If this option is set, the  program  will  do  two  things:  consult  the
       /usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy  file  for  lines  containing host names that are
       local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a  domain)
       and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly
       accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the  specified  FTP
       proxy.

       You can enable using ~/.netrc file, which keeps login names and passwords
       for ftp servers.  See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc format.

       Use passive mode enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection  for
       data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server.  This option
       is recommended and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the
       data  connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some
       firewalls.

    Save Setup
       At startup the Midnight Commander will try to load initialization  infor&#8208;
       mation  from  the  ~/.config/mc/ini  file. If this file doesn&apos;t exist, it
       will load  the  information  from  the  system-wide  configuration  file,
       located  in  /usr/share/mc/mc.ini.  If the system-wide configuration file
       doesn&apos;t exist, MC uses the default settings.

       The Save Setup command creates the ~/.config/mc/ini file  by  saving  the
       current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus.

       If  you activate the auto save setup option, MC will always save the cur&#8208;
       rent settings when exiting.

       There also exist settings which can&apos;t  be  changed  from  the  menus.  To
       change  these settings you have to edit the setup file with your favorite
       editor. See the section on Special Settings for more information.


Executing operating system commands
       You may execute commands by typing them directly in the Midnight  Comman&#8208;
       der&apos;s  input  line,  or by selecting the program you want to execute with
       the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter.

       If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, the Midnight  Com&#8208;
       mander  checks  the extension of the selected file against the extensions
       in the Extensions File.  If a match is found  then  the  code  associated
       with  that  extension  is  executed.  A very simple macro expansion takes
       place before executing the command.

  The cd internal command
       The cd command is interpreted by the Midnight Commander, it is not passed
       to  the  command  shell for execution.  Thus it may not handle all of the
       nice macro expansion and substitution that your shell does,  although  it
       does some of them:

       Tilde  substitution.   The  (~) will be substituted with your home direc&#8208;
       tory, if you append a username after the tilde, then it will  be  substi&#8208;
       tuted with the login directory of the specified user.

       For  example,  ~guest  is  the  home  directory for the user guest, while
       ~/guest is the directory guest in your home directory.

       Previous directory.  You can jump to the directory you were previously by
       using the special directory name &apos;-&apos; like this: cd -

       CDPATH  directories.  If the directory specified to the cd command is not
       in the current directory, then The Midnight Commander uses the  value  in
       the environment variable CDPATH to search for the directory in any of the
       named directories.

       For example you could set your CDPATH variable to ~/src:/usr/src,  allow&#8208;
       ing  you  to  change  your directory to any of the directories inside the
       ~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place  in  the  file  system  by
       using  its  relative  name  (for  example  cd  linux  could  take  you to
       /usr/src/linux).

  Macro Substitution
       When accessing a user menu, or executing an extension dependent  command,
       or  running a command from the command line input, a simple macro substi&#8208;
       tution takes place.

       The macros are:

       %i     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column position.   For
              edit menu only.

       %y     The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.

       %k     The block file name.

       %e     The error file name.

       %m     The current menu name.

       %f and %p
              The current file name.

       %x     The extension of current file name.

       %b     The current file name without extension.

       %d     The current directory name.

       %F     The current file in the unselected panel.
&#12;       %D     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       %t     The currently tagged files.

       %T     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       %u and %U
              Similar  to  the  %t  and %T macros, but in addition the files are
              untagged.  You can use this macro only once per menu file entry or
              extension  file  entry,  because next time there will be no tagged
              files.

       %s and %S
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are  any.  Otherwise
              the current file.

       %cd    This  is a special macro that is used to change the current direc&#8208;
              tory to the directory specified in front of it.  This is used pri&#8208;
              marily as an interface to the Virtual File System.

       %view  This  macro is used to invoke the internal viewer.  This macro can
              be used alone, or with arguments.  If you pass  any  arguments  to
              this macro, they should be enclosed in brackets.

              The  arguments are: ascii to force the viewer into ascii mode; hex
              to force the viewer into hex mode; nroff to tell the  viewer  that
              it  should  interpret  the  bold and underline sequences of nroff;
              unformatted to tell the viewer to not interpret nroff commands for
              making the text bold or underlined.

       %%     The % character

       %{some text}
              Prompt  for  the  substitution. An input box is shown and the text
              inside the braces is used as a prompt. The macro is substituted by
              the  text typed by the user. The user can press ESC or F10 to can&#8208;
              cel. This macro doesn&apos;t work on the command line yet.

       %var{ENV:default}
              If environment variable ENV is unset, the default is  substituted.
              Otherwise, the value of ENV is substituted.

  The subshell support
       The  subshell  support  is  a  compile  time  option, that works with the
       shells: bash, tcsh and zsh.

       When the subshell code is activated the Midnight Commander will  spawn  a
       concurrent  copy of your shell (the one defined in the SHELL variable and
       if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in
       a  pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you execute
       a command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed
       it.   This also allows you to change the environment variables, use shell
       functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit  the  Midnight
       Commander.

       If  you  are using bash you can specify startup commands for the subshell
       in your ~/.local/share/mc/bashrc file and special keyboard  maps  in  the
       ~/.local/share/mc/inputrc  file.  tcsh users may specify startup commands
       in the ~/.local/share/mc/tcshrc file.

       When the subshell code is used, you can suspend applications at any  time
       with  the  sequence  C-o  and jump back to the Midnight Commander, if you
       interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other external com&#8208;
       mands until you quit the application you interrupted.

       An extra added feature of using the subshell is that the prompt displayed
       by the Midnight Commander is the same prompt that you are currently using
       in your shell.

       The  OPTIONS section has more information on how you can control the sub&#8208;
       shell code.

Chmod
       The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits in a group of files
       and directories.  It can be invoked with the C-x c key combination.

       The Chmod window has two parts - Permissions and File.

       In  the  File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and
       its permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and group.

       In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons  which  corre&#8208;
       spond  to the file attribute bits.  As you change the attribute bits, you
       can see the octal value change in the File section.

       To move between the widgets (buttons and check  buttons)  use  the  arrow
       keys  or  the  Tab  key.   To change the state of the check buttons or to
       select a button use Space.  You can also use the hotkeys on  the  buttons
       to  quickly  activate  them.  Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters on
       the buttons.

       To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

       When working with a group of files or directories, you just click on  the
       bits  you want to set or clear.  Once you have selected the bits you want
       to change, you select one of the action  buttons  (Set  marked  or  Clear
       marked).

       Finally,  to  set  the attributes exactly to those specified, you can use
       the [Set all] button, which will act on all the tagged files.

       [Marked all] set only marked attributes to all selected files

       [Set marked] set marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Clean marked] clear marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Set] set the attributes of one file

       [Cancel] cancel the Chmod command

Chown
       The Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a  file.  The  hot
       key for this command is C-x o.

Advanced Chown
       The  Advanced  Chown command is the Chmod and Chown command combined into
       one window. You can change the permissions and owner/group  of  files  at
       once.

File Operations
       When you copy, move or delete files the Midnight Commander shows the file
       operations dialog.  It shows the files currently being processed and uses
       up  to three progress bars.  The file bar indicates the percentage of the
       current file that has been processed so far.  The  count  bar  shows  how
       many  of the tagged files have been handled.  The bytes bar indicates the
       percentage of the total size of the tagged files that has  been  handled.
       If the verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not shown.

       There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip but&#8208;
       ton will skip the rest of the current file.  Pressing  the  Abort  button
       will abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.

       There  are  three  other  dialogs  which you can run into during the file
       operations.

       The error dialog informs about error conditions and  has  three  choices.
       Normally  you select either the Skip button to skip the file or the Abort
       button to abort the operation altogether.  You can also select the  Retry
       button if you fixed the problem from another terminal.

       The  replace  dialog  is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on
       the top of an existing file.  The dialog shows the dates and sizes of the
       both files.  Press the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No button to
       skip the file, the All button to overwrite all the files, the None button
       to  never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the source file
       is newer than the target file.  You can  abort  the  whole  operation  by
       pressing the Abort button.

       The  recursive  delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory
       which is not empty.  Press the Yes button to delete the directory  recur&#8208;
       sively, the No button to skip the directory, the All button to delete all
       the directories and the None button to skip all  the  non-empty  directo&#8208;
       ries.   You  can  abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button.
       If you selected the Yes or All button you will be asked for  a  confirma&#8208;
       tion.   Type  &quot;yes&quot; only if you are really sure you want to do the recur&#8208;
       sive delete.

       If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the  files
       on  which  the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files
       are left tagged.

Mask Copy/Rename
       The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an  easy
       way.   To  do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and usually
       in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.  All  the
       files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target
       mask.  If there are tagged files, only  the  tagged  files  matching  the
       source mask are renamed.

       There are other options which you can set:

       Follow links

       determines  whether  make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source direc&#8208;
       tory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or
       whether would you like to copy their content.

       Dive into subdirs

       determines  the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied,
       but the target directory already exists.  The default action is  to  copy
       the contents of the source directory into the target directory.  Enabling
       this option causes copying the source directory itself  into  the  target
       directory.

       For  example,  you  want  to  copy  directory /foo containing file bar to
       /bla/foo, which is an already existing directory.   Normally  (when  Dive
       into  subdirs  is  not  set),  mc  would copy file /foo/bar into the file
       /bla/foo/bar.  By enabling this option the /bla/foo/foo directory will be
       created, and /foo/bar will be copied into /bla/foo/foo/bar.

       Preserve attributes

       determines  whether  to  preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you
       are root) the ownership of the original files.  If  this  option  is  not
       set, the current value of the umask will be respected.

       Use shell patterns

       When  this  option  is  on  you  can use the &apos;*&apos; and &apos;?&apos; wildcards in the
       source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the target mask only
       the  &apos;*&apos;  and &apos;\&lt;digit&gt;&apos; wildcards are allowed. The first &apos;*&apos; wildcard in
       the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard  group  in  the  source
       mask, the second &apos;*&apos; corresponds to the second group and so on.  The &apos;\1&apos;
       wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask,  the
       &apos;\2&apos; wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to
       &apos;\9&apos;.  The &apos;\0&apos; wildcard is the whole filename of the source file.

       Two examples:

       If the source mask is &quot;*.tar.gz&quot;, the destination is &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the
       file to be copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be &quot;foo.tgz&quot; in &quot;/bla&quot;.

       Suppose  you  want  to swap basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot; would
       become &quot;c.file&quot; and so on.  The source mask for this  is  &quot;*.*&quot;  and  the
       destination is &quot;\2.\1&quot;.

       Use shell patterns off

       When  the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn&apos;t do automatic group&#8208;
       ing anymore. You must use &apos;\(...\)&apos; expressions in  the  source  mask  to
       specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexi&#8208;
       ble but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar  to
       the situation when the shell patterns option is on.

       Two examples:

       If   the   source   mask   is  &quot;^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$&quot;,  the  destination  is
       &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will  be
       &quot;/bla/foo.tgz&quot;.

       Let&apos;s  suppose  you  want to swap basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot;
       will  become  &quot;c.file&quot;  and  so  on.  The  source  mask   for   this   is
       &quot;^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$&quot; and the destination is &quot;\2.\1&quot;.

       Case Conversions

       You  can  also change the case of the filenames.  If you use &apos;\u&apos; or &apos;\l&apos;
       in the target mask, the next character will be converted to uppercase  or
       lowercase correspondingly.

       If  you  use &apos;\U&apos; or &apos;\L&apos; in the target mask, the next characters will be
       converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the  next  &apos;\E&apos;
       or next &apos;\U&apos;, &apos;\L&apos; or the end of the file name.

       The &apos;\u&apos; and &apos;\l&apos; are stronger than &apos;\U&apos; and &apos;\L&apos;.

       For  example,  if  the  source  mask  is  &apos;*&apos; ( Use shell patterns on) or
       &apos;^\(.*\)$&apos; ( Use shell patterns off) and the target mask is  &apos;\L\u*&apos;  the
       file  names  will  be  converted to have initial upper case and otherwise
       lower case.

       You can also use &apos;\&apos; as a quote character. For example, &apos;\\&apos; is  a  back&#8208;
       slash and &apos;\*&apos; is an asterisk.

       Stable symlinks

       commands  Midnight  Commander, that it should change symlinks in the tar&#8208;
       get, so that they&apos;ll point to the same location as it  did  before.  With
       absolute  symbolic  links  this  does nothing, but if you have a relative
       one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and  other  direc&#8208;
       tory  parts  and  making  the  value  as  short  as possible (most modern
       filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus don&apos;t  waste  much
       disk space).


Select/Unselect Files
       The  dialog  of  group  of files and directories selection or uselection.
       The input line allow enter the regular expression of filenames that  will
       be selected/unselected.

       When  Files  only  checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If Files
       only is off, as files as directories will be selected.  When  Shell  Pat&#8208;
       terns  checkbox  is  on, the regular expression is much like the filename
       globbing in the shell (* standing for  zero  or  more  characters  and  ?
       standing  for  one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
       of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When  Case
       sensitive  checkbox  is  on, the selection will be case sensitive charac&#8208;
       ters.  If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

Internal Diff Viewer
       The mcdiff is a visual diff tool. You can compare two files and edit them
       in-place (diffs are updated dynamically). You can browse and view a work&#8208;
       ing copy from popular version control systems (GIT, Subversion, etc).

       Following shortcuts are available in internal  diff  viewer  of  Midnight
       Commander.

Internal File Viewer
       The  internal  file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex.  To
       toggle between modes, use the F4 key.

       The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your system or the
       file  type  to  display the information.  Some character sequences, which
       appear most often in preformatted manual pages, are  displayed  bold  and
       underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.

       When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and constant
       numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly after  removing  the  quotes.
       Each  number  matches  one  byte.  You can mix quoted text with constants
       like this:

       &quot;String&quot; -1 0xBB 012 &quot;more text&quot;

       Note that 012 is an octal number.  -1 is converted to 0xFF.

       Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that  the  Mid&#8208;
       night Commander handles in the internal file viewer.

       F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

       F2 Toggle the wrap mode.

       F4 Toggle the hex mode.

       F5  Goto  line.   This will prompt you for a line number and will display
       that line.

       F6, /.  Regular expression search.

       ?, Reverse regular expression search.

       F7 Normal search / hex mode search.

       sion else find next match.

       C-r.   Start  reverse  search  if there was no previous search expression
       else find next match.

       F8 Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as found on disk or if
       a  processing filter has been specified in the mc.ext file, then the out&#8208;
       put from the filter. Current mode is always the other than written on the
       button  label,  since  on  the button is the mode which you enter by that
       key.

       F9 Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode  is  on  the  viewer
       will interpret some string sequences to show bold and underline with dif&#8208;
       ferent colors. Also, on button label is the other mode than current.

       F10, Esc.  Exit the internal file viewer.

       C-b Jump to the previous file.

       Alt-r Toggle the ruler.

       Alt-e to change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e).   Recoding
       is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recod&#8208;
       ing you may select &quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; in charset selection dialog.

       It&apos;s possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look  at
       the Extension File Edit section


Internal File Editor
       The  internal  file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can
       edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files.  The
       internal  file editor is invoked using F4 if the use_internal_edit option
       is set in the initialization file.

       The features it presently supports are: block copy,  move,  delete,  cut,
       paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro commands;
       regular expression search and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting  (if
       supported  by  the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoin&#8208;
       dent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file  types;  and
       an  option  to  pipe  text  blocks through shell commands like indent and
       ispell.

       Sections:

              Options of editor in ini-file

       The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys
       do  what,  just  consult  the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are:
       Shift movement keys do text highlighting.  Ctrl-Ins copies  to  the  file
       mcedit.clip  and  Shift-Ins  pastes  from mcedit.clip.  Shift-Del cuts to
       mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted  text.  Mouse  highlighting
       also  works,  and you can override the mouse as usual by holding down the
       shift key while dragging the mouse to let  normal  terminal  mouse  high&#8208;
       lighting work.

       To  define  a  macro,  press Ctrl-R and then type out the key strokes you
       want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R  again  when  finished.  You  can  then
       assign  the  macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is
       executed when you press Ctrl-A and then the assigned key.  The  macro  is
       also  executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, pro&#8208;
       vided that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined,  the
       macro  commands  go  into the file ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros
       You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file.

       To change charset of displayed text may use  M-e  (Alt-e).   Recoding  is
       made  from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding
       you may select &quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; in charset selection dialog.

       F19 will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or C  or  C++
       code     or    another).    This    is    controlled    by    the    file
       /usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc       which       is        copied        to
       ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc  in your home directory the first
       time you use it.

       The editor also displays non-us characters (160+).  When  editing  binary
       files,  you should set display bits to 7 bits in the options menu to keep
       the spacing clean.


Options of editor in ini-file
       Some editor options of ini-file are described in this  section.   Options
       are placed in [Midnight-Commander] section

       editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
              Search  autocomplete  candidates  in  entire  of file or just from
              begin of file to cursor position (0)


Screen selector
       Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules (such  as  edi&#8208;
       tor,  viewer  and  diff viewer) simultaneously and switching between them
       without closing open files. Using several file managers at a  time,  how&#8208;
       ever, is not currently supported.

       Let&apos;s call each of these modules a screen. There are three ways to switch
       between screens, using one of these global shortcuts:

       Alt-}  switch to the next screen;

       Alt-{  switch to the previous screen;

       Alt-`  open a dialog window with the list of currently open  screens  (or
              use the &quot;Screen list&quot; menu item).

Completion
       Let the Midnight Commander type for you.

       Attempt  to  perform  completion on the text before current position.  MC
       attempts completion treating the text as variable  (if  the  text  begins
       with  $),  username  (if  the  text begins with ~), hostname (if the text
       begins with @) or command (if you are on the command line in the position
       where  you  might type a command, possible completions then include shell
       reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.  If none  of
       these matches, filename completion is attempted.

       Filename,  username,  variable and hostname completion works on all input
       lines, command completion is command line specific.  If the completion is
       ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the fol&#8208;
       lowing action depends on the setting of the Complete: show all option  in
       the  Configuration dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities
       pops up next to the current position and you can select  with  the  arrow
       keys and Enter the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in
       which the possibilities differ to move to a subset of  all  possibilities
       and  complete  as much as possible.  If you press Alt-Tab again, only the
       subset will be shown in the  listbox,  otherwise  the  first  item  which
       matches  all  the  previous  characters  will be highlighted.  As soon as
       there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by  cancel&#8208;
       ing keys Esc, F10 and left and right arrow keys. If Complete: show all is
       disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press  Alt-Tab  for  the  second
       time, for the first time MC just beeps.

Virtual File System
       The  Midnight  Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file
       system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch.   The
       virtual  file  system  switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipulate
       files not located on the Unix file system.

       Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File  Sys&#8208;
       tems  (VFS):  the  local file system, used for accessing the regular Unix
       file system; the ftpfs, used to manipulate files on remote  systems  with
       the  FTP  protocol;  the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar
       files; the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on  ext2  file  systems
       (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for manipulating files
       over shell connections such as rsh and ssh).  If the  code  was  compiled
       with  smbfs  support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the
       SMB (CIFS) protocol.

       A generic extfs (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided  in  order  to
       easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.

       The  VFS  switch  code will interpret all of the path names used and will
       forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of
       the file systems is described later in their own section.

  FTP File System
       The  FTP  File  System  (ftpfs)  allows you to manipulate files on remote
       machines.  To actually use it, you can use the FTP link item in the  menu
       or  directly change your current directory using the cd command to a path
       name that looks like this:

       ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]

       The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify  the
       user  element, the Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as
       that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login  name  from
       the  ~/.netrc  file.   The optional pass element is the password used for
       the connection.  Using the password in the VFS directory name is not rec&#8208;
       ommended,  because  it  can appear on the screen in clear text and can be
       saved to the directory history.

       To enable using FTP proxy, prepend !  (an exclamation sign) to the  host&#8208;
       name.

       Examples:

           ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
           ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub
           ftp://guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
           ftp://miguel:xxx@server/pub

       Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for ftpfs options.

  Tar File System
       The  tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar files
       and compressed tar files by using the  chdir  command.   To  change  your
       directory  to  a  tar  file, you change your current directory to the tar
       file by using the following syntax:

       /filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]

       The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for  tar  files,  this  means
       that  usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter into
       the tar file, see the Extension File Edit section for details on how this
       is done.

       Examples:

           mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
           /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://

       The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.

  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem
       The  fish  file  system is a network based file system that allows you to
       manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were  local.  To  use
       this,  the  other  side  has  to  either  run fish server, or has to have
       bash-compatible shell.

       To connect to a remote machine, you just need to  chdir  into  a  special
       directory which name is in the following format:

       sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]

       The  user,  options and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify
       the user element, the Midnight Commander will try to login on the  remote
       machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

       The available options are:
         &apos;C&apos; - use compression;
         &apos;r&apos; - use rsh instead of ssh;
         port - specify the port used by remote server.
       If  the  remote-dir  element  is  present,  your current directory on the
       remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
           sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
           sh://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
           sh://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private

  Undelete File System
       On Linux systems, if you asked  configure  to  use  the  ext2fs  undelete
       facilities,  you  will have the undelete file system available.  Recovery
       of deleted files is only available on ext2 file  systems.   The  undelete
       file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve all of
       the deleted files names on an ext2fs and  provides  and  to  extract  the
       selected files into a regular partition.

       To  use  this  file  system, you have to chdir into the special file name
       formed by the &quot;undel://&quot; prefix and the file name where the  actual  file
       system resides.

       For  example,  to  recover  deleted  files on the second partition of the
       first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:

           undel://sda2

       It may take a while for the undelfs  to  load  the  required  information
       before you start browsing files there.

  SMB File System
       The  smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote machines with SMB (or
       CIFS) protocol.  These include Windows for Workgroups, Windows  9x/ME/XP,
       Windows  NT,  Windows 2000 and Samba.  To actually use it, you may try to
       use the panel command &quot;SMB link...&quot;  (accessible from the menubar) or you
       may  directly change your current directory to it using the cd command to
       a path name that looks like this:

       smb://[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]

       The user, service and remote-dir elements are optional.  The user, domain
       and password can be specified in an input dialog.

       Examples:

           smb://machine/Share
           smb://other_machine
           smb://guest@machine/Public/Irlex

  EXTernal File System
       extfs  allows  you to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU
       Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.

       Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:

       1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated  with  any  existing
       file.   They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree.  You
       can invoke them by typing &apos;cd fsname://&apos; where fsname is an  extfs  short
       name (see below).  Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio
       tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).

       For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type

         cd audio://

       2. &apos;Archive&apos; filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and  more),  which  represent
       contents  of  a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of &apos;real&apos; files
       compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a
       mailbox  (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such filesys&#8208;
       tems &apos;fsname://&apos; should be appended to the archive name.  Note  that  the
       archive itself can be on another vfs.

       For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type

         cd documents.zip/uzip://

       In  many  aspects,  you  could treat extfs like any other directory.  For
       instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to  it  from  directory
       history.   An  important  limitation is that you cannot invoke shell com&#8208;
       mands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.

       Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:

       a      access &apos;A:&apos; DOS/Windows diskette (cd a://).

       apt    front end to Debian&apos;s APT package management system (cd apt://).

       audio  audio CD ripping and playing (cd audio:// or cd device/audio://).

       bpp    package   of    Bad    Penguin    GNU/Linux    distribution    (cd
              file.bpp/bpp://).

       deb    package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.deb/deb://).

       dpkg   Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (cd deb://).

       hp48   view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (cd hp48://).

       lslR   browsing  of  lslR  listings  as  found  on  many  FTPs  (cd file&#8208;
              name/lslR://).

       mailfs mbox-style mailbox files support (cd mailbox/mailfs://).

       patchfs
              extfs  to   handle   unified   and   context   diffs   (cd   file&#8208;

       You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the
       Extension  File  Edit section.  Here is an example entry for Debian pack&#8208;

Colors
       The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports color
       using  the  terminal  database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it gets
       confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the  -c
       and -b flag respectively.

       If  the  program  is  compiled  with  the Slang screen manager instead of
       ncurses, it will also check the variable COLORTERM, if it is set, it  has
       the same effect as the -c flag.

       You  may  specify  terminals  that  always force color mode by adding the
       color_terminals variable to the  Colors  section  of  the  initialization
       file.   This will prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect if
       your terminal supports color.  Example:

       [Colors]
       color_terminals=linux,xterm
       color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

       The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does not
       provide  a  way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in
       the terminal database.

       The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors.  Cur&#8208;
       rently   the   colors  are  configured  using  the  environment  variable
       MC_COLOR_TABLE or the Colors section in the initialization file.

       In the  Colors  section,  the  default  color  map  is  loaded  from  the
       base_color variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a termi&#8208;
       nal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=
       xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

       The format for the color definition is:

         &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=...

       The colors are optional, and the keywords  are:  normal,  selected,  dis&#8208;
       abled, marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged, com&#8208;
       mandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory.  But&#8208;
       ton  bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar.
       Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel,  menuinactive.
       Dialog  colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus, dtitle. Error
       dialog colors are:  errdfocus,  errdhotnormal,  errdhotfocus,  errdtitle.
       Help  colors  are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink,
       helptitle.  Viewer  color  are:  viewbold,  viewunderline,  viewselected.
       Editor  colors  are:  editnormal,  editbold,  editmarked, editwhitespace,
       editlinestate.  Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel, pmenutitle.

       header determines the color of panel header, the line that contains  col&#8208;
       umn titles and sort mode indicator.

       input determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.

       gauge  determines  the  color  of  the  filled  part  of the progress bar
       (gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file  operations,
       such as copying.

       disabled determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.

       The dialog boxes use the following colors: dnormal is used for the normal
       text, dfocus is the color used  for  the  currently  selected  component,
       dhotnormal  is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal
       components, whereas the dhotfocus color is used for the highlighted color
       in the currently selected component.

       Menus  use  the  same  scheme  but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot,
       menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead.

       Help uses the following colors: helpnormal is used for normal text,  hel&#8208;
       pitalic  is  used  for  text  which is emphasized in italic in the manual
       page, helpbold is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual
       page,  helplink is used for not selected hyperlinks and helpslink is used
       for selected hyperlink.

       Popup menu uses following colors: pmenunormal is  used  for  non-selected
       menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, pmenusel is used for
       selected menu item, pmenutitle is used for popup menu title.

       The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen,
       brown,  yellow,  blue,  brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, bright&#8208;
       cyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent
       background.  It  is  &apos;default&apos;.  The &apos;default&apos; can only be used for back&#8208;
       ground color. Another special keyword  &quot;base&quot;  means  mc&apos;s  main  colors.
       When 256 colors are available, they can be specified either as color16 to
       color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default

       Attributes can be any of bold, underline, reverse and blink, appended  by
       a  plus sign if more than one are desired.  The special word &quot;none&quot; means
       no attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color.  Example:

       menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline
&#12;
Skins
       You can change the appearance of Midnight Commander.   To  do  this,  you
       must specify a file that contain descriptions of colors and lines to draw
       boxes. Redefining of the colors is entirely compatible with  the  assign&#8208;
       ment of colors, as described in Section Colors.

       If your skin contains any of 256-color definitions, you should define the
       &apos;256colors&apos; key set to TRUE value in [skin] section.


       A skin-file is searched on the following  algorithm  (to  the  first  one
       found):

              1) command line option -S &lt;skin&gt; or --skin=&lt;skin&gt;
              2) Environment variable MC_SKIN
              3) Parameter skin in section [Midnight-Commander] in config file.
              4) File /etc/mc/skins/default.ini
              5) File /usr/share/mc/skins/default.ini


       Command  line  option,  environment variable and parameter in config file
       may contain the absolute path to the skin-file (with the  extension  .ini
       or  without  it).  Search  of  skin-file  will occur in (to the first one
       found):

              1) ~/.local/share/mc/skins/
              2) @sysconfdir@/mc/skins/
              3) /usr/share/mc/skins/

       Color pairs described as two colors and the optional attributes separated
       by &apos;;&apos;. First field sets the foreground color, second  field  sets  back&#8208;
       ground  color, third field sets the attributes.  Any of the fields may be
       omitted, in this case value will be taken from default color pair (global
       color pair or from default color pair of this section).

       Example:
       [core]
           # green on black
           _default_=green;black
           # green (default) on blue
           selected=;blue
           # yellow on black (default)
           # underlined yellow on black (default)
           marked=yellow;;underline


       Possible colors (names) and attributes are described in Colors.  section.


  Draw lines
       Lines sets in section [Lines] into skin-file. By default single lines are
       used, but you may redefine to usage of any utf-8 symbols (like to  lines,
       for example).

       WARNING!!!   When  you  build  Midnight Commander with the Ncurses screen
       library usage of drawing lines is limited!  Possible only drawing a  sin&#8208;
       gle  lines.  For all questions and comments please contact the developers
       of Ncurses.


       Descriptions of parameters [Lines]:

       lefttop
              left-top line fragment.

       righttop
              right-top line fragment.

       centertop
              down branch of horizontal line

       centerbottom

       thinvert
              thin vertical line



  Compatibility
       Appointment of color  by skin-files fully compatible with the appointment
       of the colors described in Colors.  section.

       In  this case, reassignment of colors has priority over the skin file and
       is complementary.


Filenames Highlight
       Section [filehighlight] in current skin-file contains key names as  high&#8208;
       light  groups  and  values  as  color pairs. Color pairs is documented in
       Skins section.

       Rules  of  filenames  highlight  are  placed  in  /usr/share/mc/filehigh&#8208;
       light.ini file (~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini).  Name of section in this
       file must be equal to parameters names  in  [filehighlight]  section  (in
       current skin-file).

       Keys in these groups are:

       type   file type. If present, all other options are ignored.

       regexp regular expression. If present, &apos;extensions&apos; option is ignored.

       extensions
              list of extensions of files. Separated by &apos;;&apos; sign.

       extensions_case
              (make  sense  only  with &apos;extensions&apos; parameter) make &apos;extensions&apos;
              rule case sentitive (true) or not (false).

       `type&apos; key may have values:
       - FILE (all files)
         - FILE_EXE
       - DIR (all directories)
         - LINK_DIR
       - LINK (all links except stale link)
         - HARDLINK
         - SYMLINK
       - STALE_LINK
       - DEVICE (all device files)
         - DEVICE_BLOCK
         - DEVICE_CHAR
       - SPECIAL (all special files)
         - SPECIAL_SOCKET
         - SPECIAL_FIFO
         - SPECIAL_DOOR

Special Settings
       Most of the Midnight Commander settings can be changed  from  the  menus.
       However,  there  are a small number of settings which can only be changed
       by editing the setup file.

       These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file:

       clear_before_exec
              By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before execut&#8208;
              ing  a command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the com&#8208;
              mand at the bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini  file
              and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

       confirm_view_dir
              If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.
              If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before
              changing the directory if you have files tagged.

       ftpfs_retry_seconds
              This  value  is  the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will
              wait before attempting to reconnect to  an  FTP  server  that  has
              denied  the  login.   If  the  value is zero, the login will no be
              retried.

       max_dirt_limit
              Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at  most  in  the
              internal  file  viewer.   Normally  this value is not significant,
              because the code automatically adjusts the number  of  updates  to
              skip  according  to  the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on
              very slow machines or terminals with a fast keyboard auto  repeat,
              a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.

              It  seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behav&#8208;
              ior, and that is the default value.

       mouse_move_pages_viewer
              Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or  line  by
              line on the internal file viewer.

       only_leading_plus_minus
              Allow  special  treatment  for  &apos;+&apos;,  &apos;-&apos;, &apos;*&apos; in the command line
              (select, unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line  is
              empty.   You don&apos;t need to quote those characters in the middle of
              the command line.  On the other  hand,  you  cannot  use  them  to
              change selection when the command line is not empty.

       show_output_starts_shell
              This  variable  only  works if you are not using the subshell sup&#8208;
              port.  When you use the C-o keystroke  to  go  back  to  the  user
              screen,  if  this  one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Other&#8208;
              wise, pressing any key will bring you back to the Midnight Comman&#8208;
              der.

       timeformat_recent
              Change  the  time  format used to display dates less than 6 months
              from now.  See strftime or date man page for the format specifica&#8208;
              tion. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

       timeformat_old
              Change  the time format used to display  dates older than 6 months
              from now or for dates in the future.  See  strftime  or  date  man
              page  for  the  format  specification.  If  this option is absent,
              default timeformat is used.

       torben_fj_mode
              If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly
              different  on  the  panels, instead of moving the selection to the
              first and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:

              The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else  go
              to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case
              it will go to the first file in the panel.

              The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if
              over  it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the
              bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to  the  last
              file name in the panel.

       use_file_to_guess_type
              If  this  variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file com&#8208;
              mand to match the file types listed on the mc.ext file.

       xtree_mode
              If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse  the  file
              system  on  a  Tree  panel, it will automatically reload the other
              panel with the contents of the selected directory.

       fish_directory_timeout
              This variable holds the lifetime of a  directory  cache  entry  in
              seconds. The default value is 900 seconds.

       clipboard_store
              This  variable  contains path (with options) to the external clip&#8208;
              board utility like &apos;xclip&apos; to read  text  into  X  selection  from
              file.  For example:

       clipboard_store=xclip -i

       clipboard_paste
              This  variable  contains path (with options) to the external clip&#8208;
              board utility like &apos;xclip&apos; to print the selection to standard out.
              For example:

       clipboard_pastee=xclip -o

       autodetect_codeset
              This option allows use the `enca&apos; command to autodetect codeset of
              text files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values can
              be  obtain  by the `enca --list languages | cut -d : -f1&apos; command.
              Option must be located in the [Misc] section.

       For example:

       autodetect_codeset=russian

Terminal databases
       The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system  terminal  data&#8208;
       base  without requiring root privileges.  The Midnight Commander searches
       in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located  in  the  Mid&#8208;
       night  Commander  library directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for
       the section &quot;terminal:your-terminal-name&quot; and then for the section  &quot;ter&#8208;
       minal:general&quot;,  each  line of the section contains a key symbol that you
       want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.
       You can use the special \e form to represent the escape character and the
       ^x to represent the control-x character.

       The possible key symbols are:

       f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
       bs            backspace
       home          home key
       end           end key
       up            up arrow key
       down          down arrow key
       left          left arrow key
       right         right arrow key
       pgdn          page down key
       pgup          page up key
       insert        the insert character
       delete        the delete character
       complete      to do completion

       For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O +  p,  you
       set this in the ini file:

       insert=\e[Op


       Also now you can use extended learn keys.  For example:

           ctrl-alt-right=\e[[1;6C
           ctrl-alt-left=\e[[1;6D


       This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a \e[[1;6D escape sequence and there&#8208;
       fore Midnight Commander interprets &quot;\e[[1;6D&quot; as Ctrl-Alt-Left.


       The complete key symbol represents the escape sequences  used  to  invoke
       the  completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define
       other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of  nice  and
       unused keys everywhere).


FILES
       Full  paths below may vary between installations.  They are also affected
       by the MC_DATADIR environment variable. If it&apos;s set, its  value  is  used
       instead of /usr/share/mc in the paths below.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hlp

              The help file for the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ext

              The default system-wide extensions file.

       ~/.config/mc/mc.ext

              User&apos;s  own  extension,  view configuration and edit configuration
              file.  They override the contents of  the  system  wide  files  if
              present.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ini
&#12;              The  default  system-wide  setup  for the Midnight Commander, used
              only if the user doesn&apos;t have his own ~/.config/mc/ini file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.lib

              Global settings for the Midnight Commander.  Settings in this file
              affect all users, whether they have ~/.config/mc/ini or not.  Cur&#8208;
              rently, only terminal settings are loaded from mc.lib.

       ~/.config/mc/ini

              User&apos;s own setup. If this file is present then the setup is loaded
              from here instead of the system-wide startup file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hint

              This file contains the hints displayed by the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.menu

              This file contains the default system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.config/mc/menu

              User&apos;s  own  application  menu. If this file is present it is used
              instead of the system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.cache/mc/Tree

              The directory list for the directory tree and tree view features.

       ~/.local/share/mc.menu

              Local user-defined menu. If this  file  is  present,  it  is  used
              instead of the home or system-wide applications menu.

       To  change  default root directory of MC, you can use MC_HOME environment
       variable. The value of MC_HOME must be an absolute path.  If  MC_HOME  is
       unset  or  empty,  HOME  variable  is used. If HOME is unset or empty, MC
       directories are get from GLib library.
