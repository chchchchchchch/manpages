MCEDIT(1)                    GNU Midnight Commander                    MCEDIT(1)



NAME
       mcedit - Internal file editor of GNU Midnight Commander.

USAGE
       mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] file

       mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] file:lineno[:]

DESCRIPTION
       mcedit is a link to mc, the main GNU Midnight Commander executable.  Exe&#8208;
       cuting GNU Midnight Commander under this name requests staring the inter&#8208;
       nal  editor and opening the file specified on the command line.  The edi&#8208;
       tor is based on the terminal version of cooledit - standalone editor  for
       X Window System.

OPTIONS
       +lineno
              Go to the line specified by number (do not put a space between the
              + sign and the number).

       -b     Force black and white display.

       -c     Force ANSI color mode on terminals that don&apos;t seem to  have  color
              support.

       -C &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;= ...
              Specify  a  different  color set.  See the Colors section in mc(1)
              for more information.

       -d     Disable mouse support.

       -f     Display the compiled-in search path  for  GNU  Midnight  Commander
              data files.

       -t     Force  using termcap database instead of terminfo.  This option is
              only applicable if GNU Midnight Commander was compiled with S-Lang
              library with terminfo support.

       -V     Display the version of the program.

       -x     Force  xterm  mode.   Used when running on xterm-capable terminals
              (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

FEATURES
       The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.   It  can
       edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files.  The
       features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste;
       key  for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro commands; regu&#8208;
       lar expression search and replace (and our own  scanf-printf  search  and
       replace);  shift-arrow  text highlighting (if supported by the terminal);
       insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab size;  syntax
       highlighting  for  various  file types; and an option to pipe text blocks
       through shell commands like indent and ispell.

KEYS
       The editor is easy  to  use  and  can  be  used  without  learning.   The
       pull-down  menu is invoked by pressing F9.  You can learn other keys from
       the menu and from the button bar labels.

       In addition to that, Shift combined with arrows  does  text  highlighting
       (if   supported   by   the   terminal):   Ctrl-Ins  copies  to  the  file
       ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip,       Shift-Ins        pastes        from
       ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip,         Shift-Del         cuts         to
       ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del  deletes  highlighted  text.
       Mouse  highlighting  also  works  on some terminals.  To use the standard
       mouse support provided by your terminal, hold the Shift key.  Please note
       that  the  mouse support in the terminal doesn&apos;t share the clipboard with
       mcedit.

       The completion key (usually Meta-Tab or Escape Tab)  completes  the  word
       under the cursor using the words used earlier in the file.

MACRO
       To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the keys you want to be
       executed.  Press Ctrl-R again when finished.  The macro can  be  assigned
       to  any  key  by pressing that key.  The macro is executed when you press
       the assigned key.

       The  macro  commands  are  stored  in  section  [editor]  it   the   file
       ~/.local/share/mc/mc.macros.

       External  scripts  (filters)  can be assigned into the any hotkey by edit
       mc.macros like following:

       [editor]
       ctrl-W=ExecuteScript:25;

       This means that ctrl-W hotkey  initiates  the  ExecuteScript(25)  action,
       then    editor    handler    translates    this    into    execution   of
       ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/macro.25.sh shell script.

       External scripts are stored in ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/  direc&#8208;
       tory  and  must be named as macro.XXXX.sh where XXXX is the number from 0
       to 9999.  See Menu File Edit for more detail about format of the script.

       Following macro definition and directives can be used:

       #silent
              If this directive is set, then script starts  without  interactive
              subshell.

       %c     The cursor column position number.

       %i     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column.

       %y     The syntax type of current file.

       %b     The block file name.

       %f     The current file name.

       %n     Only the current file name without extension.

       %x     The extension of current file name.

       %d     The current directory name.

       %F     The current file in the unselected panel.

       %D     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       %t     The currently tagged files.

       %T     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       %u     and  %U Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files
              are untagged. You can use this macro only once per menu file entry
              or extension file entry, because next time there will be no tagged
              files.

       %s     and %S The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Oth&#8208;
              erwise the current file.

       Feel  free  to  edit  this files, if you need.  Here is a sample external
       script:

       l       comment selection
            TMPFILE=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/up.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            echo #if 0 &gt; $TMPFILE
            cat %b &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE
            echo #endif &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE
            cat $TMPFILE &gt; %b
            rm -f $TMPFILE

       If some keys don&apos;t work, you can use Learn Keys in the Options menu.

CODE NAVIGATION
       mcedit can be used to navigation through code with tags files created  by
       etags  or  ctags commands. If there is no file TAGS code navigation would
       not work.  In example, in case of exuberant-ctags for C language  command
       will be:

       ctags -e --language-force=C -R ./

       Meta-Enter  show list box to select item under cursor (cusor should stand
       at end of word).

       Meta-Minus where minus is symbol &quot;-&quot; go to previous function  in  naviga&#8208;
       tion list (like a browser Back).

       Meta-Equal  where  equal  is symbol &quot;=&quot; go to next function in navigation
       list (like a browser Forward).

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
       mcedit supports syntax highlighting.  This means that keywords  and  con&#8208;
       texts (like C comments, string constants, etc) are highlighted in differ&#8208;
       ent colors.  The following  section  explains  the  format  of  the  file
       ~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax.    If   this  file  is  missing,  system-wide
       /usr/share/mc/syntax/Syntax is used.  The file ~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax
       is  rescanned  on  opening  of  a any new editor file.  The file contains
       rules for highlighting, each of which is given on a  separate  line,  and
       define which keywords will be highlighted to what color.

       The  file  is  divided into sections, each beginning with a line with the
       file command.  The sections are normally put into  separate  files  using
       the include command.

       The  file  command  has three arguments.  The first argument is a regular
       expression that is applied to the file name to determine if the following
       section  applies  to the file.  The second argument is the description of
       the file type.  It is used in cooledit; future versions of mcedit may use
       it as well.  The third optional argument is a regular expression to match
       the first line of text of the file.  The rules in the  following  section
       apply if either the file name or the first line of text matches.

       A  section  ends  with  the  start  of  another section.  Each section is
       divided into contexts, and each context contains rules.  A context  is  a
       scope  within  the  text  that a particular set of rules belongs to.  For
       instance, the text within a C style comment (i.e. between /* and */)  has
       its  own  color.   This  is  a  context, although it has no further rules
       inside it because there is probably  nothing  that  we  want  highlighted
       within a C comment.

       A trivial C programming section might look like this:

       file .\*\\.c C\sProgram\sFile (#include|/\\\*)

       wholechars abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_

       # default colors
       define  comment   brown
       context default
         keyword  whole  if       yellow
         keyword  whole  else     yellow
         keyword  whole  for      yellow
         keyword  whole  while    yellow
         keyword  whole  do       yellow
         keyword  whole  switch   yellow
         keyword  whole  case     yellow
         keyword  whole  static   yellow
         keyword  whole  extern   yellow
         keyword         {        brightcyan
         keyword         }        brightcyan
         keyword         &apos;*&apos;      green

       # C comments
       context /\* \*/ comment

       # C preprocessor directives
       context linestart # \n red
         keyword  \\\n  brightred

       # C string constants
       context &quot; &quot; green
         keyword  %d    brightgreen
         keyword  %s    brightgreen
         keyword  %c    brightgreen
         keyword  \\&quot;   brightgreen

       Each context starts with a line of the form:

       context   [exclusive]   [whole|wholeright|wholeleft]   [linestart]  delim
       [linestart] delim [foreground] [background] [attributes]

       The first context is an exception.  It must start with the command

       context default [foreground] [background] [attributes]

       otherwise mcedit will report an error.  The  linestart  option  specifies
       that delim must start at the beginning of a line.  The whole option tells
       that delim must be a whole word.  To specify that a word  must  begin  on
       the  word  boundary  only  on  the  left  side, you can use the wholeleft
       option, and similarly a word that must end on the word boundary is speci&#8208;
       fied by wholeright.

       The  set of characters that constitute a whole word can be changed at any
       point in the file with the wholechars command.  The left and right set of
       characters can be set separately with

       wholechars [left|right] characters

       The  exclusive  option causes the text between the delimiters to be high&#8208;
       lighted, but not the delimiters themselves.

       Each rule is a line of the form:

       keyword [whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] string foreground [back&#8208;
       ground] [attributes]

       Context  or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you can include tabs
       and spaces with the sequences \t and \s.  Newlines  and  backslashes  are
       specified  with  \n  and  \\ respectively.  Since whitespace is used as a
       separator, it may not be used as is.  Also, \* must be used to specify an
       asterisk.   The * itself is a wildcard that matches any length of charac&#8208;
       ters.  For example,

         keyword         &apos;*&apos;      green

       colors all C single character constants green.  You also could use

         keyword         &quot;*&quot;      green

       to color string constants, but the matched string would not be allowed to
       span  across  multiple newlines.  The wildcard may be used within context
       delimiters as well, but you cannot have a wildcard as the last  or  first
       character.

       Important to note is the line

         keyword  \\\n  brightgreen

       This  line defines a keyword containing the backslash and newline charac&#8208;
       ters.  Since the keywords are matched before the context delimiters, this
       keyword prevents the context from ending at the end of the lines that end
       in a backslash, thus allowing C preprocessor directive to continue across
       multiple lines.

       The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen,
       brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta,  brightmagenta,  cyan,  bright&#8208;
       cyan, lightgray and white. The special keyword &quot;default&quot; means the termi&#8208;
       nal&apos;s default. Another special keyword &quot;base&quot; means mc&apos;s main colors,  it
       is useful as a placeholder if you want to specify attributes without mod&#8208;
       ifying the background color. When 256 colors are available, they  can  be
       specified either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0
       to gray23.

       If the syntax file is shared with cooledit, it  is  possible  to  specify
       different colors for mcedit and cooledit by separating them with a slash,
       e.g.

       keyword  #include  red/Orange

       mcedit uses the color before the slash.  See  cooledit(1)  for  supported
       cooledit colors.

       Attributes  can be any of bold, underline, reverse and blink, appended by
       a plus sign if more than one are desired.

       Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the hash sign (#).

       If you are describing case insensitive language you need to  use  casein&#8208;
       sensitive  directive.  It  should be specified at the beginning of syntax
       file.

       Because of the simplicity of the implementation, there are a few intrica&#8208;
       cies  that will not be dealt with correctly but these are a minor irrita&#8208;
       tion.  On the whole, a broad spectrum of quite complicated situations are
       handled with these simple rules.  It is a good idea to take a look at the
       syntax file to see some of the nifty tricks you  can  do  with  a  little
       imagination.   If  you cannot get by with the rules I have coded, and you
       think you have a rule that would be useful, please  email  me  with  your
       request.   However,  do  not  ask for regular expression support, because
       this is flatly impossible.

       A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with the things you can
       do  rather  than  try  to  do things that this implementation cannot deal
       with.  Also remember that the aim of syntax highlighting is to make  pro&#8208;
       gramming less prone to error, not to make code look pretty.

       The syntax highlighting can be toggled using Ctrl-s shortcut.

COLORS
       The  default  colors  may  be  changed by appending to the MC_COLOR_TABLE
       environment variable.  Foreground and  background  colors  pairs  may  be
       specified for example with:

       MC_COLOR_TABLE=&quot;$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\
       editnormal=lightgray,black:\
       editbold=yellow,black:\
       editmarked=black,cyan&quot;

OPTIONS
       Most options can now be set from the editors options dialog box.  See the
       Options menu.  The following options are defined in ~/.config/mc/ini  and
       have  obvious  counterparts  in  the  dialog box.  You can modify them to
       change the editor behavior, by editing the file.  Unless specified,  a  1
       sets the option to on, and a 0 sets it to off, as is usual.

       use_internal_edit
              This option is ignored when invoking mcedit.

       editor_tab_spacing
              Interpret  the  tab character as being of this length.  Default is
              8. You should avoid using other than 8 since  most  other  editors
              and   text   viewers   assume   a  tab  spacing  of  8.  Use  edi&#8208;
              tor_fake_half_tabs to simulate a smaller tab spacing.

       editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces
              Never insert a tab space. Rather insert spaces (ascii 20h) to fill
              to the desired tab size.

       editor_return_does_auto_indent
              Pressing  return  will  tab across to match the indentation of the
              first line above that has text on it.

       editor_backspace_through_tabs
              Make a single backspace delete all the space to the left margin if
              there is no text between the cursor and the left margin.

       editor_fake_half_tabs
              This  will emulate a half tab for those who want to program with a
              tab spacing of 4, but do not want the tab size changed from 8  (so
              that  the  code will be formatted the same when displayed by other
              programs). When editing between text and the left  margin,  moving
              and  tabbing  will be as though a tab space were 4, while actually
              using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal  fill.   When  editing
              anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.

       editor_option_save_mode
              Possible  values  0, 1 and 2.  The save mode (see the options menu
              also) allows you to change the method of  saving  a  file.   Quick
              save  (0)  saves the file by immediately, truncating the disk file
              to zero length (i.e.  erasing it) and the writing the editor  con&#8208;
              tents  to  the  file.  This method is fast, but dangerous, since a
              system error during a file save will leave the file only partially
              written,  possibly rendering the data irretrievable.  When saving,
              the safe save (1) option enables creation of a temporary file into
              which  the  file  contents  are first written.  In the event of an
              problem, the original file is untouched.  When the temporary  file
              is successfully written, it is renamed to the name of the original
              file, thus replacing it.  The safest method is create backups (2).
              Where  a  backup file is created before any changes are made.  You
              can specify your own backup file extension in  the  dialog.   Note
              that  saving twice will replace your backup as well as your origi&#8208;
              nal file.

       editor_word_wrap_line_length
              line length to wrap. 72 default.

       editor_backup_extension
              symbol for add extension to name of backup files. Default &quot;~&quot;.

       editor_line_state
              show state line of editor now it show  number  of  file  line  (in
              future  it  can  show things like folding, breakpoints, etc.). M-n
              toglle this option.

       editor_visible_spaces
              Toggle show visible trailing spaces (TWS), if  editor_visible_spa&#8208;
              ces=1 TWS showed as &apos;.&apos;

       editor_visible_tabs
              Toggle  show visible tabs, if editor_visible_tabs=1 tabs showed as
              &apos;&lt;----&gt;&apos;

       editor_persistent_selections
              Do not remove block selection after moving the cursor.

       editor_cursor_beyond_eol
              Allow moving cursor beyond the end of line.

       editor_syntax_highlighting
              enable syntax highlighting.

       editor_edit_confirm_save
              show confirm dialog on save.

       editor_option_typewriter_wrap
              to be described

       editor_option_auto_para_formatting
              to be described

       editor_option_save_position
              save file position on exit.

       source_codepage
              symbol representation of codepage name for file (i.e. CP1251, ~  -
              default).

       editor_group_undo
              do  UNDO  for  several of the same type of action (inserting/over&#8208;
              writing, deleting, navigating, typing)

       editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
              Search autocomplete candidates in entire  of  file  or  just  from
              begin of file to cursor position (0)


MISCELLANEOUS
       You  can  use  scanf  search and replace to search and replace a C format
       string.  First take a look at the sscanf and sprintf  man  pages  to  see
       what  a  format  string  is and how it works.  Here&apos;s an example: suppose
       that you want to replace all occurrences of an open bracket, three  comma
       separated  numbers,  and a close bracket, with the word apples, the third
       number, the word oranges and then the second number.  You would  fill  in
       the Replace dialog box as follows:
&#12;       Enter search string
       (%d,%d,%d)
       Enter replace string
       apples %d oranges %d
       Enter replacement argument order
       3,2

       The  last line specifies that the third and then the second number are to
       be used in place of the first and second.

       It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt On Replace on, because  a
       match  is  thought  to  be  found  whenever the number of arguments found
       matches the number given, which is not always a real  match.  Scanf  also
       treats  whitespace  as  being  elastic.  Note that the scanf format %[ is
       very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.

       The editor also displays non-us characters (160+).  When  editing  binary
       files,  you  should  set display bits to 7 bits in the Midnight Commander
       options menu to keep the spacing clean.
