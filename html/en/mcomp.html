MCOMP(1)                       Mtools Users Manual                      MCOMP(1)



NAME
       mcomp - Compares two files using mtools

SYNOPSIS
       mcomp file-on-floppy local-file

DESCRIPTION
       mcomp  compares  two  files, the first one must be on a floppy disk so it
       can be accesed via mtools.   It  is  not  strictly  necessary  on  Debian
       GNU/Linux,  because  the diffutils cmp(1) program provides the same capa&#8208;
       bility after copying the file locally with

       mcopy file destination

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package  for  other  platforms
       and is retained here for completeness.


AUTHOR
       Luis   Bustamante  &lt;luferbu@fluidsignal.com&gt;  wrote  this  page  for  the
       Debian/GNU mtools package.
