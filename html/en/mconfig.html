NAME
       mconfig, - Utility for modifying .NET configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       mconfig [options] command [command_parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       mconfig  can  be  used  to edit .NET configuration files, by adding &quot;fea&#8208;
       tures&quot; (that is sets of xml statements) defined  in  one  of  the  config
       files read by mconfig. The config file can also define layouts of default
       configuration files, which may be  useful  for  bootstrapping  your  .NET
       projects.

       To  see  the list of recognized commands, default configuration files and
       features, run mconfig without passing any parameters.

OPTIONS
       -c &lt;config_file&gt;, --config=&lt;config_file&gt;
              Read the specified config file after reading the other, preconfig&#8208;
              ured, config files for the utility. Settings in the specified file
              override those found in the other configuration locations.

       -t {any | web | application}, --target={any | web | application}
              Features and default configuration files defined  in  the  mconfig
              config  file(s)  can be assigned to one of the three targets - web
              (for ASP.NET features/config files), application - for .NET appli&#8208;
              cations,  any  -  applicable  in  both  of  the  previous targets.
              Defaults to any.

       -?, -h, --help
              Show a summary usage screen.

       -v, --version
              Show the mconfig version

COMMANDS
       {addfeature, af} &lt;feature_name&gt; [config_file_path]
              Adds the feature named  &lt;feature_name&gt;  to  the  specified  config
              file.  If  [config_file_path]  is  omitted, the name of the output
              configuration file will be chosen based  on  the  selected  target
              (see  the -t option). The web target outputs configuration to file
              named Web.config, and the application target outputs to file named
              application.exe.config.  The  any  target  does not have a default
              output file.

              If the specified config file exists, the feature will be  injected
              into  it  at  the locations specified by mconfig configuration. If
              the target config file does not exist, it will be created and will
              contain only the specified feature and all its dependencies.

       {defaultconfig, dc} [config_name [target_directory]]
              Generates  a  default  config  file  using the configuration entry
              named [config_name] and outputs the resulting  configuration  file
              to the directory given by the [target_directory] option.  If [con&#8208;
              fig_name] is omitted, it defaults to Web.config for the web target
              and  application  target.  The  any  target  does  not specify any
              default  output  configuration  name.  If  the  [target_directory]
              parameter is omitted, it defaults to the current directory.

              Name  of  the  output config file created in [target_directory] is
              given in the config file layout definition.
&#12;FILES
       Config files are read in the order given below. Each subsequent file  may
       override settings found in the files read before it.

       $prefix/etc/mono/mconfig/config.xml
              The  default configuration file, distributed with mconfig. $prefix
              is the mconfig installation prefix specified  on  the  compilation
              time.

       $config_dir/mconfig/config.xml
              $config_dir  is  the  directory  specified  in the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              environment variable or,
               if it is empty, in the .config directory located  in  the  user&apos;s
              home directory. This file is not distributed with Mono.

       ./mconfig.xml
              Local  configuration  file  which can contain per-application set&#8208;
              tings.
