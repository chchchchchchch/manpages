MCVIEW(1)                    GNU Midnight Commander                    MCVIEW(1)



NAME
       mcview - Internal file viewer of GNU Midnight Commander.

USAGE
       mcview [-bcCdfhstVx?] file

DESCRIPTION
       mcview is a link to mc, the main GNU Midnight Commander executable.  Exe&#8208;
       cuting GNU Midnight Commander under this name requests staring the inter&#8208;
       nal viewer and opening the file specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       -b     Force black and white display.

       -c     Force  color  mode on terminals where mcview defaults to black and
              white.

       -C &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;= ...
              Specify a different color set.  See the Colors  section  in  mc(1)
              for more information.

       -d     Disable mouse support.

       -f     Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.

       -t     Used  only  if  the code was compiled with S-Lang and terminfo: it
              makes the Midnight Commander use the value of the TERMCAP variable
              for  the  terminal  information  instead of the information on the
              system wide terminal database

       -V     Displays the version of the program.

       -x     Forces xterm mode.  Used when running on  xterm-capable  terminals
              (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

COLORS
       The  default  colors  may  be  changed by appending to the MC_COLOR_TABLE
       environment variable.  Foreground and  background  colors  pairs  may  be
       specified for example with:

       MC_COLOR_TABLE=&quot;$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\
       normal=lightgray,black:\
       selected=black,green&quot;

FILES
       /usr/share/mc/mc.hlp

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ini

              The  default  system-wide  setup  for GNU Midnight Commander, used
              only if the user&apos;s own ~/.config/mc/ini file is missing.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.lib

              Global settings for the Midnight Commander.  Settings in this file
              affect all users, whether they have ~/.config/mc/ini or not.

              User&apos;s  own  setup.   If this file is present, the setup is loaded
