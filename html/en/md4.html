DESCRIPTION
       This package is an implementation in Tcl of the MD4 message-digest  algo&#8208;
       rithm as described in RFC 1320 (1) and (2). This algorithm takes an arbi&#8208;
       trary quantity of data and generates a 128-bit message  digest  from  the
       input.  The  MD4  algorithm  is  faster  but  potentially weaker than the
       related MD5 algorithm (3).

       If you have critcl and have built the tcllibc package then the  implemen&#8208;
       tation of the hashing function will be performed by compiled code. Alter&#8208;
       natively if cryptkit is available this will be used.  If  no  accelerator
       package  can  be found then the pure-tcl implementation is used. The pro&#8208;
       gramming interface remains the same in all cases.

COMMANDS
       ::md4::md4 ?-hex? [ -channel channel | -file filename | string ]
              Calculate the MD4 digest of the data  given  in  string.  This  is
              returned  as  a  binary  string by default. Giving the -hex option
              will return a hexadecimal encoded version of the digest.

              The data to be hashed can be specified either as a string argument
              to  the  md4 command, or as a filename or a pre-opened channel. If
              the -filename argument is given then the file is opened, the  data
              read  and  hashed and the file is closed. If the -channel argument
              is given then data is read from the channel until the end of file.
              The channel is not closed.

              Only one of -file, -channel or string should be given.

       ::md4::hmac  ?-hex? -key key [ -channel channel | -file filename | string
       ]
              Calculate an Hashed Message Authentication digest (HMAC) using the
              MD4 digest algorithm. HMACs are described in RFC 2104 (4) and pro&#8208;
              vide an MD4 digest that includes a key.  All  options  other  than
              -key are as for the ::md4::md4 command.

PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
       For the programmer, the MD4 hash can be viewed as a bucket into which one
       pours data. When you have finished, you extract a value that  is  derived
       from  the data that was poured into the bucket. The programming interface
       to the MD4 hash operates on a token (equivalent to the bucket). You  call
       MD4Init  to  obtain  a  token  and  then  call MD4Update as many times as
       required to add data to the hash. To release any resources and obtain the
       hash  value, you then call MD4Final. An equivalent set of functions gives
       you a keyed digest (HMAC).

       ::md4::MD4Init
              Begins a new MD4 hash. Returns a token ID that must  be  used  for
              the remaining functions.

       ::md4::MD4Update token data
              Add data to the hash identified by token. Calling MD4Update $token
              &quot;abcd&quot; is equivalent to calling MD4Update $token &quot;ab&quot; followed  by
              MD4Update $token &quot;cb&quot;. See EXAMPLES.

       ::md4::MD4Final token
              Returns  the  hash  value  and releases any resources held by this
              token. Once this command completes the token will be invalid.  The
              result is a binary string of 16 bytes representing the 128 bit MD4
              digest value.

       ::md4::HMACInit key
              This is equivalent to the ::md4::MD4Init command  except  that  it
              requires the key that will be included in the HMAC.

       ::md4::HMACUpdate token data

       ::md4::HMACFinal token
              These commands are identical to the MD4 equivalent commands.
