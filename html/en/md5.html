DESCRIPTION
       This package is an implementation in Tcl of the MD5 message-digest  algo&#8208;
       rithm  as  described  in  RFC 1321 (1). This algorithm takes an arbitrary
       quantity of data and generates a 128-bit message digest from  the  input.
       The  MD5  algorithm  is  related  to  the  MD4 algorithm (2) but has been
       strengthened against certain types of potential  attack.  MD5  should  be
       used in preference to MD4 for new applications.

       If  you have critcl and have built the tcllibc package then the implemen&#8208;
       tation of the hashing function will be performed by compiled code. Alter&#8208;
       natively  if  you have either cryptkit or Trf then either of these can be
       used to accelerate the digest computation. If no suitable compiled  pack&#8208;
       age  is  available then the pure-Tcl implementation wil be used. The pro&#8208;
       gramming interface remains the same in all cases.

       Note the previous version of this package always returned a  hex  encoded
       string.  This  has been changed to simplify the programming interface and
       to make this version  more  compatible  with  other  implementations.  To
       obtain the previous usage, either explicitly specify package version 1 or
       use the -hex option to the md5 command.

COMMANDS
       ::md5::md5 ?-hex? [ -channel channel | -file filename | string ]
              Calculate the MD5 digest of the data  given  in  string.  This  is
              returned  as  a  binary  string by default. Giving the -hex option
              will return a hexadecimal encoded version of the digest.

              The data to be hashed can be specified either as a string argument
              to  the  md5 command, or as a filename or a pre-opened channel. If
              the -filename argument is given then the file is opened, the  data
              read  and  hashed and the file is closed. If the -channel argument
              is given then data is read from the channel until the end of file.
              The channel is not closed.

              Only one of -file, -channel or string should be given.

       ::md5::hmac  ?-hex? -key key [ -channel channel | -file filename | string
       ]
              Calculate an Hashed Message Authentication digest (HMAC) using the
              MD5 digest algorithm. HMACs are described in RFC 2104 (3) and pro&#8208;
              vide an MD5 digest that includes a key.  All  options  other  than
              -key are as for the ::md5::md5 command.

PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
       For the programmer, the MD5 hash can be viewed as a bucket into which one
       pours data. When you have finished, you extract a value that  is  derived
       from  the data that was poured into the bucket. The programming interface
       to the MD5 hash operates on a token (equivalent to the bucket). You  call
       MD5Init  to  obtain  a  token  and  then  call MD5Update as many times as
       required to add data to the hash. To release any resources and obtain the
       hash  value, you then call MD5Final. An equivalent set of functions gives
       you a keyed digest (HMAC).

       ::md5::MD5Init
              Begins a new MD5 hash. Returns a token ID that must  be  used  for
              the remaining functions.

       ::md5::MD5Update token data
              Add data to the hash identified by token. Calling MD5Update $token
              &quot;abcd&quot; is equivalent to calling MD5Update $token &quot;ab&quot; followed  by
              MD5Update $token &quot;cb&quot;. See EXAMPLES.

       ::md5::MD5Final token
              Returns  the  hash  value  and releases any resources held by this
              token. Once this command completes the token will be invalid.  The
              result is a binary string of 16 bytes representing the 128 bit MD5
              digest value.

       ::md5::HMACInit key
              This is equivalent to the ::md5::MD5Init command  except  that  it
              requires the key that will be included in the HMAC.

       ::md5::HMACUpdate token data

       ::md5::HMACFinal token
              These commands are identical to the MD5 equivalent commands.
