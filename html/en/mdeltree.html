Name
       mdeltree - recursively delete an MSDOS directory and its contents



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mdeltree command is used to delete an MS-DOS file. Its syntax is:

       mdeltree [-v] msdosdirectory [msdosdirectories...]


       Mdeltree removes a directory and all the files and subdirectories it con&#8208;
       tains from an MS-DOS file system. An error occurs if the directory to  be
       removed does not exist.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation. However, this process is only approximative, and  some  items,
       such  as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla&#8208;
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation  in
       the  manpage  format.   Moreover, not all information has been translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo  doc.   See  the end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A  premade  html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as  html.   Indeed,  in
       the  info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
