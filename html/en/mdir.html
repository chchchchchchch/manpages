mdir(1)                                                                  mdir(1)



Name
       mdir - display an MSDOS directory



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mdir command is used to display an MS-DOS directory. Its syntax is:

       mdir [-/] [-f] [-w] [-a] [-b] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...]

       Mdir displays the contents of MS-DOS directories, or the entries for some
       MS-DOS files.

       Mdir supports the following command line options:

       /      Recursive output, just like MS-DOS&apos; -s option

       w      Wide output.  With this option, mdir prints the  filenames  across
              the page without displaying the file size or creation date.

       a      Also list hidden files.

       f      Fast.   Do not try to find out free space.  On larger disks, find&#8208;
              ing out the amount of free space takes up some non trivial  amount
              of  time,  as  the  whole FAT must be read in and scanned.  The -f
              flag bypasses this step.  This flag is not needed  on  FAT32  file
              systems, which store the size explicitly.

       b      Concise  listing.  Lists  each directory name or filename, one per
              line (including the filename extension). This switch  displays  no
              heading  information and no summary. Only a newline separated list
              of pathnames is displayed.

       An error occurs if a component of the path is not a directory.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:
&#12;                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
