NAME
       measurefs.reiser4  - the program for measuring reiser4 filesystem parame&#8208;
       ters (fragmentation, node packing, etc.).

SYNOPSIS
       measurefs.reiser4 [ options ] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       measurefs.reiser4 is reiser4 filesystem measure program. You can estimate
       reiser4 filesystem fragmentation, packingm etc. structures by using it.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              prints program version.

       -?, -h, --help
              prints program help.

       -y, --yes
              assumes an answer &apos;yes&apos; to all questions.

       -f, --force
              forces  measurefs  to  use whole disk, not block device or mounted
              partition.

       -c, --cache N
              sets tree cache node number to passed  value.  This  affects  very
              much  behavior  of  libreiser4. It affects speed, tree allocation,
              etc.

MEASUREMENT OPTIONS
       -S, --tree-stat
              shows different tree statistics  (node  packing,  internal  nodes,
              leaves, etc)

       -T, --tree-frag
              measures  total  tree  fragmentation.  The result is fragmentation
              factor - value from 0.00000  (minimal  fragmentation)  to  1.00000
              (maximal  one).  Most  probably, this factor may affect sequential
              read performance.

       -D, --data-frag
              measures average files fragmentation. This means, that  fragmenta&#8208;
              tion  of  each  file in filesystem will be measured separately and
              results will be averaged. The result  is  fragmentation  factor  -
              value  from  0.00000  (minimal  fragmentation) to 1.00000 (maximal
              one).

              Note, that for the fresh filesystem (created not  very  long  time
              ago)  and  even  fully  filled  by data, this value will be pretty
              small.

       -F, --file-frag FILE
              measures fragmentation of the specified file. The result is  frag&#8208;
              mentation  factor  - value from 0.00000 (minimal fragmentation) to
              1.00000 (maximal one). Note, that fragmentation of  a  small  file
              (depends  of  used  tail policy), which consists of tail items, is
              not very reliable value. That is because, they is always afoot due
              to balancing.

              Examples:
&#12;              measurefs.reiser4 -F /usr/bin /dev/hda2
              measurefs.reiser4 -F /bin/bash /dev/hda2

       -E, --show-file
              show file fragmentation for each file if --data-frag is specified.

PLUGIN OPTIONS
       -p, --print-profile
              prints the plugin profile. This is the set of default plugins used
              for all parts of a filesystem -- format,  nodes,  files,  directo&#8208;
              ries,  hashes,  etc. If --override is specified, then prints modi&#8208;
              fied plugins.

       -l, --print-plugins
              prints all plugins libreiser4 know about.

       -o, --override TYPE=PLUGIN, ...
              overrides the default plugin of the  type  &quot;TYPE&quot;  by  the  plugin
              &quot;PLUGIN&quot; in the plugin profile.

              Examples:

              measurefs.reiser4 -o nodeptr=nodeptr41,hash=rupasov_hash /dev/hda2
