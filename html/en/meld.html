MELD(1)                                                                  MELD(1)



NAME
       meld - Visual diff and merge tool for the GNOME Desktop

SYNOPSIS
       meld [options]
       meld [options] FILE1
       meld [options] DIR1
       meld [options] FILE1 FILE2 [FILE3]
       meld [options] DIR1 DIR2 [DIR3]

DESCRIPTION
       Meld is a graphical diff viewer and merge application for the Gnome desk&#8208;
       top.  It supports 2 and 3-file diffs, recursive directory diffs,  diffing
       of  directories  under  version  control  (Arch,  Bazaar, Codeville, CVS,
       Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS), as well as the ability to manually
       and automatically merge file differences.

OPTIONS
       --auto-compare, -a
              Automatically compare all differing files on startup.

       --diff FILE1|DIR1 FILE2|DIR2 [FILE3|DIR3]
              Create  a  diff tab for the given files or directories.  Note that
              &quot;meld --diff FILE1 FILE2&quot;  is  functionally  equivalent  to  &quot;meld
              FILE1  FILE2&quot;.  However, the --diff argument can be given multiple
              times for one invocation of meld which allows the user to automat&#8208;
              ically  initiate  multiple  diffs  when meld starts.  See examples
              below.

       --help, -h
              Print application help and usage.

       --LABEL=&lt;label&gt;, -L &lt;label&gt;
              Set application window title to &lt;label&gt;.

       --version
              Print application version and exit.

              copy of DIR1.
