MEMFROB(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 MEMFROB(3)



NAME
       memfrob - frobnicate (encrypt) a memory area

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       void *memfrob(void *s, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The memfrob() function encrypts the first n bytes of the memory area s by
       exclusive-ORing each character with the number 42.   The  effect  can  be
       reversed by using memfrob() on the encrypted memory area.

       Note  that  this  function  is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
       constant is fixed, and is only suitable for hiding strings.

RETURN VALUE
       The memfrob() function returns a pointer to the encrypted memory area.

CONFORMING TO
       The memfrob() function is unique to the GNU C Library.
