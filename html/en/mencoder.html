DESCRIPTION
       mplayer is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other platforms and CPU
       architectures, see the documentation).  It plays most MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/
       WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo,  yuv4mpeg,
       FILM  and RoQ files, supported by many native and binary codecs.  You can
       watch VCD, SVCD, DVD, Blu-ray, 3ivx,  DivX  3/4/5,  WMV  and  even  H.264
       movies, too.

       MPlayer  supports  a  wide  range  of video and audio output drivers.  It
       works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL,  SVGAlib,  fbdev,  AAlib,  libcaca,  Di&#8208;
       rectFB,  Quartz,  Mac  OS X CoreVideo, but you can also use GGI, SDL (and
       all their drivers), VESA (on every  VESA-compatible  card,  even  without
       X11), some low-level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3dfx and ATI) and
       some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens DVB, Hauppauge PVR
       (IVTV), DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  Most of them support software or hard&#8208;
       ware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen mode.

       MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status  information,  nice  big
       antialiased  shaded  subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
       European/ISO8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Kore&#8208;
       an  fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip,
       OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle,  JACOsub,  PJS  and  our
       own: MPsub) and DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Captions).

       mencoder (MPlayer&apos;s Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to
       encode MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable for&#8208;
       mats  (see  below).   It encodes to MPEG-4 (DivX/Xvid), one of the libav&#8208;
       codec codecs and PCM/MP3/VBRMP3 audio in 1, 2 or 3  passes.   Furthermore
       it  has stream copying abilities, a powerful filter system (crop, expand,
       flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, RGB/YUV conversion) and more.

       gmplayer is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.   Besides  some  own
       options (stored in gui.conf), it has the same options as MPlayer, however
       some MPlayer options will be stored in gui.conf so that they can be  cho&#8208;
       sen independently from MPlayer. (See GUI CONFIGURATION FILE below.)

       Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this
       man page.

       Also see the HTML documentation!

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven control layer which  al&#8208;
       lows  you  to  control  MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote
       control (with LIRC).  See the -input option for ways to customize it.

USAGE
       Every &apos;flag&apos; option has a &apos;noflag&apos; counterpart, e.g. the opposite of  the
       -fs option is -nofs.
&#12;       If  an  option  is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination
       with the XXX option or if XXX is compiled in.

       NOTE: The suboption parser (used for example for -ao pcm suboptions) sup&#8208;
       ports  a  special  kind of string-escaping intended for use with external
       GUIs.
       It has the following format:
       %n%string_of_length_n
       EXAMPLES:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi
       Or in a script:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%`expr length &quot;$NAME&quot;`%&quot;$NAME&quot; test.avi

CONFIGURATION FILES
       You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be  read
       every  time  MPlayer/MEncoder is run.  The system-wide configuration file
       &apos;mplayer.conf&apos; is in your configuration directory (e.g.  /etc/mplayer  or
       /usr/local/etc/mplayer),  the  user  specific one is &apos;~/.mplayer/config&apos;.
       The configuration file for MEncoder is &apos;mencoder.conf&apos; in your configura&#8208;
       tion  directory  (e.g.  /etc/mplayer or /usr/local/etc/mplayer), the user
       specific one is &apos;~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf&apos;.  User specific options  over&#8208;
       ride  system-wide options (in case of gmplayer, gui.conf options override
       user specific options) and options given on  the  command  line  override
       all.   The  syntax of the configuration files is &apos;option=&lt;value&gt;&apos;, every&#8208;
       thing after a &apos;#&apos; is considered a comment.   Options  that  work  without
       values  can be enabled by setting them to &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;1&apos; or &apos;true&apos; and dis&#8208;
       abled by setting them to &apos;no&apos; or &apos;0&apos; or &apos;false&apos;.  Even suboptions can  be
       specified in this way.

       You  can  also  write  file-specific configuration files.  If you wish to
       have a configuration file for a file called &apos;movie.avi&apos;,  create  a  file
       named &apos;movie.avi.conf&apos; with the file-specific options in it and put it in
       ~/.mplayer/.  You can also put the configuration file in the same  direc&#8208;
       tory  as the file to be played, as long as you give the -use-filedir-conf
       option (either on the command line or in your global config file).  If  a
       file-specific configuration file is found in the same directory, no file-
       specific configuration is  loaded  from  ~/.mplayer.   In  addition,  the
       -use-filedir-conf  option enables directory-specific configuration files.
       For this, MPlayer first tries to load a mplayer.conf from the same direc&#8208;
       tory as the file played and then tries to load any file-specific configu&#8208;
       ration.

PROFILES
       To  ease working with different configurations profiles can be defined in
       the configuration files.  A profile starts with its name  between  square
       brackets, e.g. &apos;[my-profile]&apos;.  All following options will be part of the
       profile.  A description (shown by -profile help) can be defined with  the
       profile-desc  option.   To  end the profile, start another one or use the
       profile name &apos;default&apos; to continue with normal options.

       EXAMPLE MPLAYER PROFILE:


       [protocol.dvd]
       profile-desc=&quot;profile for dvd:// streams&quot;
       vf=pp=hb/vb/dr/al/fd
       alang=en

       [protocol.dvdnav]
       profile-desc=&quot;profile for dvdnav:// streams&quot;
       profile=protocol.dvd
       mouse-movements=yes
       nocache=yes

       [extension.flv]
       profile-desc=&quot;profile for .flv files&quot;
       flip=yes

       [vo.pnm]
       outdir=/tmp

       [ao.alsa]
       device=spdif

       EXAMPLE MENCODER PROFILE:


       [mpeg4]
       profile-desc=&quot;MPEG4 encoding&quot;
       ovc=lacv=yes
       lavcopts=vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=1200

       [mpeg4-hq]
       profile-desc=&quot;HQ MPEG4 encoding&quot;
       profile=mpeg4
       lavcopts=mbd=2:trell=yes:v4mv=yes

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -codecpath &lt;dir&gt;
              Specify a directory for binary codecs.

       -codecs-file &lt;filename&gt; (also see -afm, -ac, -vfm, -vc)
              Override the standard search path and use the specified  file  in&#8208;
              stead of the builtin codecs.conf.

       -include &lt;configuration file&gt; (also see -gui-include)
              Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.

       -list-options
              Prints all available options.

       -msgcharset &lt;charset&gt;
              Convert  console messages to the specified character set (default:
              autodetect).  Text will be in  the  encoding  specified  with  the
              --charset  configure option.  Set this to &quot;noconv&quot; to disable con&#8208;
              version (for e.g. iconv problems).
              NOTE: The option takes effect after command line parsing has  fin&#8208;
              ished.   The MPLAYER_CHARSET environment variable can help you get
              rid of the first lines of garbled output.

       -msgcolor
              Enable colorful console output on terminals that support ANSI col&#8208;
              or.

       -msglevel &lt;all=&lt;level&gt;:&lt;module&gt;=&lt;level&gt;:...&gt;
              Control  verbosity  directly  for  each  module.  The &apos;all&apos; module
              changes the verbosity of all the modules not explicitly  specified
              on  the command line.  See &apos;-msglevel help&apos; for a list of all mod&#8208;
              ules.
              NOTE: Some messages are printed before the command line is  parsed
              and  are  therefore  not  affected by -msglevel.  To control these
              messages you have to use the MPLAYER_VERBOSE environment variable,
              see its description below for details.
              Available levels:
                 -1   complete silence
                  0   fatal messages only
                  1   error messages
                  2   warning messages
                  3   short hints
                  4   informational messages
                  5   status messages (default)
                  6   verbose messages
                  7   debug level 2
                  8   debug level 3
                  9   debug level 4

       -msgmodule
              Prepend module name in front of each console message.

       -noconfig &lt;options&gt;
              Do not parse selected configuration files.
              NOTE:  If  -include  or -use-filedir-conf options are specified at
              the command line, they will be honoured.
&#12;              Available options are:
                 all
                      all configuration files
                 gui (GUI only)
                      GUI configuration file
                 system
                      system configuration file
                 user
                      user configuration file

       -quiet
              Make console output less verbose; in particular, prevents the sta&#8208;
              tus  line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...) from being dis&#8208;
              played.  Particularly useful on  slow  terminals  or  broken  ones
              which do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. \r).

       -priority &lt;prio&gt; (Windows and OS/2 only)
              Set  process priority for MPlayer according to the predefined pri&#8208;
              orities available under Windows  and  OS/2.   Possible  values  of
              &lt;prio&gt;:
                 idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              WARNING: Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

       -profile &lt;profile1,profile2,...&gt;
              Use the given profile(s), -profile help displays a list of the de&#8208;
              fined profiles.

       -really-quiet (also see -quiet)
              Display even less output and status  messages  than  with  -quiet.
              Also suppresses the GUI error message boxes.

       -show-profile &lt;profile&gt;
              Show the description and content of a profile.

       -use-filedir-conf
              Look  for a file-specific configuration file in the same directory
              as the file that is being played.
              WARNING: May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       -v
              Increment verbosity level, one level for each -v found on the com&#8208;
              mand line.

PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -autoq &lt;quality&gt; (use with -vf [s]pp)
              Dynamically  changes  the level of postprocessing depending on the
              available spare CPU time.  The number you specify will be the max&#8208;
              imum  level  used.  Usually you can use some big number.  You have
              to use -vf [s]pp without parameters in order for this to work.

       -autosync &lt;factor&gt;
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based on audio delay  measurements.
              Specifying -autosync 0, the default, will cause frame timing to be
              based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Specifying  -autosync
              1  will do the same, but will subtly change the A/V correction al&#8208;
              gorithm.  An uneven video framerate in a movie  which  plays  fine
              with  -nosound  can  often be helped by setting this to an integer
              value greater than 1.  The higher the value, the closer the timing
              will be to -nosound.  Try -autosync 30 to smooth out problems with
              sound drivers which do not implement a perfect  audio  delay  mea&#8208;
              surement.   With this value, if large A/V sync offsets occur, they
              will only take about 1 or 2 seconds to settle out.  This delay  in
              reaction time to sudden A/V offsets should be the only side-effect
              of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.

       -benchmark
              Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped frames at the  end
              of  playback.   Use  in combination with -nosound and -vo null for
              benchmarking only the video codec.
              NOTE: With this option MPlayer will  also  ignore  frame  duration
              when playing only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).

       -colorkey &lt;number&gt;
              Changes  the colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.  0x000000 is
              black and 0xffffff is white.  Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev,
              svga,  vesa,  winvidix,  xmga,  xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck),
              xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -nocolorkey
              Disables colorkeying.  Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev,  svga,
              vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck), xvmc (see
              -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -correct-pts (EXPERIMENTAL)
              Switches MPlayer to an  experimental  mode  where  timestamps  for
              video  frames  are  calculated differently and video filters which
              add new frames or modify timestamps of existing ones are  support&#8208;
              ed.   The more accurate timestamps can be visible for example when
              playing subtitles timed to scene changes  with  the  -ass  option.
              Without  -correct-pts the subtitle timing will typically be off by
              some frames.  This option does not work correctly with some demux&#8208;
              ers and codecs.

       -crash-debug (DEBUG CODE)
              Automatically attaches gdb upon crash or SIGTRAP.  Support must be
              compiled in by configuring with --enable-crash-debug.

       -doubleclick-time
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive  button  presses
              as  a double-click (default: 300).  Set to 0 to let your windowing
              system decide what a double-click is (-vo directx only).
              NOTE: You will  get  slightly  different  behaviour  depending  on
              whether you bind MOUSE_BTN0_DBL or MOUSE_BTN0-MOUSE_BTN0_DBL.

       -edlout &lt;filename&gt;
              Creates  a new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records to
              it.  During playback, the user hits &apos;i&apos; to mark the start  or  end
              of  a  skip  block.  This provides a starting point from which the
              user can fine-tune EDL  entries  later.   See  http://www.mplayer&#8208;
              hq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.

       -edl-backward-delay &lt;number&gt;
              When  using EDL during playback and jumping backwards it is possi&#8208;
              ble to end up in the middle of an EDL record.  In that case MPlay&#8208;
              er  will  seek  further backwards to the start position of the EDL
              record and then immediately skip the scene specified  in  the  EDL
              record.   To avoid this kind of behavior, MPlayer jumps to a fixed
              time interval before the start of the EDL record.  This  parameter
              allows  you  to  specify that time interval in seconds (default: 2
              seconds).

       -edl-start-pts
              Adjust positions in EDL records according to playing file&apos;s  start
              time.  Some formats, especially MPEG TS usually start with non-ze&#8208;
              ro PTS values and when producing EDL file with -edlout option, EDL
              records  contain  absolute  values  that are correct only for this
              particular file.  If re-encoded into a different format, this  EDL
              file  no longer applies.  Specifying -edl-start-pts will automati&#8208;
              cally adjust EDL positions according to start time: when producing
              EDL file, it will substract start time from every EDL record, when
              playing with EDL file, it will add file&apos;s start time to every  EDL
              position.

       -noedl-start-pts
              Disable adjusting EDL positions.

       -enqueue (GUI only)
              Enqueue files given on the command line in the playlist instead of
              playing them immediately.

       -fixed-vo
              Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files (one (un)initial&#8208;
              ization  for all files).  Therefore only one window will be opened
              for all files.  Currently the following drivers are fixed-vo  com&#8208;
              pliant: gl, gl2, mga, svga, x11, xmga, xv, xvidix and dfbmga.

       -framedrop (also see -hardframedrop, experimental without -nocorrect-pts)
              Skip  displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync on slow systems.
              Video filters are not applied to such frames.  For  B-frames  even
              decoding is skipped completely.

       -(no)gui
              Enable  or  disable  the  GUI interface (default depends on binary
              name).  Only works as the first  argument  on  the  command  line.
              Does not work as a config-file option.

       -gui-include &lt;GUI configuration file&gt; (also see -include) (GUI only)
              Specify  a  GUI  configuration file to be parsed after the default
              gui.conf.

       -h, -help, --help
              Show short summary of options.

       -hardframedrop (experimental without -nocorrect-pts)
              More intense frame dropping (breaks  decoding).   Leads  to  image
              distortion!   Note  that especially the libmpeg2 decoder may crash
              with this, so consider using &quot;-vc ffmpeg12,&quot;.

       -heartbeat-cmd
              Command that is executed every 30 seconds during playback via sys&#8208;
              tem() - i.e. using the shell.

              NOTE:  MPlayer  uses this command without any checking, it is your
              responsibility to ensure it does not cause security problems (e.g.
              make  sure  to  use full paths if &quot;.&quot; is in your path like on Win&#8208;
              dows).  It also only works  when  playing  video  (i.e.  not  with
              -novideo but works with -vo null).

              This  can be &quot;misused&quot; to disable screensavers that do not support
              the proper X API (also see -stop-xscreensaver).  If you think this
              is  too  complicated, ask the author of the screensaver program to
              support the proper X APIs.

              EXAMPLE  for  xscreensaver:   mplayer   -heartbeat-cmd   &quot;xscreen&#8208;
              saver-command -deactivate&quot; file

              EXAMPLE    for    GNOME    screensaver:   mplayer   -heartbeat-cmd
              &quot;gnome-screensaver-command -p&quot; file

       -identify
              Shorthand for -msglevel identify=4.  Show file  parameters  in  an
              easily  parseable  format.   Also prints more detailed information
              about subtitle and audio track languages and IDs.  In  some  cases
              you  can  get more information by using -msglevel identify=6.  For
              example, for a DVD or Blu-ray it will list the chapters  and  time
              length  of  each  title,  as well as a disk ID.  Combine this with
              -frames 0 to suppress all video output.  The wrapper script TOOLS/
              midentify.sh  suppresses  the other MPlayer output and (hopefully)
              shellescapes the filenames.

       -idle (also see -slave)
              Makes MPlayer wait idly instead of quitting when there is no  file
              to  play.   Mostly  useful in slave mode where MPlayer can be con&#8208;
              trolled through input commands.
              For gmplayer -idle is the default, -noidle will quit the GUI after
              all files have been played.

       -input &lt;commands&gt;
              This  option  can  be used to configure certain parts of the input
              system.  Paths are relative to ~/.mplayer/.
              NOTE: Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

              Available commands are:

                 conf=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Specify input configuration file other than the default ~/
                      .mplayer/input.conf.   ~/.mplayer/&lt;filename&gt; is assumed if
                      no full path is given.
                 ar-dev=&lt;device&gt;
                      Device to be used for Apple IR Remote (default is  autode&#8208;
                      tected, Linux only).
                 ar-delay
                      Delay  in milliseconds before we start to autorepeat a key
                      (0 to disable).
                 ar-rate
                      Number of key presses to generate per  second  on  autore&#8208;
                      peat.
                 (no)default-bindings
                      Use the key bindings that MPlayer ships with by default.
                 keylist
                      Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
                 cmdlist
                      Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
                 js-dev
                      Specifies the joystick device to use (default: /dev/input/
                      js0).
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Read commands from the given file.  Mostly useful  with  a
                      FIFO.
                      NOTE:  When  the  given  file is a FIFO MPlayer opens both
                      ends so you can do several &apos;echo &quot;seek 10&quot; &gt; mp_pipe&apos;  and
                      the pipe will stay valid.

       -key-fifo-size &lt;2-65000&gt;
              Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7).
              A FIFO of size n can buffer (n-1) events.  If it is too small some
              events  may  be  lost.  If it is too big, MPlayer may seem to hang
              while it processes the buffered events.  To get the same  behavior
              as  before  this  option  was introduced, set it to 2 for Linux or
              1024 for Windows.  For small  value  you  should  disable  double-
              clicks  by  setting  -doubleclick-time to 0 so they do not compete
              with regular events for buffer space.

       -lircconf &lt;filename&gt; (LIRC only)
              Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (default: ~/.lircrc).

       -list-properties
              Print a list of the available properties.

       -loop &lt;number&gt;
              Loops movie playback &lt;number&gt; times.  0 means forever.

       -menu (OSD menu only)
              Turn on OSD menu support.

       -menu-cfg &lt;filename&gt; (OSD menu only)
              Use an alternative menu.conf.

       -menu-chroot &lt;path&gt; (OSD menu only)
              Chroot the file selection menu to a specific location.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -menu-chroot /home
                      Will restrict the file selection menu to /home  and  down&#8208;
                      ward  (i.e. no access to / will be possible, but /home/us&#8208;
                      er_name will).

       -menu-keepdir (OSD menu only)
              File browser starts from the last known location instead  of  cur&#8208;
              rent directory.

       -menu-root &lt;value&gt; (OSD menu only)
              Specify the main menu.

       -menu-startup (OSD menu only)
              Display the main menu at MPlayer startup.

       -mouse-movements
              Permit  MPlayer  to  receive  pointer events reported by the video
              output driver.  Necessary to select  the  buttons  in  DVD  menus.
              Supported  for X11-based VOs (x11, xv, xvmc, etc) and the gl, gl2,
              direct3d and corevideo VOs.

       -noar  Turns off AppleIR remote support.

       -noconsolecontrols
              Prevent MPlayer from reading key events from standard input.  Use&#8208;
              ful  when reading data from standard input.  This is automatically
              enabled when - is found on the command line.  There are situations
              where you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open /dev/stdin (or
              the equivalent on your system), use stdin in a playlist or  intend
              to  read  from  stdin  later on via the loadfile or loadlist slave
              commands.

       -nojoystick
              Turns off joystick support.

       -nolirc
              Turns off LIRC support.

       -nomouseinput
              Disable mouse button press/release  input  (mozplayerxp&apos;s  context
              menu relies on this option).

       -rtc (RTC only)
              Turns  on  usage  of  the Linux RTC (realtime clock - /dev/rtc) as
              timing mechanism.  This wakes up the process every 1/1024  seconds
              to check the current time.  Useless with modern Linux kernels con&#8208;
              figured for desktop use as they already wake up the  process  with
              similar accuracy when using normal timed sleep.

       -playing-msg &lt;string&gt;
              Print out a string before starting playback.  The following expan&#8208;
              sions are supported:

                 ${NAME}
                      Expand to the value of the property NAME.

                 ?(NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is available.

                 ?(!NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is not available.

       -playlist &lt;filename&gt;
              Play files according to a playlist file  (ASX,  Winamp,  SMIL,  or
              one-file-per-line format).
              WARNING:  The  way  MPlayer  parses and uses playlist files is not
              safe against maliciously constructed files.  Such files may  trig&#8208;
              ger  harmful actions.  This has been the case for all MPlayer ver&#8208;
              sions, but unfortunately this fact was not well documented  earli&#8208;
              er,  and  some  people  have  even  misguidedly recommended use of
              -playlist with untrusted sources.  Do NOT use -playlist with  ran&#8208;
              dom internet sources or files you don&apos;t trust!
              NOTE: This option is considered an entry so options found after it
              will apply only to the elements of this playlist.
              FIXME: This needs to be clarified and documented thoroughly.

       -allow-dangerous-playlist-parsing
              This enables parsing any file as a playlist if e.g. a  server  ad&#8208;
              vertises  a file as playlist.  Only enable if you know all servers
              involved are trustworthy.  MPlayer&apos;s playlist code is not designed
              to handle malicious playlist files.

       -rtc-device &lt;device&gt;
              Use the specified device for RTC timing.

       -shuffle
              Play files in random order.

       -skin &lt;name&gt; (GUI only)
              Loads  a  skin from the directory given as parameter below the de&#8208;
              fault skin directories,  ~/.mplayer/skins/  and  /usr/local/share/
              mplayer/skins/.
&#12;              EXAMPLE:
                 -skin fittyfene
                      Tries  ~/.mplayer/skins/fittyfene  and afterwards /usr/lo&#8208;
                      cal/share/mplayer/skins/fittyfene.

       -slave (also see -input)
              Switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as  a  backend  for
              other  programs.  Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer
              will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.
              NOTE: See  -input  cmdlist  for  a  list  of  slave  commands  and
              DOCS/tech/slave.txt  for their description.  Also, this is not in&#8208;
              tended to disable other inputs, e.g. via  the  video  window,  use
              some  other  method  like -input nodefault-bindings:conf=/dev/null
              for that.

       -softsleep
              Time frames by repeatedly checking the  current  time  instead  of
              asking  the kernel to wake up MPlayer at the correct time.  Useful
              if your kernel timing is imprecise and you cannot use the RTC  ei&#8208;
              ther.  Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.

       -sstep &lt;sec&gt;
              Skip &lt;sec&gt; seconds after every frame.  The normal framerate of the
              movie is kept, so playback is accelerated.  Since MPlayer can only
              seek to the next keyframe this may be inexact.

       -udp-ip &lt;ip&gt;
              Sets  the  destination address for datagrams sent by the -udp-mas&#8208;
              ter.  Setting it to a broadcast  address  allows  multiple  slaves
              having  the same broadcast address to sync to the master (default:
              127.0.0.1).

       -udp-master
              Send a datagram to -udp-ip on -udp-port just before  playing  each
              frame.  The datagram indicates the master&apos;s position in the file.

       -udp-port &lt;port&gt;
              Sets  the  destination port for datagrams sent by the -udp-master,
              and the port a -udp-slave listens on (default: 23867).

       -udp-seek-threshold &lt;sec&gt;
              When the master seeks, the slave has to decide whether to seek  as
              well,  or  to  catch up by decoding frames without pausing between
              frames.  If the master is more than &lt;sec&gt; seconds  away  from  the
              slave, the slave seeks.  Otherwise, it &quot;runs&quot; to catch up or waits
              for the master.  This should almost always be left at its  default
              setting of 1 second.

       -udp-slave
              Listen on -udp-port and match the master&apos;s position.

DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS
       -a52drc &lt;level&gt;
              Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC-3 audio streams.
              &lt;level&gt; is a float value ranging from 0 to 1,  where  0  means  no
              compression  and  1  (which is the default) means full compression
              (make loud passages more silent and vice versa).  Values up  to  2
              are  also accepted, but are purely experimental.  This option only
              shows an effect if the AC-3 stream  contains  the  required  range
              compression information.

       -aid &lt;ID&gt; (also see -alang)
              Select  audio  channel  (MPEG: 0-31, AVI/OGM: 1-99, ASF/RM: 0-127,
              VOB(AC-3): 128-159, VOB(LPCM): 160-191, MPEG-TS 17-8190).  MPlayer
              prints  the  available  audio  IDs  when run in verbose (-v) mode.
              When playing an MPEG-TS  stream,  MPlayer/MEncoder  will  use  the
              first program (if present) with the chosen audio stream.

       -ausid &lt;ID&gt; (also see -alang)
              Select  audio  substream  channel.   Currently  the valid range is
              0x55..0x75 and applies only to MPEG-TS when handled by the  native
              demuxer (not by libavformat).  The format type may not be correct&#8208;
              ly identified because of how this information (or lack thereof) is
              embedded  in  the  stream,  but  it will demux correctly the audio
              streams when multiple substreams are present.  MPlayer prints  the
              available substream IDs when run with -identify.

       -alang &lt;language code[,language code,...]&gt; (also see -aid)
              Specify a priority list of audio languages to use.  Different con&#8208;
              tainer formats employ different  language  codes.   DVDs  use  ISO
              639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska, MPEG-TS and NUT use ISO
              639-2 three letter language codes while OGM uses a free-form iden&#8208;
              tifier.   MPlayer  prints the available languages when run in ver&#8208;
              bose (-v) mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -alang hu,en
                      Chooses the Hungarian language track on a  DVD  and  falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -alang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file in Japanese.

       -audio-demuxer &lt;[+]name&gt; (-audiofile only)
              Force  audio  demuxer  type  for -audiofile.  Use a &apos;+&apos; before the
              name to force it, this will skip some checks!   Give  the  demuxer
              name as printed by -audio-demuxer help.  For backward compatibili&#8208;
              ty it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in  libmpdemux/demux&#8208;
              er.h.  -audio-demuxer audio or -audio-demuxer 17 forces MP3.

       -audiofile &lt;filename&gt;
              Play  audio  from  an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while
              viewing a movie.

       -audiofile-cache &lt;kBytes&gt;
              Enables caching for the stream used by -audiofile, using the spec&#8208;
              ified amount of memory.

       -reuse-socket (udp:// only)
              Allows  a  socket to be reused by other processes as soon as it is
              closed.

       -bandwidth &lt;Bytes&gt; (network only)
              Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming  (for  servers
              that  are  able to send content in different bitrates).  Useful if
              you want to watch live streamed media behind  a  slow  connection.
              With  Real  RTSP streaming, it is also used to set the maximum de&#8208;
              livery bandwidth allowing faster cache filling and stream dumping.

       -bluray-angle &lt;angle ID&gt; (Blu-ray only)
              Some Blu-ray discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple
              angles.   Here  you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default:
              1).

       -bluray-chapter &lt;chapter ID&gt; (Blu-ray only)
              Tells MPlayer which Blu-ray chapter to  start  the  current  title
              from (default: 1).

       -bluray-device &lt;path to disc&gt; (Blu-ray only)
              Specify  the  Blu-ray  disc  location.  Must  be  a directory with
              Blu-ray structure.

       -cache &lt;kBytes&gt;
              This option specifies how much memory (in kBytes) to use when pre&#8208;
              caching a file or URL.  Especially useful on slow media.

       -nocache
              Turns off caching.

       -cache-min &lt;percentage&gt;
              Playback will start when the cache has been filled up to &lt;percent&#8208;
              age&gt; of the total.

       -cache-seek-min &lt;percentage&gt;
              If a seek is to be made to a position within &lt;percentage&gt;  of  the
              cache  size  from  the current position, MPlayer will wait for the
              cache to be filled to  this  position  rather  than  performing  a
              stream seek (default: 50).
&#12;       -capture (MPlayer only)
              Allows  capturing  the primary stream (not additional audio tracks
              or other kind of streams) into the file specified by -dumpfile  or
              by default.  If this option is given, capturing can be started and
              stopped by pressing the key bound to this  function  (see  section
              INTERACTIVE  CONTROL).   Same as for -dumpstream, this will likely
              not produce usable results for anything else  than  MPEG  streams.
              Note that, due to cache latencies, captured data may begin and end
              somewhat delayed compared to what you see displayed.

       -cdda &lt;option1:option2&gt; (CDDA only)
              This option can be used to tune the CD Audio  reading  feature  of
              MPlayer.

              Available options are:

                 speed=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set CD spin speed.

                 paranoia=&lt;0-2&gt;
                      Set  paranoia  level.   Values  other than 0 seem to break
                      playback of anything but the first track.
                         0: disable checking (default)
                         1: overlap checking only
                         2: full data correction and verification

                 generic-dev=&lt;value&gt;
                      Use specified generic SCSI device.

                 sector-size=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set atomic read size.

                 overlap=&lt;value&gt;
                      Force minimum overlap search during verification to  &lt;val&#8208;
                      ue&gt; sectors.

                 toc-bias
                      Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported in
                      the TOC will be addressed as LBA 0.  Some  Toshiba  drives
                      need this for getting track boundaries correct.

                 toc-offset=&lt;value&gt;
                      Add &lt;value&gt; sectors to the values reported when addressing
                      tracks.  May be negative.

                 (no)skip
                      (Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.

       -cdrom-device &lt;path to device&gt;
              Specify the CD-ROM device (default: /dev/cdrom).

       -channels &lt;number&gt; (also see -af channels)
              Request the number of playback  channels  (default:  2).   MPlayer
              asks  the  decoder  to  decode  the audio into as many channels as
              specified.  Then it is up to the decoder to fulfill  the  require&#8208;
              ment.   This  is  usually  only important when playing videos with
              AC-3 audio (like DVDs).  In that case liba52 does the decoding  by
              default  and correctly downmixes the audio into the requested num&#8208;
              ber of channels.  To directly control the number of  output  chan&#8208;
              nels independently of how many channels are decoded, use the chan&#8208;
              nels filter.
              NOTE: This option is honored by codecs (AC-3 only), filters  (sur&#8208;
              round) and audio output drivers (OSS at least).

              Available options are:

                 2    stereo
                 4    surround
                 6    full 5.1
                 8    full 7.1

       -chapter &lt;chapter ID&gt;[-&lt;endchapter ID&gt;] (dvd:// and dvdnav:// only)
              Specify  which  chapter  to  start playing at.  Optionally specify
              which chapter to end playing at (default: 1).

       -cookies (network only)
              Send cookies when making HTTP requests.

       -cookies-file &lt;filename&gt; (network only)
              Read  HTTP  cookies  from  &lt;filename&gt;  (default:  ~/.mozilla/  and
              ~/.netscape/)  and  skip reading from default locations.  The file
              is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       -delay &lt;sec&gt;
              audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value)
              Negative values delay the audio, and  positive  values  delay  the
              video.   Note  that this is the exact opposite of the -audio-delay
              MEncoder option.
              NOTE: When used with MEncoder, this is not guaranteed to work cor&#8208;
              rectly with -ovc copy; use -audio-delay instead.

       -ignore-start
              Ignore  the  specified starting time for streams in AVI files.  In
              MPlayer, this nullifies stream delays in files  encoded  with  the
              -audio-delay  option.   During encoding, this option prevents MEn&#8208;
              coder from transferring original stream start  times  to  the  new
              file; the -audio-delay option is not affected.  Note that MEncoder
              sometimes adjusts stream starting times automatically  to  compen&#8208;
              sate  for  anticipated  decoding delays, so do not use this option
              for encoding without testing it first.

       -demuxer &lt;[+]name&gt;
              Force demuxer type.  Use a &apos;+&apos; before the name to force  it,  this
              will  skip  some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -de&#8208;
              muxer help.  For backward compatibility it also accepts the demux&#8208;
              er ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.

       -dumpaudio (MPlayer only)
              Dumps  raw  compressed  audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful with
              MPEG/AC-3, in most other cases the  resulting  file  will  not  be
              playable).   If  you give more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dumpfile &lt;filename&gt; (MPlayer only)
              Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.  Should be used togeth&#8208;
              er with -dumpaudio / -dumpvideo / -dumpstream / -capture.

       -dumpstream (MPlayer only)
              Dumps  the  raw stream to ./stream.dump.  Useful when ripping from
              DVD or  network.   If  you  give  more  than  one  of  -dumpaudio,
              -dumpvideo, -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will
              work.

       -dumpvideo (MPlayer only)
              Dump raw compressed video stream to ./stream.dump  (not  very  us&#8208;
              able).   If  you  give  more  than  one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dvbin &lt;options&gt; (DVB only)
              Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in order to
              override the default ones:

                 card=&lt;1-4&gt;
                      Specifies using card number 1-4 (default: 1).
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Instructs  MPlayer  to  read the channels list from &lt;file&#8208;
                      name&gt;.         Default         is         ~/.mplayer/chan&#8208;
                      nels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc}  (based on your card type) or
                      ~/.mplayer/channels.conf as a last resort.
                 timeout=&lt;1-240&gt;
                      Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying  to  tune  a
                      frequency before giving up (default: 30).

       -dvd-device &lt;path to device&gt; (DVD only)
              Specify  the DVD device or .iso filename (default: /dev/dvd).  You
              can also specify a directory that contains files previously copied
              directly from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).
&#12;       -dvd-speed &lt;factor or speed in KB/s&gt; (DVD only)
              Try to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base speed is
              about 1350KB/s, so a 8x drive can read at speeds up to  10800KB/s.
              Slower  speeds  make  the  drive  more  quiet,  for  watching DVDs
              2700KB/s should be quiet and  fast  enough.   MPlayer  resets  the
              speed  to  the drive default value on close.  Values less than 100
              mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed 8 selects 10800KB/s.
              NOTE: You need write access to the DVD device to change the speed.

       -dvdangle &lt;angle ID&gt; (DVD only)
              Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple an&#8208;
              gles.  Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default: 1).

       -edl &lt;filename&gt;
              Enables  edit  decision list (EDL) actions during playback.  Video
              will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted according
              to  the  entries  in the given file.  See http://www.mplayerhq.hu/
              DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.

       -endpos &lt;[[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]|size[b|kb|mb]&gt; (also see -ss and -sb)
              Stop at given time or byte position.
              NOTE: Byte position may not be accurate, as it can only stop at  a
              frame boundary.  When used in conjunction with -ss option, -endpos
              time will shift forward by seconds specified with  -ss  if  not  a
              byte position.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 56 seconds.
                 -endpos 01:10:00
                      Stop at 1 hour 10 minutes.
                 -ss 10 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 1 minute 6 seconds.
                 mplayer -endpos 100mb
                      Stop playback after reading 100MB of the input file.
                 mencoder -endpos 100mb
                      Encode only 100 MB.

       -forceidx
              Force  index  rebuilding.  Useful for files with broken index (A/V
              desync, etc).  This will enable seeking in files where seeking was
              not  possible.   You  can  fix the index permanently with MEncoder
              (see the documentation).
              NOTE: This option only works  if  the  underlying  media  supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -fps &lt;float value&gt;
              Override  video  framerate.  Useful if the original value is wrong
              or missing.

       -frames &lt;number&gt;
              Play/convert only first &lt;number&gt; frames, then quit.

       -hr-mp3-seek (MP3 only)
              Hi-res MP3 seeking.  Enabled when playing  from  an  external  MP3
              file,  as  we  need to seek to the very exact position to keep A/V
              sync.  Can be slow especially when seeking backwards since it  has
              to rewind to the beginning to find an exact frame position.

       -http-header-fields &lt;field1,field2&gt;
              Set custom HTTP fields when accessing HTTP stream.

              EXAMPLE:
                      mplayer -http-header-fields &apos;Field1: value1&apos;,&apos;Field2: val&#8208;
                      ue2&apos; http://localhost:1234
                      Will generate HTTP request:
                         GET / HTTP/1.0
                         Host: localhost:1234
                         User-Agent: MPlayer
                         Icy-MetaData: 1
                         Field1: value1
                         Field2: value2
                         Connection: close
&#12;       -idx (also see -forceidx)
              Rebuilds index of files if no index was found,  allowing  seeking.
              Useful with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files.
              NOTE:  This  option  only  works  if the underlying media supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -noidx Skip rebuilding index file.  MEncoder skips writing the index with
              this option.

       -ipv4-only-proxy (network only)
              Skip the proxy for IPv6 addresses.  It will still be used for IPv4
              connections.

       -loadidx &lt;index file&gt;
              The file from which to read the video index data saved by  -savei&#8208;
              dx.  This index will be used for seeking, overriding any index da&#8208;
              ta contained in the AVI itself.  MPlayer will not prevent you from
              loading  an index file generated from a different AVI, but this is
              sure to cause unfavorable results.
              NOTE: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer  has  OpenDML  sup&#8208;
              port.

       -mc &lt;seconds/frame&gt;
              maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)
              -mc  0 should always be combined with -noskip for mencoder, other&#8208;
              wise it will almost certainly cause A-V desync.

       -mf &lt;option1:option2:...&gt;
              Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

              Available options are:

                 w=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file width (default: autodetect)
                 h=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file height (default: autodetect)
                 fps=&lt;value&gt;
                      output fps (default: 25)
                 type=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file type (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)

       -ni (AVI only)
              Force usage of non-interleaved AVI parser (fixes playback of  some
              bad AVI files).

       -nobps (AVI only)
              Do  not  use  average  byte/second value for A-V sync.  Helps with
              some AVI files with broken header.

       -noextbased
              Disables extension-based demuxer selection.  By default, when  the
              file  type  (demuxer) cannot be detected reliably (the file has no
              header or it is not reliable enough), the  filename  extension  is
              used  to  select  the demuxer.  Always falls back on content-based
              demuxer selection.

       -passwd &lt;password&gt; (also see -user) (network only)
              Specify password for HTTP authentication.

       -prefer-ipv4 (network only)
              Use IPv4 on network connections.  Falls back on IPv6  automatical&#8208;
              ly.

       -prefer-ipv6 (IPv6 network only)
              Use  IPv6 on network connections.  Falls back on IPv4 automatical&#8208;
              ly.

       -psprobe &lt;byte position&gt;
              When playing an MPEG-PS or MPEG-PES streams, this option lets  you
              specify  how  many bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to scan in
              order to identify the video codec used.  This option is needed  to
              play EVO or VDR files containing H.264 streams.

       -pvr &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (PVR only)
              This  option  tunes various encoding properties of the PVR capture
              module.  It has to be used with any hardware  MPEG  encoder  based
              card   supported   by   the  V4L2  driver.   The  Hauppauge  WinTV
              PVR-150/250/350/500 and all IVTV based cards are known as PVR cap&#8208;
              ture  cards.   Be aware that only Linux 2.6.18 kernel and above is
              able to handle MPEG stream through V4L2 layer.  For hardware  cap&#8208;
              ture  of an MPEG stream and watching it with MPlayer/MEncoder, use
              &apos;pvr://&apos; as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 aspect=&lt;0-3&gt;
                      Specify input aspect ratio:
                         0: 1:1
                         1: 4:3 (default)
                         2: 16:9
                         3: 2.21:1

                 arate=&lt;32000-48000&gt;
                      Specify encoding audio rate (default: 48000 Hz, available:
                      32000, 44100 and 48000 Hz).

                 alayer=&lt;1-3&gt;
                      Specify MPEG audio layer encoding (default: 2).

                 abitrate=&lt;32-448&gt;
                      Specify audio encoding bitrate in kbps (default: 384).

                 amode=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify  audio encoding mode.  Available preset values are
                      &apos;stereo&apos;,  &apos;joint_stereo&apos;,  &apos;dual&apos;  and  &apos;mono&apos;  (default:
                      stereo).

                 vbitrate=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify  average  video bitrate encoding in Mbps (default:
                      6).

                 vmode=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify video encoding mode:
                         vbr: Variable BitRate (default)
                         cbr: Constant BitRate

                 vpeak=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify peak video bitrate encoding in Mbps  (only  useful
                      for VBR encoding, default: 9.6).

                 fmt=&lt;value&gt;
                      Choose an MPEG format for encoding:
                         ps:    MPEG-2 Program Stream (default)
                         ts:    MPEG-2 Transport Stream
                         mpeg1: MPEG-1 System Stream
                         vcd:   Video CD compatible stream
                         svcd:  Super Video CD compatible stream
                         dvd:   DVD compatible stream

       -radio &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (radio only)
              These  options set various parameters of the radio capture module.
              For listening to radio with MPlayer use &apos;radio://&lt;frequency&gt;&apos;  (if
              channels  option  is  not given) or &apos;radio://&lt;channel_number&gt;&apos; (if
              channels option is given) as a movie URL.   You  can  see  allowed
              frequency  range by running MPlayer with &apos;-v&apos;.  To start the grab&#8208;
              bing subsystem, use &apos;radio://&lt;frequency or channel&gt;/capture&apos;.   If
              the capture keyword is not given you can listen to radio using the
              line-in cable only.  Using capture to listen  is  not  recommended
              due  to  synchronization problems, which makes this process uncom&#8208;
              fortable.

              Available options are:

                 device=&lt;value&gt;
                      Radio device to use (default: /dev/radio0  for  Linux  and
                      /dev/tuner0 for *BSD).

                 driver=&lt;value&gt;
                      Radio driver to use (default: v4l2 if available, otherwise
                      v4l).  Currently, v4l and v4l2 drivers are supported.

                 volume=&lt;0..100&gt;
                      sound volume for radio device (default 100)
&#12;                 freq_min=&lt;value&gt; (*BSD BT848 only)
                      minimum allowed frequency (default: 87.50)

                 freq_max=&lt;value&gt; (*BSD BT848 only)
                      maximum allowed frequency (default: 108.00)

                 channels=&lt;frequency&gt;-&lt;name&gt;,&lt;frequency&gt;-&lt;name&gt;,...
                      Set channel list.  Use _ for spaces in names (or play with
                      quoting ;-).  The channel names will then be written using
                      OSD and the  slave  commands  radio_step_channel  and  ra&#8208;
                      dio_set_channel  will  be usable for a remote control (see
                      LIRC).  If given, number in movie URL will be  treated  as
                      channel position in channel list.
                      EXAMPLE: radio://1, radio://104.4, radio_set_channel 1

                 adevice=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Name of device to capture sound from.  Without such a name
                      capture will be disabled, even if the capture keyword  ap&#8208;
                      pears  in  the  URL.   For ALSA devices use it in the form
                      hw=&lt;card&gt;.&lt;device&gt;.  If the device name  contains  a  &apos;=&apos;,
                      the module will use ALSA to capture, otherwise OSS.

                 arate=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Rate in samples per second (default: 44100).
                      NOTE:   When   using  audio  capture  set  also  -rawaudio
                      rate=&lt;value&gt; option with the same value as arate.  If  you
                      have  problems with sound speed (runs too quickly), try to
                      play     with     different     rate     values      (e.g.
                      48000,44100,32000,...).

                 achannels=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Number of audio channels to capture.

       -rawaudio &lt;option1:option2:...&gt;
              This  option  lets you play raw audio files.  You have to use -de&#8208;
              muxer rawaudio as well.  It may also be used  to  play  audio  CDs
              which  are  not 44kHz 16-bit stereo.  For playing raw AC-3 streams
              use -rawaudio format=0x2000 -demuxer rawaudio.

              Available options are:

                 channels=&lt;value&gt;
                      number of channels
                 rate=&lt;value&gt;
                      rate in samples per second
                 samplesize=&lt;value&gt;
                      sample size in bytes
                 bitrate=&lt;value&gt;
                      bitrate for rawaudio files
                 format=&lt;value&gt;
                      fourcc in hex

       -rawvideo &lt;option1:option2:...&gt;
              This option lets you play raw video files.  You have to  use  -de&#8208;
              muxer rawvideo as well.

              Available options are:

                 fps=&lt;value&gt;
                      rate in frames per second (default: 25.0)
                 sqcif|qcif|cif|4cif|pal|ntsc
                      set standard image size
                 w=&lt;value&gt;
                      image width in pixels
                 h=&lt;value&gt;
                      image height in pixels
                 i420|yv12|yuy2|y8
                      set colorspace
                 format=&lt;value&gt;
                      colorspace  (fourcc)  in  hex  or  string  constant.   Use
                      -rawvideo format=help for a list of possible strings.
                 size=&lt;value&gt;
                      frame size in Bytes

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer foreman.qcif -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo qcif
                      Play the famous &quot;foreman&quot; sample video.
                 mplayer   sample-720x576.yuv   -demuxer   rawvideo    -rawvideo
                 w=720:h=576
                      Play a raw YUV sample.

       -referrer &lt;string&gt; (network only)
              Specify a referrer path or URL for HTTP requests.

       -rtsp-port
              Used  with &apos;rtsp://&apos; URLs to force the client&apos;s port number.  This
              option may be useful if you are behind a router and want  to  for&#8208;
              ward the RTSP stream from the server to a specific client.

       -rtsp-destination
              Used with &apos;rtsp://&apos; URLs to force the destination IP address to be
              bound.  This option may be useful with some RTSP server  which  do
              not send RTP packets to the right interface.  If the connection to
              the RTSP server fails, use -v to  see  which  IP  address  MPlayer
              tries  to bind to and try to force it to one assigned to your com&#8208;
              puter instead.

       -rtsp-stream-over-tcp (LIVE555 and NEMESI only)
              Used with &apos;rtsp://&apos; URLs to specify that  the  resulting  incoming
              RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over TCP (using the same TCP con&#8208;
              nection as RTSP).  This option may be useful if you have a  broken
              internet  connection  that does not pass incoming UDP packets (see
              http://www.live555.com/mplayer/).

       -rtsp-stream-over-http (LIVE555 only)
              Used with &apos;http://&apos; URLs to specify that  the  resulting  incoming
              RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over HTTP.

       -saveidx &lt;filename&gt;
              Force index rebuilding and dump the index to &lt;filename&gt;.  Current&#8208;
              ly this only works with AVI files.
              NOTE: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer  has  OpenDML  sup&#8208;
              port.

       -sb &lt;byte position&gt; (also see -ss)
              Seek  to byte position.  Useful for playback from CD-ROM images or
              VOB files with junk at the beginning.

       -speed &lt;0.01-100&gt;
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given  as  parameter.
              Not guaranteed to work correctly with -oac copy.

       -srate &lt;Hz&gt;
              Select  the  output  sample rate to be used (of course sound cards
              have limits on this).  If the sample frequency selected is differ&#8208;
              ent  from  that of the current media, the resample or lavcresample
              audio filter will be inserted into the audio filter layer to  com&#8208;
              pensate  for  the  difference.  The type of resampling can be con&#8208;
              trolled by the -af-adv option.  The  default  is  fast  resampling
              that may cause distortion.

       -ss &lt;time&gt; (also see -sb)
              Seek to given time position.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ss 56
                      Seeks to 56 seconds.
                 -ss 01:10:00
                      Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

       -tskeepbroken
              Tells  MPlayer not to discard TS packets reported as broken in the
              stream.  Sometimes needed to play corrupted MPEG-TS files.

       -tsprobe &lt;byte position&gt;
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, this option lets you  specify  how
              many  bytes  in  the stream you want MPlayer to search for the de&#8208;
              sired audio and video IDs.

       -tsprog &lt;1-65534&gt;
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, you can specify with  this  option
              which  program  (if  present)  you want to play.  Can be used with
              -vid and -aid.

       -tv &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (TV/PVR only)
              This option tunes various properties of  the  TV  capture  module.
              For  watching  TV with MPlayer, use &apos;tv://&apos; or &apos;tv://&lt;channel_num&#8208;
              ber&gt;&apos; or even &apos;tv://&lt;channel_name&gt; (see option channels for  chan&#8208;
              nel_name  below)  as  a  movie  URL.  You can also use &apos;tv:///&lt;in&#8208;
              put_id&gt;&apos; to start watching a movie from a composite or S-Video in&#8208;
              put (see option input for details).

              Available options are:

                 noaudio
                      no sound

                 automute=&lt;0-255&gt; (v4l and v4l2 only)
                      If  signal  strength  reported by device is less than this
                      value, audio and video will be muted.  In most cases auto&#8208;
                      mute=100  will  be  enough.   Default  is 0 (automute dis&#8208;
                      abled).

                 driver=&lt;value&gt;
                      See -tv driver=help for a list  of  compiled-in  TV  input
                      drivers.   available: dummy, v4l, v4l2, bsdbt848 (default:
                      autodetect)

                 device=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify TV device (default: /dev/video0).  NOTE:  For  the
                      bsdbt848 driver you can provide both bktr and tuner device
                      names separating them with a comma, tuner after bktr (e.g.
                      -tv device=/dev/bktr1,/dev/tuner1).

                 input=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify  input  (default:  0  (TV), see console output for
                      available inputs).

                 freq=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify the frequency to set the tuner to (e.g.  511.250).
                      Not compatible with the channels parameter.

                 outfmt=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify the output format of the tuner with a preset value
                      supported by the V4L driver (yv12,  rgb32,  rgb24,  rgb16,
                      rgb15,  uyvy,  yuy2, i420) or an arbitrary format given as
                      hex value.  Try outfmt=help for a list  of  all  available
                      formats.

                 width=&lt;value&gt;
                      output window width

                 height=&lt;value&gt;
                      output window height

                 fps=&lt;value&gt;

                 buffersize=&lt;value&gt;
                      maximum  size of the capture buffer in megabytes (default:
                      dynamical)

                 norm=&lt;value&gt;
                      For bsdbt848 and v4l, PAL, SECAM, NTSC are available.  For
                      v4l2,  see  the console output for a list of all available
                      norms, also see the normid option below.

                 normid=&lt;value&gt; (v4l2 only)
                      Sets the TV norm to the given numeric ID.  The TV norm de&#8208;
                      pends  on  the capture card.  See the console output for a
                      list of available TV norms.

                 channel=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set tuner to &lt;value&gt; channel.

                 chanlist=&lt;value&gt;
                      available: argentina, australia, china-bcast, europe-east,
                      europe-west,  france,  ireland, italy, japan-bcast, japan-

                      ble, us-cable-hrc

                 channels=&lt;chan&gt;-&lt;name&gt;[=&lt;norm&gt;],&lt;chan&gt;-&lt;name&gt;[=&lt;norm&gt;],...
                      Set  names  for  channels.   NOTE: If &lt;chan&gt; is an integer
                      greater than 1000, it will be  treated  as  frequency  (in
                      kHz) rather than channel name from frequency table.
                      Use  _ for spaces in names (or play with quoting ;-).  The
                      channel names will then be  written  using  OSD,  and  the
                      slave   commands   tv_step_channel,   tv_set_channel   and
                      tv_last_channel will be usable for a remote  control  (see
                      LIRC).  Not compatible with the frequency parameter.
                      NOTE:  The channel number will then be the position in the
                      &apos;channels&apos; list, beginning with 1.
                      EXAMPLE: tv://1, tv://TV1, tv_set_channel 1,  tv_set_chan&#8208;
                      nel TV1

                 [brightness|contrast|hue|saturation]=&lt;-100-100&gt;
                      Set the image equalizer on the card.

                 audiorate=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set input audio sample rate.

                 forceaudio
                      Capture  audio even if there are no audio sources reported
                      by v4l.

                 alsa
                      Capture from ALSA.

                 amode=&lt;0-3&gt;
                      Choose an audio mode:
                         0: mono
                         1: stereo
                         2: language 1
                         3: language 2

                 forcechan=&lt;1-2&gt;
                      By default, the count of recorded audio channels is deter&#8208;
                      mined automatically by querying the audio mode from the TV
                      card.  This option allows  forcing  stereo/mono  recording
                      regardless  of the amode option and the values returned by
                      v4l.  This can be used for  troubleshooting  when  the  TV
                      card is unable to report the current audio mode.

                 adevice=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set  an  audio device.  &lt;value&gt; should be /dev/xxx for OSS
                      and a hardware ID for ALSA.  You must replace any &apos;:&apos; by a
                      &apos;.&apos; in the hardware ID for ALSA.

                 audioid=&lt;value&gt;
                      Choose an audio output of the capture card, if it has more
                      than one.

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=&lt;0-65535&gt; (v4l1)

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=&lt;0-100&gt; (v4l2)
                      These options set parameters of the  mixer  on  the  video
                      capture card.  They will have no effect, if your card does
                      not have one.  For v4l2 50 maps to the  default  value  of
                      the control, as reported by the driver.

                 gain=&lt;0-100&gt; (v4l2)
                      Set  gain  control  for video devices (usually webcams) to
                      the desired value and switch  off  automatic  control.   A
                      value  of  0 enables automatic control.  If this option is
                      omitted, gain control will not be modified.

                 immediatemode=&lt;bool&gt;
                      A value of 0 means capture and buffer audio and video  to&#8208;
                      gether  (default for MEncoder).  A value of 1 (default for
                      MPlayer) means to do video capture only and let the  audio
                      go  through a loopback cable from the TV card to the sound
                      card.

                 mjpeg
                      Use hardware MJPEG compression (if the card supports  it).
                      When  using  this  option,  you do not need to specify the
                      width and height of the  output  window,  because  MPlayer
                      will  determine it automatically from the decimation value
                      (see below).

                 decimation=&lt;1|2|4&gt;
                      choose the size of the picture that will be compressed  by
                      hardware MJPEG compression:
                         1: full size
                             704x576    PAL
                             704x480    NTSC
                         2: medium size
                             352x288    PAL
                             352x240    NTSC
                         4: small size
                             176x144    PAL
                             176x120    NTSC

                 quality=&lt;0-100&gt;
                      Choose  the  quality  of the JPEG compression (&lt; 60 recom&#8208;
                      mended for full size).

                 tdevice=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify TV teletext device (example: /dev/vbi0)  (default:
                      none).

                 tformat=&lt;format&gt;
                      Specify TV teletext display format (default: 0):
                         0: opaque
                         1: transparent
                         2: opaque with inverted colors
                         3: transparent with inverted colors

                 tpage=&lt;100-899&gt;
                      Specify initial TV teletext page number (default: 100).

                 tlang=&lt;-1-127&gt;
                      Specify default teletext language code (default: 0), which
                      will be used as primary language until a type 28 packet is
                      received.   Useful  when  the  teletext system uses a non-
                      latin character set, but language codes are not  transmit&#8208;
                      ted  via teletext type 28 packets for some reason.  To see
                      a list of supported language codes set this option to -1.

                 hidden_video_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate stream with video renderer instead of Null  ren&#8208;
                      derer  (default: off).  Will help if video freezes but au&#8208;
                      dio does not.  NOTE: May not work with -vo directx and -vf
                      crop combination.

                 hidden_vp_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate VideoPort pin stream with video renderer instead
                      of removing it from the graph (default: off).   Useful  if
                      your  card has a VideoPort pin and video is choppy.  NOTE:
                      May not work with -vo directx and -vf crop combination.

                 system_clock (dshow only)
                      Use the system clock as sync source instead of the default
                      graph  clock  (usually  the  clock  from  one  of the live
                      sources in graph).

                 normalize_audio_chunks (dshow only)
                      Create audio chunks with a  time  length  equal  to  video
                      frame time length (default: off).  Some audio cards create
                      audio chunks about 0.5s in size, resulting in choppy video
                      when using immediatemode=0.

       -tvscan &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (TV and MPlayer only)
              Tune  the  TV  channel scanner.  MPlayer will also print value for
              &quot;-tv channels=&quot; option, including existing and  just  found  chan&#8208;
              nels.

              Available suboptions are:

                 autostart
                      Begin channel scanning immediately after startup (default:
                      disabled).

                 period=&lt;0.1-2.0&gt;
                      Specify delay in seconds before switching to next  channel
                      (default:  0.5).  Lower values will cause faster scanning,
                      but can detect inactive TV channels as active.

                 threshold=&lt;1-100&gt;
                      Threshold value for the signal strength (in  percent),  as
                      reported  by  the device (default: 50).  A signal strength
                      higher than this value will indicate  that  the  currently
                      scanning channel is active.

       -user &lt;username&gt; (also see -passwd) (network only)
              Specify username for HTTP authentication.

       -user-agent &lt;string&gt;
              Use &lt;string&gt; as user agent for HTTP streaming.
&#12;       -vid &lt;ID&gt;
              Select  video  channel  (MPG: 0-15, ASF: 0-255, MPEG-TS: 17-8190).
              When playing an MPEG-TS  stream,  MPlayer/MEncoder  will  use  the
              first program (if present) with the chosen video stream.

       -vivo &lt;suboption&gt; (DEBUG CODE)
              Force audio parameters for the VIVO demuxer (for debugging purpos&#8208;
              es).  FIXME: Document this.

OSD/SUBTITLE OPTIONS
       NOTE: Also see -vf expand.

       -ass (FreeType only)
              Turn on SSA/ASS subtitle rendering.  With this option, libass will
              be  used  for SSA/ASS external subtitles and Matroska tracks.  You
              may also want to use -embeddedfonts.
              NOTE: Unlike normal OSD, libass uses  fontconfig  by  default.  To
              disable it, use -nofontconfig.

       -ass-border-color &lt;value&gt;
              Sets  the  border  (outline)  color for text subtitles.  The color
              format is RRGGBBAA.

       -ass-bottom-margin &lt;value&gt;
              Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame.  The SSA/ASS render&#8208;
              er can place subtitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -ass-color &lt;value&gt;
              Sets the color for text subtitles.  The color format is RRGGBBAA.

       -ass-font-scale &lt;value&gt;
              Set the scale coefficient to be used for fonts in the SSA/ASS ren&#8208;
              derer.

       -ass-force-style &lt;[Style.]Param=Value[,...]&gt;
              Override some style or script info parameters.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ass-force-style FontName=Arial,Default.Bold=1
                 -ass-force-style PlayResY=768

       -ass-hinting &lt;type&gt;
              Set hinting type.  &lt;type&gt; can be:
                 0    no hinting
                 1    FreeType autohinter, light mode
                 2    FreeType autohinter, normal mode
                 3    font native hinter
                 0-3 + 4
                      The same, but hinting will only be performed if the OSD is
                      rendered  at  screen  resolution and will therefore not be
                      scaled.
                 The default value is 7 (use native hinter for unscaled OSD  and
                 no hinting otherwise).

       -ass-line-spacing &lt;value&gt;
              Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.

       -ass-styles &lt;filename&gt;
              Load  all  SSA/ASS styles found in the specified file and use them
              for rendering text subtitles.  The syntax of the file  is  exactly
              like the [V4 Styles] / [V4+ Styles] section of SSA/ASS.

       -ass-top-margin &lt;value&gt;
              Adds  a  black band at the top of the frame.  The SSA/ASS renderer
              can place toptitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -ass-use-margins
              Enables placing toptitles and subtitles in black borders when they
              are available.

       -dumpjacosub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the
              time-based JACOsub subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.js file  in
              the current directory.

       -dumpmicrodvdsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the
              MicroDVD subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.sub file in the  cur&#8208;
              rent directory.
&#12;       -dumpmpsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert  the  given  subtitle  (specified with the -sub option) to
              MPlayer&apos;s subtitle format, MPsub.  Creates a  dump.mpsub  file  in
              the current directory.

       -dumpsami (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the
              time-based SAMI subtitle format.  Creates a  dumpsub.smi  file  in
              the current directory.

       -dumpsrtsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the
              time-based SubViewer (SRT) subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.srt
              file in the current directory.
              NOTE:  Some  broken  hardware  players choke on SRT subtitle files
              with Unix line endings.  If you are unlucky enough to have such  a
              box,  pass  your subtitle files through unix2dos or a similar pro&#8208;
              gram to replace Unix line endings with DOS/Windows line endings.

       -dumpsub (MPlayer only) (BETA CODE)
              Dumps the subtitle substream  from  VOB  streams.   Also  see  the
              -dump*sub and -vobsubout* options.

       -embeddedfonts (FreeType only)
              Enables extraction of Matroska embedded fonts (default: disabled).
              These fonts can be used for SSA/ASS subtitle rendering  (-ass  op&#8208;
              tion).  Font files are created in the ~/.mplayer/fonts directory.
              NOTE:  With  FontConfig  2.4.2 or newer, embedded fonts are opened
              directly from memory, and this option is enabled by default.

       -ffactor &lt;number&gt;
              Resample the font alphamap.  Can be:
                 0    plain white fonts
                 0.75 very narrow black outline (default)
                 1    narrow black outline
                 10   bold black outline

       -flip-hebrew (FriBiDi only)
              Turns on flipping subtitles using FriBiDi.

       -noflip-hebrew-commas
              Change FriBiDi&apos;s assumptions about the  placements  of  commas  in
              subtitles.  Use this if commas in subtitles are shown at the start
              of a sentence instead of at the end.

       -font &lt;path to font.desc file, path  to  font  (FreeType),  font  pattern
       (Fontconfig)&gt;
              Search  for the OSD/SUB fonts in an alternative directory (default
              for normal fonts: ~/.mplayer/font/font.desc, default for  FreeType
              fonts: ~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf).
              NOTE:  With  FreeType, this option determines the path to the text
              font file.  With Fontconfig, this option determines the Fontconfig
              font pattern.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arial-14/font.desc
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arialuni.ttf
                 -font &apos;Bitstream Vera Sans&apos;
                 -font &apos;Bitstream Vera Sans:style=Bold&apos;

       -fontconfig (fontconfig only)
              Enables the usage of fontconfig managed fonts.
              NOTE:  By default fontconfig is used for libass-rendered subtitles
              and not used for OSD. With -fontconfig it is used for both  libass
              and OSD, with -nofontconfig it is not used at all.

       -forcedsubsonly
              Display only forced subtitles for the DVD subtitle stream selected
              by e.g. -slang.

       -fribidi-charset &lt;charset name&gt; (FriBiDi only)
              Specifies the character set that will be passed  to  FriBiDi  when
              decoding non-UTF-8 subtitles (default: ISO8859-8).

       -ifo &lt;VOBsub IFO file&gt;
              Indicate the file that will be used to load palette and frame size
              for VOBsub subtitles.

       -noautosub
              Turns off automatic subtitle file loading.
&#12;       -osd-duration &lt;time&gt;
              Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms (default: 1000).

       -osd-fractions &lt;0-2&gt;
              Set how fractions of seconds of the current timestamp are  printed
              on the OSD:
                 0    Do not display fractions (default).
                 1    Show the first two decimals.
                 2    Show approximated frame count within current second.  This
                      frame count is not accurate  but  only  an  approximation.
                      For variable fps, the approximation is known to be far off
                      the correct frame count.

       -osdlevel &lt;0-3&gt; (MPlayer only)
              Specifies which mode the OSD should start in.
                 0    subtitles only
                 1    volume + seek (default)
                 2    volume + seek + timer + percentage
                 3    volume + seek + timer + percentage + total time

       -overlapsub
              Allows the next subtitle to be displayed while the current one  is
              still  visible (default is to enable the support only for specific
              formats).

       -progbar-align &lt;0-100&gt;
              Specify the vertical alignment of the progress bar (0:  top,  100:
              bottom, default is 50, i.e. centered).

       -sid &lt;ID&gt; (also see -slang, -vobsubid)
              Display  the  subtitle  stream  specified by &lt;ID&gt; (0-31).  MPlayer
              prints the available subtitle IDs when run in verbose  (-v)  mode.
              If you cannot select one of the subtitles on a DVD, also try -vob&#8208;
              subid.

       -nosub Disables any otherwise auto-selected internal subtitles  (as  e.g.
              the Matroska/mkv demuxer supports).  Use -noautosub to disable the
              loading of external subtitle files.

       -slang &lt;language code[,language code,...]&gt; (also see -sid)
              Specify a priority list of subtitle languages to  use.   Different
              container  formats  employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska  uses  ISO  639-2  three
              letter  language  codes  while  OGM  uses  a free-form identifier.
              MPlayer prints the available languages when run  in  verbose  (-v)
              mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -slang hu,en
                      Chooses  the  Hungarian  subtitle track on a DVD and falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -slang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file with Japanese subtitles.

       -spuaa &lt;mode&gt;
              Antialiasing/scaling mode for DVD/VOBsub.  A value of  16  may  be
              added  to  &lt;mode&gt; in order to force scaling even when original and
              scaled frame size already match.  This can  be  employed  to  e.g.
              smooth subtitles with gaussian blur.  Available modes are:
                 0    none (fastest, very ugly)
                 1    approximate (broken?)
                 2    full (slow)
                 3    bilinear (default, fast and not too bad)
                 4    uses swscaler gaussian blur (looks very good)

       -spualign &lt;-1-2&gt;
              Specify how SPU (DVD/VOBsub) subtitles should be aligned.
                 -1   original position
                  0   Align at top (original behavior, default).
                  1   Align at center.
                  2   Align at bottom.

       -spugauss &lt;0.0-3.0&gt;
              Variance  parameter  of  gaussian  used by -spuaa 4.  Higher means
              more blur (default: 1.0).

       -sub &lt;subtitlefile1,subtitlefile2,...&gt;
              Use/display these subtitle files.  Only one file can be  displayed
              at the same time.

       -sub-bg-alpha &lt;0-255&gt;
              Specify the alpha channel value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.
              Big values mean more transparency.  0 means  completely  transpar&#8208;
              ent.

       -sub-bg-color &lt;0-255&gt;
              Specify  the  color value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.  Cur&#8208;
              rently subtitles are grayscale so this value is equivalent to  the
              intensity of the color.  255 means white and 0 black.

       -sub-demuxer &lt;[+]name&gt; (-subfile only) (BETA CODE)
              Force  subtitle  demuxer  type for -subfile.  Use a &apos;+&apos; before the
              name to force it, this will skip some checks!   Give  the  demuxer
              name  as printed by -sub-demuxer help.  For backward compatibility
              it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in subreader.h.

       -sub-fuzziness &lt;mode&gt;
              Adjust matching fuzziness when searching for subtitles:
                 0    exact match (default)
                 1    Load all subs containing movie name.
                 2    Load all subs in the current and -sub-paths directories.

       -sub-no-text-pp
              Disables any kind of text post processing done after  loading  the
              subtitles.  Used for debug purposes.

       -subalign &lt;0-2&gt;
              Specify  which  edge  of  the  subtitles  should be aligned at the
              height given by -subpos.
                 0    Align subtitle top edge (original behavior).
                 1    Align subtitle center.
                 2    Align subtitle bottom edge (default).

       -subcc &lt;1-4&gt;
              Display DVD Closed Caption (CC) subtitles from the specified chan&#8208;
              nel.   These  are  not  the VOB subtitles, these are special ASCII
              subtitles for the hearing impaired encoded  in  the  VOB  userdata
              stream  on most region 1 DVDs.  CC subtitles have not been spotted
              on DVDs from other regions so far.

       -subcp &lt;codepage&gt; (iconv only)
              If your system supports iconv(3), you can use this option to spec&#8208;
              ify the subtitle codepage.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp latin2
                 -subcp cp1250

       -subcp enca:&lt;language&gt;:&lt;fallback codepage&gt; (ENCA only)
              You  can specify your language using a two letter language code to
              make ENCA detect the codepage  automatically.   If  unsure,  enter
              anything  and  watch  mplayer  -v  output for available languages.
              Fallback codepage specifies the codepage to use,  when  autodetec&#8208;
              tion fails.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp enca:cs:latin2
                      Guess the encoding, assuming the subtitles are Czech, fall
                      back on latin 2, if the detection fails.
                 -subcp enca:pl:cp1250
                      Guess the encoding for Polish, fall back on cp1250.

       -sub-paths &lt;path1,path2,...&gt;
              Specify extra subtitle paths to track in the media directory.

              EXAMPLE: Assuming  that  /path/to/movie/movie.avi  is  played  and
              -sub-paths  sub,subtitles,/tmp/subs is specified, MPlayer searches
              for subtitle files in these directories:
                 /path/to/movie/
                 /path/to/movie/sub/
                 /path/to/movie/subtitles/
                 /tmp/subs/
                 ~/.mplayer/sub/

       -subdelay &lt;sec&gt;
              Delays subtitles by &lt;sec&gt; seconds.  Can be negative.

       -subfile &lt;filename&gt; (BETA CODE)
              Currently useless.  Same as -audiofile, but for  subtitle  streams
              (OggDS?).

       -subfont  &lt;path  to font (FreeType), font pattern (Fontconfig)&gt; (FreeType
       only)
              Sets the subtitle font (see -font).   If  no  -subfont  is  given,
              -font is used.
&#12;       -subfont-autoscale &lt;0-3&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale mode.
              NOTE:  0  means  that text scale and OSD scale are font heights in
              points.

              The mode can be:

                 0    no autoscale
                 1    proportional to movie height
                 2    proportional to movie width
                 3    proportional to movie diagonal (default)

       -subfont-blur &lt;0-8&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the font blur radius (default: 2).

       -subfont-encoding &lt;value&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the font encoding.  When set to  &apos;unicode&apos;,  all  the  glyphs
              from  the font file will be rendered and unicode will be used (de&#8208;
              fault: unicode).

       -subfont-osd-scale &lt;0-100&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale coefficient of the OSD elements (default: 6).

       -subfont-outline &lt;0-8&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the font outline thickness (default: 2).

       -subfont-text-scale &lt;0-100&gt; (FreeType only)
              Sets the subtitle text autoscale coefficient as percentage of  the
              screen size (default: 5).

       -subfps &lt;rate&gt;
              Specify the framerate of the subtitle file (default: movie fps).
              NOTE:  &lt;rate&gt;  &gt; movie fps speeds the subtitles up for frame-based
              subtitle files and slows them down for time-based ones.

       -subpos &lt;0-100&gt; (useful with -vf expand)
              Specify the position of subtitles on the screen.  The value is the
              vertical position of the subtitle in % of the screen height.

       -subwidth &lt;10-100&gt;
              Specify  the maximum width of subtitles on the screen.  Useful for
              TV-out.  The value is the width of the subtitle in % of the screen
              width.

       -noterm-osd
              Disable  the  display of OSD messages on the console when no video
              output is available.

       -term-osd-esc &lt;escape sequence&gt;
              Specify the escape sequence to use before writing an  OSD  message
              on  the  console.   The escape sequence should move the pointer to
              the beginning of the line used for the OSD and clear it  (default:
              ^[[A\r^[[K).

       -unicode
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as unicode.

       -unrarexec &lt;path to unrar executable&gt; (not supported on MingW)
              Specify  the path to the unrar executable so MPlayer can use it to
              access rar-compressed VOBsub files (default: not set, so the  fea&#8208;
              ture  is  off).   The path must include the executable&apos;s filename,
              i.e. /usr/local/bin/unrar.

       -utf8
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UTF-8.

       -vobsub &lt;VOBsub file without extension&gt;
              Specify a VOBsub file to use for subtitles.  Has to  be  the  full
              pathname  without  extension,  i.e.  without the &apos;.idx&apos;, &apos;.ifo&apos; or
              &apos;.sub&apos;.

       -vobsubid &lt;0-31&gt;
              Specify the VOBsub subtitle ID.

AUDIO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -abs &lt;value&gt; (-ao oss only) (OBSOLETE)
              Override audio driver/card buffer size detection.

       -format &lt;format&gt; (also see the format audio filter)
              Select the sample format used for output  from  the  audio  filter
              layer  to  the sound card.  The values that &lt;format&gt; can adopt are
              listed below in the description of the format audio filter.
&#12;       -mixer &lt;device&gt;
              Use a mixer device different from the default /dev/mixer.  For AL&#8208;
              SA this is the mixer name.

       -mixer-channel &lt;mixer line&gt;[,mixer index] (-ao oss and -ao alsa only)
              This  option will tell MPlayer to use a different channel for con&#8208;
              trolling volume than the default PCM.   Options  for  OSS  include
              vol, pcm, line.  For a complete list of options look for SOUND_DE&#8208;
              VICE_NAMES in /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h.  For  ALSA  you  can
              use the names e.g. alsamixer displays, like Master, Line, PCM.
              NOTE: ALSA mixer channel names followed by a number must be speci&#8208;
              fied in the &lt;name,number&gt; format, i.e. a channel labeled  &apos;PCM  1&apos;
              in alsamixer must be converted to PCM,1.

       -softvol
              Force  the  use  of the software mixer, instead of using the sound
              card mixer.

       -softvol-max &lt;10.0-10000.0&gt;
              Set the maximum amplification level in percent (default: 110).   A
              value  of  200 will allow you to adjust the volume up to a maximum
              of double the current level.  With values below  100  the  initial
              volume  (which  is 100%) will be above the maximum, which e.g. the
              OSD cannot display correctly.

       -volstep &lt;0-100&gt;
              Set the step size of mixer volume changes in percent of the  whole
              range (default: 3).

       -volume &lt;-1-100&gt; (also see -af volume)
              Set  the  startup volume in the mixer, either hardware or software
              (if used with -softvol).  A value of -1  (the  default)  will  not
              change the volume.

AUDIO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio output facilities.
       The syntax is:

       -ao &lt;driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]&gt;
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing &apos;,&apos; MPlayer will fall back on drivers not con&#8208;
       tained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omitted.
       NOTE: See -ao help for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -ao alsa,oss,
                      Try the ALSA driver, then the OSS driver, then others.
                 -ao alsa:noblock:device=hw=0.3
                      Sets  noblock-mode  and  the  device-name  as  first card,
                      fourth device.

       Available audio output drivers are:

       alsa
              ALSA 0.9/1.x audio output driver
                 noblock
                      Sets noblock-mode.
                 device=&lt;device&gt;
                      Sets the device name.  Replace any &apos;,&apos; with  &apos;.&apos;  and  any
                      &apos;:&apos;  with  &apos;=&apos;  in the ALSA device name.  For hwac3 output
                      via S/PDIF, use an &quot;iec958&quot; or &quot;spdif&quot; device, unless  you
                      really know how to set it correctly.

       oss
              OSS audio output driver
                 &lt;dsp-device&gt;
                      Sets the audio output device (default: /dev/dsp).
                 &lt;mixer-device&gt;
                      Sets the audio mixer device (default: /dev/mixer).
                 &lt;mixer-channel&gt;
                      Sets the audio mixer channel (default: pcm).

       sdl (SDL only)
              highly platform independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) library
              audio output driver
                 &lt;driver&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the SDL audio driver  to  use  (default:
                      let SDL choose).

       arts
              audio output through the aRts daemon
&#12;       esd
              audio output through the ESD daemon
                 &lt;server&gt;
                      Explicitly  choose  the ESD server to use (default: local&#8208;
                      host).

       jack
              audio output through JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit)
                 port=&lt;name&gt;
                      Connects to the ports with the given name (default: physi&#8208;
                      cal ports).
                 name=&lt;client
                      Client  name  that  is  passed  to  JACK (default: MPlayer
                      [&lt;PID&gt;]).  Useful if you want to have certain  connections
                      established automatically.
                 (no)estimate
                      Estimate the audio delay, supposed to make the video play&#8208;
                      back smoother (default: enabled).
                 (no)autostart
                      Automatically start  jackd  if  necessary  (default:  dis&#8208;
                      abled).   Note  that  this  seems unreliable and will spam
                      stdout with server messages.

       nas
              audio output through NAS

       coreaudio (Mac OS X only)

                      Specify the host and optionally output sink  to  use.   An
                      empty  &lt;host&gt;  string uses a local connection, &quot;localhost&quot;
                      uses network transfer (most likely  not  what  you  want).
                      You  can  also  explicitly force the workaround for broken
                      pause functionality (default: autodetected).  To only  en&#8208;
                      able that without specifying a host/sink the syntax is -ao
                      pulse:::broken_pause

       win32 (Windows only)
              native Windows waveout audio output driver

       dsound (Windows only)
              DirectX DirectSound audio output driver
                 device=&lt;devicenum&gt;
                      Sets  the  device  number  to use.  Playing a file with -v
                      will show a list of available devices.

              -nosound for benchmarking.

       pcm
              raw PCM/wave file writer audio output
                 (no)waveheader
                      Include or do not include the wave  header  (default:  in&#8208;
                      cluded).  When not included, raw PCM will be generated.
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Write  the  sound to &lt;filename&gt; instead of the default au&#8208;

                      ets  in  buffer&quot;  message).   It  is normal that you get a
                      &quot;Your system is too SLOW to play this!&quot; message.

       plugin
              plugin audio output driver

VIDEO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -adapter &lt;value&gt;
              Set the graphics card that will receive the image.  You can get  a
              list  of  available  cards when you run this option with -v.  Cur&#8208;
              rently only works with the directx video output driver.

       -bpp &lt;depth&gt;
              Override the autodetected color depth.  Only supported by the  fb&#8208;
              dev, dga, svga, vesa video output drivers.

       -border
              Play  movie  with window border and decorations.  Since this is on
              by default, use -noborder to disable the standard  window  decora&#8208;
              tions.

       -brightness &lt;-100-100&gt;
              Adjust  the brightness of the video signal (default: 0).  Not sup&#8208;
              ported by all video output drivers.

       -contrast &lt;-100-100&gt;
              Adjust the contrast of the video signal (default:  0).   Not  sup&#8208;
              ported by all video output drivers.

       -display &lt;name&gt; (X11 only)
              Specify  the  hostname and display number of the X server you want
              to display on.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -display xtest.localdomain:0

       -dr
              Turns on direct rendering (not supported by all codecs  and  video
              outputs).   This  can  result  in significantly faster blitting on
              some systems, on most the difference will  be  minimal.   In  some
              cases, particularly with decoders specifying their buffer require&#8208;
              ments badly, it can be vastly slower.

       -fbmode &lt;modename&gt; (-vo fbdev only)
              Change video mode to the one that  is  labeled  as  &lt;modename&gt;  in
              /etc/fb.modes.
              NOTE: VESA framebuffer does not support mode changing.

       -fbmodeconfig &lt;filename&gt; (-vo fbdev only)
              Override  framebuffer  mode  configuration  file  (default:  /etc/
              fb.modes).

       -fs (also see -zoom)
              Fullscreen playback (centers movie, and paints black bands  around
              it).  Not supported by all video output drivers.

       -fsmode-dontuse &lt;0-31&gt; (OBSOLETE, use the -fs option)
              Try this option if you still experience fullscreen problems.

       -fstype &lt;type1,type2,...&gt; (X11 only)
              Specify  a  priority list of fullscreen modes to be used.  You can
              negate the modes by prefixing them with &apos;-&apos;.   If  you  experience
              problems like the fullscreen window being covered by other windows
              try using a different order.
              NOTE: See -fstype help for a full list of available modes.

              The available types are:

                 above
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_ABOVE hint if available.
                 below
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_BELOW hint if available.
                 fullscreen
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint if available.
                 layer
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the default layer.
                 layer=&lt;0...15&gt;
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the given layer number.
                 netwm
                      Force NETWM style.
                 none
                      Clear the list of modes; you can add modes to  enable  af&#8208;
                      terward.
                 stays_on_top
                      Use _NETWM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP hint if available.

              EXAMPLE:
                 layer,stays_on_top,above,fullscreen
                      Default  order, will be used as a fallback if incorrect or
                      unsupported modes are specified.
                 -fullscreen
                      Fixes fullscreen switching on OpenBox 1.x.

       -gamma &lt;-100-100&gt;
              Adjust the gamma of the video signal (default: 0).  Not  supported
              by all video output drivers.

       -geometry x[%][:y[%]] or [WxH][+-x+-y]
              Adjust  where  the output is on the screen initially.  The x and y
              specifications are in pixels measured from  the  top-left  of  the
              screen  to the top-left of the image being displayed, however if a
              percentage sign is given after the argument it turns the value in&#8208;
              to  a  percentage  of  the screen size in that direction.  It also
              supports the standard X11 -geometry option format, in  which  e.g.
              +10-50  means  &quot;place 10 pixels from the left border and 50 pixels
              from the lower border&quot; and &quot;--20+-10&quot; means &quot;place 20  pixels  be&#8208;
              yond the right and 10 pixels beyond the top border&quot;.  If an exter&#8208;
              nal window is specified using the -wid option, then the  x  and  y
              coordinates  are  relative  to  the  top-left corner of the window
              rather than the screen.   The  coordinates  are  relative  to  the
              screen  given  with  -xineramascreen  for the video output drivers
              that fully support -xineramascreen (direct3d, gl, gl2, vdpau, x11,
              xv, xvmc, corevideo).
              NOTE:  This  option  is only supported by the x11, xmga, xv, xvmc,
              xvidix, gl, gl2, direct3d, directx, fbdev, sdl, dfxfb  and  corev&#8208;
              ideo video output drivers.

              EXAMPLE:
                 50:40
                      Places the window at x=50, y=40.
                 50%:50%
                      Places the window in the middle of the screen.
                 100%
                      Places  the  window at the middle of the right edge of the
                      screen.
                 100%:100%
                      Places the window  at  the  bottom  right  corner  of  the
                      screen.

       -gui-wid &lt;window ID&gt; (also see -wid) (GUI only)
              This  tells  the GUI to also use an X11 window and stick itself to
              the bottom of the video, which is useful to embed a mini-GUI in  a
              browser (with the MPlayer plugin for instance).

       -hue &lt;-100-100&gt;
              Adjust  the  hue  of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get a
              colored negative of the image with this option.  Not supported  by
              all video output drivers.

       -monitor-dotclock &lt;range[,range,...]&gt; (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the dotclock or pixelclock range of the monitor.

       -monitor-hfreq &lt;range[,range,...]&gt; (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the horizontal frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitor-vfreq &lt;range[,range,...]&gt; (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the vertical frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitoraspect &lt;ratio&gt; (also see -aspect)
              Set  the  aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.  A value of 0
              disables a previous setting (e.g. in the config file).   Overrides
              the -monitorpixelaspect setting if enabled.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -monitoraspect 4:3  or 1.3333
                 -monitoraspect 16:9 or 1.7777

       -monitorpixelaspect &lt;ratio&gt; (also see -aspect)
              Set the aspect of a single pixel of your monitor or TV screen (de&#8208;
              fault: 1).  A value of 1 means square  pixels  (correct  for  (al&#8208;
              most?) all LCDs).

       -name (X11 only)
              Set the window class name.

       -nodouble
              Disables  double buffering, mostly for debugging purposes.  Double
              buffering fixes flicker by storing two frames in memory, and  dis&#8208;
              playing one while decoding another.  It can affect OSD negatively,
              but often removes OSD flickering.

       -nograbpointer
              Do not grab the mouse pointer after a  video  mode  change  (-vm).
              Useful for multihead setups.

       -nokeepaspect
              Do not keep window aspect ratio when resizing windows.  Only works
              with the x11, xv, xmga,  xvidix,  directx  video  output  drivers.
              Furthermore  under X11 your window manager has to honor window as&#8208;
              pect hints.

       -ontop
              Makes the player window stay on top of other  windows.   Supported
              by  video output drivers which use X11, except SDL, as well as di&#8208;
              rectx, corevideo, quartz, ggi and gl2.

       -panscan &lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of  e.g.  a
              16:9 movie to make it fit a 4:3 display without black bands).  The
              range controls how much of the image is cropped.  Only works  with
              the  xv,  xmga,  mga,  gl, gl2, quartz, corevideo and xvidix video
              output drivers.
              NOTE: Values between -1 and 0 are allowed as well, but highly  ex&#8208;
              perimental and may crash or worse.  Use at your own risk!

       -panscanrange &lt;-19.0-99.0&gt; (experimental)
              Change  the  range of the pan-and-scan functionality (default: 1).
              Positive values mean multiples of  the  default  range.   Negative
              numbers  mean  you  can zoom in up to a factor of -panscanrange+1.
              E.g. -panscanrange -3 allows a zoom factor of up to 4.  This  fea&#8208;
              ture is experimental.  Do not report bugs unless you are using -vo
              gl.

       -refreshrate &lt;Hz&gt;
              Set the monitor refreshrate in Hz.  Currently  only  supported  by
              -vo directx combined with the -vm option.

       -rootwin
              Play movie in the root window (desktop background).  Desktop back&#8208;
              ground images may cover the movie window, though.  Only works with
              the  x11,  xv,  xmga,  xvidix, quartz, corevideo and directx video
              output drivers.

       -saturation &lt;-100-100&gt;
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0).   You  can
              get grayscale output with this option.  Not supported by all video
              output drivers.

       -screenh &lt;pixels&gt;
              Specify the screen height for video output drivers  which  do  not
              know the screen resolution like fbdev, x11 and TV-out.

       -screenw &lt;pixels&gt;
              Specify  the  screen  width  for video output drivers which do not
              know the screen resolution like fbdev, x11 and TV-out.

       -(no)stop-xscreensaver (X11 only)
              Turns off xscreensaver at startup and turns it on  again  on  exit
              (default:  enabled).  If your screensaver supports neither the XSS
              nor XResetScreenSaver API please use -heartbeat-cmd instead.

       -title (also see -use-filename-title)
              Set the window title.  Supported by X11-based video  output  driv&#8208;
              ers.

       -use-filename-title (also see -title)
              Set  the  window title using the media filename, when not set with
              -title.  Supported by X11-based video output drivers.

       -vm
              Try to change to a different video mode.  Supported  by  the  dga,
              x11,  xv,  sdl and directx video output drivers.  If used with the
              directx video output driver the -screenw, -screenh, -bpp and  -re&#8208;
              freshrate options can be used to set the new display mode.

       -vsync
              Enables VBI for the vesa, dfbmga and svga video output drivers.

       -wid &lt;window ID&gt; (also see -gui-wid) (X11, OpenGL and DirectX only)
              This tells MPlayer to attach to an existing window.  Useful to em&#8208;
              bed MPlayer in a browser (e.g. the plugger extension).   This  op&#8208;
              tion  fills the given window completely, thus aspect scaling, pan&#8208;
              scan, etc are no longer handled by MPlayer but must be managed  by
              the application that created the window.

       -xineramascreen &lt;-2-...&gt;
              In  Xinerama  configurations  (i.e.  a  single  desktop that spans
              across multiple displays) this option tells MPlayer  which  screen
              to  display  the  movie on.  A value of -2 means fullscreen across
              the whole virtual display (in this case  Xinerama  information  is
              completely ignored), -1 means fullscreen on the display the window
              currently is on.  The initial position set via the  -geometry  op&#8208;
              tion  is relative to the specified screen.  Will usually only work
              with &quot;-fstype -fullscreen&quot; or &quot;-fstype none&quot;.  This option is  not
              suitable  to  only  set the startup screen (because it will always
              display on the given screen in fullscreen mode), -geometry is  the
              best  that  is available for that purpose currently.  Supported by
              at least the direct3d, gl, gl2, x11, xv and corevideo video output
              drivers.

       -zrbw (-vo zr only)
              Display  in black and white.  For optimal performance, this can be
              combined with &apos;-lavdopts gray&apos;.

       -zrcrop &lt;[width]x[height]+[x offset]+[y offset]&gt; (-vo zr only)
              Select a part of the input image to display, multiple  occurrences
              of  this  option  switch  on  cinerama mode.  In cinerama mode the
              movie is distributed over more than one TV (or beamer) to create a
              larger  image.   Options appearing after the n-th -zrcrop apply to
              the n-th MJPEG card, each card should at least have  a  -zrdev  in
              addition  to the -zrcrop.  For examples, see the output of -zrhelp
              and the Zr section of the documentation.

       -zrdev &lt;device&gt; (-vo zr only)
              Specify the device special file that belongs to your  MJPEG  card,
              by  default  the zr video output driver takes the first v4l device
              it can find.

       -zrfd (-vo zr only)
              Force decimation: Decimation, as specified by -zrhdec and -zrvdec,
              only  happens  if the hardware scaler can stretch the image to its
              original size.  Use this option to force decimation.

       -zrhdec &lt;1|2|4&gt; (-vo zr only)
              Horizontal decimation: Ask the driver to send only  every  2nd  or
              4th  line/pixel  of  the input image to the MJPEG card and use the
              scaler of the MJPEG card to stretch  the  image  to  its  original
              size.

       -zrhelp (-vo zr only)

VIDEO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Video output drivers are interfaces to different video output facilities.
       The syntax is:

       -vo &lt;driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]&gt;
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing &apos;,&apos; MPlayer will fall back on drivers not con&#8208;
       tained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omitted.
       NOTE: See -vo help for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -vo xmga,xv,
                      Try  the  Matrox X11 driver, then the Xv driver, then oth&#8208;
                      ers.
                 -vo directx:noaccel
                      Uses the DirectX driver with acceleration features  turned
                      off.

       Available video output drivers are:

       xv (X11 only)
              Uses the XVideo extension of XFree86 4.x to enable hardware accel&#8208;
              erated playback.  If you cannot use a  hardware  specific  driver,
              this is probably the best option.  For information about what col&#8208;
              orkey is used and how it is drawn run MPlayer with -v  option  and
              look out for the lines tagged with [xv common] at the beginning.
                 adaptor=&lt;number&gt;
                      Select a specific XVideo adaptor (check xvinfo results).
                 port=&lt;number&gt;
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 ck=&lt;cur|use|set&gt;
                      Select  the  source  from which the colorkey is taken (de&#8208;
                      fault: cur).
                         cur  The default takes the colorkey  currently  set  in
                              Xv.
                         use  Use  but do not set the colorkey from MPlayer (use
                              -colorkey option to change it).
                         set  Same as use but also sets the supplied colorkey.
                 ck-method=&lt;man|bg|auto&gt;
                      Sets the colorkey drawing method (default: man).
                         man  Draw the colorkey  manually  (reduces  flicker  in
                              some cases).
                         bg   Set the colorkey as window background.
                         auto Let Xv draw the colorkey.

       x11 (X11 only)

              rently only supported by tdfx_vid.
                 &lt;vo_driver&gt;
                      Select  the  driver  to use as source to overlay on top of
                      X11.

       vdpau (with -vc ffmpeg12vdpau, ffwmv3vdpau,  ffvc1vdpau,  ffh264vdpau  or
       ffodivxvdpau)
              Video  output  that uses VDPAU to decode video via hardware.  Also
              supports displaying of software-decoded video.
                 sharpen=&lt;-1-1&gt;
                      For positive values, apply a sharpening algorithm  to  the
                      video,  for negative values a blurring algorithm (default:
                      0).
                 denoise=&lt;0-1&gt;
                      Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the  video  (default:

                         1    Show only first field, similar to -vf field.
                         2    Bob deinterlacing, similar to -vf tfields=1.
                         3    motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing May lead to
                              A/V  desync  with  slow video hardware and/or high
                              resolution.  This is the default if &quot;D&quot; is used to
                              enable deinterlacing.
                         4    motion  adaptive temporal deinterlacing with edge-

                 chroma-deint
                      Makes  temporal  deinterlacers  operate  both  on luma and
                      chroma (default).  Use nochroma-deint to solely  use  luma
                      and  speed  up  advanced  deinterlacing.  Useful with slow
                      video memory.
                 pullup
                      Try to skip deinterlacing for progressive  frames,  useful
                      for  watching telecined content, needs fast video hardware
                      for high resolutions.  Only  works  with  motion  adaptive
                      temporal deinterlacing.
                 colorspace
                      Select the color space for YUV to RGB conversion.  In gen&#8208;
                      eral BT.601 should be used for  standard  definition  (SD)
                      content  and BT.709 for high definition (HD) content.  Us&#8208;
                      ing incorrect color space results  in  slightly  under  or
                      over saturated and shifted colors.
                         0    Guess  the  color space based on video resolution.

                              sumed  to  be  HD  and  BT.709 color space will be
                              used.
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space (default).
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 hqscaling
                         0    Use default VDPAU scaling (default).
                         1-9  Apply high quality VDPAU  scaling  (needs  capable
                              hardware).
                 force-mixer
                      Forces  the  use  of the VDPAU mixer, which implements all
                      above options (default).  Use noforce-mixer to allow  dis&#8208;
                      playing  BGRA colorspace.  (Disables all above options and
                      the hardware equalizer if image format  BGRA  is  actually
                      used.)

       sdl (SDL only, buggy/outdated)
              Highly platform independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) library
              video  output  driver.   Since SDL uses its own X11 layer, MPlayer
              X11 options do not have any effect on SDL.  Note that it has  sev&#8208;
              eral  minor  bugs  (-vm/-novm  is mostly ignored, -fs behaves like
              -novm should, window is in top-left  corner  when  returning  from
              fullscreen, panscan is not supported, ...).

                      Specify video mode to use.  The mode can  be  given  in  a
                      &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;x&lt;colors&gt; format, e.g. 640x480x16M or be a
                      graphics mode number, e.g. 84.
                 bbosd
                      Draw OSD into black bands below the movie (slower).
                 native
                      Use only native drawing  functions.   This  avoids  direct
                      rendering, OSD and hardware acceleration.
                 retrace
                      Force  frame switch on vertical retrace.  Usable only with
                      -double.  It has the same effect as the -vsync option.
                 sq
                      Try to select a video mode with square pixels.
                 vidix
                      Use svga with VIDIX.

       gl
              OpenGL video output driver, simple version.  Video  size  must  be
              smaller  than  the maximum texture size of your OpenGL implementa&#8208;
              tion.  Intended to work even with the most basic OpenGL  implemen&#8208;
              tations,  but also makes use of newer extensions, which allow sup&#8208;
              port for more colorspaces and direct rendering.  For optimal speed
              try adding the options
              -dr -noslices
              The  code performs very few checks, so if a feature does not work,
              this might be because it is not supported by your card/OpenGL  im&#8208;
              plementation even if you do not get any error message.  Use glxin&#8208;
              fo or a similar tool to display the supported OpenGL extensions.
                 backend=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the backend/OpenGL implementation to use  (default:
                      -1).
                         -1: Autoselect
                         0: Win32/WGL
                         1: X11/GLX
                         2: SDL
                         3: X11/EGL (highly experimental)
                 (no)ati-hack
                      ATI  drivers may give a corrupted image when PBOs are used
                      (when using -dr or force-pbo).  This option fixes this, at
                      the expense of using a bit more memory.
                 (no)force-pbo
                      Always  uses  PBOs  to  transfer textures even if this in&#8208;
                      volves an extra copy.  Currently this gives a little extra
                      speed  with  NVidia  drivers and a lot more speed with ATI
                      drivers.  May need -noslices and the ati-hack suboption to
                      work correctly.
                 (no)scaled-osd
                      Changes  the way the OSD behaves when the size of the win&#8208;
                      dow changes (default:  disabled).   When  enabled  behaves
                      more  like the other video output drivers, which is better
                      for fixed-size fonts.  Disabled  looks  much  better  with
                      FreeType  fonts  and  uses the borders in fullscreen mode.
                      Does not work correctly with ass subtitles (see -ass), you
                      can  instead  render  them  without OpenGL support via -vf
                      ass.
                 osdcolor=&lt;0xAARRGGBB&gt;
                      Color for OSD (default: 0x00ffffff,  corresponds  to  non-
                      transparent white).
                 rectangle=&lt;0,1,2&gt;
                      Select  usage  of  rectangular  textures which saves video
                      RAM, but often is slower (default: 0).
                         0: Use power-of-two textures (default).
                         1: Use the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension.
                         2: Use the  GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two  extension.
                         In  some cases only supported in software and thus very
                         slow.
                 swapinterval=&lt;n&gt;
                      Minimum interval between two buffer swaps, counted in dis&#8208;
                      played  frames  (default: 1).  1 is equivalent to enabling
                      VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.  Values below 0 will leave it
                      at the system default.  This limits the framerate to (hor&#8208;
                      izontal refresh rate / n).  Requires  GLX_SGI_swap_control
                      support  to  work.   With some (most/all?) implementations
                      this only works in fullscreen mode.
                 ycbcr
                      Use the GL_MESA_ycbcr_texture extension to convert YUV  to
                      RGB.   In  most  cases  this is probably slower than doing
                      software conversion to RGB.
                 yuv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.  The default  is
                      auto-detection deciding between values 0 and 2.
                         0: Use software conversion.  Compatible with all OpenGL
                         versions.  Provides brightness, contrast and saturation
                         control.
                         1: Use register combiners.  This uses an nVidia-specif&#8208;
                         ic  extension  (GL_NV_register_combiners).   At   least
                         three  texture  units  are needed.  Provides saturation
                         and hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         2: Use a  fragment  program.   Needs  the  GL_ARB_frag&#8208;
                         ment_program  extension  and  at  least  three  texture
                         units.  Provides brightness, contrast,  saturation  and
                         hue control.
                         3:  Use  a  fragment program using the POW instruction.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least  three  texture units.  Provides brightness, con&#8208;
                         trast, saturation, hue and gamma  control.   Gamma  can
                         also  be  set  independently  for  red, green and blue.
                         Method 4 is usually faster.
                         4: Use  a  fragment  program  with  additional  lookup.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least four texture units.   Provides  brightness,  con&#8208;
                         trast,  saturation,  hue  and gamma control.  Gamma can
                         also be set independently for red, green and blue.
                         5: Use ATI-specific method (for older cards).  This us&#8208;
                         es  an ATI-specific extension (GL_ATI_fragment_shader -
                         not GL_ARB_fragment_shader!).  At least  three  texture
                         units are needed.  Provides saturation and hue control.
                         This method is fast but inexact.
                         6: Use a 3D texture to do conversion via lookup.  Needs
                         the GL_ARB_fragment_program extension and at least four
                         texture units.  Extremely slow (software emulation)  on
                         some (all?) ATI cards since it uses a texture with bor&#8208;
                         der pixels.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation,
                         hue  and gamma control.  Gamma can also be set indepen&#8208;
                         dently for red, green and blue.  Speed depends more  on
                         GPU memory bandwidth than other methods.
                 colorspace
                      Select the color space for YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0    Use  the  formula  used  normally  by MPlayer (de&#8208;
                              fault).
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space.
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 levelconv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the brightness level conversion to use for the  YUV
                      to RGB conversion
                         0    Convert TV to PC levels (default).
                         1    Convert PC to TV levels.
                         2    Do not do any conversion.
                 lscale=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select  the scaling function to use for luminance scaling.
                      Only valid for yuv modes 2, 3, 4 and 6.
                         0    Use simple linear filtering (default).
                         1    Use bicubic B-spline filtering  (better  quality).
                              Needs  one  additional  texture unit.  Older cards
                              will not be able to  handle  this  for  chroma  at
                              least in fullscreen mode.
                         2    Use  cubic filtering in horizontal, linear filter&#8208;
                              ing in vertical direction.  Works on  a  few  more
                              cards than method 1.
                         3    Same  as  1  but  does  not  use a lookup texture.
                              Might be faster on some cards.
                         4    Use experimental unsharp masking with 3x3  support
                              and   a  default  strength  of  0.5  (see  filter-
                              strength).
                         5    Use experimental unsharp masking with 5x5  support
                              and   a  default  strength  of  0.5  (see  filter-
                              strength).
                 cscale=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the scaling function to use for  chrominance  scal&#8208;
                      ing.  For details see lscale.
                 filter-strength=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set the effect strength for the lscale/cscale filters that
                      support it.
                 noise-strength=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set how much noise to add. 0 to disable (default), 1.0 for
                      level suitable for dithering to 6 bit.
                 stereo=&lt;value&gt;
                      Select  a  method for stereo display.  You may have to use
                      -aspect to fix the aspect value.  Add 32 to swap left  and
                      right side.  Experimental, do not expect too much from it.
                         0    normal 2D display
                         1    Convert  side by side input to full-color red-cyan
                              stereo.
                         2    Convert side by side input to full-color green-ma&#8208;
                              genta stereo.
                         3    Convert side by side input to quadbuffered stereo.
                              Only supported by very few OpenGL cards.

              The following options are only useful if writing your own fragment
              programs.

                 customprog=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Load  a  custom  fragment  program  from  &lt;filename&gt;.  See
                      TOOLS/edgedect.fp for an example.
                 customtex=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Load a custom &quot;gamma ramp&quot; texture from &lt;filename&gt;.   This
                      can  be used in combination with yuv=4 or with the custom&#8208;
                      prog option.
                 (no)customtlin
                      If enabled (default) use GL_LINEAR  interpolation,  other&#8208;
                      wise use GL_NEAREST for customtex texture.
                 (no)customtrect
                      If  enabled,  use texture_rectangle for customtex texture.
                      Default is disabled.
                 (no)mipmapgen
                      If enabled, mipmaps for the video are automatically gener&#8208;
                      ated.   This should be useful together with the customprog
                      and the TXB instruction to implement blur filters  with  a
                      large  radius.   For  most  OpenGL implementations this is
                      very slow for any non-RGB formats.  Default is disabled.

              Normally there is no reason to use  the  following  options,  they
              mostly exist for testing purposes.

                 (no)glfinish
                      Call  glFinish()  before  swapping buffers.  Slower but in
                      some cases more correct output (default: disabled).
                 (no)manyfmts
                      Enables support for more (RGB and BGR) color formats  (de&#8208;
                      fault: enabled).  Needs OpenGL version &gt;= 1.2.
                 slice-height=&lt;0-...&gt;
                      Number  of  lines copied to texture in one piece (default:
                      0).  0 for whole image.
                      NOTE: If YUV colorspace is used (see yuv suboption),  spe&#8208;
                      cial rules apply:
                         If  the  decoder  uses slice rendering (see -noslices),
                         this setting has no effect, the size of the  slices  as
                         provided by the decoder is used.
                         If  the  decoder  does not use slice rendering, the de&#8208;
                         fault is 16.
                 (no)osd
                      Enable or disable support for  OSD  rendering  via  OpenGL
                      (default:  enabled).   This option is for testing; to dis&#8208;
                      able the OSD use -osdlevel 0 instead.
                 (no)aspect
                      Enable or disable aspect scaling and pan-and-scan  support
                      (default: enabled).  Disabling might increase speed.

       gl2
              Variant of the OpenGL video output driver.  Supports videos larger
              than the maximum texture size but lacks many of the advanced  fea&#8208;
              tures and optimizations of the gl driver and is unlikely to be ex&#8208;
              tended further.
                 (no)glfinish
                      same as gl (default: enabled)
                 yuv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.  If set to  any&#8208;
                      thing  except  0 OSD will be disabled and brightness, con&#8208;
                      trast and gamma setting is only available via the global X
                      server settings.  Apart from this the values have the same
                      meaning as for -vo gl.

       matrixview
              OpenGL-based renderer creating a Matrix-like running-text effect.
                 cols=&lt;n&gt;
                      Number of text columns to display.  Very low values (&lt; 16)
                      will  probably fail due to scaler limitations.  Values not
                      divisible by 16 may cause issues as well.
                 rows=&lt;n&gt;
                      Number of text rows to display.  Very low  values  (&lt;  16)
                      will  probably fail due to scaler limitations.  Values not

              Produces no video output.  Useful for benchmarking.

       aa
              ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.
              NOTE: The driver does not handle -aspect correctly.
              HINT: You  probably  have  to  specify  -monitorpixelaspect.   Try
              &apos;mplayer -vo aa -monitorpixelaspect 0.5&apos;.

       caca
              Color ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.

       bl
              Video  playback using the Blinkenlights UDP protocol.  This driver
              is highly hardware specific.
                 &lt;subdevice&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the Blinkenlights  subdevice  driver  to
                      use.   It  is something like arcade:host=localhost:2323 or
                      hdl:file=name1,file=name2.  You must specify a subdevice.

       ggi
              GGI graphics system video output driver
                 &lt;driver&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the GGI driver to use.  Replace any  &apos;,&apos;
                      that would appear in the driver string by a &apos;.&apos;.

       directfb
              Play video using the DirectFB library.
                 (no)input
                      Use the DirectFB instead of the MPlayer keyboard code (de&#8208;
                      fault: enabled).
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      Double and triple buffering give best results if you  want
                      to  avoid  tearing issues.  Triple buffering is more effi&#8208;
                      cient than double buffering as it does not  block  MPlayer
                      while  waiting for the vertical retrace.  Single buffering
                      should be avoided (default: single).
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      Control the output order for interlaced  frames  (default:
                      disabled).   Valid values are top = top fields first, bot&#8208;
                      tom = bottom fields first.  This option does not have  any
                      effect  on progressive film material like most MPEG movies
                      are.  You need to enable this option if you  have  tearing
                      issues  or unsmooth motions watching interlaced film mate&#8208;
                      rial.
                 layer=N
                      Will force layer with ID N for playback (default: -1 - au&#8208;
                      to).
                 dfbopts=&lt;list&gt;
                      Specify a parameter list for DirectFB.

              first head.
                 (no)input
                      same as directfb (default: disabled)
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      same as directfb (default: triple)
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      same as directfb
                 (no)bes
                      Enable the use of the Matrox  BES  (backend  scaler)  (de&#8208;
                      fault:  disabled).   Gives  very  good  results concerning
                      speed and output quality as interpolated picture  process&#8208;
                      ing is done in hardware.  Works only on the primary head.
                 (no)spic
                      Make  use  of  the Matrox sub picture layer to display the
                      OSD (default: enabled).
                 (no)crtc2
                      Turn on TV-out on the second head (default: enabled).  The
                      output  quality is amazing as it is a full interlaced pic&#8208;
                      ture with proper sync to every odd/even field.
                 tvnorm=pal|ntsc|auto
                      Will set the TV norm of the Matrox card without  the  need
                      for  modifying /etc/directfbrc (default: disabled).  Valid
                      norms are pal = PAL, ntsc = NTSC.  Special  norm  is  auto
                      (auto-adjust using PAL/NTSC) because it decides which norm
                      to use by looking at the framerate of the movie.

       yuv4mpeg
              Transforms the video stream into a sequence  of  uncompressed  YUV
              4:2:0 images and stores it in a file (default: ./stream.yuv).  The
              format is the same as the one employed by mjpegtools, so  this  is
              useful if you want to process the video with the mjpegtools suite.
              It supports the YV12 format.  If your source file has a  different
              format and is interlaced, make sure to use -vf scale=::1 to ensure
              the conversion uses interlaced mode.  You can combine it with  the
              -fixed-vo option to concatenate files with the same dimensions and
              fps value.
                 interlaced
                      Write the output as interlaced frames, top field first.
                 interlaced_bf
                      Write the output as interlaced frames, bottom field first.
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Write the output to  &lt;filename&gt;  instead  of  the  default
                      stream.yuv.

              NOTE:  If  you do not specify any option the output is progressive
              (i.e. not interlaced).

       gif89a
              Output each frame into a single animated GIF file in  the  current
              directory.  It supports only RGB format with 24 bpp and the output
              is converted to 256 colors.
                 &lt;fps&gt;
                      Float value to specify framerate (default: 5.0).
                 &lt;output&gt;
                      Specify the output filename (default: ./out.gif).

              NOTE: You must specify the framerate before the  filename  or  the
              framerate will be part of the filename.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.nut -vo gif89a:fps=15:output=test.gif

                      is maximum compression.
                 outdir=&lt;dirname&gt;
                      Specify  the  directory to save the PNG files to (default:
                      ./).
                 prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;
                      Specify the prefix to be used for the PNG  filenames  (de&#8208;
                      fault: no prefix).
                 alpha
                      Create PNG files with an alpha channel.  Note that MPlayer
                      in general does not support alpha, so this  will  only  be
                      useful in some rare cases.

       mng
              Output  video  into  an  animated MNG file using 24 bpp RGB images
              with lossless compression.
                 output=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Specify the output filename (default: out.mng).

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.mkv -vo mng:output=test.mng

       tga
              Output each frame into a Targa  file  in  the  current  directory.
              Each  file  takes  the  frame  number padded with leading zeros as
              name.  The purpose of this video output driver is to have a simple
              lossless  image  writer  to  use without any external library.  It
              supports the BGR[A] color format, with 15, 24 and 32 bpp.  You can
              force a particular format with the format video filter.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.nut -vf format=bgr15 -vo tga

DECODING/FILTERING OPTIONS
       -ac &lt;[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]&gt;
              Specify  a  priority list of audio codecs to be used, according to
              their codec name in codecs.conf.  Use a &apos;-&apos; before the codec  name
              to  omit  it.   Use  a &apos;+&apos; before the codec name to force it, this
              will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing  &apos;,&apos;  MPlayer  will
              fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -ac help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ac mp3acm
                      Force the l3codeca.acm MP3 codec.
                 -ac mad,
                      Try libmad first, then fall back on others.
                 -ac hwac3,a52,
                      Try hardware AC-3 passthrough, software AC-3, then others.
                 -ac hwdts,
                      Try hardware DTS passthrough, then fall back on others.
                 -ac -ffmp3,
                      Skip FFmpeg&apos;s MP3 decoder.

       -af-adv &lt;force=(0-7):list=(filters)&gt; (also see -af)
              Specify advanced audio filter options:

                 force=&lt;0-7&gt;
                      Forces  the  insertion of audio filters to one of the fol&#8208;
                      lowing:
                         0: Use completely automatic filter insertion (currently
                         identical to 1).
                         1: Optimize for accuracy (default).
                         2:  Optimize  for speed.  Warning: Some features in the
                         audio filters may silently fail, and the sound  quality
                         may drop.
                         3:  Use  no automatic insertion of filters and no opti&#8208;
                         mization.  Warning: It may be possible to crash MPlayer
                         using this setting.
                         4:  Use  automatic  insertion of filters according to 0
                         above, but use floating point processing when possible.
                         5: Use automatic insertion of filters  according  to  1
                         above, but use floating point processing when possible.
                         6:  Use  automatic  insertion of filters according to 2
                         above, but use floating point processing when possible.
                         7: Use no automatic insertion of filters according to 3
                         above, and use floating point processing when possible.

                 list=&lt;filters&gt;
                      Same as -af.

       -afm &lt;driver1,driver2,...&gt;
              Specify  a  priority  list of audio codec families to be used, ac&#8208;
              cording to their codec name in codecs.conf.  Falls back on the de&#8208;
              fault codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -afm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -afm ffmpeg
                      Try FFmpeg&apos;s libavcodec codecs first.
                 -afm acm,dshow
                      Try Win32 codecs first.

       -aspect &lt;ratio&gt; (also see -zoom)
              Override  movie aspect ratio, in case aspect information is incor&#8208;
              rect or missing in the file being played.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -aspect 4:3  or -aspect 1.3333
                 -aspect 16:9 or -aspect 1.7777

       -noaspect
              Disable automatic movie aspect ratio compensation.

       -field-dominance &lt;-1-1&gt;
              Set first field for interlaced content.  Useful for  deinterlacers
              that  double  the  framerate:  -vf tfields=1, -vf yadif=1, -vo vd&#8208;
              pau:deint and -vo xvmc:bobdeint.
                 -1   auto (default): If the decoder does not export the  appro&#8208;
                      priate information, it falls back to 0 (top field first).
                 0    top field first
                 1    bottom field first

       -flip
              Flip image upside-down.

       -lavdopts &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (DEBUG CODE)
              Specify libavcodec decoding parameters.  Separate multiple options
              with a colon.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -lavdopts gray:skiploopfilter=all:skipframe=nonref

              Available options are:

                 bitexact
                      Only use bit-exact algorithms in all decoding  steps  (for
                      codec testing).

                 bug=&lt;value&gt;
                      Manually work around encoder bugs.
                         0: nothing

                      tion  and  might  potentially cause problems, like simpler
                      dequantization, simpler motion compensation, assuming  use
                      of the default quantization matrix, assuming YUV 4:2:0 and
                      skipping a few checks to detect damaged bitstreams.

                 gray

                 idct=&lt;0-99&gt; (see -lavcopts)
                      For best decoding quality use the same IDCT algorithm  for
                      decoding  and encoding.  This may come at a price in accu&#8208;
                      racy, though.

                 lowres=&lt;number&gt;[,&lt;w&gt;]
                      Decode at lower resolutions.  Low resolution  decoding  is
                      not  supported  by all codecs, and it will often result in
                      ugly artifacts.  This is not a bug, but a side  effect  of
                      not decoding at full resolution.
                         0: disabled

                      If  &lt;w&gt;  is specified lowres decoding will be used only if
                      the width of the video is major than or equal to &lt;w&gt;.
                 o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]  Pass AVOptions to libav&#8208;
                 codec  decoder.  Note, a patch to make the o= unneeded and pass
                 all unknown options through the AVOption system is welcome.   A
                 full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFmpeg manual.  Note
                 that some options may conflict with MEncoder options.

                      EXAMPLE:
                           o=debug=pict

                 sb=&lt;number&gt; (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip the given number of macroblock rows at the bottom.

                 st=&lt;number&gt; (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip the given number of macroblock rows at the top.

                 skiploopfilter=&lt;skipvalue&gt; (H.264 only)
                      Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264 decod&#8208;
                      ing.   Since  the filtered frame is supposed to be used as
                      reference for decoding dependent frames this has  a  worse
                      effect on quality than not doing deblocking on e.g. MPEG-2
                      video.  But at least for high bitrate HDTV this provides a
                      big speedup with no visible quality loss.

                      &lt;skipvalue&gt; can be either one of the following:
                         none: Never skip.
                         default:  Skip  useless  processing  steps (e.g. 0 size
                         packets in AVI).
                         nonref: Skip frames that are not referenced  (i.e.  not
                         used for decoding other frames, the error cannot &quot;build
                         up&quot;).
                         bidir: Skip B-Frames.
                         nonkey: Skip all frames except keyframes.
                         all: Skip all frames.

                 skipidct=&lt;skipvalue&gt; (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      Skips the IDCT step.  This degrades quality a  lot  of  in
                      almost  all  cases  (see skiploopfilter for available skip
                      values).

                 skipframe=&lt;skipvalue&gt;
                      Skips decoding of frames  completely.   Big  speedup,  but
                      jerky motion and sometimes bad artifacts (see skiploopfil&#8208;
                      ter for available skip values).

                 threads=&lt;1-8&gt; (MPEG-1/2 and H.264 only)
                      number of threads to use for decoding (default: 1)

                 vismv=&lt;value&gt;
                      Visualize motion vectors.
                         0: disabled
                         1: Visualize forward predicted MVs of P-frames.
                         2: Visualize forward predicted MVs of B-frames.
                         4: Visualize backward predicted MVs of B-frames.

                 vstats
                      Prints some statistics and stores them in ./vstats_*.log.

                 wait_keyframe
                      Wait for a keyframe before  displaying  anything.   Avoids
                      broken  frames  at startup or after seeking with some for&#8208;
                      mats.

       -noslices
              Disable drawing video by  16-pixel  height  slices/bands,  instead
              draws  the  whole frame in a single run.  May be faster or slower,
              depending on video card and available cache.  It has  effect  only
              with libmpeg2 and libavcodec codecs.

       -nosound
              Do not play/encode sound.  Useful for benchmarking.

       -novideo
              Do  not  play/encode video.  In many cases this will not work, use
              -vc null -vo null instead.

       -pp &lt;quality&gt; (also see -vf pp)
              Set the DLL postprocess level.  This option is  no  longer  usable
              with -vf pp.  It only works with Win32 DirectShow DLLs with inter&#8208;
              nal postprocessing routines.  The valid range of -pp values varies
              by codec, it is mostly 0-6, where 0=disable, 6=slowest/best.

       -pphelp (also see -vf pp)
              Show  a  summary about the available postprocess filters and their
              usage.

       -ssf &lt;mode&gt;
              Specifies software scaler parameters.

                 -vf scale -ssf lgb=3.0
                 lgb=&lt;0-100&gt;
                      gaussian blur filter (luma)
                 cgb=&lt;0-100&gt;
                      gaussian blur filter (chroma)
                 ls=&lt;-100-100&gt;
                      sharpen filter (luma)
                 cs=&lt;-100-100&gt;
                      sharpen filter (chroma)
                 chs=&lt;h&gt;
                      chroma horizontal shifting
                 cvs=&lt;v&gt;
                      chroma vertical shifting

       -stereo &lt;mode&gt;
              Select type of MP2/MP3 stereo output.
                 0    stereo
                 1    left channel
                 2    right channel

       -sws &lt;software scaler type&gt; (also see -vf scale and -zoom)
              Specify the software scaler algorithm to be used  with  the  -zoom
              option.  This affects video output drivers which lack hardware ac&#8208;
              celeration, e.g. x11.

              Available types are:

                 0    fast bilinear
                 1    bilinear
                 2    bicubic (good quality) (default)
                 3    experimental
                 4    nearest neighbor (bad quality)
                 5    area
                 6    luma bicubic / chroma bilinear
                 7    gauss
                 8    sincR
                 9    lanczos
                 10   natural bicubic spline

              NOTE: Some -sws options are tunable.  The description of the scale
              video filter has further information.

       -vc &lt;[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]&gt;
              Specify  a  priority list of video codecs to be used, according to
              their codec name in codecs.conf.  Use a &apos;-&apos; before the codec  name
              to  omit  it.   Use  a &apos;+&apos; before the codec name to force it, this
              will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing  &apos;,&apos;  MPlayer  will
              fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -vc help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vc divx
                      Force Win32/VfW DivX codec, no fallback.
                 -vc -divxds,-divx,
                      Skip Win32 DivX codecs.
                 -vc ffmpeg12,mpeg12,
                      Try  libavcodec&apos;s MPEG-1/2 codec, then libmpeg2, then oth&#8208;
                      ers.

       -vfm &lt;driver1,driver2,...&gt;
              Specify a priority list of video codec families to  be  used,  ac&#8208;
              cording  to their names in codecs.conf.  Falls back on the default
              codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -vfm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vfm ffmpeg,dshow,vfw
                      Try the libavcodec, then Directshow, then VfW  codecs  and
                      fall back on others, if they do not work.
                 -vfm xanim
                      Try XAnim codecs first.

       -x &lt;x&gt; (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale  image  to width &lt;x&gt; (if software/hardware scaling is avail&#8208;
              able).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -xvidopts &lt;option1:option2:...&gt;
              Specify additional parameters when decoding with Xvid.
              NOTE: Since libavcodec is faster than Xvid you might want  to  use
              the  libavcodec  postprocessing  filter (-vf pp) and decoder (-vfm
              ffmpeg) instead.

              Xvid&apos;s internal postprocessing filters:
                 deblock-chroma (also see -vf pp)
                      chroma deblock filter
                 deblock-luma (also see -vf pp)
                      luma deblock filter
                 dering-luma (also see -vf pp)
                      luma deringing filter
                 dering-chroma (also see -vf pp)
                      chroma deringing filter
                 filmeffect (also see -vf noise)
                      Adds artificial film grain to  the  video.   May  increase
                      perceived quality, while lowering true quality.

              rendering methods:
                 dr2
                      Activate direct rendering method 2.
                 nodr2
                      Deactivate direct rendering method 2.

       -xy &lt;value&gt; (also see -zoom)
                 value&lt;=8
                      Scale image by factor &lt;value&gt;.
                 value&gt;8
                      Set  width  to  value and calculate height to keep correct
                      aspect ratio.

       -y &lt;y&gt; (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale image to height &lt;y&gt; (if software/hardware scaling is  avail&#8208;
              able).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -zoom
              Allow  software scaling, where available.  This will allow scaling
              with output drivers (like x11, fbdev) that do not support hardware
              scaling  where MPlayer disables scaling by default for performance
              reasons.

AUDIO FILTERS
       Audio filters allow you to modify the audio stream  and  its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -af &lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;
              Setup a chain of audio filters.

       NOTE: To get a full list of available audio filters, see -af help.

       Audio  filters  are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

       -af-add &lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -af-pre &lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -af-del &lt;index1[,index2,...]&gt;
              Deletes the filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start  at
              0, negative numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the last).

       -af-clr
              Completely empties the filter list.
&#12;       Available filters are:

       resample[=srate[:sloppy[:type]]]
              Changes  the  sample rate of the audio stream.  Can be used if you
              have a fixed frequency sound card or if you are stuck with an  old
              sound  card  that  is only capable of max 44.1kHz.  This filter is
              automatically enabled if necessary.  It only supports 16-bit inte&#8208;
              ger and float in native-endian format as input.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate &lt;srate&gt;.
                 &lt;srate&gt;
                      output  sample  frequency in Hz.  The valid range for this
                      parameter is 8000 to 192000.  If the input and output sam&#8208;
                      ple frequency are the same or if this parameter is omitted
                      the filter is automatically unloaded.  A high sample  fre&#8208;
                      quency  normally  improves  the  audio quality, especially
                      when used in combination with other filters.
                 &lt;sloppy&gt;
                      Allow (1) or disallow (0) the output frequency  to  differ
                      slightly from the frequency given by &lt;srate&gt; (default: 1).
                      Can be used if the startup of the  playback  is  extremely
                      slow.
                 &lt;type&gt;
                      Select which resampling method to use.
                         0:  linear interpolation (fast, poor quality especially
                         when upsampling)
                         1: polyphase filterbank and integer processing
                         2: polyphase filterbank and floating  point  processing
                         (slow, best quality)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af resample=44100:0:0
                      would  set  the output frequency of the resample filter to
                      44100Hz using exact output frequency  scaling  and  linear
                      interpolation.

       lavcresample[=srate[:length[:linear[:count[:cutoff]]]]]
              Changes  the sample rate of the audio stream to an integer &lt;srate&gt;
              in Hz.  It only supports the 16-bit native-endian format.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate &lt;srate&gt;.
                 &lt;srate&gt;
                      the output sample rate
                 &lt;length&gt;
                      length of the filter with respect to  the  lower  sampling
                      rate (default: 16)
                 &lt;linear&gt;
                      if  1  then  filters will be linearly interpolated between
                      polyphase entries
                 &lt;count&gt;
                      log2 of the number of polyphase  entries  (...,  10-&gt;1024,
                      11-&gt;2048, 12-&gt;4096, ...)  (default: 10-&gt;1024)
                 &lt;cutoff&gt;
                      cutoff  frequency  (0.0-1.0),  default  set depending upon
                      filter length

       lavcac3enc[=tospdif[:bitrate[:minchn]]]
              Encode multi-channel audio to AC-3 at  runtime  using  libavcodec.
              Supports  16-bit  native-endian  input format, maximum 6 channels.
              The output is big-endian when outputting a raw  AC-3  stream,  na&#8208;
              tive-endian  when outputting to S/PDIF.  The output sample rate of
              this filter is same with the input sample rate.  When input sample
              rate  is  48kHz,  44.1kHz,  or 32kHz, this filter directly use it.
              Otherwise a resampling filter is auto-inserted before this  filter
              to  make  the  input and output sample rate be 48kHz.  You need to
              specify &apos;-channels N&apos; to make the decoder  decode  audio  into  N-
              channel, then the filter can encode the N-channel input to AC-3.
                 &lt;tospdif&gt;
                      Output  raw  AC-3  stream  if  zero  or not set, output to
                      S/PDIF for passthrough when &lt;tospdif&gt; is set non-zero.
                 &lt;bitrate&gt;
                      The bitrate to encode the AC-3 stream.  Set it  to  either
                      384  or 384000 to get 384kbits.  Valid values: 32, 40, 48,
                      56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256,
                                    320, 384, 448, 512, 576, 640 Default bitrate
                      is  based on the input channel number: 1ch: 96,  2ch: 192,
                      3ch: 224,  4ch: 384,  5ch: 448,  6ch: 448
                 &lt;minchn&gt;
                      If the input channel number is  less  than  &lt;minchn&gt;,  the
                      filter will detach itself (default: 5).

       sweep[=speed]
              Produces a sine sweep.
                 &lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
                      Sine  function  delta,  use  very  low  values to hear the
                      sweep.

       sinesuppress[=freq:decay]
              Remove a sine at the specified frequency.  Useful to  get  rid  of
              the 50/60Hz noise on low quality audio equipment.  It probably on&#8208;
              ly works on mono input.
                 &lt;freq&gt;
                      The frequency of the sine which should be removed (in  Hz)
                      (default: 50)
                 &lt;decay&gt;
                      Controls the adaptivity (a larger value will make the fil&#8208;
                      ter adapt to amplitude and phase changes quicker, a small&#8208;
                      er  value  will  make  the  adaptation  slower)  (default:
                      0.0001).  Reasonable values are around 0.001.
&#12;       bs2b[=option1:option2:...]
              Bauer stereophonic to binaural transformation using libbs2b.   Im&#8208;
              proves the headphone listening experience by making the sound sim&#8208;
              ilar to that from loudspeakers, allowing each  ear  to  hear  both
              channels  and  taking into account the distance difference and the
              head shadowing effect.  It is applicable only to 2 channel audio.
                 fcut=&lt;300-1000&gt;
                      Set cut frequency in Hz.
                 feed=&lt;10-150&gt;
                      Set feed level for low frequencies in 0.1*dB.
                 profile=&lt;value&gt;
                      Several profiles are available for convenience:
                           default
                                will be  used  if  nothing  else  was  specified
                                (fcut=700, feed=45)
                           cmoy
                                Chu   Moy   circuit   implementation  (fcut=700,
                                feed=60)
                           jmeier
                                Jan  Meier  circuit  implementation   (fcut=650,
                                feed=95)

              If  fcut  or  feed  options are specified together with a profile,
              they will be applied on top of the selected profile.

       hrtf[=flag]
              Head-related transfer function: Converts multichannel audio  to  2
              channel  output  for  headphones, preserving the spatiality of the
              sound.

       equalizer=[g1:g2:g3:...:g10]
              10 octave band graphic equalizer, implemented using  10  IIR  band
              pass filters.  This means that it works regardless of what type of
              audio is being played back.  The center  frequencies  for  the  10
              bands are:

              No. frequency
              0    31.25 Hz
              1    62.50 Hz
              2   125.00 Hz
              3   250.00 Hz
              4   500.00 Hz
              5    1.00 kHz
              6    2.00 kHz
              7    4.00 kHz
              8    8.00 kHz
              9   16.00 kHz

              If  the  sample  rate  of the sound being played is lower than the
              center frequency for a frequency band, then that band will be dis&#8208;
              abled.   A  known bug with this filter is that the characteristics
              for the uppermost band are not completely symmetric if the  sample
              rate  is close to the center frequency of that band.  This problem
              can be worked around by upsampling the sound  using  the  resample
              filter before it reaches this filter.
                 &lt;g1&gt;:&lt;g2&gt;:&lt;g3&gt;:...:&lt;g10&gt;
                      floating  point  numbers  representing  the gain in dB for
                      each frequency band (-12-12)

                      Would amplify the sound in the upper and  lower  frequency
                      region while canceling it almost completely around 1kHz.

       channels=nch[:nr:from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...]
              Can  be used for adding, removing, routing and copying audio chan&#8208;
              nels.  If only &lt;nch&gt; is given the  default  routing  is  used,  it
              works  as follows: If the number of output channels is bigger than
              the number of input channels empty channels are  inserted  (except
              mixing  from  mono to stereo, then the mono channel is repeated in
              both of the output channels).  If the number of output channels is
              smaller  than  the number of input channels the exceeding channels
              are truncated.
                 &lt;nch&gt;
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 &lt;nr&gt;
                      number of routes (1-8)
                 &lt;from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...&gt;
                      Pairs of numbers between 0 and  7  that  define  where  to
                      route each channel.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af channels=4:4:0:1:1:0:2:2:3:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number  of  channels to 4 and set up 4
                      routes that swap channel 0 and channel 1 and leave channel
                      2  and  3  intact.   Observe  that if media containing two
                      channels was played back, channels 2 and 3  would  contain
                      silence but 0 and 1 would still be swapped.
                 mplayer -af channels=6:4:0:0:0:1:0:2:0:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number  of  channels to 6 and set up 4
                      routes that copy channel 0 to channels 0 to 3.  Channel  4
                      and 5 will contain silence.
&#12;       format[=format] (also see -format)
              Convert  between  different sample formats.  Automatically enabled
              when needed by the sound card or another filter.
                 &lt;format&gt;
                      Sets the desired format.  The general form is &apos;sbe&apos;, where
                      &apos;s&apos; denotes the sign (either &apos;s&apos; for signed or &apos;u&apos; for un&#8208;
                      signed), &apos;b&apos; denotes the number of bits per sample (16, 24
                      or  32) and &apos;e&apos; denotes the endianness (&apos;le&apos; means little-
                      endian, &apos;be&apos; big-endian and &apos;ne&apos;  the  endianness  of  the
                      computer  MPlayer  is  running on).  Valid values (amongst
                      others) are: &apos;s16le&apos;, &apos;u32be&apos; and &apos;u24ne&apos;.  Exceptions  to
                      this  rule  that are also valid format specifiers: u8, s8,
                      floatle, floatbe, floatne, mulaw,  alaw,  mpeg2,  ac3  and
                      imaadpcm.

       volume[=v[:sc]]
              Implements  software volume control.  Use this filter with caution
              since it can reduce the signal to noise ratio of  the  sound.   In
              most  cases  it is best to set the level for the PCM sound to max,
              leave this filter out and control the output level to your  speak&#8208;
              ers  with  the  master  volume control of the mixer.  In case your
              sound card has a digital PCM mixer instead of an analog  one,  and
              you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead.  If there is an
              external amplifier connected to the computer (this is  almost  al&#8208;
              ways  the case), the noise level can be minimized by adjusting the
              master level and the volume knob on the amplifier until the  hiss&#8208;
              ing noise in the background is gone.
              This  filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maximum
              sound level and prints out that level when  MPlayer  exits.   This
              volume  estimate  can  be used for setting the sound level in MEn&#8208;
              coder such that the maximum dynamic range is utilized.  This  fea&#8208;
              ture  currently  only  works  with  floating-point  data, use e.g.
              -af-adv force=5, or use -af stats.
              NOTE: This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only  be  en&#8208;
              abled once for every audio stream.
                 &lt;v&gt;
                      Sets the desired gain in dB for all channels in the stream
                      from -200dB to +60dB, where -200dB mutes  the  sound  com&#8208;
                      pletely and +60dB equals a gain of 1000 (default: 0).
                 &lt;sc&gt;
                      Turns  soft clipping on (1) or off (0).  Soft-clipping can
                      make the sound more smooth if very high volume levels  are
                      used.   Enable  this  option  if  the dynamic range of the
                      loudspeakers is very low.
                      WARNING: This feature creates  distortion  and  should  be
                      considered a last resort.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af volume=10.1:0 media.avi
                      Would  amplify  the  sound  by 10.1dB and hard-clip if the
                      sound level is too high.

       pan=n[:L00:L01:L02:...L10:L11:L12:...Ln0:Ln1:Ln2:...]
              Mixes channels arbitrarily.  Basically a combination of the volume
              and the channels filter that can be used to down-mix many channels
              to only a few, e.g. stereo to mono or vary the &quot;width&quot; of the cen&#8208;
              ter  speaker  in  a surround sound system.  This filter is hard to
              use, and will require some tinkering before the desired result  is
              obtained.   The  number  of options for this filter depends on the
              number of output channels.  An example how to downmix a  six-chan&#8208;
              nel  file to two channels with this filter can be found in the ex&#8208;
              amples section near the end.
                 &lt;n&gt;
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 &lt;Lij&gt;
                      How much of input channel i is mixed into output channel j
                      (0-1).   So  in  principle you first have n numbers saying
                      what to do with the first input channel,  then  n  numbers
                      that  act  on the second input channel etc.  If you do not
                      specify any numbers for some input channels, 0 is assumed.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af pan=1:0.5:0.5 media.avi
                      Would down-mix from stereo to mono.
                 mplayer -af pan=3:1:0:0.5:0:1:0.5 media.avi
                      Would give 3 channel output leaving channels 0 and  1  in&#8208;
                      tact,  and  mix  channels  0  and  1 into output channel 2
                      (which could be sent to a subwoofer for example).

       sub[=fc:ch]
              Adds a subwoofer channel to the audio stream.  The audio data used
              for  creating  the subwoofer channel is an average of the sound in
              channel 0 and channel 1.  The resulting  sound  is  then  low-pass
              filtered  by  a 4th order Butterworth filter with a default cutoff
              frequency of 60Hz and added to a separate  channel  in  the  audio
              stream.
              Warning:  Disable this filter when you are playing DVDs with Dolby
              Digital 5.1 sound, otherwise this filter will disrupt the sound to
              the subwoofer.
                 &lt;fc&gt;
                      cutoff  frequency  in  Hz for the low-pass filter (20Hz to
                      300Hz) (default: 60Hz) For the best result try setting the
                      cutoff  frequency  as  low as possible.  This will improve
                      the stereo or surround sound experience.
                 &lt;ch&gt;
                      Determines the channel number in which to insert the  sub-
                      channel audio.  Channel number can be between 0 and 7 (de&#8208;
                      fault: 5).  Observe that the number of channels will auto&#8208;
                      matically be increased to &lt;ch&gt; if necessary.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af sub=100:4 -channels 5 media.avi
                      Would  add a sub-woofer channel with a cutoff frequency of
                      100Hz to output channel 4.

       center
              Creates a center channel from the front channels.   May  currently
              be  low  quality  as  it does not implement a high-pass filter for
              proper extraction yet, but averages and halves  the  channels  in&#8208;
              stead.
                 &lt;ch&gt;
                      Determines  the channel number in which to insert the cen&#8208;
                      ter channel.  Channel number can be between 0 and  7  (de&#8208;
                      fault: 5).  Observe that the number of channels will auto&#8208;
                      matically be increased to &lt;ch&gt; if necessary.

       surround[=delay]
              Decoder for matrix encoded surround  sound  like  Dolby  Surround.
              Many files with 2 channel audio actually contain matrixed surround
              sound.  Requires a sound card supporting at least 4 channels.
                 &lt;delay&gt;
                      delay time in ms for the rear speakers (0  to  1000)  (de&#8208;
                      fault:  20)  This delay should be set as follows: If d1 is
                      the distance from the  listening  position  to  the  front
                      speakers  and  d2 is the distance from the listening posi&#8208;
                      tion to the rear speakers, then the delay should be set to
                      15ms if d1 &lt;= d2 and to 15 + 5*(d1-d2) if d1 &gt; d2.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af surround=15 -channels 4 media.avi
                      Would  add surround sound decoding with 15ms delay for the
                      sound to the rear speakers.

       delay[=ch1:ch2:...]
              Delays the sound to the loudspeakers such that the sound from  the
              different channels arrives at the listening position simultaneous&#8208;
              ly.  It is only useful if you have more than 2 loudspeakers.
                 ch1,ch2,...
                      The delay in ms that should be  imposed  on  each  channel
                      (floating point number between 0 and 1000).

              To  calculate  the required delay for the different channels do as
              follows:

              1. Measure the distance to the loudspeakers in meters in  relation
                 to  your  listening position, giving you the distances s1 to s5
                 (for a 5.1 system).  There is no point in compensating for  the
                 subwoofer (you will not hear the difference anyway).

              2. Subtract the distances s1 to s5 from the maximum distance, i.e.
                 s[i] = max(s) - s[i]; i = 1...5.

              3. Calculate the required delays in ms as d[i] = 1000*s[i]/342;  i
                 = 1...5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af delay=10.5:10.5:0:0:7:0 media.avi
                      Would  delay  front left and right by 10.5ms, the two rear
                      channels and the sub by 0ms and the center channel by 7ms.

       export[=mmapped_file[:nsamples]]
              Exports the incoming signal to other processes using  memory  map&#8208;
              ping (mmap()).  Memory mapped areas contain a header:

              int nch                      /*number of channels*/
              int size                     /*buffer size*/
              unsigned long long counter   /*Used to keep sync, updated every
                                             time new data is exported.*/

              The rest is payload (non-interleaved) 16 bit data.
                 &lt;mmapped_file&gt;
                      file  to  map  data to (default: ~/.mplayer/mplayer-af_ex&#8208;
                      port)
                 &lt;nsamples&gt;
                      number of samples per channel (default: 512)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af export=/tmp/mplayer-af_export:1024 media.avi
                      Would export 1024 samples per  channel  to  &apos;/tmp/mplayer-
                      af_export&apos;.

       extrastereo[=mul]
              (Linearly)  increases  the difference between left and right chan&#8208;
              nels which adds some sort of &quot;live&quot; effect to playback.
                 &lt;mul&gt;
                      Sets the difference coefficient (default: 2.5).  0.0 means
                      mono sound (average of both channels), with 1.0 sound will
                      be unchanged, with -1.0 left and right  channels  will  be
                      swapped.

       volnorm[=method:target]
              Maximizes the volume without distorting the sound.
                 &lt;method&gt;
                      Sets the used method.
                         1: Use a single sample to smooth the variations via the
                         standard weighted mean over past samples (default).
                         2: Use several samples to smooth the variations via the
                         standard weighted mean over past samples.

                 &lt;target&gt;
                      Sets the target amplitude as a fraction of the maximum for
                      the sample type (default: 0.25).

       ladspa=file:label[:controls...]
              Load a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer&apos;s Simple Plugin API)  plugin.
              This  filter  is reentrant, so multiple LADSPA plugins can be used
              at once.
                 &lt;file&gt;
                      Specifies the LADSPA plugin library file.  If  LADSPA_PATH
                      is  set, it searches for the specified file.  If it is not
                      set, you must supply a fully specified pathname.
                 &lt;label&gt;
                      Specifies the filter within the library.   Some  libraries
                      contain  only one filter, but others contain many of them.
                      Entering &apos;help&apos; here,  will  list  all  available  filters
                      within  the specified library, which eliminates the use of
                      &apos;listplugins&apos; from the LADSPA SDK.
                 &lt;controls&gt;
                      Controls are zero or more floating point values  that  de&#8208;
                      termine the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example de&#8208;
                      lay, threshold or gain).  In verbose mode (add -v  to  the
                      MPlayer  command  line),  all available controls and their
                      valid ranges are printed.   This  eliminates  the  use  of
                      &apos;analyseplugin&apos; from the LADSPA SDK.

       comp
              Compressor/expander  filter usable for microphone input.  Prevents
              artifacts on very loud sound and raises the  volume  on  very  low
              sound.  This filter is untested, maybe even unusable.

       gate
              Noise  gate  filter similar to the comp audio filter.  This filter
              is untested, maybe even unusable.

       karaoke
              Simple voice removal filter exploiting the fact that voice is usu&#8208;
              ally recorded with mono gear and later &apos;center&apos; mixed onto the fi&#8208;
              nal audio stream.  Beware that this filter will turn  your  signal
              into  mono.  Works well for 2 channel tracks; do not bother trying
              it on anything but 2 channel stereo.

       scaletempo[=option1:option2:...]
              Scales audio tempo without altering pitch,  optionally  synced  to
              playback speed (default).
              This  works  by  playing &#180;stride&#180; ms of audio at normal speed then
              consuming &#180;stride*scale&#180; ms of input audio.  It pieces the strides
              together by blending &#180;overlap&#180;% of stride with audio following the
              previous stride.  It optionally performs a short statistical anal&#8208;
              ysis  on the next &#180;search&#180; ms of audio to determine the best over&#8208;
              lap position.
                 scale=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Nominal amount to scale tempo.  Scales this amount in  ad&#8208;
                      dition to speed.  (default: 1.0)
                 stride=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Length in milliseconds to output each stride.  Too high of
                      value will cause noticable skips at high scale amounts and
                      an  echo at low scale amounts.  Very low values will alter
                      pitch.  Increasing improves performance.  (default: 60)
                 overlap=&lt;percent&gt;
                      Percentage of stride to overlap.  Decreasing improves per&#8208;
                      formance.  (default: .20)
                 search=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Length  in  milliseconds  to search for best overlap posi&#8208;
                      tion.  Decreasing improves performance greatly.   On  slow
                      systems,  you  will  probably  want  to set this very low.
                      (default: 14)
                 speed=&lt;tempo|pitch|both|none&gt;
                      Set response to speed change.
                         tempo
                              Scale tempo in sync with speed (default).
                         pitch
                              Reverses effect of filter.  Scales  pitch  without
                              altering     tempo.      Add     &#180;[     speed_mult
                              0.9438743126816935&#180;     and     &#180;]      speed_mult

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af scaletempo -speed 1.2 media.ogg
                      Would  playback  media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at
                      normal pitch.  Changing playback speed, would change audio
                      tempo to match.
                 mplayer  -af  scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=none  -speed  1.2  me&#8208;
                 dia.ogg
                      Would playback media at 1.2x normal speed, with  audio  at
                      normal pitch, but changing playback speed has no effect on
                      audio tempo.
                 mplayer  -af   scaletempo=stride=30:overlap=.50:search=10   me&#8208;
                 dia.ogg
                      Would tweak the quality and performace parameters.
                 mplayer -af format=floatne,scaletempo media.ogg
                      Would  make  scaletempo  use  float code.  Maybe faster on
                      some platforms.
                 mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=pitch audio.ogg
                      Would playback audio file at 1.2x normal speed, with audio
                      at  normal  pitch.   Changing playback speed, would change
                      pitch, leaving audio tempo at 1.2x.

       stats
              Collects and prints statistics about the audio stream,  especially
              the  volume.  These statistics are especially intended to help ad&#8208;
              justing the volume  while  avoiding  clipping.   The  volumes  are
              printed  in  dB  and compatible with the volume audio filter, they
              are always rounded towards -0dB.

              The &apos;n_samples&apos; field is the total number of samples seen  by  the
              filter.   The  &apos;mean_volume&apos;  field  is the root mean square.  The
              &apos;max_volume&apos; field is exactly what it says.   The  &apos;histogram_Xdb&apos;
              fields  count  how  many  samples  were  at -XdB, for X just below
              max_volume.

              For example, if max_volume is -7dB and histogram_7dB is 19,  &apos;vol&#8208;
              ume=7&apos;  will not cause clipping and &apos;volume=8&apos; will cause clipping
              on exactly 19 samples.

VIDEO FILTERS
       Video filters allow you to modify the video stream  and  its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -vf &lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;
              Setup a chain of video filters.

       Many  parameters  are  optional and set to default values if omitted.  To
       explicitly use a default value set a parameter to &apos;-1&apos;.   Parameters  w:h
       means  width  x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted from the
       upper left corner of the bigger image.
       NOTE: To get a full list of available video filters, see -vf help.

       Video filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands  to  manage
       the filter list.

       -vf-add &lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-pre &lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-del &lt;index1[,index2,...]&gt;
              Deletes  the filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start at
              0, negative numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the last).

       -vf-clr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       -vf &lt;filter&gt;=help
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for  a  par&#8208;
              ticular filter.

       -vf &lt;filter=named_parameter1=value1[:named_parameter2=value2:...]&gt;
              Sets  a named parameter to the given value.  Use on and off or yes
              and no to set flag parameters.

       Available filters are:

       crop[=w:h:x:y]
              Crops the given part of the image and discards the  rest.   Useful
              to remove black bands from widescreen movies.
                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      Cropped  width  and height, defaults to original width and
                      height.
                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

       cropdetect[=limit:round[:reset]]
              Calculates necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommend&#8208;
              ed parameters to stdout.
                 &lt;limit&gt;
                      Threshold,  which can be optionally specified from nothing
                      (0) to everything (255) (default: 24).
                 &lt;round&gt;
                      Value which the width/height should be divisible  by  (de&#8208;
                      fault:  16).  The offset is automatically adjusted to cen&#8208;
                      ter the video.  Use 2 to get only even dimensions  (needed
                      for  4:2:2 video).  16 is best when encoding to most video
                      codecs.
                 &lt;reset&gt;
                      Counter that determines after how many  frames  cropdetect
                      will  reset the previously detected largest video area and
                      start over to detect the current optimal  crop  area  (de&#8208;
                      fault:  0).  This can be useful when channel logos distort
                      the video area.  0 indicates never reset  and  return  the
                      largest area encountered during playback.

       rectangle[=w:h:x:y]
              Draws  a rectangle of the requested width and height at the speci&#8208;
              fied coordinates over the image and prints current  rectangle  pa&#8208;
              rameters  to  the console.  This can be used to find optimal crop&#8208;
              ping  parameters.   If   you   bind   the   input.conf   directive
              &apos;change_rectangle&apos; to keystrokes, you can move and resize the rec&#8208;
              tangle on the fly.
                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      width and height  (default:  -1,  maximum  possible  width
                      where boundaries are still visible.)
                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      top left corner position (default: -1, uppermost leftmost)

       expand[=w:h:x:y:o:a:r]
              Expands  (not  scales)  movie  resolution  to  the given value and
              places the unscaled original at coordinates x, y.  Can be used for
              placing subtitles/OSD in the resulting black bands.

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      Expanded  width,height  (default:  original width,height).
                      Negative values for w and h are treated as offsets to  the
                      original size.

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=0:-50:0:0
                                  Adds  a  50  pixel border to the bottom of the
                                  picture.

                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      position of original image on the expanded image (default:
                      center)

                 &lt;o&gt;
                      OSD/subtitle rendering
                         0: disable (default)
                         1: enable

                 &lt;a&gt;
                      Expands to fit an aspect instead of a resolution (default:
                      0).

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=800:::::4/3
                                  Expands to 800x600, unless the source is high&#8208;
                                  er  resolution,  in  which  case it expands to
                                  fill a 4/3 aspect.

                 &lt;r&gt;
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible  by  &lt;r&gt;
                      (default: 1).

       flip (also see -flip)
              Flips the image upside down.

       mirror
              Mirrors the image on the Y axis.

       rotate[=&lt;0-7&gt;]
              Rotates the image by 90 degrees and optionally flips it.  For val&#8208;
              ues between 4-7 rotation is only done if  the  movie  geometry  is
              portrait and not landscape.

                 0    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).

                 1    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

                 2    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

                 3    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip.

       scale[=w:h[:interlaced[:chr_drop[:par[:par2[:presize[:noup[:arnd]]]]]]]]
              Scales  the  image  with the software scaler (slow) and performs a
              YUV&lt;-&gt;RGB colorspace conversion (also see -sws).

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      scaled width/height (default: original width/height)
                      NOTE: If -zoom is used, and underlying filters  (including
                      libvo)  are  incapable of scaling, it defaults to d_width/
                      d_height!
                          0:   scaled d_width/d_height
                         -1:   original width/height
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension  and  the
                         prescaled aspect ratio.
                         -3:    Calculate  w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original aspect ratio.
                         -(n+8): Like -n above, but rounding  the  dimension  to
                         the closest multiple of 16.

                 &lt;interlaced&gt;
                      Toggle interlaced scaling.
                         0: off (default)
                         1: on

                 &lt;chr_drop&gt;
                      chroma skipping
                         0: Use all available input lines for chroma.
                         1: Use only every 2. input line for chroma.
                         2: Use only every 4. input line for chroma.
                         3: Use only every 8. input line for chroma.

                 &lt;par&gt;[:&lt;par2&gt;] (also see -sws)
                      Set  some  scaling  parameters  depending  on  the type of
                      scaler selected with -sws.

                      Disallow upscaling past the original dimensions.
                         0: Allow upscaling (default).
                         1: Disallow upscaling  if  one  dimension  exceeds  its
                         original value.
                         2:  Disallow  upscaling if both dimensions exceed their
                         original values.

                 &lt;arnd&gt;
                      Accurate rounding for the vertical scaler,  which  may  be
                      faster or slower than the default rounding.
                         0: Disable accurate rounding (default).
                         1: Enable accurate rounding.

       dsize[=aspect|w:h:aspect-method:r]
              Changes  the intended display size/aspect at an arbitrary point in
              the filter chain.  Aspect can be given  as  a  fraction  (4/3)  or
              floating  point number (1.33).  Alternatively, you may specify the
              exact display width and height desired.   Note  that  this  filter
              does not do any scaling itself; it just affects what later scalers
              (software or hardware) will do when auto-scaling  to  correct  as&#8208;
              pect.

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      New  display  width and height.  Can also be these special
                      values:
                          0:   original display width and height
                         -1:   original video width and height (default)
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension  and  the
                         original display aspect ratio.
                         -3:    Calculate  w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original video aspect ratio.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:-2
                                  Specifies a display resolution of 800x600  for
                                  a  4/3 aspect video, or 800x450 for a 16/9 as&#8208;
                                  pect video.
                 &lt;aspect-method&gt;
                      Modifies width and height according to original aspect ra&#8208;
                      tios.
                         -1: Ignore original aspect ratio (default).
                          0:  Keep  display aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as
                         maximum resolution.
                          1: Keep display aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and  &lt;h&gt;  as
                         minimum resolution.
                          2:  Keep  video  aspect  ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as
                         maximum resolution.
                          3: Keep video aspect ratio by using  &lt;w&gt;  and  &lt;h&gt;  as
                         minimum resolution.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:600:0
                                  Specifies  a  display  resolution  of  at most
                                  800x600, or smaller, in order to keep aspect.

                 &lt;r&gt;
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible  by  &lt;r&gt;
                      (default: 1).

       yvu9
              Forces software YVU9 to YV12 colorspace conversion.  Deprecated in
              favor of the software scaler.

       yuvcsp
              Clamps YUV color values to the CCIR 601 range without  doing  real
              conversion.

       palette
              RGB/BGR 8 -&gt; 15/16/24/32bpp colorspace conversion using palette.

       format[=fourcc[:outfourcc]]
              Restricts  the  colorspace  for  the next filter without doing any
              conversion.  Use together with the scale filter for a real conver&#8208;
              sion.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see format=fmt=help.
                 &lt;fourcc&gt;
                      format name like rgb15, bgr24, yv12, etc (default: yuy2)
                 &lt;outfourcc&gt;
                      Format name that should be substituted for the output.  If
                      this is not 100% compatible with  the  &lt;fourcc&gt;  value  it
                      will crash.
                      Valid examples:
                      format=rgb24:bgr24 format=yuyv:yuy2
                      Invalid examples (will crash):

       noformat[=fourcc]
              Restricts  the  colorspace  for  the next filter without doing any
              conversion.  Unlike the format filter, this will  allow  any  col&#8208;
              orspace except the one you specify.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see noformat=fmt=help.
                 &lt;fourcc&gt;

&#12;       pp[=filter1[:option1[:option2...]]/[-]filter2...] (also see -pphelp)
              Enables the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters.  Subfil&#8208;
              ters must be separated by &apos;/&apos; and can be disabled by prepending  a
              &apos;-&apos;.  Each subfilter and some options have a short and a long name
              that can be used interchangeably, i.e.  dr/dering  are  the  same.
              All subfilters share common options to determine their scope:
                 a/autoq
                      Automatically  switch  the subfilter off if the CPU is too
                      slow.
                 c/chrom
                      Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
                 y/nochrom
                      Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
                 n/noluma
                      Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

              NOTE: -pphelp shows a list of available subfilters.

              Available subfilters are

                         more deblocking (default: 39).

                 The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share  the  dif&#8208;
                 ference  and  flatness values so you cannot set different hori&#8208;
                 zontal and vertical thresholds.

       spp[=quality[:qp[:mode]]]
              Simple  postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the
              image at several (or - in the case  of  quality  level  6  -  all)
              shifts and averages the results.

                 &lt;quality&gt;
                      0-6 (default: 3)

                 &lt;qp&gt;
                      Force  quantization  parameter  (default:  0,  use QP from
                      video).

                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      0: hard thresholding (default)
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      4: like 0, but also use B-frames&apos; QP (may cause flicker)
                      5: like 1, but also use B-frames&apos; QP (may cause flicker)

       uspp[=quality[:qp]]
              Ultra simple &amp; slow postprocessing filter that compresses and  de&#8208;
              compresses the image at several (or - in the case of quality level
              8 - all) shifts and averages the results.  The  way  this  differs
              from  the  behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &amp; decodes
              each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified  in&#8208;
              tra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

                 &lt;quality&gt;
                      0-8 (default: 3)

                 &lt;qp&gt;
                      Force quantization parameter  (default:  0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 &lt;-15-32&gt;
                      Filter  strength,  lower values mean more details but also
                      more  artifacts,  while  higher  values  make  the   image
                      smoother but also blurrier (default: 0 - PSNR optimal).

                 &lt;bframes&gt;
                      0: do not use QP from B-frames (default)
                      1: use QP from B-frames too (may cause flicker)

       pp7[=qp[:mode]]
              Variant of the spp filter, similar to spp=6 with 7 point DCT where
              only the center sample is used after IDCT.

                 &lt;qp&gt;
                      Force quantization parameter  (default:  0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      0: hard thresholding
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      2: medium thresholding (default, good results)

                      zontally.  You can use whitespace  to  make  the  equation
                      more  readable.   There are a couple of constants that can
                      be used in the equation:
                         PI: the number pi
                         E: the number e
                         X / Y: the coordinates of the current sample
                         W / H: width and height of the image
                         SW / SH: width/height scale depending on the  currently
                         filtered plane, e.g. 1,1 and 0.5,0.5 for YUV 4:2:0.
                         p(x,y):  returns the value of the pixel at location x/y
                         of the current plane.

       noise[=luma[u][t|a][h][p]:chroma[u][t|a][h][p]]
              Adds noise.
                 &lt;0-100&gt;
                      luma noise
                 &lt;0-100&gt;
                      chroma noise
                 u    uniform noise (gaussian otherwise)
                 t    temporal noise (noise pattern changes between frames)
                 a    averaged temporal noise (smoother, but a lot slower)
                 h    high quality (slightly better looking, slightly slower)
                 p    mix random noise with a (semi)regular pattern

       denoise3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              This filter aims to reduce image noise producing smooth images and
              making  still  images  really still (This should enhance compress&#8208;
              ibility.).
                 &lt;luma_spatial&gt;
                      spatial luma strength (default: 4)
                 &lt;chroma_spatial&gt;
                      spatial chroma strength (default: 3)
                 &lt;luma_tmp&gt;
                      luma temporal strength (default: 6)
                 &lt;chroma_tmp&gt;
                      chroma temporal  strength  (default:  luma_tmp*chroma_spa&#8208;
                      tial/luma_spatial)

       hqdn3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              High  precision/quality  version of the denoise3d filter.  Parame&#8208;
              ters and usage are the same.

       ow[=depth[:luma_strength[:chroma_strength]]]
              Overcomplete Wavelet denoiser.
                 &lt;depth&gt;
                      Larger depth values will denoise  lower  frequency  compo&#8208;
                      nents more, but slow down filtering (default: 8).
                 &lt;luma_strength&gt;
                      luma strength (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;chroma_strength&gt;
                      chroma strength (default: 1.0)

       eq[=brightness:contrast] (OBSOLETE)
              Software  equalizer  with interactive controls just like the hard&#8208;
              ware equalizer, for cards/drivers that do not  support  brightness
              and contrast controls in hardware.  Might also be useful with MEn&#8208;
              coder, either for fixing poorly captured movies, or  for  slightly
              reducing  contrast  to  mask  artifacts  and get by with lower bi&#8208;
              trates.
                 &lt;-100-100&gt;
                      initial brightness
                 &lt;-100-100&gt;
                      initial contrast

       eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]
              Alternative software  equalizer  that  uses  lookup  tables  (very
              slow),  allowing gamma correction in addition to simple brightness
              and contrast adjustment.  Note that it uses the same MMX optimized
              code  as  -vf  eq if all gamma values are 1.0.  The parameters are
              given as floating point values.
                 &lt;0.1-10&gt;
                      initial gamma value (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;-2-2&gt;
                      initial contrast, where negative values result in a  nega&#8208;
                      tive image (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;-1-1&gt;
                      initial brightness (default: 0.0)
                 &lt;0-3&gt;
                      initial saturation (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;0.1-10&gt;
                      gamma value for the red component (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;0.1-10&gt;
                      gamma value for the green component (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;0.1-10&gt;
                      gamma value for the blue component (default: 1.0)
                 &lt;0-1&gt;
                      The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of a
                      high gamma value on bright image  areas,  e.g.  keep  them
                      from  getting overamplified and just plain white.  A value
                      of 0.0 turns the gamma correction all the way  down  while
                      1.0 leaves it at its full strength (default: 1.0).

       hue[=hue:saturation]
              Software  equalizer  with interactive controls just like the hard&#8208;
              ware equalizer, for cards/drivers that do not support hue and sat&#8208;
              uration controls in hardware.
                 &lt;-180-180&gt;
                      initial hue (default: 0.0)
                 &lt;-100-100&gt;
                      initial saturation, where negative values result in a neg&#8208;
                      ative chroma (default: 1.0)

       halfpack[=f]
              Convert planar YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsampling
              luma  but  keeping  all chroma samples.  Useful for output to low-
              resolution display devices when hardware downscaling is poor qual&#8208;
              ity or is not available.  Can also be used as a primitive luma-on&#8208;
              ly deinterlacer with very low CPU usage.
                 &lt;f&gt;
                      By default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when downsam&#8208;
                      pling.   Any value different from 0 or 1 gives the default
                      (averaging) behavior.
                         0: Only use even lines when downsampling.
                         1: Only use odd lines when downsampling.

       ilpack[=mode]
              When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats,  chroma  in&#8208;
              terlacing  does  not line up properly due to vertical downsampling
              of the chroma channels.  This filter packs the planar  4:2:0  data
              into YUY2 (4:2:2) format with the chroma lines in their proper lo&#8208;
              cations, so that in any given scanline, the luma and  chroma  data
              both come from the same field.
                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      Select the sampling mode.
                         0: nearest-neighbor sampling, fast but incorrect
                         1: linear interpolation (default)

       harddup
              Only  useful  with MEncoder.  If harddup is used when encoding, it
              will force duplicate frames to be encoded in the output.  This us&#8208;
              es  slightly more space, but is necessary for output to MPEG files
              or if you plan to demux and remux the video stream after encoding.
              Should be placed at or near the end of the filter chain unless you
              have a good reason to do otherwise.

       softskip
              Only useful with MEncoder.   Softskip  moves  the  frame  skipping
              (dropping)  step  of encoding from before the filter chain to some
              point during the filter chain.  This allows filters which need  to
              see  all  frames  (inverse  telecine, temporal denoising, etc.) to
              function properly.  Should be placed after the filters which  need
              to  see all frames and before any subsequent filters that are CPU-
              intensive.

       decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]
              Drops frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame in
              order  to  reduce  framerate.   The main use of this filter is for
              very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming over dialup modem),  but
              it  could  in  theory be used for fixing movies that were inverse-
              telecined incorrectly.
                 &lt;max&gt;
                      Sets the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be
                      dropped  (if  positive),  or  the minimum interval between
                      dropped frames (if negative).
                 &lt;hi&gt;,&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;frac&gt;
                      A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region  dif&#8208;
                      fers  by  more  than  a threshold of &lt;hi&gt;, and if not more
                      than &lt;frac&gt; portion (1 meaning the whole image) differs by
                      more  than  a  threshold of &lt;lo&gt;.  Values of &lt;hi&gt; and &lt;lo&gt;
                      are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual pixel  value
                      differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of
                      difference for each pixel, or the same spread out  differ&#8208;
                      ently over the block.

       dint[=sense:level]
              The  drop-deinterlace  (dint)  filter  detects and drops the first
              from a set of interlaced video frames.
                 &lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
                      relative difference between neighboring  pixels  (default:
                      0.1)
                 &lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
                      What part of the image has to be detected as interlaced to
                      drop the frame (default: 0.15).

       lavcdeint (OBSOLETE)
              FFmpeg deinterlacing filter, same as -vf pp=fd

       lavfi=filtergraph
              FFmpeg libavfilter wrapper.  filtergraph defines a whole libavfil&#8208;
              ter  graph  with  one  input  and one output.  See http://www.ffm&#8208;
              peg.org/libavfilter.html#SEC4 for details.

              As a special case, if filtergraph is $word then the value  of  the
              word environment variable is used; this is necessary if commas are
              present in the graph description, as mplayer uses them as a delim&#8208;
              iter between filters.

              NOTE:  This  filter  is  considered  experimental, it may interact
              strangely with other filters.

              EXAMPLE:
              overlay=&quot;movie=$small_video, scale=160:120 [ca]; [in]  [ca]  over&#8208;
              lay=16:8&quot; mplayer -vf lavfi=&apos;$overlay&apos; $big_video

       kerndeint[=thresh[:map[:order[:sharp[:twoway]]]]]
              Donald  Graft&apos;s  adaptive kernel deinterlacer.  Deinterlaces parts
              of a video if a configurable threshold is exceeded.
                 &lt;0-255&gt;
                      threshold (default: 10)
                 &lt;map&gt;
                         0: Ignore pixels exceeding the threshold (default).
                         1: Paint pixels exceeding the threshold white.

                 &lt;order&gt;
                         0: Leave fields alone (default).
                         1: Swap fields.

                 &lt;sharp&gt;
                         0: Disable additional sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable additional sharpening.

                 &lt;twoway&gt;
                         0: Disable twoway sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable twoway sharpening.

       unsharp[=l|cWxH:amount[:l|cWxH:amount]]
              unsharp mask / gaussian blur

                 l
                      Apply effect on luma component.

                 c
                      Apply effect on chroma components.

                 &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;
                      width and height of the matrix, odd sized in  both  direc&#8208;
                      tions  (min = 3x3, max = 13x11 or 11x13, usually something
                      between 3x3 and 7x7)

                 amount
                      Relative amount of sharpness/blur to add to the  image  (a
                      sane range should be -1.5-1.5).
                         &lt;0: blur
                         &gt;0: sharpen

       swapuv
              Swap U &amp; V plane.

       il[=d|i][s][:[d|i][s]]
              (De)interleaves  lines.   The  goal  of  this filter is to add the
              ability to process interlaced images pre-field without deinterlac&#8208;
              ing  them.  You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it on a TV
              without breaking the interlacing.  While deinterlacing  (with  the
              postprocessing filter) removes interlacing permanently (by smooth&#8208;
              ing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits the frame into 2 fields
              (so  called half pictures), so you can process (filter) them inde&#8208;
              pendently and then re-interleave them.
                 d    deinterleave (placing one above the other)
                 i    interleave
                 s    swap fields (exchange even &amp; odd lines)

       fil[=i|d]
              (De)interleaves lines.  This filter is very similar to the il fil&#8208;
              ter but much faster, the main disadvantage is that it does not al&#8208;
              ways work.  Especially if combined with other filters it may  pro&#8208;
              duce randomly messed up images, so be happy if it works but do not
              complain if it does not for your combination of filters.
                 d    Deinterleave fields, placing them side by side.
                 i    Interleave fields again (reversing the effect of fil=d).

       field[=n]
              Extracts a single field from  an  interlaced  image  using  stride
              arithmetic  to  avoid  wasting  CPU time.  The optional argument n
              specifies whether to extract the even or the odd field  (depending
              on whether n is even or odd).

       detc[=var1=value1:var2=value2:...]
              Attempts  to  reverse  the  &apos;telecine&apos; process to recover a clean,
              non-interlaced stream at film framerate.  This was the  first  and
              most primitive inverse telecine filter to be added to MPlayer/MEn&#8208;
              coder.  It works by latching onto the  telecine  3:2  pattern  and
              following it as long as possible.  This makes it suitable for per&#8208;
              fectly-telecined material, even in the presence of a  fair  degree
              of  noise,  but  it  will  fail  in  the presence of complex post-
              telecine edits.  Development on this filter is  no  longer  taking
              place,  as ivtc, pullup, and filmdint are better for most applica&#8208;
              tions.  The following arguments (see syntax above) may be used  to
              control detc&apos;s behavior:

                 &lt;dr&gt;
                      Set the frame dropping mode.
                         0:  Do not drop frames to maintain fixed output framer&#8208;
                         ate (default).
                         1: Always drop a frame when there have been no drops or
                         telecine merges in the past 5 frames.
                         2:  Always maintain exact 5:4 input to output frame ra&#8208;
                         tio.
                         NOTE: Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.

                 &lt;am&gt;
                      Analysis mode.
                         0: Fixed pattern with initial frame number specified by
                         &lt;fr&gt;.
                         1: aggressive search for telecine pattern (default)

                 &lt;fr&gt;
                      Set  initial  frame number in sequence.  0-2 are the three
                      clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the  two  interlaced
                      frames.   The  default,  -1,  means  &apos;not  in telecine se&#8208;
                      quence&apos;.  The number specified here is the  type  for  the
                      imaginary previous frame before the movie starts.

       ivtc[=1]
              Experimental  &apos;stateless&apos;  inverse  telecine  filter.  Rather than
              trying to lock on to a pattern like the  detc  filter  does,  ivtc
              makes  its decisions independently for each frame.  This will give
              much better results for material that has undergone heavy  editing
              after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as forgiving
              of noisy input, for example TV capture.   The  optional  parameter
              (ivtc=1)  corresponds  to the dr=1 option for the detc filter, and
              should be used with MEncoder but not with MPlayer.  As with  detc,
              you  must  specify the correct output framerate (-ofps 24000/1001)
              when using MEncoder.  Further development on ivtc has stopped,  as
              the pullup and filmdint filters appear to be much more accurate.

       pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb:mp]
              Third-generation  pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, ca&#8208;
              pable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive,
              and  30000/1001 fps progressive content.  The pullup filter is de&#8208;
              signed to be much more robust than detc or ivtc, by taking  advan&#8208;
              tage of future context in making its decisions.  Like ivtc, pullup
              is stateless in the sense that it does not lock onto a pattern  to
              follow,  but  it  instead looks forward to the following fields in
              order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.   It  is
              still under development, but believed to be quite accurate.

                 jl, jr, jt, and jb
                      These  options  set  the amount of &quot;junk&quot; to ignore at the
                      left, right, top, and bottom of the  image,  respectively.
                      Left/right  are in units of 8 pixels, while top/bottom are
                      in units of 2 lines.  The default  is  8  pixels  on  each
                      side.

                 sb (strict breaks)
                      Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of pullup
                      generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also
                      cause  an  excessive number of frames to be dropped during
                      high motion sequences.  Conversely, setting it to -1  will
                      make  pullup match fields more easily.  This may help pro&#8208;
                      cessing of video where there is  slight  blurring  between
                      the  fields,  but  may  also  cause there to be interlaced
                      frames in the output.

                 mp (metric plane)
                      This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a chroma plane in&#8208;
                      stead  of  the luma plane for doing pullup&apos;s computations.
                      This may improve accuracy on very clean  source  material,
                      but  more  likely  will  decrease  accuracy, especially if
                      there is chroma noise (rainbow effect)  or  any  grayscale
                      video.   The  main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane
                      is to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable  in  realtime
                      on slow machines.

              NOTE:  Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when encoding
              to ensure that pullup is able to see each frame.  Failure to do so
              will  lead  to incorrect output and will usually crash, due to de&#8208;
              sign limitations in the codec/filter layer.

       filmdint[=options]
              Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter  above.   It
              is  designed  to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft
              and hard telecine and limited support for movies that  are  slowed
              down  or  sped  up from their original framerate for TV.  Only the
              luma plane is used to find the frame breaks.  If a  field  has  no
              match,  it  is  deinterlaced with simple linear approximation.  If
              the source is MPEG-2, this must be the first filter to  allow  ac&#8208;
              cess  to  the field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.  Depending on
              the source MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice, as long  as
              you do not see lots of &quot;Bottom-first field&quot; warnings.  With no op&#8208;
              tions it does normal inverse telecine, and should be used together
              with  mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps 24000/1001.  When this filter
              is used with MPlayer, it will result in an uneven framerate during
              playback,  but it is still generally better than using pp=lb or no
              deinterlacing at all.  Multiple options can be specified separated
              by /.

                 crop=&lt;w&gt;:&lt;h&gt;:&lt;x&gt;:&lt;y&gt;
                      Just  like the crop filter, but faster, and works on mixed
                      hard and soft telecined content as well as when y is not a
                      multiple of 4.  If x or y would require cropping fraction&#8208;
                      al pixels from the chroma planes, the crop area is extend&#8208;
                      ed.  This usually means that x and y must be even.

                 io=&lt;ifps&gt;:&lt;ofps&gt;
                      For  each  ifps  input  frames the filter will output ofps
                      frames.  The ratio of ifps/ofps should match the -fps/-of&#8208;
                      ps  ratio.   This  could be used to filter movies that are
                      broadcast on TV at a frame rate different from their orig&#8208;
                      inal framerate.

                 luma_only=&lt;n&gt;
                      If  n  is  nonzero,  the chroma plane is copied unchanged.
                      This is useful for YV12 sampled TV, which discards one  of
                      the chroma fields.

                 mmx2=&lt;n&gt;
                      On  x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized functions, if n=2, use
                      3DNow!  optimized functions, otherwise, use plain  C.   If
                      this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are auto-de&#8208;
                      tected, use this option to override auto-detection.

                 fast=&lt;n&gt;
                      The larger n will speed up the filter at  the  expense  of
                      accuracy.  The default value is n=3.  If n is odd, a frame
                      immediately  following  a  frame  marked  with   the   RE&#8208;
                      PEAT_FIRST_FIELD  MPEG  flag is assumed to be progressive,
                      thus filter will not  spend  any  time  on  soft-telecined
                      MPEG-2  content.   This is the only effect of this flag if
                      MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.  Without MMX2 and  3DNow,  if
                      n=0  or  1, the same calculations will be used as with n=2
                      or 3.  If n=2 or 3, the number of luma levels used to find
                      the frame breaks is reduced from 256 to 128, which results
                      in a faster filter without losing much accuracy.   If  n=4
                      or 5, a faster, but much less accurate metric will be used
                      to find the frame breaks, which is more likely  to  misde&#8208;
                      tect high vertical detail as interlaced content.

                 verbose=&lt;n&gt;
                      If  n  is  nonzero,  print  the  detailed metrics for each
                      frame.  Useful for debugging.

                 dint_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Deinterlace threshold.  Used during de-interlacing of  un&#8208;
                      matched  frames.   Larger  value means less deinterlacing,
                      use n=256 to completely turn off  deinterlacing.   Default
                      is n=8.

                 comb_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Threshold for comparing a top and bottom fields.  Defaults
                      to 128.

                 diff_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Threshold to detect temporal change of a  field.   Default
                      is 128.

                 sad_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.

       softpulldown
              This  filter  works  only  correct  with  MEncoder and acts on the
              MPEG-2 flags used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).   If  you
              want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies that are partly soft
              telecined, inserting this filter before them should make them more
              reliable.

       divtc[=options]
              Inverse   telecine   for   deinterlaced  video.   If  3:2-pulldown
              telecined video has lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced  us&#8208;
              ing  a method that keeps one field and interpolates the other, the
              result is a juddering video that has every fourth frame  duplicat&#8208;
              ed.  This filter is intended to find and drop those duplicates and
              restore the original film framerate.  When using this filter,  you
              must  specify  -ofps  that is 4/5 of the fps of the input file and
              place the softskip later in the filter chain to make sure that di&#8208;
              vtc  sees  all the frames.  Two different modes are available: One
              pass mode is the default and is straightforward to  use,  but  has
              the  disadvantage  that  any  changes  in the telecine phase (lost
              frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder until the  filter  can
              resync  again.   Two  pass mode avoids this by analyzing the whole
              video beforehand so it will have forward knowledge about the phase
              changes  and  can  resync  at the exact spot.  These passes do not
              correspond to pass one and two of the encoding process.  You  must
              run  an extra pass using divtc pass one before the actual encoding
              throwing the resulting video  away.   Use  -nosound  -ovc  raw  -o
              /dev/null  to  avoid wasting CPU power for this pass.  You may add
              something like crop=2:2:0:0 after divtc to speed  things  up  even
              more.   Then  use  divtc pass two for the actual encoding.  If you
              use multiple encoder passes, use divtc pass two for all  of  them.
              The options are:

                 pass=1|2
                      Use two pass mode.

                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Set the two pass log filename (default: &quot;framediff.log&quot;).

                 threshold=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set  the  minimum  strength the telecine pattern must have
                      for the filter to believe in it (default: 0.5).   This  is
                      used  to avoid recognizing false pattern from the parts of
                      the video that are very dark or very still.

                 window=&lt;numframes&gt;
                      Set the number of past frames to look  at  when  searching
                      for pattern (default: 30).  Longer window improves the re&#8208;
                      liability of the pattern search, but  shorter  window  im&#8208;
                      proves  the  reaction  time to the changes in the telecine
                      phase.  This only affects the one pass mode.  The two pass
                      mode  currently uses fixed window that extends to both fu&#8208;
                      ture and past.

                 phase=0|1|2|3|4
                      Sets the initial telecine phase for  one  pass  mode  (de&#8208;
                      fault: 0).  The two pass mode can see the future, so it is
                      able to use the correct phase from the beginning, but  one
                      pass  mode  can  only guess.  It catches the correct phase
                      when it finds it, but this option can be used to  fix  the
                      possible  juddering  at  the beginning.  The first pass of
                      the two pass mode also uses this, so if you save the  out&#8208;
                      put from the first pass, you get constant phase result.

                 deghost=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set  the  deghosting  threshold  (0-255 for one pass mode,
                      -255-255 for two  pass  mode,  default  0).   If  nonzero,
                      deghosting  mode is used.  This is for video that has been
                      deinterlaced by blending the fields  together  instead  of
                      dropping one of the fields.  Deghosting amplifies any com&#8208;
                      pression artifacts in the blended frames, so the parameter
                      value  is used as a threshold to exclude those pixels from
                      deghosting that differ from the previous frame  less  than
                      specified  value.  If two pass mode is used, then negative
                      value can be used to make the  filter  analyze  the  whole
                      video  in  the beginning of pass-2 to determine whether it
                      needs deghosting or not and then select either zero or the
                      absolute  value of the parameter.  Specify this option for
                      pass-2, it makes no difference on pass-1.

       phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]
              Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the  field  order
              changes.   The  intended  use  is to fix PAL movies that have been
              captured with the opposite field order to the film-to-video trans&#8208;
              fer.  The options are:

                 t    Capture  field  order  top-first,  transfer  bottom-first.
                      Filter will delay the bottom field.

                 b    Capture bottom-first, transfer top-first.  Filter will de&#8208;
                      lay the top field.

                 p    Capture and transfer with the same field order.  This mode
                      only exists for the documentation of the other options  to
                      refer  to,  but if you actually select it, the filter will
                      faithfully do nothing ;-)

                 a    Capture field  order  determined  automatically  by  field
                      flags,  transfer  opposite.   Filter selects among t and b
                      modes on a frame by frame basis using field flags.  If  no
                      field  information is available, then this works just like
                      u.

                 u    Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite.  Filter se&#8208;
                      lects among t and b on a frame by frame basis by analyzing
                      the images and selecting  the  alternative  that  produces
                      best match between the fields.

                 T    Capture  top-first,  transfer  unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among t and p using image analysis.

                 B    Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among b and p using image analysis.

                 A    Capture  determined  by  field  flags, transfer unknown or
                      varying.  Filter selects among t,  b  and  p  using  field
                      flags  and  image  analysis.   If  no field information is
                      available, then this works just like U.  This is  the  de&#8208;
                      fault mode.

                 U    Both  capture and transfer unknown or varying.  Filter se&#8208;
                      lects among t, b and p using image analysis only.

                 v    Verbose operation.  Prints  the  selected  mode  for  each
                      frame  and  the  average squared difference between fields
                      for t, b, and p alternatives.

       telecine[=start]
              Apply 3:2 &apos;telecine&apos; process to increase framerate by  20%.   This
              most  likely  will  not work correctly with MPlayer, but it can be
              used  with  &apos;mencoder  -fps  30000/1001   -ofps   30000/1001   -vf
              telecine&apos;.   Both fps options are essential!  (A/V sync will break
              if they are wrong.)  The optional start parameter tells the filter
              where in the telecine pattern to start (0-3).

       tinterlace[=mode]
              Temporal  field interlacing - merge pairs of frames into an inter&#8208;
              laced frame, halving the framerate.  Even frames  are  moved  into
              the  upper field, odd frames to the lower field.  This can be used
              to fully reverse the effect of the tfields  filter  (in  mode  0).
              Available modes are:
                 0    Move  odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower
                      field, generating a full-height frame at half framerate.
                 1    Only output odd frames, even frames  are  dropped;  height
                      unchanged.
                 2    Only  output  even  frames, odd frames are dropped; height
                      unchanged.
                 3    Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate  lines
                      with black; framerate unchanged.
                 4    Interleave even lines from even frames with odd lines from
                      odd frames.  Height unchanged at half framerate.

       tfields[=mode[:field_dominance]]
              Temporal field separation - split fields into frames, doubling the
              output  framerate.   Like  the  telecine filter, tfields might not
              work completely right unless used with MEncoder and both -fps  and
              -ofps set to the desired (double) framerate!
                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      0: Leave fields unchanged (will jump/flicker).
                      1:  Interpolate  missing  lines. (The algorithm used might
                      not be so good.)
                      2: Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with linear interpolation
                      (no jump).
                      4:  Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with 4tap filter (higher
                      quality) (default).
                 &lt;field_dominance&gt; (DEPRECATED)
                      -1: auto (default) Only works if the decoder  exports  the
                      appropriate information and no other filters which discard
                      that information come before tfields in the filter  chain,
                      otherwise it falls back to 0 (top field first).
                      0: top field first
                      1: bottom field first
                      NOTE:  This  option  will  possibly be removed in a future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       yadif=[mode[:field_dominance]]
              Yet another deinterlacing filter
                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      0: Output 1 frame for each frame.
                      1: Output 1 frame for each field.
                      2: Like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                      3: Like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                 &lt;field_dominance&gt; (DEPRECATED)
                      Operates like tfields.
                      NOTE: This option will possibly be  removed  in  a  future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       mcdeint=[mode[:parity[:qp]]]
              Motion compensating deinterlacer.  It needs one field per frame as
              input and must thus be used together with tfields=1  or  yadif=1/3
              or equivalent.
                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      0: fast
                      1: medium
                      2: slow, iterative motion estimation
                      3: extra slow, like 2 plus multiple reference frames
                 &lt;parity&gt;
                      0  or 1 selects which field to use (note: no autodetection
                      yet!).
                 &lt;qp&gt;
                      Higher values should result in a  smoother  motion  vector
                      field but less optimal individual vectors.

       1bpp
              1bpp bitmap to YUV/BGR 8/15/16/32 conversion

       down3dright[=lines]
              Reposition and resize stereoscopic images.  Extracts  both  stereo
              fields and places them side by side, resizing them to maintain the
              original movie aspect.
                 &lt;lines&gt;
                      number of lines to select from the  middle  of  the  image
                      (default: 12)

       bmovl=hidden:opaque:fifo
              The  bitmap  overlay filter reads bitmaps from a FIFO and displays
              them on top of the movie, allowing some transformations on the im&#8208;
              age.  Also see TOOLS/bmovl-test.c for a small bmovl test program.
                 &lt;hidden&gt;
                      Set  the  default  value  of the &apos;hidden&apos; flag (0=visible,
                      1=hidden).
                 &lt;opaque&gt;
                      Set the default value of the &apos;opaque&apos; flag (0=transparent,
                      1=opaque).
                 &lt;fifo&gt;
                      path/filename for the FIFO (named pipe connecting &apos;mplayer
                      -vf bmovl&apos; to the controlling application)

              FIFO commands are:
                 RGBA32 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*4 Bytes of raw RGBA32 data.
                 ABGR32 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*4 Bytes of raw ABGR32 data.
                 RGB24 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*3 Bytes of raw RGB24 data.
                 BGR24 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*3 Bytes of raw BGR24 data.
                 ALPHA width height xpos ypos alpha
                      Change alpha transparency of the specified area.
                 CLEAR width height xpos ypos
                      Clear area.
                 OPAQUE
                      Disable all alpha transparency.  Send &quot;ALPHA 0 0 0 0 0&quot; to
                      enable it again.
                 HIDE
                      Hide bitmap.
                 SHOW
                      Show bitmap.

              Arguments are:
                 &lt;width&gt;, &lt;height&gt;
                      image/area size
                 &lt;xpos&gt;, &lt;ypos&gt;
                      Start blitting at position x/y.
                 &lt;alpha&gt;
                      Set  alpha  difference.   If  you set this to -255 you can
                      then send a sequence of ALPHA-commands to set the area  to
                      -225, -200, -175 etc for a nice fade-in-effect! ;)
                         0:    same as original
                         255:  Make everything opaque.
                         -255: Make everything transparent.

                 &lt;clear&gt;
                      Clear the framebuffer before blitting.
                         0:  The  image  will  just be blitted on top of the old
                         one, so you do not need to send 1.8MB  of  RGBA32  data
                         every time a small part of the screen is updated.
                         1: clear

       framestep=I|[i]step
              Renders only every nth frame or every intra frame (keyframe).

              If  you  call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then
              only keyframes are rendered.  For DVDs it generally means  one  in
              every 15/12 frames (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB), for AVI it means every scene
              change or every keyint value (see -lavcopts keyint= value  if  you
              use MEncoder to encode the video).

              When  a  keyframe  is  found, an &apos;I!&apos; string followed by a newline
              character is printed, leaving the current line of MPlayer/MEncoder
              output  on  the  screen, because it contains the time (in seconds)
              and frame number of the keyframe (You can use this information  to
              split the AVI.).

              If  you  call the filter with a numeric parameter &apos;step&apos; then only
              one in every &apos;step&apos; frames is rendered.

              If you put an &apos;i&apos; (lowercase) before the number then  an  &apos;I!&apos;  is
              printed (like the I parameter).

              If you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only I!
              is printed.

       tile=xtiles:ytiles:output:start:delta
              Tile a series of images into a single, bigger image.  If you  omit
              a  parameter or use a value less than 0, then the default value is
              used.  You can also stop when you are satisfied (... -vf tile=10:5
              ...).   It  is probably a good idea to put the scale filter before
              the tile :-)

              The parameters are:

                 &lt;xtiles&gt;
                      number of tiles on the x axis (default: 5)
                 &lt;ytiles&gt;
                      number of tiles on the y axis (default: 5)
                 &lt;output&gt;
                      Render  the  tile  when  &apos;output&apos;  number  of  frames  are
                      reached, where &apos;output&apos; should be a number less than xtile
                      * ytile.  Missing tiles are left blank.   You  could,  for
                      example,  write  an 8 * 7 tile every 50 frames to have one
                      image every 2 seconds @ 25 fps.
                 &lt;start&gt;
                      outer border thickness in pixels (default: 2)
                 &lt;delta&gt;
                      inner border thickness in pixels (default: 4)

       delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]
              Suppresses a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the sur&#8208;
              rounding pixels.  Just set a rectangle covering the logo and watch
              it disappear (and sometimes something even uglier  appear  -  your
              mileage may vary).
                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      top left corner of the logo
                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      width and height of the cleared rectangle
                 &lt;t&gt;  Thickness  of  the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w
                      and h).  When set to -1, a green rectangle is drawn on the
                      screen to simplify finding the right x,y,w,h parameters.
                 file=&lt;file&gt;
                      You  can specify a text file to load the coordinates from.
                      Each line must have a timestamp (in seconds,  and  in  as&#8208;
                      cending  order)  and the &quot;x:y:w:h:t&quot; coordinates (t can be
                      omitted).

       remove-logo=/path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
              Suppresses a TV station logo, using a PGM or PPM image file to de&#8208;
              termine  which  pixels comprise the logo.  The width and height of
              the image file must match those of the  video  stream  being  pro&#8208;
              cessed.   Uses  the  filter image and a circular blur algorithm to
              remove the logo.

                 /path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
                      [path] + filename of the filter image.

       zrmjpeg[=options]
              Software YV12 to MJPEG encoder for use with the zr2  video  output
              device.

                 maxheight=&lt;h&gt;|maxwidth=&lt;w&gt;
                      These options set the maximum width and height the zr card
                      can handle (the  MPlayer  filter  layer  currently  cannot
                      query those).

                 {dc10+,dc10,buz,lml33}-{PAL|NTSC}
                      Use  these options to set maxwidth and maxheight automati&#8208;
                      cally to the values known for card/mode combo.  For  exam&#8208;
                      ple,  valid  options  are: dc10-PAL and buz-NTSC (default:
                      dc10+PAL)

                 color|bw
                      Select color or black and white encoding.  Black and white
                      encoding is faster.  Color is the default.

                 hdec={1,2,4}
                      Horizontal decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 vdec={1,2,4}
                      Vertical decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 quality=1-20
                      Set JPEG compression quality [BEST] 1 - 20 [VERY BAD].

                 fd|nofd
                      By  default,  decimation  is  only  performed if the Zoran
                      hardware can upscale the resulting  MJPEG  images  to  the
                      original  size.  The option fd instructs the filter to al&#8208;
                      ways perform the requested decimation (ugly).

       screenshot
              Allows acquiring screenshots of the movie using  slave  mode  com&#8208;
              mands  that  can be bound to keypresses.  See the slave mode docu&#8208;
              mentation and the INTERACTIVE CONTROL section for details.   Files
              named &apos;shotNNNN.png&apos; will be saved in the working directory, using
              the first available number - no files will  be  overwritten.   The
              filter has no overhead when not used and accepts an arbitrary col&#8208;
              orspace, so it is safe to add it to the configuration file.   Make
              sure  that  the screenshot filter is added after all other filters
              whose effect you want to record  on  the  saved  image.   E.g.  it
              should  be the last filter if you want to have an exact screenshot
              of what you see on the monitor.

       ass
              Moves SSA/ASS subtitle rendering to an arbitrary point in the fil&#8208;
              ter chain.  Only useful with the -ass option.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf ass,screenshot
                      Moves  SSA/ASS  rendering  before  the  screenshot filter.
                      Screenshots taken this way will contain subtitles.

       blackframe[=amount:threshold]
              Detect frames that are (almost) completely black.  Can  be  useful
              to  detect  chapter transitions or commercials.  Output lines con&#8208;
              sist of the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage  of
              blackness, the frame type and the frame number of the last encoun&#8208;
              tered keyframe.

                 &lt;amount&gt;
                      Percentage of the pixels that have to be below the thresh&#8208;
                      old (default: 98).

                 &lt;threshold&gt;
                      Threshold  below  which  a pixel value is considered black
                      (default: 32).

       stereo3d[=in:out]

                      sbs2r or side_by_side_half_width_right_first
                             side  by side with half width resolution (right eye
                             left, left eye right)
                      abl or above_below_left_first
                             above-below (left eye above, right eye below)
                      abl or above_below_right_first

                             above, left eye below)

                 &lt;out&gt;
                      Stereoscopic image format of output. Possible  values  are
                      all the input formats as well as:

                             eye, magenta filter on right eye)
                      agmh or anaglyph_green_magenta_half_color
                             anaglyph  green/magenta  half colored (green filter
                             on left eye, magenta filter on right eye)
                      agmc or anaglyph_green_magenta_color
                             anaglyph green/magenta  colored  (green  filter  on
                             left eye, magenta filter on right eye)
                      aybg or anaglyph_yellow_blue_gray
                             anaglyph  yellow/blue  gray  (yellow filter on left
                             eye, blue filter on right eye)
                      aybh or anaglyph_yellow_blue_half_color
                             anaglyph yellow/blue half colored (yellow filter on

                      aybc or anaglyph_yellow_blue_color
                             anaglyph yellow/blue colored (yellow filter on left

                      irl or interleave_rows_left_first
                             Interleaved rows (left eye has top row,  right  eye
                             starts on next row)
                      irr or interleave_rows_right_first
                             Interleaved  rows  (right eye has top row, left eye
                             starts on next row)
                      ml or mono_left
                             mono output (left eye only)
                      mr or mono_right
                             mono output (right eye only)
                 NOTE: To use either of the interleaved-rows output  formats  to
                 display  full-screen  on a row-interleaved 3D display, you will
                 need to scale the video to the correct height first  using  the
                 &quot;scale&quot;  filter,  if it is not already the right height.  Typi&#8208;
                 cally,   that   is   1080   rows    (so    use    e.g.     &quot;-vf
                 scale=1440:1080,stereo3d=sbsl:irl&quot;  for a 720p side-by-side en&#8208;
                 coded movie).

       gradfun[=strength[:radius]]
              Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into near&#8208;
              ly  flat  regions  by truncation to 8bit colordepth.  Interpolates
              the gradients that should go where  the  bands  are,  and  dithers
              them.

              This filter is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
              lossy compression, because compression tends to  lose  the  dither
              and bring back the bands.

                 &lt;strength&gt;
                      Maximum  amount  by  which  the filter will change any one
                      pixel.  Also the threshold for detecting nearly  flat  re&#8208;
                      gions (default: 1.2).

                 &lt;radius&gt;
                      Neighborhood  to fit the gradient to.  Larger radius makes
                      for smoother gradients, but also prevents the filter  from
                      modifying pixels near detailed regions (default: 16).

       fixpts[=options]
              Fixes  the  presentation  timestamps  (PTS) of the frames.  By de&#8208;
              fault, the PTS passed to the next filter is dropped, but the  fol&#8208;
              lowing options can change that:

                 print
                      Print the incoming PTS.

                 fps=&lt;fps&gt;
                      Specify a frame per second value.

                 start=&lt;pts&gt;
                      Specify an initial value for the PTS.

                 autostart=&lt;n&gt;
                      Uses  the nth incoming PTS as the initial PTS.  All previ&#8208;
                      ous PTS are kept, so setting a huge value or -1 keeps  the
                      PTS intact.

                 autofps=&lt;n&gt;
                      Uses  the  nth  incoming PTS after the end of autostart to
                      determine the framerate.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf fixpts=fps=24000/1001,ass,fixpts
                      Generates a new sequence of PTS, uses it  for  ASS  subti&#8208;
                      tles,  then drops it.  Generating a new sequence is useful
                      when the timestamps are reset during the program; this  is
                      frequent  on  DVDs.  Dropping it may be necessary to avoid
                      confusing encoders.

              NOTE: Using this filter together with any sort of seeking (includ&#8208;
              ing -ss and EDLs) may make demons fly out of your nose.

GENERAL ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       -audio-delay &lt;any floating-point number&gt;
              Delays either audio or video by setting a delay field in the head&#8208;
              er (default: 0.0).  This does not delay either stream while encod&#8208;
              ing,  but  the  player will see the delay field and compensate ac&#8208;
              cordingly.  Positive values delay the audio, and  negative  values
              delay the video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of the -de&#8208;
              lay option.  For example, if a video plays correctly  with  -delay
              0.2,  you  can  fix  the video with MEncoder by using -audio-delay
              -0.2.

              Currently, this option only works  with  the  default  muxer  (-of
              avi).   If you are using a different muxer, then you must use -de&#8208;
              lay instead.

       -audio-density &lt;1-50&gt;
              Number of audio chunks per second (default is 2 for 0.5s long  au&#8208;
              dio chunks).
              NOTE:  CBR  only, VBR ignores this as it puts each packet in a new
              chunk.

       -audio-preload &lt;0.0-2.0&gt;
              Sets up the audio buffering time interval (default: 0.5s).

       -fafmttag &lt;format&gt;
              Can be used to override the audio format tag of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -fafmttag 0x55
                      Will have the output file contain 0x55 (mp3) as audio for&#8208;
                      mat tag.

       -ffourcc &lt;fourcc&gt;
              Can be used to override the video fourcc of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ffourcc div3
                      Will have the output file contain &apos;div3&apos; as video fourcc.

       -force-avi-aspect &lt;0.2-3.0&gt;
              Override  the  aspect stored in the AVI OpenDML vprp header.  This
              can be used to change the aspect ratio with &apos;-ovc copy&apos;.

       -frameno-file &lt;filename&gt; (DEPRECATED)
              Specify the name of the audio file with framenumber mappings  cre&#8208;
              ated in the first (audio only) pass of a special three pass encod&#8208;
              ing mode.
              NOTE: Using this mode will most likely give you  A-V  desync.   Do
              not  use it.  It is kept for backwards compatibility only and will
              possibly be removed in a future version.

       -hr-edl-seek
              Use a more precise, but much slower  method  for  skipping  areas.
              Areas  marked for skipping are not seeked over, instead all frames
              are decoded, but only the necessary frames are encoded.  This  al&#8208;
              lows starting at non-keyframe boundaries.
              NOTE: Not guaranteed to work right with &apos;-ovc copy&apos;.

       -info &lt;option1:option2:...&gt; (AVI only)
              Specify the info header of the resulting AVI file.

              Available options are:

       -noautoexpand
              Do  not  automatically  insert the expand filter into the MEncoder
              filter chain.  Useful to control at  which  point  of  the  filter
              chain  subtitles  are  rendered  when  hardcoding subtitles onto a
              movie.

       -noencodedups
              Do not attempt to encode duplicate  frames  in  duplicate;  always
              output  zero-byte frames to indicate duplicates.  Zero-byte frames
              will be written anyway unless a filter or encoder capable of doing
              duplicate  encoding  is loaded.  Currently the only such filter is
              harddup.

       -noodml (-of avi only)
              Do not write OpenDML index for AVI files &gt;1GB.

       -noskip
              Do not skip frames.

       -o &lt;filename&gt;
              Outputs to the given filename.
              If you want a default output filename, you can put this option  in
              the MEncoder config file.

       -oac &lt;codec name&gt;
              Encode with the given audio codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -oac help to get a list of available audio codecs.
&#12;              EXAMPLE:
                 -oac copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -oac pcm
                      Encode to uncompressed PCM.
                 -oac mp3lame
                      Encode to MP3 (using LAME).
                 -oac lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -of &lt;format&gt; (BETA CODE!)
              Encode to the specified container format (default: AVI).
              NOTE: Use -of help to get a list of available container formats.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -of avi
                      Encode to AVI.
                 -of mpeg
                      Encode to MPEG (also see -mpegopts).
                 -of lavf
                      Encode with libavformat muxers (also see -lavfopts).
                 -of rawvideo
                      raw video stream (no muxing - one video stream only)
                 -of rawaudio
                      raw audio stream (no muxing - one audio stream only)

       -ofps &lt;fps&gt;
              Specify a frames per second (fps) value for the output file, which
              can be different from that of the source material.   Must  be  set
              for  variable  fps (ASF, some MOV) and progressive (30000/1001 fps
              telecined MPEG) files.

       -ovc &lt;codec name&gt;
              Encode with the given video codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -ovc help to get a list of available video codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ovc copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -ovc raw
                      Encode to an arbitrary uncompressed format (use &apos;-vf  for&#8208;
                      mat&apos; to select).
                 -ovc lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -passlogfile &lt;filename&gt;
              Dump  first  pass information to &lt;filename&gt; instead of the default
              divx2pass.log in two pass encoding mode.

       -skiplimit &lt;value&gt;
              Specify the maximum number of frames that may be skipped after en&#8208;
              coding one frame (-noskiplimit for unlimited).

       -vobsubout &lt;basename&gt;
              Specify  the  basename  for  the output .idx and .sub files.  This
              turns off subtitle rendering in the encoded movie and  diverts  it
              to VOBsub subtitle files.

       -vobsuboutid &lt;langid&gt;
              Specify  the  language  two  letter  code for the subtitles.  This
              overrides what is read from the DVD or the .ifo file.

       -vobsuboutindex &lt;index&gt;
              Specify the index of the subtitles in the output  files  (default:
              0).

       -force-key-frames &lt;time&gt;,&lt;time&gt;,...
              Force  key  frames  at the specified timestamps, more precisely at
              the first frame after each specified time.

              This option can be used to ensure that a seek point is present  at
              a chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file.

              The timestamps must be specified in ascending order.

              Since  MEncoder  does  not send timestamps along the filter chain,
              you probably need to use the fixpts  filter  for  this  option  to
              work.

              Not  all  codecs support forced key frames.  Currently, support is
              only implemented for the following encoders: lavc, x264, xvid.

CODEC SPECIFIC ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       You can specify codec specific encoding parameters  using  the  following
       syntax:

       -&lt;codec&gt;opts &lt;option1[=value1]:option2[=value2]:...&gt;

       Where  &lt;codec&gt;  may  be:  lavc,  xvidenc, mp3lame, toolame, twolame, nuv,
       xvfw, faac, x264enc, mpeg, lavf.

              bit_exact  disables  several optimizations and thus should only be
              used for regression tests, which need binary identical files  even
              if the encoder version changes.  This also suppresses the user_da&#8208;

              minimum quantizer

                 1    Not recommended (much larger file, little quality  differ&#8208;
                      ence  and  weird  side effects: msmpeg4, h263 will be very
                      low quality, ratecontrol will  be  confused  resulting  in
                      lower quality and some decoders will not be able to decode
                      it).

                 2    Recommended  for  normal  mpeg4/mpeg1video  encoding  (de&#8208;
                      fault).

                 3    Recommended  for  h263(p)/msmpeg4.  The reason for prefer&#8208;
                      ring 3 over 2 is that 2 could lead  to  overflows.   (This
                      will be fixed for h263(p) by changing the quantizer per MB
                      in the future, msmpeg4 cannot be fixed as it does not sup&#8208;
                      port that.)

       lmin=&lt;0.01-255.0&gt;
              Minimum  frame-level Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (default:
              2.0).  Lavc will rarely use quantizers below the  value  of  lmin.
              Lowering  lmin will make lavc more likely to choose lower quantiz&#8208;
              ers for some frames, but not lower than the value of vqmin.  Like&#8208;
              wise,  raising lmin will make lavc less likely to choose low quan&#8208;
              tizers, even if vqmin would have allowed them.  You probably  want
              to set lmin approximately equal to vqmin.  When adaptive quantiza&#8208;
              tion is in use, changing lmin/lmax may have less of an effect; see
              mblmin/mblmax.

       lmax=&lt;0.01-255.0&gt;
              maximum Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (default: 31.0)

       mblmin=&lt;0.01-255.0&gt;
              Minimum  macroblock-level Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (de&#8208;
              fault:2.0).  This parameter affects adaptive quantization  options
              like qprd, lumi_mask, etc..

       mblmax=&lt;0.01-255.0&gt;
              Maximum  macroblock-level Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (de&#8208;
              fault: 31.0).

       vqscale=&lt;0-31&gt;
              Constant quantizer  / constant  quality  encoding  (selects  fixed
              quantizer  mode).   A  lower value means better quality but larger
              files (default: -1).  In case of snow codec, value 0  means  loss&#8208;
              less  encoding.   Since the other codecs do not support this, vqs&#8208;
              cale=0 will have an undefined effect.  1 is not  recommended  (see
              vqmin for details).

       vqmax=&lt;1-31&gt;
              Maximum quantizer, 10-31 should be a sane range (default: 31).

       vqdiff=&lt;1-31&gt;
              maximum  quantizer  difference  between consecutive I- or P-frames
              (default: 3)

       vmax_b_frames=&lt;0-4&gt;
              maximum number of B-frames between non-B-frames:
                 0    no B-frames (default)
                 0-2  sane range for MPEG-4

                      options (default)

       me_range=&lt;0-9999&gt;
              motion estimation search range (default: 0 (unlimited))

       mbd=&lt;0-2&gt; (also see *cmp, qpel)
              Macroblock decision algorithm (high  quality  mode),  encode  each
              macro  block  in  all modes and choose the best.  This is slow but
              results in better quality and file size.  When mbd is set to 1  or
              2,  the  value of mbcmp is ignored when comparing macroblocks (the
              mbcmp value is still used in other places  though,  in  particular
              the motion search algorithms).  If any comparison setting (precmp,
              subcmp, cmp, or mbcmp) is nonzero, however, a  slower  but  better
              half-pel motion search will be used, regardless of what mbd is set
              to.  If qpel is set, quarter-pel motion search will  be  used  re&#8208;
              gardless.
                 0    Use comparison function given by mbcmp (default).
                 1    Select the MB mode which needs the fewest bits (=vhq).
                 2    Select the MB mode which has the best rate distortion.

       vhq
              Same as mbd=1, kept for compatibility reasons.

       v4mv
              Allow  4  motion vectors per macroblock (slightly better quality).
              Works better if used with mbd&gt;0.

       obmc
              overlapped block motion compensation (H.263+)

       loop
              loop filter (H.263+) note, this is broken

       inter_threshold &lt;-1000-1000&gt;
              Does absolutely nothing at the moment.

       keyint=&lt;0-300&gt;
              maximum interval between keyframes in frames (default: 250 or  one
              keyframe  every  ten seconds in a 25fps movie.  This is the recom&#8208;
              mended default for MPEG-4).  Most codecs require regular keyframes
              in  order  to limit the accumulation of mismatch error.  Keyframes
              are also needed for seeking, as seeking  is  only  possible  to  a
              keyframe  -  but  keyframes  need more space than other frames, so
              larger numbers here mean slightly smaller files but  less  precise
              seeking.   0  is  equivalent  to  1,  which  makes  every  frame a
              keyframe.  Values &gt;300 are not recommended as the quality might be
              bad  depending  upon  decoder, encoder and luck.  It is common for
              MPEG-1/2 to use values &lt;=30.

       sc_threshold=&lt;-1000000000-1000000000&gt;
              Threshold for scene change detection.  A keyframe is  inserted  by
              libavcodec  when  it  detects a scene change.  You can specify the
              sensitivity of the detection with this option.  -1000000000  means
              there  is a scene change detected at every frame, 1000000000 means
              no scene changes are detected (default: 0).

       sc_factor=&lt;any positive integer&gt;
              Causes frames with higher quantizers to be more likely to  trigger
              a  scene  change detection and make libavcodec use an I-frame (de&#8208;
              fault: 1).  1-16 is a sane range.  Values  between  2  and  6  may
              yield  increasing  PSNR  (up  to approximately 0.04 dB) and better
              placement of I-frames in high-motion scenes.  Higher values than 6
              may  give  very  slightly  better PSNR (approximately 0.01 dB more
              than sc_factor=6), but noticably worse visual quality.

       vb_strategy=&lt;0-2&gt; (pass one only)
              strategy to choose between I/P/B-frames:
                 0    Always use the maximum number of B-frames (default).
                 1    Avoid B-frames in high motion scenes.  See the b_sensitiv&#8208;
                      ity option to tune this strategy.
                 2    Places  B-frames  more  or less optimally to yield maximum
                      quality (slower).  You may want to reduce the speed impact
                      of this option by tuning the option brd_scale.

       b_sensitivity=&lt;any integer greater than 0&gt;
              Adjusts  how  sensitively  vb_strategy=1 detects motion and avoids
              using B-frames (default: 40).  Lower sensitivities will result  in
              more B-frames.  Using more B-frames usually improves PSNR, but too
              many B-frames can hurt  quality  in  high-motion  scenes.   Unless
              there  is  an  extremely  high amount of motion, b_sensitivity can
              safely be lowered below the default; 10 is a reasonable  value  in
              most cases.

       brd_scale=&lt;0-10&gt;
              Downscales frames for dynamic B-frame decision (default: 0).  Each
              time brd_scale is increased by one, the frame dimensions  are  di&#8208;
              vided  by two, which improves speed by a factor of four.  Both di&#8208;
              mensions of the fully downscaled frame must be  even  numbers,  so
              brd_scale=1  requires  the  original dimensions to be multiples of
              four, brd_scale=2 requires multiples  of  eight,  etc.   In  other
              words, the dimensions of the original frame must both be divisible
              by 2^(brd_scale+1) with no remainder.

       bidir_refine=&lt;0-4&gt;
              Refine the two motion vectors used in  bidirectional  macroblocks,
              rather than re-using vectors from the forward and backward search&#8208;
              es.  This option has no effect without B-frames.
                 0    Disabled (default).
                 1-4  Use a wider search (larger values are slower).

       vpass=&lt;1-3&gt;
              Activates internal two (or more) pass mode, only  specify  if  you
              wish to use two (or more) pass encoding.
                 1    first pass (also see turbo)
                 2    second pass
                 3    Nth pass (second and subsequent passes of N-pass encoding)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The  first  pass  (vpass=1) writes the statistics file.  You might
              want to deactivate some  CPU-hungry  options,  like  &quot;turbo&quot;  mode
              does.
              In  two  pass mode, the second pass (vpass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In N-pass mode, the second pass (vpass=3, that is not a typo) does
              both:  It  first  reads the statistics, then overwrites them.  You
              might want to backup divx2pass.log before doing this if  there  is
              any  possibility  that  you will have to cancel MEncoder.  You can
              use all encoding options,  except  very  CPU-hungry  options  like
              &quot;qns&quot;.
              You  can  run  this  same pass over and over to refine the encode.
              Each subsequent pass will use the  statistics  from  the  previous
              pass to improve.  The final pass can include any CPU-hungry encod&#8208;
              ing options.
              If you want a 2 pass encode, use first vpass=1, and then vpass=2.
              If you want a 3 or more pass encode, use  vpass=1  for  the  first
              pass  and  then vpass=3 and then vpass=3 again and again until you
              are satisfied with the encode.

              huffyuv:
                 pass 1
                      Saves statistics.
                 pass 2
                      Encodes with an optimal Huffman table based  upon  statis&#8208;
                      tics from the first pass.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically  speeds  up pass one using faster algorithms and dis&#8208;
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will  probably  reduce  global
              PSNR a little bit (around 0.01dB) and change individual frame type
              and PSNR a little bit more (up to 0.03dB).

       aspect=&lt;x/y&gt;
              Store movie aspect internally, just like with  MPEG  files.   Much
              nicer  than  rescaling,  because  quality  is not decreased.  Only
              MPlayer will play these files correctly, other players  will  dis&#8208;
              play them with wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given as
              a ratio or a floating point number.

              EXAMPLE:
                 aspect=16/9 or aspect=1.78

       autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but automatically computes aspect, tak&#8208;
              ing into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.) made
              in the filter chain.  Does not incur a performance penalty, so you
              can safely leave it always on.

       vbitrate=&lt;value&gt;
              Specify bitrate (default: 800).
              WARNING: 1kbit = 1000 bits

       vratetol=&lt;value&gt;
              approximated  file  size tolerance in kbit.  1000-100000 is a sane
              range.  (warning: 1kbit = 1000 bits) (default: 8000)
              NOTE: vratetol should not be too large during the second  pass  or
              there might be problems if vrc_(min|max)rate is used.

       vrc_maxrate=&lt;value&gt;
              maximum bitrate in kbit/sec (default: 0, unlimited)

       vrc_minrate=&lt;value&gt;

       vrc_buf_size=&lt;value&gt;
              buffer  size  in  kbit  For MPEG-1/2 this also sets the vbv buffer
              size, use 327 for VCD, 917 for SVCD and 1835 for DVD.

       vrc_strategy
              Ratecontrol method.  Note that some of  the  ratecontrol-affecting
              options will have no effect if vrc_strategy is not set to 0.
                 0    Use internal lavc ratecontrol (default).
                 1    Use  Xvid  ratecontrol (experimental; requires MEncoder to

              set q= -q * v{b|i}_qfactor + v{b|i}_qoffset
              HINT: To do constant quantizer encoding with different  quantizers
              for   I/P-  and  B-frames  you  can  use:  lmin=  &lt;ip_quant&gt;:lmax=

       vqblur=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt; (pass one)
              Quantizer blur (default: 0.5),  larger  values  will  average  the

              Data partitioning.  Adds 2 Bytes per video packet, improves error-
              resistance  when  transferring  over  unreliable  channels   (e.g.
              streaming  over  the internet).  Each video packet will be encoded
              in 3 separate partitions:
                 1. MVs
                      movement
                 2. DC coefficients
                      low res picture
                 3. AC coefficients
                      details
              MV &amp; DC are most important, losing them looks far worse than  los&#8208;
              ing  the  AC and the 1. &amp; 2. partition.  (MV &amp; DC) are far smaller
              than the 3. partition (AC) meaning that errors  will  hit  the  AC
              partition  much more often than the MV &amp; DC partitions.  Thus, the
              picture will look better with partitioning than without, as  with&#8208;
              out partitioning an error will trash AC/DC/MV equally.

       tcplx_mask=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
              Temporal  complexity masking (default: 0.0 (disabled)).  Imagine a
              scene with a bird flying across the whole scene;  tcplx_mask  will
              raise  the  quantizers  of the bird&apos;s macroblocks (thus decreasing
              their quality), as the human eye usually does not have time to see
              all the bird&apos;s details.  Be warned that if the masked object stops
              (e.g. the bird lands) it is likely to look horrible  for  a  short
              period  of  time, until the encoder figures out that the object is
              not moving and needs refined blocks.  The saved bits will be spent
              on  other parts of the video, which may increase subjective quali&#8208;
              ty, provided that tcplx_mask is carefully chosen.

       scplx_mask=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
              Spatial complexity masking.  Larger values  help  against  blocki&#8208;
              ness, if no deblocking filter is used for decoding, which is maybe
              not a good idea.
              Imagine a scene with grass (which usually has great  spatial  com&#8208;
              plexity),  a blue sky and a house; scplx_mask will raise the quan&#8208;
              tizers of the grass&apos; macroblocks, thus decreasing its quality,  in
              order to spend more bits on the sky and the house.
              HINT:  Crop  any  black borders completely as they will reduce the
              quality of the macroblocks (also applies without scplx_mask).

              NOTE: This setting does not have the same effect as using a custom
              matrix  that would compress high frequencies harder, as scplx_mask
              will reduce the quality of P blocks even if only DC  is  changing.
              The result of scplx_mask will probably not look as good.

       p_mask=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt; (also see vi_qfactor)
              Reduces  the  quality  of inter blocks.  This is equivalent to in&#8208;
              creasing the quality of intra blocks, because the same average bi&#8208;
              trate  will  be  distributed  by  the rate controller to the whole
              video sequence (default: 0.0 (disabled)).  p_mask=1.0 doubles  the
              bits allocated to each intra block.
&#12;       border_mask=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
              border-processing  for MPEG-style encoders.  Border processing in&#8208;
              creases the quantizer for macroblocks which are less than 1/5th of
              the  frame width/height away from the frame border, since they are
              often visually less important.

       predia=&lt;-99-6&gt;
              diamond type and size for motion estimation pre-pass

       dia=&lt;-99-6&gt;
              Diamond type &amp; size for motion estimation.  Motion  search  is  an
              iterative  process.   Using  a  small  diamond  does not limit the
              search to finding only small motion vectors.  It is just  somewhat
              more  likely  to  stop before finding the very best motion vector,
              especially when noise is involved.  Bigger diamonds allow a  wider
              search  for  the best motion vector, thus are slower but result in
              better quality.
              Big normal diamonds are better quality  than  shape-adaptive  dia&#8208;
              monds.
              Shape-adaptive  diamonds  are  a  good  tradeoff between speed and
              quality.
              NOTE: The sizes of the normal diamonds and shape adaptive ones  do

              ing for each 8x8 block.  Trellis searched  quantization  is  quite
              simply  an  optimal  quantization in the PSNR versus bitrate sense
              (Assuming that there would be no rounding errors introduced by the
              IDCT,  which is obviously not the case.).  It simply finds a block
              for the minimum of error and lambda*bits.

                      quantization parameter (QP) dependent constant

       mv0
              Try to encode each MB with MV=&lt;0,0&gt; and  choose  the  better  one.
              This has no effect if mbd=0.

       mv0_threshold=&lt;any non-negative integer&gt;
              When  surrounding  motion vectors are &lt;0,0&gt; and the motion estima&#8208;
              tion score of the current block is less than mv0_threshold,  &lt;0,0&gt;
              is  used  for  the  motion vector and further motion estimation is
              skipped (default: 256).  Lowering mv0_threshold to 0  can  give  a
              slight  (0.01dB) PSNR increase and possibly make the encoded video
              look slightly better; raising mv0_threshold past  320  results  in
              diminished PSNR and visual quality.  Higher values speed up encod&#8208;
              ing very slightly (usually less than 1%, depending  on  the  other
              options used).
              NOTE: This option does not require mv0 to be enabled.

              subpel refinement quality (for qpel) (default: 8 (high quality))
              NOTE: This has a significant effect on speed.

       refs=&lt;1-8&gt;
              number  of  reference  frames  to consider for motion compensation

       psnr
              print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for  the  whole  video
              after  encoding and store the per frame PSNR in a file with a name
              like &apos;psnr_hhmmss.log&apos;.  Returned values are in dB (decibel),  the
              higher the better.

       mpeg_quant
              Use MPEG quantizers instead of H.263.

       aic
              Enable  AC  prediction for MPEG-4 or advanced intra prediction for
              H.263+.  This will improve quality very slightly (around  0.02  dB
              PSNR) and slow down encoding very slightly (about 1%).
              NOTE: vqmin should be 8 or larger for H.263+ AIC.

       aiv
              alternative inter vlc for H.263+

       umv
              unlimited  MVs  (H.263+  only) Allows encoding of arbitrarily long
              MVs.

              NOTE:  The  H.263 MMX quantizer cannot handle positive biases (set
              vfdct=1 or 2), the MPEG MMX quantizer cannot handle negative bias&#8208;

       nr=&lt;0-100000&gt;
              Noise  reduction,  0  means disabled.  0-600 is a useful range for
              typical content, but you may want to turn it up  a  bit  more  for
              very noisy content (default: 0).  Given its small impact on speed,
              you might want to prefer to use this  over  filtering  noise  away
              with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       qns=&lt;0-3&gt;
              Quantizer  noise  shaping.   Rather  than choosing quantization to
              most closely match the source video in the PSNR sense, it  chooses
              quantization  such  that noise (usually ringing) will be masked by
              similar-frequency content in the image.  Larger values are  slower
              but may not result in better quality.  This can and should be used
              together with trellis quantization,  in  which  case  the  trellis
              quantization  (optimal for constant weight) will be used as start&#8208;
              point for the iterative search.

       inter_matrix=&lt;comma separated matrix&gt;
              Use  custom inter matrix.  It needs a comma separated string of 64
              integers.

       intra_matrix=&lt;comma separated matrix&gt;
              Use custom intra matrix.  It needs a comma separated string of  64
              integers.

       dc
              intra   DC  precision  in  bits  (default:  8).   If  you  specify
              vcodec=mpeg2video this value can be 8, 9, 10 or 11.

       cgop (also see sc_threshold)
              Close all GOPs.  Currently it only works if scene change detection
              is disabled (sc_threshold=1000000000).

       gmc
              Enable Global Motion Compensation.

       (no)lowdelay
              Sets the low delay flag for MPEG-1/2 (disables B-frames).

       vglobal=&lt;0-3&gt;
              Control writing global video headers.
                 0    Codec decides where to write global headers (default).
                 1    Write   global  headers  only  in  extradata  (needed  for
                      .mp4/MOV/NUT).

   nuv (-nuvopts)
       Nuppel video is based on RTJPEG and LZO.  By default frames are first en&#8208;
       coded with RTJPEG and then compressed with LZO, but  it  is  possible  to
       disable  either  or both of the two passes.  As a result, you can in fact
       output raw i420, LZO compressed i420, RTJPEG, or  the  default  LZO  com&#8208;
       pressed RTJPEG.
       NOTE:  The  nuvrec  documentation contains some advice and examples about
       the settings to use for the most common TV encodings.

       c=&lt;0-20&gt;
              chrominance threshold (default: 1)

       l=&lt;0-20&gt;
              luminance threshold (default: 1)

       lzo
              Enable LZO compression (default).

       nolzo
              Disable LZO compression.

       q=&lt;3-255&gt;
              quality level (default: 255)

       raw
              Disable RTJPEG encoding.

       rtjpeg
              Enable RTJPEG encoding (default).

   xvidenc (-xvidencopts)
       There are three modes available: constant bitrate (CBR), fixed  quantizer
       and two pass.

       pass=&lt;1|2&gt;
              Specify the pass in two pass mode.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically  speeds  up pass one using faster algorithms and dis&#8208;
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will  probably  reduce  global
              PSNR a little bit and change individual frame type and PSNR a lit&#8208;
              tle bit more.

       bitrate=&lt;value&gt; (CBR or two pass mode)
              Sets the bitrate to be used in kbits/second if &lt;16000 or in  bits/
              second if &gt;16000.  If &lt;value&gt; is negative, Xvid will use its abso&#8208;
              lute value as the target size (in kBytes) of the video and compute
              the associated bitrate automagically (default: 687 kbits/s).

       fixed_quant=&lt;1-31&gt;
              Switch  to  fixed  quantizer  mode and specify the quantizer to be
              used.

       zones=&lt;zone0&gt;[/&lt;zone1&gt;[/...]] (CBR or two pass mode)
              User specified quality for specific parts (ending, credits,  ...).
              Each zone is &lt;start-frame&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;value&gt; where &lt;mode&gt; may be
                 q    Constant quantizer override, where value=&lt;2.0-31.0&gt; repre&#8208;
                      sents the quantizer value.
                 w    Ratecontrol weight override, where value=&lt;0.01-2.00&gt;  rep&#8208;
                      resents the quality correction in %.

              EXAMPLE:
                 zones=90000,q,20
                      Encodes  all  frames starting with frame 90000 at constant
                      quantizer 20.
                 zones=0,w,0.1/10001,w,1.0/90000,q,20
                      Encode frames 0-10000 at 10% bitrate, encode frames  90000
                      up  to  the  end  at constant quantizer 20.  Note that the
                      second zone is needed to delimit the first zone, as  with&#8208;
                      out it everything up until frame 89999 would be encoded at
                      10% bitrate.

       me_quality=&lt;0-6&gt;
              This option controls the motion estimation subsystem.  The  higher
              the value, the more precise the estimation should be (default: 6).
              The more precise the motion estimation is, the more  bits  can  be
              saved.  Precision is gained at the expense of CPU time so decrease
              this setting if you need realtime encoding.
&#12;       (no)qpel
              MPEG-4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion  search  by  de&#8208;
              fault.  The standard proposes a mode where encoders are allowed to
              use quarter pixel precision.  This option  usually  results  in  a
              sharper image.  Unfortunately it has a great impact on bitrate and
              sometimes the higher bitrate use will prevent  it  from  giving  a
              better  image  quality  at  a fixed bitrate.  It is better to test
              with and without this option and see whether it is worth  activat&#8208;
              ing.

       (no)gmc
              Enable  Global Motion Compensation, which makes Xvid generate spe&#8208;
              cial frames (GMC-frames) which are well suited for Pan/Zoom/Rotat&#8208;
              ing  images.  Whether or not the use of this option will save bits
              is highly dependent on the source material.

       (no)trellis
              Trellis Quantization is a kind  of  adaptive  quantization  method
              that  saves  bits by modifying quantized coefficients to make them
              more compressible by the entropy encoder.  Its impact  on  quality
              is good, and if VHQ uses too much CPU for you, this setting can be
              a good alternative to save a few bits (and gain quality  at  fixed
              bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ (default: on).

       (no)cartoon
              Activate  this  if  your encoded sequence is an anime/cartoon.  It
              modifies some Xvid internal thresholds so Xvid takes better  deci&#8208;
              sions on frame types and motion vectors for flat looking cartoons.

       (no)chroma_me
              The  usual motion estimation algorithm uses only the luminance in&#8208;
              formation to find the best motion vector.  However for some  video
              material,  using  the  chroma planes can help find better vectors.
              This setting toggles the use of chroma planes for  motion  estima&#8208;
              tion (default: on).

       (no)chroma_opt
              Enable  a chroma optimizer prefilter.  It will do some extra magic
              on color information to  minimize  the  stepped-stairs  effect  on
              edges.  It will improve quality at the cost of encoding speed.  It
              reduces PSNR by nature, as the mathematical deviation to the orig&#8208;
              inal  picture  will  get  bigger, but the subjective image quality
              will raise.  Since it works with color information, you might want
              to turn it off when encoding in grayscale.

       (no)hq_ac
              Activates  high-quality  prediction  of  AC coefficients for intra
              frames from neighbor blocks (default: on).

       vhq=&lt;0-4&gt;
              The motion search algorithm is based on a search in the usual col&#8208;
              or  domain  and  tries  to find a motion vector that minimizes the
              difference between the reference  frame  and  the  encoded  frame.
              With  this setting activated, Xvid will also use the frequency do&#8208;
              main (DCT) to search for a motion vector that minimizes  not  only
              the  spatial difference but also the encoding length of the block.
              Fastest to slowest:
                 0    off
                 1    mode decision (inter/intra MB) (default)
                 2    limited search
                 3    medium search
                 4    wide search

       (no)lumi_mask
              Adaptive quantization allows the macroblock quantizers to vary in&#8208;
              side  each  frame.  This is a &apos;psychosensory&apos; setting that is sup&#8208;
              posed to make use of the fact that the human eye tends  to  notice
              fewer  details  in very bright and very dark parts of the picture.
              It compresses those areas more strongly than  medium  ones,  which
              will  save  bits  that can be spent again on other frames, raising
              overall subjective quality and possibly reducing PSNR.

       (no)grayscale
              Make Xvid discard chroma planes so the encoded video is  grayscale
              only.  Note that this does not speed up encoding, it just prevents
              chroma data from being written in the last stage of encoding.

       (no)interlacing
              Encode the fields of interlaced video material.  Turn this  option
              on for interlaced content.
              NOTE:  Should  you rescale the video, you would need an interlace-
              aware   resizer,    which    you    can    activate    with    -vf
              scale=&lt;width&gt;:&lt;height&gt;:1.

       min_iquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              minimum I-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_iquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              maximum I-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_pquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              minimum P-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_pquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              maximum P-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_bquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              minimum B-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_bquant=&lt;0-31&gt;
              maximum B-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_key_interval=&lt;value&gt; (two pass only)
              minimum interval between keyframes (default: 0)

       max_key_interval=&lt;value&gt;
              maximum interval between keyframes (default: 10*fps)

       quant_type=&lt;h263|mpeg&gt;
              Sets  the  type  of quantizer to use.  For high bitrates, you will
              find that MPEG quantization preserves more detail.   For  low  bi&#8208;
              trates,  the  smoothing  of  H.263 will give you less block noise.
              When using custom matrices, MPEG quantization must be used.

       quant_intra_matrix=&lt;filename&gt;
              Load a custom intra matrix file.  You can build such a  file  with
              xvid4conf&apos;s matrix editor.

       quant_inter_matrix=&lt;filename&gt;
              Load  a  custom inter matrix file.  You can build such a file with
              xvid4conf&apos;s matrix editor.

       keyframe_boost=&lt;0-1000&gt; (two pass mode only)
              Shift some bits from the pool  for  other  frame  types  to  intra
              frames,  thus improving keyframe quality.  This amount is an extra
              percentage, so a value of 10 will give  your  keyframes  10%  more
              bits than normal (default: 0).

       kfthreshold=&lt;value&gt; (two pass mode only)
              Works  together with kfreduction.  Determines the minimum distance
              below which you consider that two frames are  considered  consecu&#8208;
              tive  and  treated  differently according to kfreduction (default:
              10).

       kfreduction=&lt;0-100&gt; (two pass mode only)
              The above two settings can be used to adjust the size of keyframes
              that  you consider too close to the first (in a row).  kfthreshold
              sets the range in which keyframes are reduced, and kfreduction de&#8208;
              termines  the  bitrate  reduction they get.  The last I-frame will
              get treated normally (default: 30).

       max_bframes=&lt;0-4&gt;
              Maximum number of B-frames to put between I/P-frames (default: 2).

       bquant_ratio=&lt;0-1000&gt;
              quantizer ratio between B- and  non-B-frames,  150=1.50  (default:
              150)

       bquant_offset=&lt;-1000-1000&gt;
              quantizer  offset  between B- and non-B-frames, 100=1.00 (default:
              100)

       bf_threshold=&lt;-255-255&gt;
              This setting allows you to specify what priority to place  on  the
              use of B-frames.  The higher the value, the higher the probability
              of B-frames being used (default: 0).  Do not forget that  B-frames
              usually  have a higher quantizer, and therefore aggressive produc&#8208;
              tion of B-frames may cause worse visual quality.

       (no)closed_gop
              This option tells Xvid to  close  every  GOP  (Group  Of  Pictures
              bounded  by  two I-frames), which makes GOPs independent from each
              other.  This just implies that the last frame of the GOP is either
              a  P-frame  or  a N-frame but not a B-frame.  It is usually a good
              idea to turn this option on (default: on).

       (no)packed
              This option is meant to solve frame-order issues when encoding  to
              container  formats  like  AVI  that  cannot cope with out-of-order
              frames.  In practice, most decoders (both software  and  hardware)
              are able to deal with frame-order themselves, and may get confused
              when this option is turned on, so you can safely leave if off, un&#8208;
              less you really know what you are doing.
              WARNING:  This will generate an illegal bitstream, and will not be
              decodable by ISO-MPEG-4 decoders except DivX/libavcodec/Xvid.
              WARNING: This will also store a fake DivX version in the  file  so
              the bug autodetection of some decoders might be confused.

       frame_drop_ratio=&lt;0-100&gt; (max_bframes=0 only)
              This  setting  allows  the  creation  of  variable framerate video
              streams.  The value of the setting  specifies  a  threshold  under
              which,  if  the  difference of the following frame to the previous
              frame is below or equal to this threshold, a frame gets not  coded
              (a  so  called  n-vop is placed in the stream).  On playback, when
              reaching an n-vop the previous frame will be displayed.
              WARNING: Playing with this setting may result in a jerky video, so
              use it at your own risks!

       rc_reaction_delay_factor=&lt;value&gt;
              This  parameter  controls  the  number of frames the CBR rate con&#8208;
              troller will wait before reacting to bitrate changes  and  compen&#8208;
              sating  for  them  to  obtain a constant bitrate over an averaging
              range of frames.

       rc_averaging_period=&lt;value&gt;
              Real CBR is hard to achieve.  Depending on the video material, bi&#8208;
              trate  can  be variable, and hard to predict.  Therefore Xvid uses
              an averaging period for which it guarantees a given amount of bits
              (minus a small variation).  This settings expresses the &quot;number of
              frames&quot; for which Xvid averages bitrate and tries to achieve CBR.

       rc_buffer=&lt;value&gt;
              size of the rate control buffer

       curve_compression_high=&lt;0-100&gt;
              This setting allows Xvid to take a certain percentage of bits away
              from  high bitrate scenes and give them back to the bit reservoir.
              You could also use this if you have a clip with so many bits allo&#8208;
              cated to high-bitrate scenes that the low(er)-bitrate scenes start
              to look bad (default: 0).

       curve_compression_low=&lt;0-100&gt;
              This setting allows Xvid to give a  certain  percentage  of  extra
              bits  to the low bitrate scenes, taking a few bits from the entire
              clip.  This might come in handy if  you  have  a  few  low-bitrate
              scenes that are still blocky (default: 0).

       overflow_control_strength=&lt;0-100&gt;
              During  pass  one  of two pass encoding, a scaled bitrate curve is
              computed.  The difference between that expected curve and the  re&#8208;
              sult  obtained during encoding is called overflow.  Obviously, the
              two pass rate controller tries to compensate  for  that  overflow,
              distributing  it  over the next frames.  This setting controls how
              much of the overflow is distributed every  time  there  is  a  new
              frame.   Low  values  allow lazy overflow control, big rate bursts
              are compensated for more slowly (could lead to lack  of  precision
              for  small  clips).  Higher values will make changes in bit redis&#8208;
              tribution more abrupt, possibly too abrupt if you set it too high,
              creating artifacts (default: 5).
              NOTE: This setting impacts quality a lot, play with it carefully!

       max_overflow_improvement=&lt;0-100&gt;
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control may increase the
              frame size.  This parameter specifies the  maximum  percentage  by
              which  the overflow control is allowed to increase the frame size,
              compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       max_overflow_degradation=&lt;0-100&gt;
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control may decrease the
              frame  size.   This  parameter specifies the maximum percentage by
              which the overflow control is allowed to decrease the frame  size,
              compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       container_frame_overhead=&lt;0...&gt;
              Specifies  a  frame average overhead per frame, in bytes.  Most of
              the time users express their target bitrate for video  w/o  taking
              care  of  the  video  container overhead.  This small but (mostly)
              constant overhead can cause the target file size to  be  exceeded.
              Xvid allows users to set the amount of overhead per frame the con&#8208;
              tainer generates (give only an average per frame).  0 has  a  spe&#8208;
              cial meaning, it lets Xvid use its own default values (default: 24
              - AVI average overhead).

       profile=&lt;profile_name&gt;
              Restricts options and VBV (peak bitrate over a short  period)  ac&#8208;

              not recognize Xvid but most recognize DivX.

       par=&lt;mode&gt;
              Specifies  the  Pixel  Aspect  Ratio mode (not to be confused with
              DAR, the Display Aspect Ratio).  PAR is the ratio of the width and
              height  of  a  single pixel.  So both are related like this: DAR =
              PAR * (width/height).
              MPEG-4 defines 5 pixel aspect ratios and one extended one,  giving
              the opportunity to specify a specific pixel aspect ratio.  5 stan&#8208;
              dard modes can be specified:
                 vga11
                      It is the usual PAR for PC content.  Pixels are  a  square
                      unit.
                 pal43
                      PAL standard 4:3 PAR.  Pixels are rectangles.
                 pal169
                      same as above
                 ntsc43
                      same as above
                 ntsc169
                      same as above (Do not forget to give the exact ratio.)
                 ext
                      Allows  you  to  specify  your own pixel aspect ratio with
                      par_width and par_height.
              NOTE: In general, setting aspect and autoaspect options is enough.

       par_width=&lt;1-255&gt; (par=ext only)
              Specifies the width of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       par_height=&lt;1-255&gt; (par=ext only)
              Specifies the height of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       aspect=&lt;x/y | f (float value)&gt;
              Store movie aspect internally, just like MPEG files.   Much  nicer
              solution than rescaling, because quality is not decreased.  MPlay&#8208;
              er and a few others players will play these files correctly,  oth&#8208;
              ers will display them with the wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter
              can be given as a ratio or a floating point number.

       (no)autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but automatically computes aspect, tak&#8208;
              ing into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.) made
              in the filter chain.

       psnr
              Print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for  the  whole  video
              after  encoding and store the per frame PSNR in a file with a name
              like &apos;psnr_hhmmss.log&apos; in the current directory.  Returned  values
              are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.

       debug
              Save per-frame statistics in ./xvid.dbg. (This is not the two pass
              control file.)

       The following options are only available in Xvid 1.1.x and later.

       bvhq=&lt;0|1&gt;
              This setting allows vector candidates for B-frames to be used  for
              the  encoding  chosen  using a rate distortion optimized operator,
              which is what is done for P-frames by the vhq option.   This  pro&#8208;
              duces nicer-looking B-frames while incurring almost no performance
              penalty (default: 1).

       vbv_bufsize=&lt;0...&gt; (two pass mode only)
              Specify the video buffering verifier (VBV)  buffer  size  in  bits
              (default:  0  -  VBV check disabled).  VBV allows restricting peak
              bitrate to make the video play properly on hardware players.   For
              example,  the  Home  profile uses vbv_bufsize=3145728.  If you set
              vbv_bufsize you should set also vbv_maxrate.  Note that  there  is
              no  vbv_peakrate because Xvid does not actually use it for bitrate
              controlling; the other VBV options are enough to restrict the peak
              bitrate.

       vbv_initial=&lt;0...vbv_bufsize&gt; (two pass mode only)
              Specify  the  initial fill of the VBV buffer in bits (default: 75%
              of vbv_bufsize).  The default is probably what you want.

       vbv_maxrate=&lt;0...&gt; (two pass mode only)
              Specify the maximum processing rate in bits/s (default:  0).   For
              example, the Home profile uses vbv_maxrate=4854000.

       The following option is only available in Xvid 1.2.x and later.

       threads=&lt;0-n&gt;
              Create  n  threads to run the motion estimation (default: 0).  The
              maximum number of threads that can be used is the  picture  height
              divided by 16.

   x264enc (-x264encopts)
       bitrate=&lt;value&gt;
              Sets  the  average  bitrate  to  be used in kbits/second (default:
              off).  Since local bitrate may vary, this average may  be  inaccu&#8208;
              rate for very short videos (see ratetol).  Constant bitrate can be
              achieved by combining this with vbv_maxrate, at significant reduc&#8208;
              tion in quality.

       qp=&lt;0-51&gt;
              This  selects  the quantizer to use for P-frames.  I- and B-frames
              are offset from this value by ip_factor and pb_factor, respective&#8208;
              ly.   20-40  is a useful range.  Lower values result in better fi&#8208;
              delity, but higher bitrates.  0 is lossless.  Note that  quantiza&#8208;
              tion in H.264 works differently from MPEG-1/2/4: H.264&apos;s quantiza&#8208;
              tion parameter (QP) is on a logarithmic scale.  The mapping is ap&#8208;
              proximately  H264QP  =  12 + 6*log2(MPEGQP).  For example, MPEG at
              QP=2 is equivalent to H.264  at  QP=18.   Generally,  this  option
              should be avoided and crf should be used instead as crf will yield
              better visual results for the same size.

       crf=&lt;1.0-50.0&gt;
              Enables constant quality mode, and selects the quality.  The scale
              is  similar to QP.  Like the bitrate-based modes, this allows each
              frame to use a different QP based on the frame&apos;s complexity.  This
              option should generally be used instead of qp.

       crf_max=&lt;float&gt;
              With  CRF  and  VBV,  limit RF to this value (may cause VBV under&#8208;
              flows!).

       pass=&lt;1-3&gt;
              Enable 2 or 3-pass mode.  It is recommended to always encode in  2
              or  3-pass  mode  as it leads to a better bit distribution and im&#8208;
              proves overall quality.
                 1    first pass
                 2    second pass (of two pass encoding)
                 3    Nth pass (second and third passes of three pass encoding)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (pass=1)  collects  statistics  on  the  video  and
              writes them to a file.  You might want to deactivate some CPU-hun&#8208;
              gry options, apart from the ones that are on by default.
              In two pass mode, the second pass (pass=2)  reads  the  statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In  three  pass mode, the second pass (pass=3, that is not a typo)
              does both: It first reads the statistics,  then  overwrites  them.
              You can use all encoding options, except very CPU-hungry options.
              The  third  pass  (pass=3)  is the same as the second pass, except
              that it has the second pass&apos; statistics to work from.  You can use
              all encoding options, including CPU-hungry ones.
              The first pass may use either average bitrate or constant quantiz&#8208;
              er.  ABR is recommended, since it  does  not  require  guessing  a
              quantizer.  Subsequent passes are ABR, and must specify bitrate.

              me=dia  partitions=none  ref=1 subq={2 if &gt;2 else unchanged} trel&#8208;
              lis=0 fast_pskip.  These settings significantly  improve  encoding
              speed while having little or no impact on the quality of the final
              pass.
              This option is implied with preset=placebo.

       keyint=&lt;value&gt;
              Sets maximum interval between IDR-frames (default:  250).   Larger
              values  save  bits,  thus  improve quality, at the cost of seeking
              precision.  Unlike MPEG-1/2/4, H.264  does  not  suffer  from  DCT
              drift with large values of keyint.

       keyint_min=&lt;1-keyint/2&gt;
              Sets  minimum  interval  between  IDR-frames  (default: auto).  If
              scenecuts appear within this interval, they are still  encoded  as
              I-frames,  but  do not start a new GOP.  In H.264, I-frames do not
              necessarily bound a closed GOP because it is allowable  for  a  P-
              frame to be predicted from more frames than just the one frame be&#8208;
              fore it (also see frameref).  Therefore, I-frames are  not  neces&#8208;
              sarily seekable.  IDR-frames restrict subsequent P-frames from re&#8208;
              ferring to any frame prior to the IDR-frame.

       scenecut=&lt;-1-100&gt;
              Controls how aggressively to insert extra I-frames (default:  40).
              With  small values of scenecut, the codec often has to force an I-
              frame when it would exceed keyint.  Good values  of  scenecut  may
              find  a better location for the I-frame.  Large values use more I-
              frames than necessary, thus wasting bits.  -1  disables  scene-cut
              detection,  so  I-frames are inserted only once every other keyint
              frames, even if a scene-cut occurs earlier.  This  is  not  recom&#8208;
              mended  and  wastes  bitrate  as scenecuts encoded as P-frames are
              just as big as I-frames, but do not reset the &quot;keyint counter&quot;.

       (no)intra_refresh
              Periodic intra block refresh instead of keyframes  (default:  dis&#8208;
              abled).   This  option  disables  IDR-frames, and, instead, uses a
              moving vertical bar of intra-coded blocks. This  reduces  compres&#8208;
              sion  efficiency but benefits low-latency streaming and resilience
              to packet loss.

       frameref=&lt;1-16&gt;
              Number of previous frames used as predictors in  B-  and  P-frames
              (default:  3).  This is effective in anime, but in live-action ma&#8208;
              terial the improvements usually drop off very rapidly above  6  or
              so  reference  frames.   This has no effect on decoding speed, but
              does increase the memory needed for decoding.  Some  decoders  can
              only handle a maximum of 15 reference frames.

       bframes=&lt;0-16&gt;
              maximum  number  of  consecutive  B-frames between I- and P-frames
              (default: 3)

       (no)b_adapt
              Automatically decides when to use B-frames and how many, up to the
              maximum  specified  above  (default:  on).  If this option is dis&#8208;
              abled, then the maximum number of B-frames is used.

       b_bias=&lt;-100-100&gt;
              Controls the decision performed by b_adapt.  A higher b_bias  pro&#8208;
              duces more B-frames (default: 0).

       b_pyramid=&lt;normal|strict|none&gt;
              Allows  B-frames  to  be  used  as references for predicting other
              frames.  For example, consider 3 consecutive B-frames: I0 B1 B2 B3
              P4.   Without  this  option,  B-frames  follow the same pattern as
              MPEG-[124].  So they are coded in the order I0 P4 B1  B2  B3,  and
              all  the B-frames are predicted from I0 and P4.  With this option,
              they are coded as I0 P4 B2 B1 B3.  B2 is the same as above, but B1
              is  predicted  from I0 and B2, and B3 is predicted from B2 and P4.
              This usually results in slightly improved compression,  at  almost
              no speed cost.  However, this is an experimental option: it is not
              fully tuned and may not always help.  Requires bframes &gt;= 2.  Dis&#8208;
              advantage: increases decoding delay to 2 frames.
                 normal
                      Allow  B-frames as references as described above (not Blu-
                      ray compatible).
                 strict
                      Disallow P-frames referencing B-frames. Gives  worse  com&#8208;
                      pression, but is required for Blu-ray compatibility.
                 none
                      Disable using B-frames as references.

       (no)open_gop
              Use recovery points to close GOPs; only available with bframes.

       (no)bluray_compat
              Enable compatibility hacks for Blu-Ray support.

       (no)fake_interlaced
              Flag stream as interlaced but encode progressive. Makes it posssi&#8208;
              ble to encode 25p and 30p Blu-Ray streams. Ignored  in  interlaced
              mode.

       frame_packing=&lt;0-5&gt;
              Define frame arrangement for stereoscopic videos.
                 0    Checkerboard - pixels are alternately from L and R.
                 1    Column alternation - L and R are interlaced by column.
                 2    Row alternation - L and R are interlaced by row.
                 3    Side by side - L is on the left, R is on the right.
                 4    Top-bottom - L is on top, R is on the bottom.
                 5    Frame alternation - one view per frame.

       (no)deblock
              Use deblocking filter (default: on).  As it takes very little time
              compared to its quality gain, it is not recommended to disable it.

       deblock=&lt;-6-6&gt;,&lt;-6-6&gt;
              The first parameter is AlphaC0 (default: 0).  This adjusts thresh&#8208;
              olds for the H.264 in-loop deblocking filter.  First, this parame&#8208;
              ter adjusts the maximum amount of change that the  filter  is  al&#8208;
              lowed to cause on any one pixel.  Secondly, this parameter affects
              the threshold for difference across the edge  being  filtered.   A
              positive  value  reduces  blocking  artifacts  more, but will also
              smear details.
              The second parameter is Beta (default: 0).  This affects  the  de&#8208;
              tail  threshold.  Very detailed blocks are not filtered, since the
              smoothing caused by the filter would be more noticeable  than  the
              original blocking.
              The  default behavior of the filter almost always achieves optimal
              quality, so it is best to either leave  it  alone,  or  make  only
              small  adjustments.   However, if your source material already has
              some blocking or noise which you would like to remove, it may be a
              good idea to turn it up a little bit.

       (no)cabac
              Use  CABAC  (Context-Adaptive  Binary Arithmetic Coding) (default:
              on).  Slightly slows down encoding and decoding, but  should  save
              10-15%  bitrate.   Unless  you are looking for decoding speed, you
              should not disable it.

       qp_min=&lt;1-51&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              Minimum quantizer, 10-30 seems to be a useful range (default: 10).

       qp_max=&lt;1-51&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              maximum quantizer (default: 51)

       qp_step=&lt;1-50&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              maximum value by which the quantizer may be incremented/decrement&#8208;
              ed between frames (default: 4)

       (no)mbtree
              Enable  macroblock  tree  ratecontrol  (default:  enabled).  Use a
              large lookahead to track temporal propagation of data  and  weight
              quality  accordingly.   In multi-pass mode, this writes to a sepa&#8208;
              rate stats file named &lt;passlogfile&gt;.mbtree.

       rc_lookahead=&lt;0-250&gt;
              Adjust the mbtree lookahead distance (default: 40).  Larger values
              will  be  slower  and  cause  x264 to consume more memory, but can
              yield higher quality.

       ratetol=&lt;0.1-100.0&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              allowed variance in average bitrate  (no  particular  units)  (de&#8208;
              fault: 1.0)

       vbv_maxrate=&lt;value&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              maximum local bitrate, in kbits/second (default: disabled)

       vbv_bufsize=&lt;value&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              averaging period for vbv_maxrate, in kbits (default: none, must be
              specified if vbv_maxrate is enabled)

       vbv_init=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              initial buffer occupancy, as a fraction of  vbv_bufsize  (default:
              0.9)

       ip_factor=&lt;value&gt;
              quantizer factor between I- and P-frames (default: 1.4)

       pb_factor=&lt;value&gt;
              quantizer factor between P- and B-frames (default: 1.3)

       qcomp=&lt;0-1&gt; (ABR or two pass)
              quantizer compression (default: 0.6).  A lower value makes the bi&#8208;
              trate more constant, while a higher value makes  the  quantization
              parameter more constant.

       cplx_blur=&lt;0-999&gt; (two pass only)
              Temporal blur of the estimated frame complexity, before curve com&#8208;
              pression (default: 20).  Lower values allow the quantizer value to
              jump  around  more,  higher values force it to vary more smoothly.
              cplx_blur ensures that each I-frame has quality comparable to  the
              following P-frames, and ensures that alternating high and low com&#8208;
              plexity frames (e.g. low fps animation) do not waste bits on fluc&#8208;
              tuating quantizer.

       qblur=&lt;0-99&gt; (two pass only)
              Temporal  blur of the quantization parameter, after curve compres&#8208;
              sion (default: 0.5).  Lower values allow the  quantizer  value  to
              jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smoothly.

       zones=&lt;zone0&gt;[/&lt;zone1&gt;[/...]]
              User  specified quality for specific parts (ending, credits, ...).
              Each zone is &lt;start-frame&gt;,&lt;end-frame&gt;,&lt;option&gt; where  option  may
              be
                 q=&lt;0-51&gt;
                      quantizer
                 b=&lt;0.01-100.0&gt;
                      bitrate multiplier
              NOTE:  The  quantizer option is not strictly enforced.  It affects
              only the planning stage of ratecontrol, and is  still  subject  to
              overflow compensation and qp_min/qp_max.

       direct_pred=&lt;name&gt;
              Determines  the  type  of  motion  prediction used for direct mac&#8208;
              roblocks in B-frames.
                 none Direct macroblocks are not used.
                 spatial
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from  neighboring  blocks.
                      (default)
                 temporal
                      Motion  vectors  are  extrapolated  from  the following P-
                      frame.
                 auto The codec selects between spatial and  temporal  for  each
                      frame.
              Spatial  and  temporal  are approximately the same speed and PSNR,
              the choice between them depends on the  video  content.   Auto  is
              slightly better, but slower.  Auto is most effective when combined
              with multipass.  direct_pred=none is both slower and lower  quali&#8208;
              ty.

       weightp
              Weighted P-frame prediction mode (default: 2).
                 0    disabled (fastest)
                 1    weighted refs (better quality)
                 2    weighted refs + duplicates (best)

       (no)weight_b
              Use  weighted  prediction in B-frames.  Without this option, bidi&#8208;
              rectionally predicted macroblocks give equal weight to each refer&#8208;
              ence  frame.   With this option, the weights are determined by the
              temporal position of the B-frame relative to the references.   Re&#8208;
              quires bframes &gt; 1.

       partitions=&lt;list&gt;
              Enable     some     optional     macroblock     types    (default:
              p8x8,b8x8,i8x8,i4x4).
                 p8x8 Enable types p16x8, p8x16, p8x8.
                 p4x4 Enable types p8x4, p4x8, p4x4.  p4x4 is  recommended  only
                      with subq &gt;= 5, and only at low resolutions.
                 b8x8 Enable types b16x8, b8x16, b8x8.
                 i8x8 Enable type i8x8.  i8x8 has no effect unless 8x8dct is en&#8208;
                      abled.
                 i4x4 Enable type i4x4.
                 all  Enable all of the above types.
                 none Disable all of the above types.
              Regardless of this option, macroblock types  p16x16,  b16x16,  and
              i16x16 are always enabled.
              The idea is to find the type and size that best describe a certain
              area of the picture.  For example, a global pan is  better  repre&#8208;
              sented by 16x16 blocks, while small moving objects are better rep&#8208;
              resented by smaller blocks.

       (no)8x8dct
              Adaptive spatial transform size: allows macroblocks to choose  be&#8208;
              tween  4x4  and  8x8  DCT.   Also allows the i8x8 macroblock type.
              Without this option, only 4x4 DCT is used.

       me=&lt;name&gt;

                 esa  exhaustive search (very slow, and no better than umh)

       me_range=&lt;4-64&gt;
              radius of exhaustive or multi-hexagon motion search (default: 16)

       subq=&lt;0-11&gt;
              Adjust subpel refinement quality.  This parameter controls quality
              versus  speed tradeoffs involved in the motion estimation decision
              process.  subq=5 can compress up to 10% better than subq=1.

                      date  macroblock  types.   Then selects the best type with
                      SAD metric (faster than  subq=1,  not  recommended  unless
                      you&apos;re looking for ultra-fast encoding).
                 1    Does  as  0,  then refines the motion of that type to fast

                      date  macroblock  types.   Then selects the best type with
                      SATD metric.  Then refines the motion of that type to fast
                      quarterpixel precision.
                 3    As 2, but uses a slower quarterpixel refinement.
                 4    Runs  fast quarterpixel precision motion estimation on all
                      candidate macroblock types.  Then selects  the  best  type
                      with  SATD metric.  Then finishes the quarterpixel refine&#8208;
                      ment for that type.
                 5    Runs best quality quarterpixel precision motion estimation
                      on  all  candidate  macroblock types, before selecting the
                      best type.  Also refines the two motion  vectors  used  in
                      bidirectional  macroblocks  with  SATD metric, rather than
                      reusing vectors from the forward and backward searches.
                 6    Enables rate-distortion optimization of  macroblock  types
                      in I- and P-frames.
                 7    Enables  rate-distortion  optimization of macroblock types
                      in all frames (default).
                 8    Enables rate-distortion optimization of motion vectors and
                      intra prediction modes in I- and P-frames.
                 9    Enables rate-distortion optimization of motion vectors and
                      intra prediction modes in all frames.
                 10   QP-RD; requires trellis=2 and aq_mode=1 or higher (best).
                 11   Full RD; disable all early terminations.
              In the above, &quot;all candidates&quot; does not exactly mean  all  enabled
              types: 4x4, 4x8, 8x4 are tried only if 8x8 is better than 16x16.

       (no)chroma_me
              Takes  into  account  chroma  information  during  subpixel motion
              search (default: enabled).  Requires subq&gt;=5.

       (no)mixed_refs
              Allows each 8x8 or 16x8 motion partition to independently select a
              reference frame.  Without this option, a whole macroblock must use
              the same reference.  Requires frameref&gt;1.

       trellis=&lt;0-2&gt; (cabac only)
              rate-distortion optimal quantization
                 0    disabled
                 1    enabled only for the final encode (default)
                 2    enabled during all mode decisions (slow, requires subq&gt;=6)

       psy-rd=rd[,trell]
              Sets the strength of the psychovisual optimization.
                 rd=&lt;0.0-10.0&gt;
                      psy optimization  strength  (requires  subq&gt;=6)  (default:
                      1.0)
                 trell=&lt;0.0-10.0&gt;
                      trellis (requires trellis, experimental) (default: 0.0)

       (no)psy
              Enable  psychovisual  optimizations  that  hurt  PSNR and SSIM but
              ought to look better (default: enabled).

       deadzone_inter=&lt;0-32&gt;
              Set the size of the inter luma quantization deadzone for non-trel&#8208;
              lis  quantization  (default:  21).   Lower values help to preserve
              fine details  and  film  grain  (typically  useful  for  high  bi&#8208;
              trate/quality  encode),  while higher values help filter out these
              details to save bits that can be spent again on other  macroblocks
              and  frames (typically useful for bitrate-starved encodes).  It is
              recommended that  you  start  by  tweaking  deadzone_intra  before
              changing this parameter.

       deadzone_intra=&lt;0-32&gt;
              Set the size of the intra luma quantization deadzone for non-trel&#8208;
              lis quantization (default: 11).  This option has the  same  effect
              as deadzone_inter except that it affects intra frames.  It is rec&#8208;
              ommended that you start by tweaking this parameter before changing
              deadzone_inter.

       (no)fast_pskip
              Performs  early  skip  detection  in  P-frames (default: enabled).
              This usually improves speed at no cost, but it can sometimes  pro&#8208;
              duce artifacts in areas with no details, like sky.

       (no)dct_decimate
              Eliminate  dct  blocks  in P-frames containing only a small single
              coefficient (default: enabled).  This will remove some details, so
              it  will  save bits that can be spent again on other frames, hope&#8208;
              fully raising overall subjective quality.  If you are  compressing
              non-anime content with a high target bitrate, you may want to dis&#8208;
              able this to preserve as much detail as possible.

       nr=&lt;0-100000&gt;
              Noise reduction, 0 means disabled.  100-1000 is a useful range for
              typical  content,  but  you  may want to turn it up a bit more for
              very noisy content (default: 0).  Given its small impact on speed,
              you  might  want  to  prefer to use this over filtering noise away
              with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       chroma_qp_offset=&lt;-12-12&gt;
              Use a different quantizer for chroma as compared to luma.   Useful
              values are in the range &lt;-2-2&gt; (default: 0).

       aq_mode=&lt;0-2&gt;
              Defines how adaptive quantization (AQ) distributes bits:
                 0    disabled
                 1    Avoid moving bits between frames.
                 2    Move bits between frames (by default).

       aq_strength=&lt;positive float value&gt;
              Controls  how much adaptive quantization (AQ) reduces blocking and
              blurring in flat and textured areas (default: 1.0).   A  value  of
              0.5  will  lead  to  weak AQ and less details, when a value of 1.5
              will lead to strong AQ and more details.

       cqm=&lt;flat|jvt|&lt;filename&gt;&gt;
              Either uses a predefined custom quantization matrix or loads a  JM
              format matrix file.
                 flat
                      Use the predefined flat 16 matrix (default).
                 jvt
                      Use the predefined JVT matrix.
                 &lt;filename&gt;
                      Use the provided JM format matrix file.
              NOTE:  Windows  CMD.EXE users may experience problems with parsing
              the command line if they attempt to use all the CQM  lists.   This
              is  due  to  a command line length limitation.  In this case it is
              recommended the lists be put into a JM format CQM file and  loaded
              as specified above.

       cqm4iy=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom  4x4  intra  luminance  matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4ic=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 intra chrominance matrix, given as a list of  16  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4py=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom  4x4  inter  luminance  matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4pc=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 inter chrominance matrix, given as a list of  16  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8iy=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom  8x8  intra  luminance  matrix, given as a list of 64 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8py=&lt;list&gt; (also see cqm)
              Custom 8x8 inter luminance matrix, given as a  list  of  64  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       level_idc=&lt;10-51&gt;
              Set the bitstream&apos;s level as defined by annex A of the H.264 stan&#8208;
              dard (default: 51 - level 5.1).  This is used for telling the  de&#8208;
              coder  what  capabilities it needs to support.  Use this parameter
              only if you know what it means, and you have a need to set it.
&#12;       (no)cpu_independent
              Ensure exact reproducibility  across  different  CPUs  instead  of
              chosing  different  algorithms  when available/better (default:en&#8208;
              abled).

       threads=&lt;0-16&gt;
              Spawn threads to encode in parallel on multiple CPUs (default: 0).
              This  has  a  slight  penalty to compression quality.  0 or &apos;auto&apos;
              tells x264 to detect how many CPUs you have and pick an  appropri&#8208;
              ate number of threads.

       (no)sliced_threads
              Use  slice-based  threading  (default:  disabled).   Unlike normal
              threading, this option adds no encoding latency, but  is  slightly
              slower and less effective at compression.

       slice_max_size=&lt;0 or positive integer&gt;
              Maximum  slice  size  in bytes (default: 0).  A value of zero dis&#8208;
              ables the maximum.

       slice_max_mbs=&lt;0 or positive integer&gt;
              Maximum slice size in number of macroblocks (default: 0).  A value
              of zero disables the maximum.

       slices=&lt;0 or positive integer&gt;
              Maximum  number of slices per frame (default: 0).  A value of zero
              disables the maximum.

       sync_lookahead=&lt;0-250&gt;
              Adjusts the size of the threaded lookahead buffer (default: 0).  0
              or &apos;auto&apos; tells x264 to automatically determine buffer size.

       (no)deterministic
              Use  only  deterministic optimizations with multithreaded encoding
              (default: enabled).

       (no)global_header
              Causes SPS and PPS to appear only once, at the  beginning  of  the
              bitstream  (default:  disabled).   Some  players, such as the Sony
              PSP, require the use of this option.  The default behavior  causes
              SPS and PPS to repeat prior to each IDR frame.

       (no)tff
              Enable interlaced mode, top field first (default: disabled)

       (no)bff
              Enable interlaced mode, bottom field first (default: disabled)

       nal_hrd=&lt;none|vbr|cbr&gt;
              Signal HRD information (requires vbv_bufsize) (default: none).

       (no)pic_struct
              Force pic_struct in Picture Timing SEI (default: disabled).

       (no)constrained_intra
              Enable  constrained  intra  prediction  (default: disabled).  This
              significantly reduces compression, but is required  for  the  base
              layer of SVC encodes.

       output_csp=&lt;i420|i422|i444|rgb&gt;
              Specify output colorspace (default: i420).

       (no)aud
              Write  access  unit  delimeters to the stream (default: disabled).
              Enable this only if your target container format  requires  access
              unit delimiters.

       overscan=&lt;undef|show|crop&gt;
              Include  VUI  overscan  information  in  the stream (default: dis&#8208;
              abled).  See doc/vui.txt in the x264 source code for more informa&#8208;
              tion.

       videoformat=&lt;component|pal|ntsc|secam|mac|undef&gt;
              Include  VUI video format information in the stream (default: dis&#8208;
              abled).  This is a purely informative setting for  describing  the
              original source.  See doc/vui.txt in the x264 source code for more
              information.

       (no)fullrange
              Include VUI full range information in the  stream  (default:  dis&#8208;
              abled).   Use this option if your source video is not range limit&#8208;
              ed.  See doc/vui.txt in the x264 source code for more information.

       colorprim=&lt;bt709|bt470m|bt470bg|smpte170m|smpte240m|film|undef&gt;
              Include color primaries information (default: disabled).  This can
              be  used for color correction.  See doc/vui.txt in the x264 source
              code for more information.

       transfer=&lt;bt709|bt470m|bt470bg|linear|log100|log316|smpte170m|smpte240m&gt;
              Include VUI transfer characteristics  information  in  the  stream
              (default:  disabled).  This can be used for color correction.  See
              doc/vui.txt in the x264 source code for more information.

       colormatrix=&lt;bt709|fcc|bt470bg|smpte170m|smpte240m|GBR|YCgCo&gt;
              Include VUI matrix coefficients in the stream (default: disabled).
              This  can  be  used  for color correction.  See doc/vui.txt in the
              x264 source code for more information.

       chromaloc=&lt;0-5&gt;
              Include VUI chroma sample location information in the stream  (de&#8208;
              fault:  disabled).   Use  this  option  to ensure alignment of the
              chroma  and  luma  planes  after  color  space  conversions.   See
              doc/vui.txt in the x264 source code for more information.

       log=&lt;-1-3&gt;
              Adjust the amount of logging info printed to the screen.
                 -1   none
                  0   Print errors only.
                  1   warnings
                  2   PSNR and other analysis statistics when the encode finish&#8208;
                      es (default)
                  3   PSNR, QP, frametype, size, and other statistics for  every
                      frame

       (no)psnr
              Print signal-to-noise ratio statistics.
              NOTE:  The &apos;Y&apos;, &apos;U&apos;, &apos;V&apos;, and &apos;Avg&apos; PSNR fields in the summary are
              not mathematically sound (they are simply the average of per-frame
              PSNRs).   They  are  kept  only for comparison to the JM reference
              codec.  For all other purposes, please  use  either  the  &apos;Global&apos;
              PSNR, or the per-frame PSNRs printed by log=3.

       (no)ssim
              Print the Structural Similarity Metric results.  This is an alter&#8208;
              native to PSNR, and may be better correlated  with  the  perceived
              quality of the compressed video.

       (no)visualize
              Enable  x264  visualizations during encoding.  If the x264 on your
              system supports it, a new window will be opened during the  encod&#8208;
              ing  process, in which x264 will attempt to present an overview of
              how each frame gets encoded.  Each block type  on  the  visualized
              movie will be colored as follows:

       dump_yuv=&lt;file name&gt;
              Dump YUV frames to the specified file.  For debugging use.
                 red/pink
                      intra block
                 blue
                      inter block
                 green
                      skip block
                 yellow
                      B-block
              This feature can be considered experimental and subject to change.
              In particular, it depends on x264 being compiled  with  visualiza&#8208;
              tions  enabled.   Note  that as of writing this, x264 pauses after
              encoding and visualizing each frame, waiting for the user to press
              a key, at which point the next frame will be encoded.

   xvfw (-xvfwopts)
       Encoding with Video for Windows codecs is mostly obsolete unless you wish
       to encode to some obscure fringe codec.

       codec=&lt;name&gt;
              The name of the binary codec file with which to encode.

       compdata=&lt;file&gt;
              The name of the codec settings file (like  firstpass.mcf)  created
              by vfw2menc.

   MPEG muxer (-mpegopts)
       The MPEG muxer can generate 5 types of streams, each of which has reason&#8208;
       able default parameters that the user can override.  Generally, when gen&#8208;
       erating MPEG files, it is advisable to disable MEncoder&apos;s frame-skip code
       (see -noskip, -mc as well as the harddup and softskip video filters).

       EXAMPLE:
                 format=mpeg2:tsaf:vbitrate=8000

       format=&lt;mpeg1 | mpeg2 | xvcd | xsvcd | dvd | pes1 | pes2&gt;
              stream format (default: mpeg2).  pes1 and  pes2  are  very  broken
              formats (no pack header and no padding), but VDR uses them; do not
              choose them unless you know exactly what you are doing.

       size=&lt;up to 65535&gt;
              Pack size in bytes, do not change unless you know exactly what you
              are doing (default: 2048).

       muxrate=&lt;int&gt;
              Nominal  muxrate in kbit/s used in the pack headers (default: 1800
              kb/s).  Will be updated as necessary in the case of &apos;format=mpeg1&apos;
              or &apos;mpeg2&apos;.

       tsaf
              Sets  timestamps on all frames, if possible; recommended when for&#8208;
              mat=dvd.  If dvdauthor complains with a message like &quot;..audio sec&#8208;
              tor out of range...&quot;, you probably did not enable this option.

       interleaving2
              Uses  a  better  algorithm  to interleave audio and video packets,
              based on the principle that the muxer will always try to fill  the
              stream with the largest percentage of free space.

       vdelay=&lt;1-32760&gt;
              Initial  video delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it if
              you want to delay video with respect to audio.   It  doesn&apos;t  work
              with :drop.

       adelay=&lt;1-32760&gt;
              Initial  audio delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it if
              you want to delay audio with respect to video.

       drop
              When used with vdelay the muxer drops the part of audio  that  was
              anticipated.

       vwidth, vheight=&lt;1-4095&gt;
              Set the video width and height when video is MPEG-1/2.

       vpswidth, vpsheight=&lt;1-4095&gt;
              Set pan and scan video width and height when video is MPEG-2.

       vaspect=&lt;1 | 4/3 | 16/9 | 221/100&gt;
              Sets  the display aspect ratio for MPEG-2 video.  Do not use it on
              MPEG-1 or the resulting aspect ratio will be completely wrong.

       vbitrate=&lt;int&gt;
              Sets the video bitrate in kbit/s for MPEG-1/2 video.

       vframerate=&lt;24000/1001 | 24 | 25 | 30000/1001 | 30 | 50 | 60000/1001 | 60
       &gt;
              Sets  the  framerate  for MPEG-1/2 video.  This option will be ig&#8208;
              nored if used with the telecine option.

       telecine
              Enables 3:2 pulldown soft telecine mode: The muxer will  make  the
              video  stream look like it was encoded at 30000/1001 fps.  It only
              works with MPEG-2 video when the output  framerate  is  24000/1001
              fps,  convert  it with -ofps if necessary.  Any other framerate is
              incompatible with this option.

       film2pal
              Enables FILM to PAL and NTSC to PAL soft telecine mode: The  muxer
              will make the video stream look like it was encoded at 25 fps.  It
              only  works  with  MPEG-2  video  when  the  output  framerate  is
              24000/1001  fps,  convert  it  with -ofps if necessary.  Any other
              framerate is incompatible with this option.

       tele_src and tele_dest
              Enables arbitrary telecining using Donand Graft&apos;s DGPulldown code.
              You  need  to  specify the original and the desired framerate; the
              muxer will make the video stream look like it was encoded  at  the
              desired framerate.  It only works with MPEG-2 video when the input
              framerate is smaller than the output framerate and  the  framerate
              increase is &lt;= 1.5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 tele_src=25,tele_dest=30000/1001
                      PAL to NTSC telecining

       vbuf_size=&lt;40-1194&gt;
              Sets  the  size  of the video decoder&apos;s buffer, expressed in kilo&#8208;
              bytes.  Specify it only if the bitrate of the video stream is  too
              high for the chosen format and if you know perfectly well what you
              are doing.  A too high value may lead to an unplayable movie,  de&#8208;
              pending  on  the  player&apos;s capabilities.  When muxing HDTV video a
              value of 400 should suffice.

       abuf_size=&lt;4-64&gt;
              Sets the size of the audio decoder&apos;s buffer,  expressed  in  kilo&#8208;
              bytes.  The same principle as for vbuf_size applies.

   FFmpeg libavformat demuxers (-lavfdopts)
       analyzeduration=&lt;value&gt;
              Maximum length in seconds to analyze the stream properties.

       format=&lt;value&gt;
              Force a specific libavformat demuxer.

       o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]
              Pass  AVOptions to libavformat demuxer.  Note, a patch to make the
              o= unneeded and pass all unknown options through the AVOption sys&#8208;
              tem is welcome.  A full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFm&#8208;
              peg manual.  Note that some options may conflict with MPlayer/MEn&#8208;
              coder options.

              EXAMPLE:
                 o=ignidx

       probesize=&lt;value&gt;
              Maximum  amount  of  data to probe during the detection phase.  In
              the case of MPEG-TS this value identifies the maximum number of TS
              packets to scan.

       cryptokey=&lt;hexstring&gt;
              Encryption key the demuxer should use.  This is the raw binary da&#8208;
              ta of the key converted to a hexadecimal string.

   FFmpeg libavformat muxers (-lavfopts) (also see -of lavf)
       delay=&lt;value&gt;
              Currently only meaningful for MPEG[12]: Maximum allowed  distance,
              in seconds, between the reference timer of the output stream (SCR)
              and the decoding timestamp (DTS) for any stream present (demux  to
              decode  delay).   Default is 0.7 (as mandated by the standards de&#8208;
              fined by MPEG).  Higher values require larger buffers and must not
              be used.

       format=&lt;container_format&gt;
              Override  which  container format to mux into (default: autodetect
              from output file extension).

       muxrate=&lt;rate&gt;
              Nominal bitrate of the multiplex, in bits per second; currently it
              is meaningful only for MPEG[12].  Sometimes raising it  is  neces&#8208;
              sary in order to avoid &quot;buffer underflows&quot;.

       o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]
              Pass AVOptions to libavformat muxer.  Note, a patch to make the o=
              unneeded and pass all unknown options through the AVOption  system
              is  welcome.   A full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFmpeg
              manual.  Note that some options may  conflict  with  MEncoder  op&#8208;
              tions.

              EXAMPLE:
                 o=packetsize=100

       packetsize=&lt;size&gt;
              Size,  expressed  in  bytes,  of the unitary packet for the chosen
              format.  When muxing to MPEG[12] implementations the default  val&#8208;
              ues are: 2324 for [S]VCD, 2048 for all others formats.

       preload=&lt;distance&gt;
              Currently  only meaningful for MPEG[12]: Initial distance, in sec&#8208;
              onds, between the reference timer of the output stream  (SCR)  and
              the  decoding timestamp (DTS) for any stream present (demux to de&#8208;
              code delay).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       There are a number of environment variables that can be used  to  control
       the behavior of MPlayer and MEncoder.

       MPLAYER_CHARSET (also see -msgcharset)
              Convert  console  messages  to the specified charset (default: au&#8208;
              todetect).  A value of &quot;noconv&quot; means no conversion.

       MPLAYER_HOME
              Directory where MPlayer looks for user settings.

       MPLAYER_VERBOSE (also see -v and -msglevel)
              Set the initial verbosity level across all  message  modules  (de&#8208;
              fault:  0).   The  resulting verbosity corresponds to that of -ms&#8208;
              glevel 5 plus the value of MPLAYER_VERBOSE.

   libaf:
       LADSPA_PATH
              If LADSPA_PATH is set, it searches for the specified file.  If  it
              is  not  set,  you must supply a fully specified pathname.  FIXME:
              This is also mentioned in the ladspa section.

   libdvdcss:
       DVDCSS_CACHE
              Specify a directory in which to store title key values.  This will
              speed  up  descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache.  The DVDC&#8208;
              SS_CACHE directory is created if it does not exist, and  a  subdi&#8208;
              rectory  is  created  named after the DVD&apos;s title or manufacturing
              date.  If DVDCSS_CACHE is not set or is empty, libdvdcss will  use
              the  default  value  which  is  &quot;${HOME}/.dvdcss/&quot;  under Unix and
              &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application  Data\dvdcss\&quot;  under
              Win32.  The special value &quot;off&quot; disables caching.

       DVDCSS_METHOD
              Sets  the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss will
              use to read scrambled discs.  Can be one of title, key or disc.
                 key
                      is the default method.  libdvdcss will use a set of calcu&#8208;
                      lated  player  keys to try and get the disc key.  This can
                      fail if the drive does not recognize  any  of  the  player
                      keys.
                 disc
                      is  a fallback method when key has failed.  Instead of us&#8208;
                      ing player keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key using a
                      brute  force algorithm.  This process is CPU intensive and
                      requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary data.
                 title
                      is the fallback when all other methods  have  failed.   It
                      does  not  rely  on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but
                      rather uses a crypto attack to guess the  title  key.   On
                      rare  cases  this may fail because there is not enough en&#8208;
                      crypted data on the disc to perform a statistical  attack,
                      but  in the other hand it is the only way to decrypt a DVD
                      stored on a hard disc, or a DVD with the wrong  region  on
                      an RPC2 drive.

       DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE
              Specify  the  raw  device to use.  Exact usage will depend on your
              operating system, the Linux utility  to  set  up  raw  devices  is
              raw(8)  for instance.  Please note that on most operating systems,
              using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires
              a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).

       DVDCSS_VERBOSE
              Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
                 0    Outputs no messages at all.
                 1    Outputs error messages to stderr.
                 2    Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

       DVDREAD_NOKEYS
              Skip retrieving all keys on startup.  Currently disabled.

       AUDIODEV
              FIXME: Document this.

       AUDIOSERVER
              Specifies  the  Network Audio System server to which the nas audio
              output driver should connect and  the  transport  that  should  be
              used.  If unset DISPLAY is used instead.  The transport can be one
              of tcp and  unix.   Syntax  is  tcp/&lt;somehost&gt;:&lt;someport&gt;,  &lt;some&#8208;
              host&gt;:&lt;instancenumber&gt;  or  [unix]:&lt;instancenumber&gt;.  The NAS base
              port is 8000 and &lt;instancenumber&gt; is added to that.

              EXAMPLES:
                 AUDIOSERVER=somehost:0
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost using default  port  and
                      transport.
                 AUDIOSERVER=tcp/somehost:8000
                      Connect  to  NAS  server on somehost listening on TCP port
                      8000.
                 AUDIOSERVER=(unix)?:0
                      Connect to NAS server instance 0 on localhost  using  unix
                      domain sockets.

       ports decoding raw DTS streams, you can  directly  play  it  via  cdda://
       without setting format, hwac3 or hwdts.

       Play a 6-channel AAC file with only two speakers:
       mplayer -rawaudio format=0xff -demuxer rawaudio -af pan=2:.32:.32:.39:.06:.06:.39:.17:-.17:-.17:.17:.33:.33 adts_he-aac160_51.aac
       You  might  want  to  play a bit with the pan values (e.g multiply with a
       value) to increase volume or avoid clipping.

       checkerboard invert with geq filter:
       mplayer -vf geq=&apos;128+(p(X\,Y)-128)*(0.5-gt(mod(X/SW\,128)\,64))*(0.5-gt(mod(Y/SH\,128)\,64))*4&apos;

EXAMPLES OF MENCODER USAGE
       Encode DVD title #2, only selected chapters:
       mencoder dvd://2 -chapter 10-15 -o title2.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4

       Encode DVD title #2, resizing to 640x480:
       mencoder dvd://2 -vf scale=640:480 -o title2.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4

       Encode DVD title #2, resizing to 512xHHH (keep aspect ratio):
       mencoder dvd://2 -vf scale -zoom -xy 512 -o title2.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4

       The same, but with bitrate set to 1800kbit and optimized macroblocks:
       mencoder dvd://2 -o title2.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=1:vbitrate=1800

       The same, but with MJPEG compression:
