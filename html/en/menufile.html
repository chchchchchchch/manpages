MENUFILE(5)                                                          MENUFILE(5)



NAME
       menufile - entry in the Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.menu/*

       /etc/menu/*

       /usr/lib/menu/*

       /usr/share/menu/*

       /usr/share/menu/default/*

DESCRIPTION
       Menu  files add entries to the Debian menu system. The system administra&#8208;
       tor can place menu files in /etc/menu/ to override menu files that  pack&#8208;
       ages add to /usr/share/menu/ .  The user can place menu files in ~/.menu/
       to override all other menu files.

       Please read the Debian menu manual available in  /usr/share/doc/menu/html
       for the complete specification of menu files.

       The  menu  files are usually named after the Debian package that contains
       the programs listed in them. In it, you can list several  &quot;menu  entries&quot;
       that specify a specific item in the menu structure. Each menu entry spec&#8208;
       ifies which packages it depends on; if that package  are  not  installed,
       the  menu entry will be ignored by update-menus(1).  (In a menu entry you
       can specify pseudo-packages that start with &quot;local.&quot;;  update-menus  will
       always  use  those menu entries).  If you wish to remove an item from the
       menu entirely, make an empty menu file with the same name as the file you
       want to override.

Examples
       Dosemu could install the following menu file as /usr/share/menu/dosemu:

        ?package(dosemu):needs=&quot;text&quot;           section=&quot;Applications/Emulators&quot;
       title=&quot;Dosemu&quot; command=&quot;dosemu&quot;
        ?package(dosemu):needs=&quot;X11&quot;            section=&quot;Applications/Emulators&quot;
       title=&quot;Dosemu&quot; command=&quot;xdos&quot;

       The system administrator wants to override this file to change how dosemu
       is run, so /etc/menu/dosemu is created:

        ?package(dosemu):needs=&quot;text&quot;           section=&quot;Applications/Emulators&quot;
       title=&quot;Dosemu&quot; command=&quot;dosemu -A&quot;
        ?package(dosemu):needs=&quot;X11&quot;            section=&quot;Applications/Emulators&quot;
       title=&quot;Dosemu&quot; command=&quot;xdos -A&quot;

       A user does not want Dosemu to appear in the menus at all,  so  the  user
       creates an empty file named ~/.menu/dosemu.

FORMAT
       A menu file consists of 0 or more lines of the following format:

              ?package(package-name):var1=value1 var2=value2  ...

              needs  Specify  what kind of environment the program require. This
                     variable must be defined, and should be one of the  follow&#8208;
                     ing:

                     needs=&quot;text&quot;
                            Program requires a terminal
&#12;                     needs=&quot;x11&quot;
                            Program requires a X server

                     needs=&quot;vc&quot;
                            Program requires a Linux console (i.e.: svgalib pro&#8208;
                            grams)

                     needs=&quot;wm&quot;
                            The program is a window manager.

                     needs=&quot;fvwmmodule&quot;
                            The program is a fvwm compatible module.

              section
                     The section in which the menu entry should appear. See MENU
                     LAYOUT for preferred section names.

              icon   An  icon for this menu entry. If no icon is available, just
                     don&apos;t define this.

              title  The title of the program that will  appear  on  the  menus.
                     Keep  it  short.   If two menu entries share the same title
                     and section, the one that best fits the  available  display
                     will be used. So in the example above with two menu entries
                     that both have the menu id &quot;title&quot;, if X is available,  the
                     X11  one will be used; otherwise the text one will be used.
                     Must be defined.

              command
                     The  command  to  be  executed  when  this  menu  entry  is
                     selected.

              hints  A  comma-separated  list  of  hints  on  how  grouping menu
                     entries; see the manual.

MENU LAYOUT
       The authoritative list of Debian&apos;s menu structure is  maintained  in  the
       Debian  Menu sub-policy document which is part of the Debian Policy pack&#8208;
       age. The menu structure below is included only for convenience. Please do
       not put your packages into any other sections.

       Use  `/&apos;  to separate sub-menu names, for example, &quot;Applications/Editors&quot;
       or &quot;Games/Arcade&quot;.

NOTES
       If you want to specify an icon or hotkey for a sub-menu (for example, the
       Editors sub-menu), just use the same syntax but leave the command empty:

       ?package(mypackage):needs=&quot;X11&quot;   section=&quot;Applications&quot;  icon=&quot;icon.xpm&quot;
       hotkey=&quot;E&quot; title=&quot;Editors&quot;


       Whenever any menu files are changed, you must run update-menus(1)
