MERGECHANGES(1)                                                  MERGECHANGES(1)



NAME
       mergechanges - merge multiple changes files

SYNOPSIS
       mergechanges [-f] file1 file2 [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       mergechanges merges two or more .changes files, merging the Architecture,
       Description and Files (and Checksums-*, if present) fields  of  the  two.
       There  are checks made to ensure that the changes files are from the same
       source package and version and use the same  changes  file  Format.   The
       first  changes  file  is  used  as the basis and the information from the
       later ones is merged into it.

       The output is normally written to stdout.  If the -f option is given, the
       output  is  written to package_version_multi.changes instead, in the same
       directory as the first changes file listed.
