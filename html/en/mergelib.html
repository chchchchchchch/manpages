NAME
       mergelib - merge one library into another

SYNOPSIS
       mergelib to-library from-library [object-filename-prefix]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mergelib  program merges objects from one library into another.  The
       names of object files in from-library will be  prefixed  by  object-file&#8208;
       name-prefix  (&quot;_&quot;  by default) to avoid name clashes.  The merged library
       will be left in to-library.

AUTHOR
       Jim Fulton wrote the mergelib program for the X Consortium.

       Colin Watson wrote this manual page, originally for the Debian Project.
