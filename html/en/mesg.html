MESG(1)                        Linux User&apos;s Manual                       MESG(1)



NAME
       mesg - control write access to your terminal

SYNOPSIS
       mesg [y|n]

DESCRIPTION
       Mesg controls the access to your terminal by others.  It&apos;s typically used
       to allow  or  disallow  other  users  to  write  to  your  terminal  (see
       write(1)).

OPTIONS
       y      Allow write access to your terminal.

       n      Disallow write access to your terminal.

       If  no  option is given, mesg prints out the current access state of your
       terminal.

NOTES
       Mesg assumes that its standard input is connected to your terminal.  That
       also  means that if you are logged in multiple times, you can get/set the
       mesg status of other sessions by using redirection.  For example &quot;mesg  n
       &lt; /dev/pts/46&quot;.
