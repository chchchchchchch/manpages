MIKMOD(1)                                                              MIKMOD(1)



NAME
       mikmod - play soundtracker etc. modules on a Unix machine.



SYNOPSIS
       mikmod [-options]... [module|playlist]...



DESCRIPTION
       MikMod is a very portable module player based on libmikmod, written orig&#8208;
       inally by Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak). It will play the IT, XM, MOD,  MTM,
       S3M,  STM,  ULT, FAR, MED, DSM, AMF, IMF and 669 module formats. It works
       under AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD,  OpenBSD,  OSF/1,  SunOS,
       Solaris  and OS/2. It is controllable via an easy-to-use curses interface
       and will extract and play modules from a  variety  of  different  archive
       formats.



OPTIONS
       Options  can  be  given  in  any  order,  and are case-sensitive. For the
       options which have both a short and a long form, the  long  form  can  be
       prefixed by one or two dashes. Note that the settings in your $HOME/.mik&#8208;
       modrc will override the defaults shown in this man page.



OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -d, --driver n
              Use the specified device driver for output, 0 is  autodetect.  The
              default is 0.  If your installed libmikmod engine is recent enough
              (&gt;=3.1.7), you can also specify the driver with an alias, as  well
              as driver options separated by commas. The list and driver aliases
              and recognized options can be found in libmikmod&apos;s documentation.

       -o, --output 8m|8s|16m|16s
              Output settings, 8 or 16 bit in stereo or  mono.  The  default  is
              &quot;16s&quot;.

       -f, --frequency freq
              Set mixing frequency in hertz. The default is 44100.

       -i, --interpolate
              Use  interpolated  mixing. This will generally improve audio qual&#8208;
              ity, at the expense of a bit more CPU usage. Note that this option
              alters  the  behaviour of software drivers only ; hardware drivers
              are not affected.

       --nointerpolate
              Do not use interpolated mixing (default).

       --hqmixer
              Use high quality software mixer. This improves audio quality,  but
              requires  a  lot  more CPU power. Note that this option alters the
              behaviour of software drivers only  ;  hardware  drivers  are  not
              affected.

       --nohqmixer
              Do not use high quality software mixer (default).
&#12;       --surround
              Use surround mixing.

       --nosurround
              Do not use surround mixing (default).

       -r, --reverb n
              Sets  reverb  amount  from  0  (no reverb) to 15 (max reverb). The
              default is 0 (no reverb).



PLAYBACK OPTIONS
       -v, --volume volume
              Set volume from 0% (silence) to 100%. The default is 100%.

       -F, --fadeout
              Fade out the volume during the last pattern of each module.

       --nofadeout
              Do not fade out the volume during the last pattern of each  module
              (default).

       -l, --loops
              Enable in-module backwards loops.

       --noloops
              Disable in-module backwards loops (default).

       -a, --panning
              Process  panning effects (default). This should be disabled (using
              --nopanning) for very old  demo  modules  which  use  the  panning
              effects for synchronization purposes.

       --nopanning
              Do not process panning effects.

       -x, --protracker
              Enable  protracker extended speed effect (default). This should be
              disabled (using --noprotracker) for very old  demo  modules  which
              use the extended speed effect for synchronization purposes.

       --noprotracker
              Disable protracker extended speed effect.

       -X, --exitafter
              Exit  MikMod  upon playlist completion. If there is nothing in the
              playlist, MikMod will not  exit.  Can  be  disabled  with  --noex&#8208;
              itafter.

       --noexitafter
              Do not exit MikMod upon playlist completion.


LOADING OPTIONS
       -c, --curious
              Look for hidden patterns in module. Most modules don&apos;t have hidden
              patterns, but you can find &quot;bonus&quot; patterns (or just  silence)  in
              some modules.

       --nocurious
              Do not look for hidden patterns in module (default).

       -p, --playmode n
              Playlist mode. The possible values here are 1, to loop the current
              module; 2, to loop the whole playlist; 4, to shuffle the playlist;
              and  8, to walk the playlist in random order.  These values can be
              added; 0 plays the whole playlist once.  The default is 2, depend&#8208;
              ing on your mikmod configuration.

       -t, --tolerant
              Don&apos;t halt MikMod if a module cannot be read or is an unknown for&#8208;
              mat.

       --notolerant
              Halt MikMod if a module cannot be read or  is  an  unknown  format
              (default).



SCHEDULING OPTIONS
       The following options need root privileges (or a setuid root binary), and
       don&apos;t work under all systems.

       -s, --renice
              Renice to -20 if possible to gain more CPU priority.  This  option
              is only available under FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS/2.

       --norenice
              Do not renice to -20 (default).

       -S, --realtime
              Reschedule  mikmod  to  gain real-time priority (and thus more CPU
              time).  DANGEROUS! USE WITH CAUTION! This option is only available
              under FreeBSD, Linux and OS/2.

       --norealtime
              Do not reschedule MikMod to gain real-time priority (default).



DISPLAY OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Quiet  mode.  Disables  interactive  commands  and  displays  only
              errors.

       --terse
              Terse display like MikMod 2, i.e. without the information panels.

       -C, --color
              Enable colors in interface (default).

       --nocolor
              Disable colors in interface.



INFORMATION OPTIONS
       -n, --information
              Display the list of the known drivers and module loaders.

       -V, --version
              Display MikMod version.

       -h, --help
              Display a summary of the options.



CONFIGURATION OPTION
       --norc Do not parse the $HOME/.mikmodrc  configuration  file.  This  file
              contains  your default settings, so that you don&apos;t have to specify
              them each time you run MikMod. The file is read when you run  Mik&#8208;
              Mod  and  updated  on exit. Using this option prevents MikMod from
              accessing this file.

MENU BASICS
       Some functions of MikMod are available through menus, in the playlist and
       configuration panels.

       You  can select commands in the menus either by moving the selection with
       the arrow keys and pressing enter, or  entering  the  highlighted  letter
       corresponding ot the command you want to select.

       Menu  entries  ending  with a &gt; character open a submenu, whereas entries
       ending in ... open a dialog box. You can  dismiss  a  submenu  either  by
       choosing  a command in this menu, or using the left arrow key to go back,
       or switching panels.

       In dialog boxes, you can move the focus from the input line to the Ok and
       Cancel buttons either with the &quot;tab&quot; key, or the up and down arrow keys.

       Also,  if  the  statusbar  is active (which is the default behaviour), it
       will contain a short help text describing the menu option currently high&#8208;
       lighted.



PLAYLIST MENU
       When  the playlist panel is displayed, pressing the return key will popup
       a menu. The menu commands are:


       Play   Continue list playback from the currently highlighted module.

       Remove Remove module from the playlist.

       Delete...
              Remove module from the playlist, and delete module file  on  disk,
              or  whole archive if the module is stored in an archive file. This
              function asks you to confirm your choice.

       File &gt; This entry opens a submenu with four commands,  &quot;Load&quot;,  &quot;Insert&quot;,
              &quot;Save&quot;  and  &quot;Save as&quot;. The Load and Insert commands ask you for a
              filename, and replace the playlist with it (load) or merge it with
              the playlist (insert). No wildcards are allowed. The Save and Save
              as commands save the  current  playlist  in  a  file,  by  default
              ``playlist.mpl&apos;&apos;,  in  the  current  directory. Note that playlist
              filenames should end in .mpl, or they won&apos;t be loaded by MikMod.

       Shuffle
              Randomize the playlist.

       Sort &gt; This entry opens a submenu with sort commands. You  can  select  a
              normal  or  reverse  order, and then sort the playlist with one of
              the four criteria: by name, by extension, by path or by time.

       Back   Discards the menu.



CONFIGURATION PANEL
       The configuration panel lets you customize your MikMod settings, and save
       them.  You can also try some particular settings without losing your pre&#8208;
       vious configuration.


       Output options
              This section lets you choose various vital playback settings, such
              as  the  output  driver,  the stereo/mono and 16/8 bit output set&#8208;
              tings, the playback frequency, and the software mixer settings.

       Playback options
              This section lets you choose  various  module  playback  settings,
              such  as  the output volume, the processing of panning effects and
              bacwards loops, etc.

       Other options
              This section lets you choose the remaining settings, such  as  the
              playlist mode, and various program settings.


       Use config
              This  command  activates  the  current configuration settings, but
              does not save them.

       Save config
              This command saves and activates the  current  configuration  set&#8208;
              tings.

       Revert config
              This command reverts to the on-disk configuration file settings.
