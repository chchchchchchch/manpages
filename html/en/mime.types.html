NAME
       mime.types - mime type description file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.types file defines the recognized file types.

       Additional file types can be added to mime.types or (preferably) in addi&#8208;
       tional files in the  CUPS  configuration  directory  with  the  extension
       &quot;.types&quot;.

       Each  line in the mime.types file is a comment, blank, or rule line. Com&#8208;
       ment lines start with the # character. Rule lines  start  with  the  MIME
       type  name  and  are  optionally followed by a series of file recognition
       rules that are used to automatically identify print and web files:

           super/type rule [ ... ruleN]
       MIME type names are case-insensitive and are sorted in ascending alphanu&#8208;
       meric order for the purposes of matching. See the &quot;TYPE MATCHING AND PRI&#8208;
       ORITY&quot; section for more information.

       The rules may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using &quot;+&quot; for a  logi&#8208;
       cal AND and &quot;,&quot; or whitespace for a logical OR, and negated using &quot;!&quot;.

RULES
       Rules  take two forms - a filename extension by itself and functions with
       test values inside parenthesis. The following functions are available:

       match(&quot;pattern&quot;)
            Pattern match on filename

       ascii(offset,length)
            True if bytes are valid printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)

       printable(offset,length)
            True if bytes are printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL,  TAB,  BS,  32-126,
            128-254)

       priority(number)
            Specifies  the relative priority of this MIME type. The default pri&#8208;
            ority is 100.  Larger values have higher priority while smaller val&#8208;
            ues have lower priority.

       string(offset,&quot;string&quot;)
            True if bytes are identical to string

       istring(offset,&quot;string&quot;)
            True if a case-insensitive comparison of the bytes is identical

       char(offset,value)
            True if byte is identical

       short(offset,value)
            True if 16-bit integer is identical

       int(offset,value)
            True if 32-bit integer is identical

       locale(&quot;string&quot;)
            True if current locale matches string

       contains(offset,range,&quot;string&quot;)
            True if the range contains the string
&#12;STRING CONSTANTS
       String constants can be specified inside quotes (&quot;&quot;) for strings contain&#8208;
       ing whitespace and angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) for hexadecimal strings.

TYPE MATCHING AND PRIORITY
       When CUPS needs to determine the MIME type of a  given  file,  it  checks
       every MIME type defined in the .types files. When two types have the same
       matching rules, the type chosen will depend on the type name  and  prior&#8208;
       ity,  with higher- priority types being used over lower-priority ones. If
       the types have the same priority, the type names are sorted  alphanumeri&#8208;
       cally in ascending order and the first type is chosen.

       For example, if two types &quot;text/bar&quot; and &quot;text/foo&quot; are defined as match&#8208;
       ing the extension &quot;doc&quot;, normally the  type  &quot;text/bar&quot;  will  be  chosen
       since  its  name is alphanumerically smaller than &quot;text/foo&quot;. However, if
       &quot;text/foo&quot; also defines a higher  priority  than  &quot;text/bar&quot;,  &quot;text/foo&quot;
       will be chosen instead.
