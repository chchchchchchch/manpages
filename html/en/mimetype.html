MIMETYPE(1p)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          MIMETYPE(1p)



NAME
       mimetype - Determine file type

SYNOPSIS
       mimetype [options] [-] files

DESCRIPTION
       This script tries to determine the mime type of a file using the Shared
       MIME-info database. It is intended as a kind of file(1) work-alike, but
       uses mimetypes instead of descriptions.

       If one symlinks the file command to mimetype it will behave a little more
       compatible, see &quot;--file-compat&quot;.  Commandline options to specify
       alternative magic files are not implemented the same because of the
       conflicting data formats.  Also the wording of the descriptions will
       differ.

       For naming switches I followed the manpage of file(1) version 4.02 when
       possible. They seem to differ completely from the spec in the &apos;utilities&apos;
       chapter of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (POSIX).

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
           Show output of all rules that match the file.

           TODO: this method now just returns one match for each method (globs,
           magic, etc.).

       -b, --brief
           Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).

       --database=mimedir:mimedir:...
           Force the program to look in these directories for the shared mime-
           info database. The directories specified by the basedir specification
           are ignored.

       -d, --describe
           Print file descriptions instead of mime types, this is the default
           when using &quot;--file-compat&quot;.

       -D, --debug
           Print debug information about how the mimetype was determined.

       -f namefile, --namefile=namefile
           Read the names of the files to be examined from the file &apos;namefile&apos;
           (one per line) before the argument list.

       --file-compat
           Make mimetype behave a little more file(1) compatible. This is turned
           on automatically when you call mimetype by a link called &apos;file&apos;.

           A single &apos;-&apos; won&apos;t be considered a separator between options and
           filenames anymore, but becomes identical to &quot;--stdin&quot;.  ( You can
           still use &apos;--&apos; as separator, but that is not backward compatible with
           the original file command. ) Also the default becomes to print
           descriptions instead of mimetypes.

       -F string, --separator=string
           Use string as custom separator between the file name and its mimetype
           or description, defaults to &apos;:&apos; .

       -h, --help
       -u, --usage
           Print a help message and exits.
&#12;       -i, --mimetype
           Use mime types, opposite to &quot;--describe&quot;, this is the default when
           _not_ using &quot;--file-compat&quot;.

       -L, --dereference
           Follow symbolic links.

       -l code, --language=code
           The language attribute specifies a two letter language code, this
           makes descriptions being outputted in the specified language.

       -M, --magic-only
           Do not check for extensions, globs or inode type, only look at the
           content of the file. This is particularly useful if for some reason
           you don&apos;t trust the name or the extension a file has.

       -N, --noalign
           Do not align output fields.

       --output-format
           If you want an alternative output format, you can specify a format
           string containing the following escapes:

                   %f for the filename
                   %d description
                   %m mime type

           Alignment is not available when using this, you need to post-process
           the output to do that.

       --stdin
           Determine type of content from STDIN, less powerful then normal file
           checking because it only uses magic typing. This will happen also if
           the STDIN filehandle is a pipe.

           To use this option IO::Scalar needs to be installed.

       -v, --version
           Print the version of the program and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_DATA_HOME
       XDG_DATA_DIRS
           These variables can list base directories to search for data files.
           The shared mime-info will be expected in the &quot;mime&quot; sub directory of
           one of these directories. If these are not set, there will be
           searched for the following directories:

                   $HOME/.local/share/mime
                   /usr/local/share/mime
                   /usr/share/mime

           See also the &quot;XDG Base Directory Specification&quot;
           http://freedesktop.org/Standards/basedir-spec
           &lt;http://freedesktop.org/Standards/basedir-spec&gt;

FILES
       The base dir for all data files is determined by two environment
       variables, see &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;.

       BASE/mime/packages/SOURCE.xml
           All other files are compiled from these source files. To re-compile
           them use update-mime-database(1).

       BASE/mime/globs
           Compiled information about globs.

       BASE/mime/magic
           Compiled information about magic numbers.
&#12;       BASE/mime/MEDIA/SUBTYPE.xml
           Descriptions of a mimetype in multiple languages, used for the
           &quot;--describe&quot; switch.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If a file has an empty mimetype or an empty description, most probably
       the file doesn&apos;t exist and the given name doesn&apos;t match any globs. An
       empty description can also mean that there is no description available in
       the language you specified.

       The program exits with a non-zero exit value if either the commandline
       arguments failed, a module it depends on wasn&apos;t found or the shared mime-
       info database wasn&apos;t accesable. See File::MimeInfo for more details.

TODO
       The &apos;--all&apos; switch doesn&apos;t really show all matches, but only one per
       mime-typing method. This needs to be implemnted in the modules first.

BUGS
       No known bugs, please mail the author if you find one.

       mimetype doesn&apos;t provide a switch for looking inside compressed files
       because it seems to me that this can only be done by un-compressing the
       file, something that defeats the purpose. On the other hand the option
       should exist for strict compatibility with file(1). Possibly a subclass
       should be made for this one day.
