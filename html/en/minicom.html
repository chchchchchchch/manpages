MINICOM(1)                         Version 2.1                        MINICOM(1)



NAME
       minicom - friendly serial communication program

SYNOPSIS
       minicom [-somMlwz8] [-c on|off] [-S script] [-d entry]
               [-a on|off] [-t term] [-p pty] [-C capturefile] [configuration]

DESCRIPTION
       minicom is a communication program which somewhat resembles the shareware
       program TELIX but is free with source code and runs  under  most  Unices.
       Features  include  dialing  directory with auto-redial, support for UUCP-
       style lock files on serial devices, a  separate  script  language  inter&#8208;
       preter,  capture  to file, multiple users with individual configurations,
       and more.

COMMAND-LINE
       -s   Setup.   Root  edits  the   system-wide   defaults   in   /etc/mini&#8208;
            com/minirc.dfl  with this option.  When it is used, minicom does not
            initialize, but puts you directly into the configuration menu.  This
            is very handy if minicom refuses to start up because your system has
            changed, or for the first time you run minicom.  For  most  systems,
            reasonable defaults are already compiled in.

       -o   Do  not initialize. Minicom will skip the initialization code.  This
            option is handy if you quit from minicom without resetting, and then
            want  to  restart  a session. It is potentially dangerous though: no
            check for lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could  interfere
            with things like UUCP... maybe this will be taken out later. For now
            it is assumed, that users who  are  given  access  to  a  modem  are
            responsible enough for their actions.

       -m   Override  command-key  with the Meta or ALT key. This is the default
            in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one of minicom&apos;s menus, but
            if  you  use  different  terminals all the time, of which some don&apos;t
            have a Meta or ALT key, it&apos;s handy to set the default command key to
            Ctrl-A  and use this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta
            or ALT keys. Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the  ESC  pre&#8208;
            fix,  not the other variant that sets the highest bit of the charac&#8208;
            ter.

       -M   Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the 8th bit  of  the
            character high (sends 128 + character code).

       -z   Use  terminal status line. This only works on terminals that support
            it and that have the relevant information in their termcap  or  ter&#8208;
            minfo database entry.

       -l   Literal  translation  of characters with the high bit set. With this
            flag on, minicom will try to translate the IBM  line  characters  to
            ASCII.  Many PC-unix clones will display character correctly without
            translation (Linux in a special mode, Coherent and SCO).

       -L   Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character set.

       -w   Turns line-wrap on at startup by default.

       -a   Attribute usage. Some terminals, notably  Televideo&apos;s,  have  rotten
            attribute handling (serial instead of parallel). By default, minicom
            uses &apos;-a on&apos;, but if you are using such a terminal you  can  (must!)
            supply the option &apos;-a off&apos;. The trailing &apos;on&apos; or &apos;off&apos; is needed.

       -t   Terminal type. With this flag, you can override the environment TERM
            variable.  This is handy for use in the  MINICOM  environment  vari&#8208;
            able; one can create a special termcap entry for use with minicom on
            the console, that initializes the screen to raw mode so that in con&#8208;
            junction  with  the  -l  flag, the IBM line characters are displayed
            untranslated.

       -c   Color usage. Some terminals (such  as  the  Linux  console)  support
            color  with  the  standard  ANSI  escape sequences. Because there is
            apparently no termcap support for color, these escape sequences  are
            hard-coded  into  minicom.  Therefore this option is off by default.
            You can turn it on with &apos;-c on&apos;. This, and the &apos;-m&apos; option, are good
            candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.

       -S   script.   Run  the named script at startup. So far, passing username
            and password to a startup script is not supported. If you  also  use
            the -d option to start dialing at startup, the -S script will be run
            BEFORE dialing the entries specified with -d.

       -d   Dial an entry from the dialing directory on startup. You can specify
            an  index  number, but also a substring of the name of the entry. If
            you specify a name that has multiple entries in the directory,  they
            are  all  tagged for dialing. You can also specify multiple names or
            index numbers by separating them with commas. The dialing will start
            from  the  first entry specified after all other program initializa&#8208;
            tion procedures are completed.

       -p   Pseudo terminal to use. This overrides the terminal port defined  in
            the  configuration  files, but only if it is a pseudo TTY. The file&#8208;
            name  supplied  must   be   of   the   form   (/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f],
            (/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f]   or   (/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f].   For   example,
            /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or /dev/ptyp2.

       -C   filename.  Open capture file at startup.

       -T   Disable the display of the online time in the status bar.

       -b   Specify the baud rate, overriding the value given in the  configura&#8208;
            tion file.

       -D   Specify  the device, overriding the value given in the configuration
            file.

       -R   Specify the character set of the remote system is using and  convert
            it  to  the  character  set  of  the  local  side.  Example might be
            &apos;latin1&apos;.

       -7   7bit mode for terminals which aren&apos;t 8bit capable. 8bit  is  default
            if  the  environment is configured for this via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit
            otherwise.

       -8   8bit characters pass through without any modification.  &apos;Continuous&apos;
            means  no  locate/attribute  control  sequences are inserted without
            real change of locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit multi-
            byte  characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every language with
            8bit characters. (For example displaying Finnish text  doesn&apos;t  need
            this.)

            When minicom starts, it first searches the MINICOM environment vari&#8208;
            able for command-line arguments, which can  be  over-ridden  on  the
            command line.  Thus, if you have done

                 MINICOM=&apos;-m -c on&apos;
                 export MINICOM
            or  the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will assume that your
            terminal has a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and that color  is  supported.   If
            you  then log in from a terminal without color support, and you have
            set MINICOM in your startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and don&apos;t
            want  to  re-set your environment variable, you can type &apos;minicom -c
            off&apos; and run without color support for that session.

       configuration
            The configuration argument is more  interesting.  Normally,  minicom
            gets  its  defaults  from a file called &quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you however
            give an argument to minicom, it will try to get its defaults from  a
            file  called  &quot;minirc.configuration&quot;.   So  it is possible to create
            multiple configuration files, for different ports,  different  users
            etc. Most sensible is to use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2
            etc. If a user creates his own configuration file, it will  show  up
            in his home directory as &quot;.minirc.dfl&quot; or &quot;.minirc.configuration&quot;.

USE
       Minicom  is  window based. To pop-up a window with the function you want,
       press Control-A (from now on, we will use C-A  to  mean  Control-A),  and
       then the function key (a-z or A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then &apos;z&apos;, a
       help screen comes up with a short summary of all  commands.  This  escape
       key  can  be altered when minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O), but
       we&apos;ll stick to Control-A for now.

       For every menu the next keys can be used:
       UP     arrow-up or &apos;k&apos;
       DOWN   arrow-down or &apos;j&apos;
       LEFT   arrow-left or &apos;h&apos;
       RIGHT  arrow-right or &apos;l&apos;
       CHOOSE Enter
       CANCEL ESCape.

       The screen is divided into two portions: the upper 24 lines are the  ter&#8208;
       minal-emulator screen. In this window, ANSI or VT100 escape sequences are
       interpreted.  If there is a line left at the bottom,  a  status  line  is
       placed  there.   If  this  is not possible the status line will be showed
       every time you press C-A. On terminals that have a  special  status  line
       that  will be used if the termcap information is complete and the -k flag
       has been given.

       Possible commands are listed next, in alphabetical order.
       C-A  Pressing C-A a second time will just send a C-A to the  remote  sys&#8208;
            tem.  If you have changed your &quot;escape character&quot; to something other
            than C-A, this works analogously for that character.
       A    Toggle &apos;Add Linefeed&apos; on/off. If it  is  on,  a  linefeed  is  added
            before every carriage return displayed on the screen.
       B    Gives  you a scroll back buffer. You can scroll up with u, down with
            d, a page up with b, a page down with f, and if you  have  them  the
            arrow  and  page  up/page down keys can also be used. You can search
            for text in the buffer with s (case-sensitive) or  S  (case-insensi&#8208;
            tive).  N will find the next occurrence of the string.  c will enter
            citation mode. A text cursor appears and you specify the start  line
            by hitting Enter key. Then scroll back mode will finish and the con&#8208;
            tents with prefix &apos;&gt;&apos; will be sent.
       C    Clears the screen.
       D    Dial a number, or go to the dialing directory.
       E    Toggle local echo on and off (if your version  of  minicom  supports
            it).
       F    A break signal is sent to the modem.
       G    Run script (Go). Runs a login script.
       H    Hangup.
       I    Toggle the type of escape sequence that the cursor keys send between
            normal and applications mode. (See also the comment about the status
            line below).
       J    Jump to a shell. On return, the whole screen will be redrawn.
       K    Clears the screen, runs kermit and redraws the screen upon return.
       L    Turn  Capture  file  on  off.  If  turned on, all output sent to the
            screen will be captured in the file too.
       M    Sends the modem initialization string. If you are online and the DCD
            line  setting is on, you are asked for confirmation before the modem
            is initialized.
       N    Toggle between three states, whether each line is prefixed with cur&#8208;
            rent  date  and time, a timestamp is added every second, or no time&#8208;
            stamps.
       O    Configure minicom. Puts you in the configuration menu.
       P    Communication Parameters. Allows you to change the bps rate,  parity
            and number of bits.
       Q    Exit minicom without resetting the modem. If macros changed and were
            not saved, you will have a chance to do so.
       R    Receive files. Choose from various protocols (external). If you have
            the  filename selection window and the prompt for download directory
            enabled, you&apos;ll get a selection window for  choosing  the  directory
            for  downloading.  Otherwise  the  download directory defined in the
            Filenames and paths menu will be used.
       S    Send files. Choose the protocol like you do with  the  receive  com&#8208;
            mand.  If  you  don&apos;t have the filename selection window enabled (in
            the File transfer protocols menu), you&apos;ll just  have  to  write  the
            filename(s)  in  a  dialog  window. If you have the selection window
            enabled, a window will pop up showing the filenames in  your  upload
            directory. You can tag and untag filenames by pressing spacebar, and
            move the cursor up and  down  with  the  cursor  keys  or  j/k.  The
            selected  filenames are shown highlighted. Directory names are shown
            [within brackets] and you can move up or down in the directory  tree
            by  pressing the spacebar twice. Finally, send the files by pressing
            ENTER or quit by pressing ESC.
       T    Choose Terminal emulation:  Ansi(color)  or  vt100.   You  can  also
            change  the  backspace key here, turn the status line on or off, and
            define delay (in milliseconds) after each newline if you need that.
       W    Toggle line-wrap on/off.
       X    Exit minicom, reset modem. If macros changed and were not saved, you
            will have a chance to do so.
       Y    Paste  a  file.  Reads  a  file and sends its contests just as if it
            would be typed in.
       Z    Pop up the help screen.

DIALING DIRECTORY
       By pressing C-A D the program puts you in the dialing directory. Select a
       command  by  pressing  the capitalized letter or moving cursor right/left
       with the arrow keys or the h/l keys and  pressing  Enter.  You  can  add,
       delete  or  edit entries and move them up and down in the directory list.
       By choosing &quot;dial&quot; the phone numbers of the tagged entries, or if nothing
       is  tagged, the number of the highlighted entry will be dialed. While the
       modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing. Any  other  key
       will  close  the  dial  window, but won&apos;t cancel the dialing itself. Your
       dialing directory will be saved into the file  &quot;.dialdir&quot;  in  your  home
       directory.   You  can scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can
       also scroll complete pages by pressing the PageUp or  PageDown  key.   If
       you  don&apos;t  have those, use Control-B (Backward) and Control-F (Forward).
       You can use the space bar to tag a number of  entries  and  minicom  will
       rotate  trough  this  list if a connection can&apos;t be made. A &apos;&gt;&apos; symbol is
       drawn in the directory before the names of the tagged entries.

       The &quot;edit&quot; menu speaks for itself, but I will discuss it briefly here.
       A - Name  The name for this entry
       B - Number
                 and its telephone number.
       C - Dial string #
                 Which specific dial string you want to use  to  connect.  There
                 are  three  different dial strings (prefixes and suffixes) that
                 can be configured in the Modem and dialing menu.
       D - Local echo
                 can be on or off for this system (if your  version  of  minicom
                 supports it).
       E - Script
                 The  script that must be executed after a successful connection
                 is made (see the manual for runscript)
       F - Username
                 The username that is passed to the runscript  program.   It  is
                 passed in the environment string &quot;$LOGIN&quot;.
       G - Password
                 The password is passed as &quot;$PASS&quot;.
       H - Terminal Emulation
                 Use ANSI or VT100 emulation.
       I - Backspace key sends
                 What code (Backspace or Delete) the backspace key sends.
       J - Linewrap
                 Can be on or off.
       K - Line settings
                 Bps  rate, bits, parity and number of stop bits to use for this
                 connection.  You can choose current for the speed, so  that  it
                 will use whatever speed is being used at that moment (useful if
                 you have multiple modems).
       L - Conversion table
                 You may specify a character conversion table to be loaded when&#8208;
                 ever  this  entry  answers, before running the login script. If
                 this field is blank, the conversion table stays unchanged.
       The edit menu also shows the latest date and time when  you  called  this
       entry  and  the  total  number of calls there, but doesn&apos;t let you change
       them.  They are updated automatically when you connect.

       The moVe command lets you move the highlighted entry up or  down  in  the
       dialing  directory with the up/down arrow keys or the k and j keys. Press
       Enter or ESC to end moving the entry.

CONFIGURATION
       By pressing C-A O you will be thrown into the setup menu.

       Filenames and paths
         This menu defines your default directories.
         A - Download directory
              where the downloaded files go to.
         B - Upload directory
              where the uploaded files are read from.
         C - Script directory
              Where you keep your login scripts.
         D - Script program
              Which program to use as the script interpreter.  Defaults  to  the
              program  &quot;runscript&quot;,  but  if you want to use something else (eg,
              /bin/sh or &quot;expect&quot;) it is possible.  Stdin and  stdout  are  con&#8208;
              nected to the modem, stderr to the screen.
              If  the  path  is  relative (ie, does not start with a slash) then
              it&apos;s relative to your home directory, except for the script inter&#8208;
              preter.
         E - Kermit program
              Where  to  find  the executable for kermit, and it&apos;s options. Some
              simple macro&apos;s can be used on the command line: &apos;%l&apos;  is  expanded
              to  the complete filename of the dial out-device, &apos;%f&apos; is expanded
              to the serial port file descriptor and &apos;%b&apos;  is  expanded  to  the
              current serial port speed.
         F - Logging options
              Options to configure the logfile writing.

              A - File name
                   Here  you can enter the name of the logfile. The file will be
                   written in your home directory,  and  the  default  value  is
                   &quot;minicom.log&quot;.   If you blank the name, all logging is turned
                   off.

              B - Log connects and hangups
                   This option defines whether or not  the  logfile  is  written
                   when the remote end answers the call or hangs up. Or when you
                   give the hangup command yourself  or  leave  minicom  without
                   hangup while online.

              C - Log file transfers
                   Do you want log entries of receiving and sending files.
         The  &apos;log&apos;  command in the scripts is not affected by logging options B
         and C.  It is always executed, if you just have the  name  of  the  log
         file defined.

       File Transfer Protocols
         Protocols defined here will show up when C-A s/r is pressed.  &quot;Name&quot; in
         the beginning of the line is the name that will show up  in  the  menu.
         &quot;Program&quot; is the path to the protocol. &quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the
         program needs an argument, e.g. a file to be transmitted.  U/D  defines
         if  this  entry  should  show  up  in  the upload or the download menu.
         Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen, or that  minicom
         will  only  show  it&apos;s  stderr  in  a window. IO-Red defines if minicom
         should attach the program&apos;s standard in and output to the modem port or
         not.  &quot;Multi&quot;  tells  the  filename selection window whether or not the
         protocol can send multiple files with one command. It has no effect  on
         download protocols, and it is also ignored with upload protocols if you
         don&apos;t use the filename selection window. The old sz and rz are not full
         screen,  and  have IO-Red set. However, there are curses based versions
         of at least rz that do not want their stdin and stdout redirected,  and
         run  full  screen.  All file transfer protocols are run with the UID of
         the user, and not with UID=root. &apos;%l&apos;, &apos;%f&apos; and &apos;%b&apos; can be used on the
         command  line  as with kermit.  Within this menu you can also define if
         you want to use the filename selection window when prompted  for  files
         to  upload,  and  if you like to be prompted for the download directory
         every time the automatic download is started. If you leave the download
         directory  prompt  disabled, the download directory defined in the file
         and directory menu is used.

       Serial port setup
         A - Serial device
              /dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS1 for most  people.   /dev/cua&lt;n&gt;  is  still
              possible  under  GNU/Linux,  but  no  longer  recommended as these
              devices are obsolete and many systems with kernel 2.2.x  or  newer
              don&apos;t  have  them.   Use  /dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead.  You may also have
              /dev/modem as a symlink to the real device.
              If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports, you  may
              specify  all  of  them here in a list separated by space, comma or
              semicolon. When Minicom starts, it checks the list until it  finds
              an  available modem and uses that one. (However, you can&apos;t specify
              different init strings to them... at least not yet.)
              To use a UNIX socket for communication the  device  name  must  be
              prefixed  with &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full path and the filename
              of the socket.  Minicom will then try to connect to this socket as
              a  client.  As  long  as  it cannot connect to the socket it stays
              &apos;offline&apos;. As soon as the  connection  establishes,  minicom  goes
              &apos;online&apos;.  If  the  server  closes the socket, minicom switches to
              &apos;offline&apos; again.
         B - Lock file location
              On most systems This should be /usr/spool/uucp. GNU/Linux  systems
              use  /var/lock. If this directory does not exist, minicom will not
              attempt to use lockfiles.
         C - Callin program
              If you have a uugetty or something on your serial port,  it  could
              be  that you want a program to be run to switch the modem cq. port
              into dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get  into  dialin
              mode.
         D - Callout program
              And this to get into dialout mode.
         E - Bps/Par/Bits
              Default parameters at startup.

         If  one  of  the  entries is left blank, it will not be used. So if you
         don&apos;t care about locking, and don&apos;t have a getty running on your modem&#8208;
         line, entries B - D should be left blank.

       Modem and Dialing
         Here,  the  parameters  for  your modem are defined. I will not explain
         this further because the defaults are for  generic  Hayes  modems,  and
         should  work  always.  This  file  is not a Hayes tutorial :-) The only
         things worth noticing are that control characters can be sent  by  pre&#8208;
         fixing  them  with  a  &apos;^&apos;, in which &apos;^^&apos; means &apos;^&apos; itself, and the &apos;\&apos;
         character must also be doubled as &apos;\\&apos;, because backslash is used  spe&#8208;
         cially in the macro definitions.  Some options however, don&apos;t have much
         to do with the modem but more with the behaviour of minicom itself:
         M - Dial time
              The number of seconds before minicom times out if no connection is
              established.
         N - Delay before redial
              Minicom  will redial if no connection was made, but it first waits
              some time.
         O - Number of tries
              Maximum number of times that minicom attempts to dial.
         P - Drop DTR time
              If you set this to 0, minicom hangs up  by  sending  a  Hayes-type
              hangup  sequence. If you specify a non-zero value, the hangup will
              be done by dropping the DTR line. The value tells in  seconds  how
              long DTR will be kept down.
         Q - Auto bps detect
              If  this  is  on, minicom tries to match the dialed party&apos;s speed.
              With most modern modems this is NOT  desirable,  since  the  modem
              buffers the data and converts the speed.
         R - Modem has DCD line
              If  your  modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that goes
              &apos;high&apos; when a connection is made) minicom will use  it.  When  you
              have this option on, minicom will also NOT start dialing while you
              are already online.
         S - Status line shows DTE speed / line speed
              You can toggle the status line to show either the DTE  speed  (the
              speed  which  minicom  uses to communicate with your modem) or the
              line speed (the speed that your modem uses on the line to communi&#8208;
              cate  with the other modem). Notice that the line speed may change
              during the connection, but you will still  only  see  the  initial
              speed that the modems started the connection with. This is because
              the modem doesn&apos;t tell the program if the speed is changed.  Also,
              to  see  the line speed, you need to have the modem set to show it
              in the connect string.  Otherwise you will only see 0 as the  line
              speed.
         T - Multi-line untag
              You  can  toggle  the  feature  to  untag entries from the dialing
              directory when a connection is established to  a  multi-line  BBS.
              All the tagged entries that have the same name are untagged.

            Note  that a special exception is made for this menu: every user can
            change all parameters here, but some of them will not be saved.

       Screen and keyboard
         A - Command key is
              the &apos;Hot Key&apos; that brings you into command mode. If this is set to
              &apos;ALT&apos;  or  &apos;meta  key&apos;,  you can directly call commands by alt-key
              instead of HotKey-key.
         B - Backspace key sends
              There still are some systems that want a VT100 to send DEL instead
              of  BS. With this option you can enable that stupidity.  (Eh, it&apos;s
              even on by default...)
         C - Status line is
              Enabled or disabled. Some slow terminals  (for  example,  X-termi&#8208;
              nals)  cause the status line to jump &quot;up and down&quot; when scrolling,
              so you can turn it off if desired. It will still be shown in  com&#8208;
              mand-mode.
         D - Alarm sound
              If  turned  on,  minicom will sound an alarm (on the console only)
              after a successful connection and when up/downloading is complete.
         E - Foreground Color (menu)
              indicates the foreground color to use for  all  the  configuration
              windows in minicom.
         F - Background Color (menu)
              indicates  the  background  color to use for all the configuration
              windows in minicom. Note that minicom will not allow  you  to  set
              foreground and background colors to the same value.
         G - Foreground Color (term)
              indicates the foreground color to use in the terminal window.
         H - Background Color (term)
              indicates the background color to use in the terminal window. Note
              that minicom will not allow you to set foreground  and  background
              colors to the same value.
         I - Foreground Color (stat)
              indicates the foreground color to use in for the status bar.
         J - Background Color (stat)
              indicates  the color to use in for the status bar. Note that mini&#8208;
              com will allow you to set the status bar&apos;s  foreground  and  back&#8208;
              ground  colors  to  the same value. This will effectively make the
              status bar invisible but if these are your intentions, please  see
              the option
         K - History buffer size
              The   number   of  lines  to  keep  in  the  history  buffer  (for
              backscrolling).
         L - Macros file
              is the full path to the file that holds macros. Macros  allow  you
              to  define  a  string  to be sent when you press a certain key. In
              minicom, you may define F1 through F10 to send up to  256  charac&#8208;
              ters  [this  is  set at compile time]. The filename you specify is
              verified as soon as you hit ENTER. If you do not have  permissions
              to  create  the  specified file, an error message will so indicate
              and you will be forced to re-edit the filename. If you are permit&#8208;
              ted  to  create  the  file,  minicom  checks  to see if it already
              exists. If so, it assumes it&apos;s a macro file and reads it in. If it
              isn&apos;t, well, it&apos;s your problem :-) If the file does not exist, the
              filename is accepted.
         M - Edit Macros
              opens up a new window which allows you to edit the F1 through  F10
              macros.
         N - Macros enabled
              -  Yes  or  No.  If macros are disabled, the F1-F10 keys will just
              send the VT100/VT220 function key escape sequences.
         O - Character conversion
              The active conversion table filename is shown here. If you can see
              no  name,  no  conversion  is active. Pressing O, you will see the
              conversion table edit menu.

              Edit Macros
                 Here, the macros for F1 through F10 are defined. The bottom  of
                 the  window  shows a legend of character combinations that have
                 special meaning.  They allow you to enter special control char&#8208;
                 acters  with  plain text by prefixing them with a &apos;^&apos;, in which
                 &apos;^^&apos; means &apos;^&apos; itself. You can send a 1 second delay  with  the
                 &apos;^~&apos;  code.  This  is useful when you are trying to login after
                 ftp&apos;ing or telnet&apos;ing somewhere.  You  can  also  include  your
                 current  username  and password from the phone directory in the
                 macros with &apos;\u&apos; and &apos;\p&apos;, respectively. If you need the  back&#8208;
                 slash  character  in  the  macro, write it doubled as &apos;\\&apos;.  To
                 edit a macro, press the number (or letter for F10) and you will
                 be  moved  to  the end of the macro. When editing the line, you
                 may use the left &amp; right arrows, Home  &amp;  End  keys,  Delete  &amp;
                 BackSpace,  and  ESC  and RETURN.  ESC cancels any changes made
                 while ENTER accepts the changes.

              Character conversion
                 Here you can edit the character conversion table.  If  you  are
                 not  an  American,  you  know  that in many languages there are
                 characters that are not included in the  ASCII  character  set,
                 and in the old times they may have replaced some less important
                 characters in ASCII and now they  are  often  represented  with
                 character codes above 127. AND there are various different ways
                 to represent them. This is where you may edit conversion tables
                 for  systems that use a character set different from the one on
                 your computer.
&#12;              A - Load table
                   You probably guessed it. This command loads a table from  the
                   disk.   You  are asked a file name for the table.  Predefined
                   tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and .mcsf7 should be included with  the
                   program.  Table  .mciso  does  no conversion, .mcpc8 is to be
                   used for connections with systems that use the 8-bit pc char&#8208;
                   acter  set,  and .mcsf7 is for compatibility with the systems
                   that uses the good old 7-bit coding to replace the characters
                   {|}[]\  with  the  diacritical characters used in Finnish and
                   Swedish.

              B - Save table
                   This one saves the active table on the filename you specify.

              C - edit char
                   This is where you can make  your  own  modifications  to  the
                   existing  table.  First you are asked the character value (in
                   decimal) whose conversion you want to change. Next you&apos;ll say
                   which  character  you  want  to  see on your screen when that
                   character comes from the outside world. And  then  you&apos;ll  be
                   asked  what you want to be sent out when you enter that char&#8208;
                   acter from your keyboard.

              D - next screen

              E - prev screen
                   Yeah, you probably noticed that this screen  shows  you  what
                   kind  of conversions are active. The screen just is (usually)
                   too small to show the whole table  at  once  in  an  easy-to-
                   understand  format. This is how you can scroll the table left
                   and right.

              F - convert capture
                   Toggles whether or not the character conversion table is used
                   when writing the capture file.

       Save setup as dfl
         Save  the  parameters  as  the default for the next time the program is
         started. Instead of dfl, any other parameter name may appear, depending
         on which one was used when the program was started.

       Save setup as..
         Save  the  parameters under a special name. Whenever Minicom is started
         with this name as an argument,  it  will  use  these  parameters.  This
         option is of course privileged to root.

       Exit
         Escape from this menu without saving.  This can also be done with ESC.

       Exit from minicom
         Only  root will see this menu entry, if he/she started minicom with the
         &apos;-s&apos; option. This way, it is possible to change the configuration with&#8208;
         out actually running minicom.

STATUS LINE
       The  status  line has several indicators, that speak for themselves.  The
       mysterious APP or NOR indicator probably  needs  explanation.  The  VT100
       cursor  keys can be in two modes: applications mode and cursor mode. This
       is controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the cursor keys  do
       not work in, say, vi when you&apos;re logged in using minicom then you can see
       with this indicator whether the cursor keys are in applications or cursor
       mode.  You can toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys then
       work, it&apos;s probably an error in the remote system&apos;s  termcap  initializa&#8208;
       tion strings (is).

LOCALES
       Minicom  has  support for local languages. This means you can change most
       of the English messages and other strings to another language by  setting
       the environment variable LANG.

MISC
       If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This means kill -15, or since
       sigterm is default, just plain &quot;kill &lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;.  This  will  cause  a
       graceful  exit  of  minicom,  doing  resets and everything.  You may kill
       minicom from a script with the command &quot;!  killall  -9  minicom&quot;  without
       hanging  up  the  line.  Without the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up
       before exiting.

       Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up  is  ESC  [  A),
       Minicom does not know if the escape character it gets is you pressing the
       escape key, or part of a sequence.

       An old version of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather  crude  way:  to
       get the escape key, you had to press it twice.

       As  of  release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is
       builtin, like in vi. For systems that have the select() system  call  the
       timeout  is  0.5 seconds. And... surprise: a special Linux-dependent hack
       :-) was added. Now, minicom can  separate  the  escape  key  and  escape-
       sequences.  To  see  how  dirty this was done, look into wkeys.c.  But it
       works like a charm!

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       In Debian GNU/Linux systems, minicom is not setuid root. Users that  need
       to  use  it have to get added to the dialout group in order to use serial
       port devices.

FILES
       Minicom keeps it&apos;s configuration files  in  the  directory  /etc/minicom.
       You&apos;ll  find the demo files for runscript(1), and the examples of charac&#8208;
       ter conversion tables in /usr/share/doc/minicom.  The  conversion  tables
       are  named something like mc.* in the tables subdirectory, but you proba&#8208;
       bly want to copy the ones you need in your home  directory  as  something
       beginning with a dot.

       minirc.*
       $HOME/.minirc.*
       $HOME/.dialdir
       $HOME/minicom.log
       /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/minicom.mo
