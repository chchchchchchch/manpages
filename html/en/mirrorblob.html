NAME
       mirrorblob - Draws a wobbly blob that distorts the image behind it.

SYNOPSIS
       mirrorblob  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual]  [-window]
       [-root] [-wire] [-delay  number]  [-fog]  [-walls]  [-colour]  [-texture]
       [-offset-texture] [-blend] [-antialias] [-resolution number] [-bumps num&#8208;
       ber] [-fade-time number] [-hold-time number] [-zoom number] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       Draws a wobbling blob, making use of alpha blending, fog,  textures,  and
       lighting,  plus  a  ``frames  per second&apos;&apos; meter so that you can tell how
       fast your graphics card is... Requires OpenGL.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.  -wire Render in  wireframe  instead  of
               solid.

       -delay number
               Per-frame  delay,  in  microseconds.   Default:  10000 (0.01 sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -fog | -no-fog
               Whether to enable fog.

       -walls | -no-walls
               Add walls for blob to hit.

       -colour | -no-colour
               Draw coloured blob.  If also  textured,  the  texture  will  have
               color mixed in.

       -texture | -no-texture
               Whether to wrap a texture image on the blob.

       -offset_texture | -no-offset_texture
               Whether to ofset the texture calculations to only use a region of
               the image
                under the blob.  This works well with a semi-transparent blob.

       -blend | -no-blend
               Whether to draw a  transparent  blob.  (see  also  offset_texture
               above)

       -antialias | -no-antialias
               Whether to antialias lines.

       -resolution number
               Resolution  of  the  tessellation  used to calculate and draw the
               blob.  Larger
                numbers give a smoother  blob  but  increase  calculation  times
               exponentially.

       -bumps number
               Number of bumps used to distort the blob.
&#12;       -hold-time number
               Time until loading a new image.

       -fade-time number
               Time taken to transition between images.

       -zoom number
               Size multiplier for blob.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
