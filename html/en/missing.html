MISSING(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 MISSING(7)



NAME
       missing - missing manual pages

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  intends to document which manual pages are missing in
       various sections.  Bug reports against the package manpages-dev  or  man&#8208;
       pages  were opened for all of them through the Debian Bug Tracking System
       (BTS).  Some of these bug  reports  were  reported  upstream  while  some
       weren&apos;t.   Upstream,  however,  is  not able to create arbitrary manpages
       without additional information and additional spare  time.   Hence,  it&apos;s
       completely useless to simply report them upstream.

       Manpages  represent  an important means of documentation which can easily
       be read and converted into various formats.  They are  very  helpful  for
       checking how things work, rather than for a tutorial.  If you notice that
       more pages are missing, please try to  find  additional  information  and
       report it as wishlist bug against this package.

       If  you  are confident with the issue, please write up a preliminary man&#8208;
       page and attach it to the bug report.  It doesn&apos;t matter if your  English
       is  bad  or if you mixed up markup, as long as the content can be used as
       source for a new manpage.  A detailed documentation on how to write  man&#8208;
       pages is available in man(7).

       When writing manual pages please ensure that they are conforming with The
       Single UNIX Specification (see below).  Linux ought to be  conforming  to
       this  specification.   Differences  need  to be documented, in additional
       sections, though.

MISSING PAGES
       The following is a list of missing pages sorted by section and  bug  num&#8208;
       ber.   If you can contribute content or even a manual page, please send a
       mail to nnnnn@bugs.debian.org where nnnnn refers to the bug  number  from
       below.

   Section 9 - Kernel routines
       Bug#102724
              Mandrake seems to deliver section 9  manual  pages,  though  their
              source is obscure and they do seem to be out-dated.  Nevertheless,
              some section 9 manpages would be nice, indeed.
