MISSION-CONTROL-5(8)             D-Bus services             MISSION-CONTROL-5(8)



NAME
       mission-control-5 - Telepathy account manager/chanel dispatcher

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/telepathy/mission-control-5

DESCRIPTION
       Mission  Control  5  implements  the AccountManager and ChannelDispatcher
       services described in the Telepathy D-Bus specification, allowing clients
       like  empathy(1)  to  store account details, connect to accounts, request
       communication channels, and have channels dispatched to them.

       It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and  should  usually
       be started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful
       to start it manually for debugging.

OPTIONS
       There are no command-line options.

ENVIRONMENT
       MC_DEBUG=all or MC_DEBUG=category[,category...]
              May be set to &quot;all&quot; for full debug output from Mission Control and
              telepathy-glib,  or various undocumented category names (which may
              change from release to release) to filter the output. See  Mission
              Control  and  telepathy-glib  source  code for the available cate&#8208;
              gories.

       MC_DEBUG=level
              Set a numeric debug level for  Mission  Control  itself  (but  not
              telepathy-glib).   Level  0  logs  nothing, level 1 logs most mes&#8208;
              sages, and level 2 logs all messages.

       MC_TP_DEBUG=type
              May be set to &quot;all&quot; for full debug output from telepathy-glib,  or
              various undocumented options (which may change from telepathy-glib
              release to release)  to  filter  the  output.  See  telepathy-glib
              source code for the available options.
