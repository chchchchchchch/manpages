MK-BUILD-DEPS(1)                                                MK-BUILD-DEPS(1)



NAME
       mk-build-deps - build a package satisfying a package&apos;s build-dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       mk-build-deps --help|--version

       mk-build-deps [options] control file | package name ...

DESCRIPTION
       Given a package name and/or control file, mk-build-deps will use equivs
       to generate a binary package which may be installed to satisfy all the
       build dependencies of the given package.

       If --build-dep and/or --build-indep are given, then the resulting binary
       package(s) will depend solely on the Build-Depends/Build-Depends-Indep
       dependencies, respectively.

OPTIONS
       -i, --install
           Install the generated packages and its build-dependencies.

       -t, --tool
           When installing the generated package use the specified tool.
           (default: apt-get --no-install-recommends)

       -r, --remove
           Remove the package file after installing it. Ignored if used without
           the --install switch.

       -a foo, --arch foo
           If the source package has architecture-specific build dependencies,
           produce a package for architecture foo, not for the system
           architecture. (If the source package does not have architecture-
           specific build dependencies, the package produced is always for the
           pseudo-architecture all.)

       -B, --build-dep
           Generate a package which only depends on the source package&apos;s Build-
           Depends dependencies.

       -A, --build-indep
           Generate a package which only depends on the source package&apos;s Build-
           Depends-Indep dependencies.

       -h, --help
           Show a summary of options.

       -v, --version
           Show version and copyright information.

       -s, --root-cmd
           Use the specified tool to gain root privileges before installing.
           Ignored if used without the --install switch.
