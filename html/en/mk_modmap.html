MK_MODMAP(8)                                                        MK_MODMAP(8)



NAME
       mk_modmap - translate a Linux keytable file into an xmodmap file


SYNOPSIS
       mk_modmap [ -v ] keymap_file


DESCRIPTION
       The  mk_modmap  command  tries to translate a Linux console keytable file
       into a file that can be parsed by xmodmap, and used within X.  It outputs
       the results to standard out.

       If the -v flag is used, verbose output is given.

       It requires the X header files to be installed.  (In Debian, these are in
       the &quot;xlibs-dev&quot; package).

NOTES
       Since XFree version 2.1, X initialises its keymap using the Linux keymap,
       so xmodmap will often be superfluous.
