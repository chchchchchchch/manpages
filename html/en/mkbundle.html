mkbundle(mkbundle 1.0)                                    mkbundle(mkbundle 1.0)



NAME
       mkbundle, mkbundle2 - Creates a bundled executable.

SYNOPSIS
       mkbundle [options] assembly1 [assembly2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       mkbundle  generates an executable program that will contain static copies
       of the assemblies listed on the command line.  By default only the assem&#8208;
       blies  specified  in the command line will be included in the bundle.  To
       automatically  include  all  of  the  dependencies  referenced,  use  the
       &quot;--deps&quot; command line option.

       Use  mkbundle  when you want the startup runtime to load the 1.0 profile,
       and use mkbundle2 when you want the startup runtime to load the 2.0  pro&#8208;
       file.

       For  example,  to create a bundle for hello world, use the following com&#8208;
       mand:
            $ mkbundle -o hello hello.exe

       The above will pull hello.exe  into  a  native  program  called  &quot;hello&quot;.
       Notice  that  the produced image still contains the CIL image and no pre&#8208;
       compilation is done.

       In addition, it is possible to control whether  mkbundle  should  compile
       the  resulting  executable  or not with the -c option.  This is useful if
       you want to link additional libraries or control the generated output  in
       more detail. For example, this could be used to link some libraries stat&#8208;
       ically:
            $ mkbundle -c -o host.c -oo bundles.o --deps hello.exe

            $ cc host.c bundles.o /usr/lib/libmono.a -lc -lrt

       You may also use mkbundle to generate a bundle you can use when embedding
       the  Mono runtime in a native application.  In that case, use both the -c
       and --nomain options.  The resulting host.c file will not have  a  main()
       function.   Call mono_mkbundle_init() before initializing the JIT in your
       code so that the bundled assemblies are available to  the  embedded  run&#8208;
       time.

OPTIONS
       -c     Produce the stub file, do not compile the resulting stub.

       -o filename
              Places  the output on `out&apos;.  If the flag -c is specified, this is
              the C host program.  If not,  this  contains  the  resulting  exe&#8208;
              cutable.

       -oo filename
              Specifies the name to be used for the helper object file that con&#8208;
              tains the bundle.

       -L path
              Adds the `path&apos; do the search list for assemblies.  The rules  are
              the same as for the compiler -lib: or -L flags.

       Specifies that a machine.config file must be bundled as well.
              Typically  this  is  $prefix/etc/mono/1.0/machine.config  or $pre&#8208;
              fix/etc/mono/2.0/machine.config depending on the profile that  you
              are using (1.0 or 2.0)
&#12;       --nodeps
              This  is  the  default:  mkbundle will only include the assemblies
              that were specified on the command line to reduce the size of  the
              resulting image created.

       --deps This  option  will bundle all of the referenced assemblies for the
              assemblies listed on the command line option.  This is  useful  to
              distribute a self-contained image.

       --keeptemp
              By  default  mkbundle will delete the temporary files that it uses
              to produce the bundle.  This option keeps the file around.

       --machine-config FILE
              Uses the given FILE as the machine.config file for  the  generated
              application.

       --nomain
              With  the -c option, generate the host stub without a main() func&#8208;
              tion.

       --config-dir DIR
              When passed, DIR will be  set  for  the  MONO_CFG_DIR  environment
              variable

       --static
              By  default  mkbundle  dynamically  links  to mono and glib.  This
              option causes it to statically link instead.

       Important:
              Since the Mono runtime is licensed under the LGPL, even if you use
              static you should transfer the component pieces of the mkbundle to
              your users so they are able to upgrade the Mono runtime  on  their
              own.

       If you want to use this for commercial licenses, you must obtain a
              proprietary license for Mono from mono@novell.com

       -z     Compresses  the  assemblies  before  embedding.  This  results  in
              smaller executable files, but increases startup time and  requires
              zlib to be installed on the target system.

WINDOWS
       On  Windows  systems,  it it necessary to have  Unix-like toolchain to be
       installed for mkbundle to work.  You can use cygwin&apos;s  and  install  gcc,
       gcc-mingw and as packages.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       AS     Assembler command. The default is &quot;as&quot;.

       CC     C compiler command. The default is &quot;cc&quot; under Linux and &quot;gcc -mno-
              cygwin&quot; under Windows.

       MONO_BUNDLED_OPTIONS
              Options to be passed to the bundled  Mono  runtime,  separated  by
              spaces. See the mono(1) manual page or run mono --help.

FILES
       This  program  will  load  referenced  assemblies  from the Mono assembly
       cache.

BUGS
       The option &quot;--static&quot; is not supported under Windows.  Moreover,  a  full
       cygwin environment containing at least &quot;gcc&quot; and &quot;as&quot; is required for the
       build process. The generated executable does not depend on cygwin.
