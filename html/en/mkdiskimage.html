MKDISKIMAGE(1)                  Syslinux Project                  MKDISKIMAGE(1)



NAME
       mkdiskimage - Create a blank MS-DOS formatted hard disk image


SYNOPSIS
       mkdiskimage [-doFMz4] [-i id] file cyl head sect


DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  convenient tool to generate a hard disk image, pre-formatted
       according to the MS-DOS specification, and having stated properties.

       A disk image named file will be created, large enough to have cyl  cylin&#8208;
       ders,  head  heads,  and  sect  sectors.  Using -M, the value of cyl will
       instead be interpreted as size in MBytes.

       Additional settings include ZIP type disks,  FAT32  formatting,  and  the
       inclusion of an emulation header.


OPTIONS
       -4  Use  the  fourth partition table entry. This is the standard for ZIP-
           disks.

       -F  Format the partition using a FAT32 file system.

       -M  The argument cyl is given in Megabytes. Recalculate this to  get  the
           count in cylinders.

       -d  Add a DOSEMU header.

       -i id
           Specify the MBR identity field as id.

       -o  Print to stdout the file system offset.

       -z  Use a ZIP-disk geometry. This needs heads=64 and sect=32.
