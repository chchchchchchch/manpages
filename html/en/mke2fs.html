DESCRIPTION
       mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem, usually in  a
       disk  partition.   device is the special file corresponding to the device
       (e.g /dev/hdXX).  blocks-count is the number of blocks on the device.  If
       omitted, mke2fs automagically figures the file system size.  If called as
       mkfs.ext3 a journal is created as if the -j option was specified.

       The defaults of the parameters for the newly created filesystem,  if  not
       overridden   by   the   options  listed  below,  are  controlled  by  the
       /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file.  See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual  page
       for more details.

OPTIONS
       -b block-size
              Specify  the size of blocks in bytes.  Valid block-size values are
              1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes per block.  If  omitted,  block-size  is
              heuristically  determined  by the filesystem size and the expected
              usage of the filesystem (see the -T  option).   If  block-size  is
              preceded by a negative sign (&apos;-&apos;), then mke2fs will use heuristics
              to determine the appropriate block size, with the constraint  that
              the  block size will be at least block-size bytes.  This is useful
              for certain hardware devices which require that the blocksize be a
              multiple of 2k.

       -c     Check  the  device for bad blocks before creating the file system.
              If this option is specified twice, then a slower  read-write  test
              is used instead of a fast read-only test.

       -D     Use  direct  I/O  when  writing  to  the disk.  This avoids mke2fs
              dirtying a lot of buffer cache  memory,  which  may  impact  other
              applications  running  on  a  busy server.  This option will cause
              mke2fs to run much more slowly, however, so there is a tradeoff to
              using direct I/O.

       -E extended-options
              Set  extended  options  for  the filesystem.  Extended options are
              comma separated, and may take an argument using the  equals  (&apos;=&apos;)
              sign.   The -E option used to be -R in earlier versions of mke2fs.
              The -R option is still accepted for backwards compatibility.   The
              following extended options are supported:

                   mmp_update_interval=interval
                          Adjust  the  initial  MMP  update interval to interval
                          seconds.  Specifying an interval of 0 means to use the
                          default interval.  The specified interval must be less
                          than 300 seconds.  Requires that the  mmp  feature  be
                          enabled.

                   stride=stride-size
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stride-
                          size filesystem blocks. This is the number  of  blocks
                          read  or  written  to  disk  before moving to the next
                          disk, which is sometimes  referred  to  as  the  chunk
                          size.   This  mostly  affects  placement of filesystem
                          metadata like bitmaps at mke2fs time to avoid  placing
                          them on a single disk, which can hurt performance.  It
                          may also be used by the block allocator.

                   stripe_width=stripe-width
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stripe-
                          width  filesystem blocks per stripe. This is typically
                          stride-size * N, where N is the number of data-bearing
                          disks in the RAID (e.g. for RAID 5 there is one parity
                          disk, so N will be the number of disks  in  the  array
                          minus  1).  This allows the block allocator to prevent
                          read-modify-write of the parity in a  RAID  stripe  if
                          possible when the data is written.

                   resize=max-online-resize
                          Reserve  enough space so that the block group descrip&#8208;
                          tor table can grow to support a  filesystem  that  has
                          max-online-resize blocks.

                   lazy_itable_init[= &lt;0 to disable, 1 to enable&gt;]
                          If  enabled  and the uninit_bg feature is enabled, the
                          inode table will not be fully initialized  by  mke2fs.
                          This  speeds  up filesystem initialization noticeably,
                          but it requires the kernel to finish initializing  the
                          filesystem  in  the  background when the filesystem is
                          first mounted.  If the option  value  is  omitted,  it
                          defaults to 1 to enable lazy inode table zeroing.

                   lazy_journal_init[= &lt;0 to disable, 1 to enable&gt;]
                          If enabled, the journal inode will not be fully zeroed
                          out by mke2fs.  This speeds up filesystem  initializa&#8208;
                          tion  noticeably,  but  carries some small risk if the
                          system crashes before the journal has been overwritten
                          entirely one time.  If the option value is omitted, it
                          defaults to 1 to enable lazy journal inode zeroing.

                   test_fs
                          Set a flag in  the  filesystem  superblock  indicating
                          that it may be mounted using experimental kernel code,
                          such as the ext4dev filesystem.

                   discard
                          Attempt to discard blocks  at  mkfs  time  (discarding
                          blocks  initially is useful on solid state devices and
                          sparse / thin-provisioned storage).  When  the  device
                          advertises  that  discard also zeroes data (any subse&#8208;
                          quent read after the discard and before write  returns
                          zero),  then  mark  all not-yet-zeroed inode tables as
                          zeroed. This significantly speeds up  filesystem  ini&#8208;
                          tialization. This is set as default.

                   nodiscard
                          Do not attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time.

                   quotatype
                          Specify  which  quota  type  (&apos;usr&apos; or &apos;grp&apos;) is to be
                          initialized. This option has any effect only if  quota
                          feature  is  set.  Without  this  extended option, the
                          default behavior is to initialize both user and  group
                          quotas.

       -f fragment-size
              Specify the size of fragments in bytes.

       -F     Force  mke2fs to create a filesystem, even if the specified device
              is not a partition on a block special device, or if other  parame&#8208;
              ters  do  not  make  sense.   In order to force mke2fs to create a
              filesystem even if the filesystem appears  to  be  in  use  or  is
              mounted (a truly dangerous thing to do), this option must be spec&#8208;
              ified twice.

       -g blocks-per-group
              Specify the number of blocks in a block group.  There is generally
              no  reason for the user to ever set this parameter, as the default
              is optimal for the filesystem.  (For administrators who are creat&#8208;
              ing filesystems on RAID arrays, it is preferable to use the stride
              RAID parameter as part of the -E option rather  than  manipulating
              the number of blocks per group.)  This option is generally used by
              developers who are developing test cases.

       -G number-of-groups
              Specify the number of block groups that will be packed together to
              create  a  larger  virtual  block group (or &quot;flex_bg group&quot;) in an
              ext4 filesystem.  This improves meta-data locality and performance
              on  meta-data  heavy  workloads.   The  number of groups must be a
              power of 2 and may only be specified  if  the  flex_bg  filesystem
              feature is enabled.

       -i bytes-per-inode
              Specify  the bytes/inode ratio.  mke2fs creates an inode for every
              bytes-per-inode bytes of space on the disk.  The larger the bytes-
              per-inode  ratio,  the  fewer  inodes will be created.  This value
              generally shouldn&apos;t be smaller than the blocksize of the  filesys&#8208;
              tem, since in that case more inodes would be made than can ever be
              used.  Be warned that it is not possible to expand the  number  of
              inodes on a filesystem after it is created, so be careful deciding
              the correct value for this parameter.

       -I inode-size
              Specify the size of each inode in bytes.  mke2fs creates  256-byte
              inodes  by default.  In kernels after 2.6.10 and some earlier ven&#8208;
              dor kernels it is possible to utilize inodes larger than 128 bytes
              to store extended attributes for improved performance.  The inode-
              size value must be a power of 2  larger  or  equal  to  128.   The
              larger the inode-size the more space the inode table will consume,
              and this reduces the usable space in the filesystem and  can  also
              negatively  impact  performance.   Extended  attributes  stored in
              large inodes are not visible with older kernels, and such filesys&#8208;
              tems  will  not  be  mountable with 2.4 kernels at all.  It is not
              possible to change this value after the filesystem is created.

       -j     Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.  If the -J  option  is
              not specified, the default journal parameters will be used to cre&#8208;
              ate an appropriately sized journal (given the size of the filesys&#8208;
              tem)  stored within the filesystem.  Note that you must be using a
              kernel which has ext3 support in order to actually make use of the
              journal.

       -J journal-options
              Create  the  ext3  journal using options specified on the command-
              line.  Journal options are comma separated, and may take an  argu&#8208;
              ment  using the equals (&apos;=&apos;)  sign.  The following journal options
              are supported:

                   size=journal-size
                          Create an internal journal (i.e.,  stored  inside  the
                          filesystem)  of size journal-size megabytes.  The size
                          of the journal must be at least 1024 filesystem blocks
                          (i.e., 1MB if using 1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks,
                          etc.)  and may be no more than  10,240,000  filesystem
                          blocks  or  half the total file system size (whichever
                          is smaller)

                   device=external-journal
                          Attach the filesystem  to  the  journal  block  device
                          located  on  external-journal.   The  external journal
                          must already have been created using the command

                          mke2fs -O journal_dev external-journal

                          Note that external-journal must have been created with
                          the  same  block size as the new filesystem.  In addi&#8208;
                          tion, while there is support  for  attaching  multiple
                          filesystems  to  a  single external journal, the Linux
                          kernel and e2fsck(8) do not currently  support  shared
                          external journals yet.

                          Instead  of  specifying a device name directly, exter&#8208;
                          nal-journal  can   also   be   specified   by   either
                          LABEL=label  or UUID=UUID to locate the external jour&#8208;
                          nal by either the volume label or UUID stored  in  the
                          ext2  superblock  at  the  start  of the journal.  Use
                          dumpe2fs(8) to display a journal device&apos;s volume label
                          and UUID.  See also the -L option of tune2fs(8).

              Only one of the size or device options can be given for a filesys&#8208;
              tem.

       -l filename
              Read the bad blocks list from filename.  Note that the block  num&#8208;
              bers  in the bad block list must be generated using the same block
              size as used by mke2fs.  As a result, the -c option to mke2fs is a
              much  simpler  and  less error-prone method of checking a disk for
              bad blocks before formatting it, as mke2fs will automatically pass
              the correct parameters to the badblocks program.

       -L new-volume-label
              Set  the volume label for the filesystem to new-volume-label.  The
              maximum length of the volume label is 16 bytes.

       -m reserved-blocks-percentage
              Specify the percentage of the filesystem blocks reserved  for  the
              super-user.  This avoids fragmentation, and allows root-owned dae&#8208;
              mons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to function correctly  after
              non-privileged   processes  are  prevented  from  writing  to  the
              filesystem.  The default percentage is 5%.

       -M last-mounted-directory
              Set the last mounted directory for the filesystem.  This might  be
              useful  for the sake of utilities that key off of the last mounted
              directory to determine where the filesystem should be mounted.

       -n     Causes mke2fs to not actually create  a  filesystem,  but  display
              what  it  would do if it were to create a filesystem.  This can be
              used to determine the location of the  backup  superblocks  for  a
              particular  filesystem, so long as the mke2fs parameters that were
              passed when the filesystem was originally created are used  again.
              (With the -n option added, of course!)

       -N number-of-inodes
              Overrides  the  default  calculation  of the number of inodes that
              should be reserved for the filesystem (which is based on the  num&#8208;
              ber  of  blocks  and  the bytes-per-inode ratio).  This allows the
              user to specify the number of desired inodes directly.
&#12;       -o creator-os
              Overrides the default value  of  the  &quot;creator  operating  system&quot;
              field  of  the filesystem.  The creator field is set by default to
              the name of the OS the mke2fs executable was compiled for.

       -O feature[,...]
              Create a filesystem with the given features (filesystem  options),
              overriding  the default filesystem options.  The features that are
              enabled by default are specified by  the  base_features  relation,
              either  in the [defaults] section in the /etc/mke2fs.conf configu&#8208;
              ration file, or in the [fs_types] subsections for the usage  types
              as  specified  by  the -T option, further modified by the features
              relation found in the [fs_types] subsections  for  the  filesystem
              and  usage  types.   See  the  mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more
              details.  The filesystem type-specific configuration setting found
              in  the  [fs_types] section will override the global default found
              in [defaults].

              The filesystem feature set will be further edited using either the
              feature  set  specified  by  this option, or if this option is not
              given, by the default_features relation for  the  filesystem  type
              being  created,  or in the [defaults] section of the configuration
              file.

              The filesystem feature set is comprised of  a  list  of  features,
              separated  by  commas,  that are to be enabled.  To disable a fea&#8208;
              ture, simply prefix the feature name with a  caret  (&apos;^&apos;)  charac&#8208;
              ter.  The pseudo-filesystem feature &quot;none&quot; will clear all filesys&#8208;
              tem features.

                   dir_index
                          Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups in large direc&#8208;
                          tories.

                   extent Instead of using the indirect block scheme for storing
                          the location of data blocks in an inode,  use  extents
                          instead.  This is a much more efficient encoding which
                          speeds up  filesystem  access,  especially  for  large
                          files.

                   filetype
                          Store file type information in directory entries.

                   flex_bg
                          Allow the per-block group metadata (allocation bitmaps
                          and inode tables) to be placed anywhere on the storage
                          media.   In  addition, mke2fs will place the per-block
                          group metadata together starting at  the  first  block
                          group  of  each  &quot;flex_bg  group&quot;.    The  size of the
                          flex_bg group can be specified using the -G option.

                   has_journal
                          Create an ext3 journal (as if using the -j option).

                   journal_dev
                          Create an external ext3 journal on  the  given  device
                          instead  of  a  regular  ext2  filesystem.   Note that
                          external-journal must be created with the  same  block
                          size as the filesystems that will be using it.

                   large_file
                          Filesystem  can  contain  files  that are greater than
                          2GB.  (Modern kernels set this  feature  automatically
                          when a file &gt; 2GB is created.)

                   quota  Create quota inodes (inode# 3 for userquota and inode#
                          4 for group quota) and set  them  in  the  superblock.
                          With this feature, the quotas will be enabled automat&#8208;
                          ically when the filesystem is mounted.

                   resize_inode
                          Reserve space so the block group descriptor table  may
                          grow  in the future.  Useful for online resizing using
                          resize2fs.  By default mke2fs will attempt to  reserve
                          enough  space  so that the filesystem may grow to 1024
                          times its initial size.  This can be changed using the
                          resize extended option.

                   sparse_super
                          Create  a  filesystem  with  fewer  superblock  backup
                          copies (saves space on large filesystems).

                   uninit_bg
                          Create a filesystem without initializing  all  of  the
                          block groups.  This feature also enables checksums and
                          highest-inode-used  statistics  in  each   blockgroup.
                          This  feature  can  speed  up filesystem creation time
                          noticeably (if lazy_itable_init is enabled),  and  can
                          also reduce e2fsck time dramatically.  It is only sup&#8208;
                          ported by the ext4 filesystem in recent Linux kernels.

       -q     Quiet execution.  Useful if mke2fs is run in a script.

       -r revision
              Set the filesystem revision for the new filesystem.  Note that 1.2
              kernels  only  support  revision 0 filesystems.  The default is to
              create revision 1 filesystems.

       -S     Write superblock and group descriptors only.  This  is  useful  if
              all  of the superblock and backup superblocks are corrupted, and a
              last-ditch recovery method is desired.  It causes mke2fs to reini&#8208;
              tialize  the  superblock and group descriptors, while not touching
              the inode table and the block and inode bitmaps.  The e2fsck  pro&#8208;
              gram  should  be  run  immediately  after this option is used, and
              there is no guarantee that any data will be  salvageable.   It  is
              critical  to  specify  the correct filesystem blocksize when using
              this option, or there is no chance of recovery.

       -t fs-type
              Specify the filesystem type (i.e., ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.) that is
              to  be created.  If this option is not specified, mke2fs will pick
              a default either via how the command was run (for example, using a
              name  of  the form mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, etc.) or via a default as
              defined by the /etc/mke2fs.conf(5) file.    This  option  controls
              which filesystem options are used by default, based on the fstypes
              configuration stanza in /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).

              If the -O option is used to explicitly add  or  remove  filesystem
              options  that  should  be set in the newly created filesystem, the
              resulting filesystem may not be supported  by  the  requested  fs-
              type.   (e.g.,  &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O extent /dev/sdXX&quot; will create a
              filesystem that is not supported by  the  ext3  implementation  as
              found  in  the  Linux  kernel; and &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O ^has_journal
              /dev/hdXX&quot; will create a filesystem that does not have  a  journal
              and hence will not be supported by the ext3 filesystem code in the
              Linux kernel.)

       -T usage-type[,...]
              Specify how the filesystem is going to be used, so that mke2fs can
              choose  optimal  filesystem  parameters  for  that use.  The usage
              types that are supported are defined  in  the  configuration  file
              /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).  The user may specify one or more usage types
              using a comma separated list.

              If this option is is not specified,  mke2fs  will  pick  a  single
              default  usage type based on the size of the filesystem to be cre&#8208;
              ated.  If  the  filesystem  size  is  less  than  or  equal  to  3
              megabytes,  mke2fs  will  use  the filesystem type floppy.  If the
              filesystem size is greater than 3 but less than or  equal  to  512
              megabytes,  mke2fs(8)  will use the filesystem type small.  If the
              filesystem size is greater than or equal to 4 terabytes  but  less
              than 16 terabytes, mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem type big.  If
              the filesystem size is greater than  or  equal  to  16  terabytes,
              mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem type huge.  Otherwise, mke2fs(8)
              will use the default filesystem type default.

       -U UUID
              Create the filesystem with the specified UUID.

       -v     Verbose execution.

       -V     Print the version number of mke2fs and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       MKE2FS_SYNC
              If set to non-zero integer value, its value is used  to  determine
              how often sync(2) is called during inode table initialization.

       MKE2FS_CONFIG
              Determines   the   location   of   the   configuration  file  (see
              mke2fs.conf(5)).

       MKE2FS_FIRST_META_BG
              If set to non-zero integer value, its value is used  to  determine
              first meta block group. This is mostly for debugging purposes.

       MKE2FS_DEVICE_SECTSIZE
              If  set  to non-zero integer value, its value is used to determine
              physical sector size of the device.

       MKE2FS_SKIP_CHECK_MSG
              If set, do not show the  message  of  filesystem  automatic  check
              caused by mount count or check interval.

BUGS
       mke2fs  accepts the -f option but currently ignores it because the second
       extended file system does not support fragments yet.
       There may be other ones.  Please, report them to the author.
