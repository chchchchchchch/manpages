MKFIFO(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  MKFIFO(3)



NAME
       mkfifo - make a FIFO special file (a named pipe)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
       mkfifo()  makes  a  FIFO special file with name pathname.  mode specifies
       the FIFO&apos;s permissions.  It is modified by the  process&apos;s  umask  in  the
       usual way: the permissions of the created file are (mode &amp; ~umask).

       A  FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created in a
       different way.  Instead of being an anonymous communications  channel,  a
       FIFO special file is entered into the file system by calling mkfifo().

       Once  you  have  created a FIFO special file in this way, any process can
       open it for reading or writing, in the same  way  as  an  ordinary  file.
       However,  it  has  to  be open at both ends simultaneously before you can
       proceed to do any input or output operations on it.  Opening a  FIFO  for
       reading  normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO for
       writing, and vice versa.  See fifo(7) for nonblocking  handling  of  FIFO
       special files.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success  mkfifo() returns 0.  In the case of an error, -1 is returned
       (in which case, errno is set appropriately).

ERRORS
       EACCES One of the directories in pathname did not allow search  (execute)
              permission.

       EEXIST pathname already exists.  This includes the case where pathname is
              a symbolic link, dangling or not.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              Either the total length of pathname is greater than  PATH_MAX,  or
              an  individual  filename  component  has  a  length  greater  than
              NAME_MAX.  In the GNU system, there is no imposed limit on overall
              filename  length,  but  some  file systems may place limits on the
              length of a component.

       ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a  dangling
              symbolic link.

       ENOSPC The directory or file system has no room for the new file.

       ENOTDIR
              A  component  used  as  a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a
              directory.

       EROFS  pathname refers to a read-only file system.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.
