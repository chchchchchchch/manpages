MKFONTDIR(1)                                                        MKFONTDIR(1)



NAME
       mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a directory

SYNOPSIS
       mkfontdir  [-n] [-x suffix] [-r] [-p prefix] [-e encoding-directory-name]
       ...  [--] [directory-name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       For each directory argument, mkfontdir reads all of the font files in the
       directory  searching  for  properties named &quot;FONT&quot;, or (failing that) the
       name of the file stripped of its suffix.  These are  converted  to  lower
       case  and  used as font names, and, along with the name of the font file,
       are written out to the file &quot;fonts.dir&quot; in the directory.  The  X  server
       and font server use &quot;fonts.dir&quot; to find font files.

       The kinds of font files read by mkfontdir depend on configuration parame&#8208;
       ters, but typically include PCF (suffix &quot;.pcf&quot;), SNF (suffix &quot;.snf&quot;)  and
       BDF  (suffix  &quot;.bdf&quot;).   If  a font exists in multiple formats, mkfontdir
       will first choose PCF, then SNF and finally BDF.

       The first line of fonts.dir gives the number of fonts in the  file.   The
       remaining  lines  list the fonts themselves, one per line, in two fields.
       First is the name of the font file, followed by a space and the  name  of
       the font.

SCALABLE FONTS
       Because  scalable  font files do not usually include the X font name, the
       file &quot;fonts.scale&quot; can be used to name the scalable fonts in  the  direc&#8208;
       tory.   The  fonts  listed  in  it  are copied to fonts.dir by mkfontdir.
       &quot;fonts.scale&quot; has the same format as the &quot;fonts.dir&quot;  file,  and  can  be
       created with the mkfontscale(1) program.

FONT NAME ALIASES
       The  file  &quot;fonts.alias&quot;,  which can be put in any directory of the font-
       path, is used to map new names to existing fonts, and should be edited by
       hand.   The  format  is two white-space separated columns, the first con&#8208;
       taining aliases and the  second  containing  font-name  patterns.   Lines
       beginning with &quot;!&quot; are comment lines and are ignored.

       If  neither the alias nor the value specifies the size fields of the font
       name, this is a scalable alias.  A font name of  any  size  that  matches
       this  alias  will  be  mapped to the same size of the font that the alias
       resolves to.

       When a font alias is used, the name it references is searched for in  the
       normal  manner,  looking through each font directory in turn.  This means
       that the aliases need not mention fonts in  the  same  directory  as  the
       alias file.

       To  embed  white  space in either name, simply enclose it in double-quote
       marks; to embed double-quote marks (or any other character), precede them
       with back-slash:

       &quot;magic-alias with spaces&quot;     &quot;\&quot;font name\&quot; with quotes&quot;
       regular-alias            fixed

       If the string &quot;FILE_NAMES_ALIASES&quot; stands alone on a line, each file-name
       in the directory (stripped of its suffix) will be used as  an  alias  for
       that font.

ENCODING FILES
       The  option  -e  can  be used to specify a directory with encoding files.
       Every such directory is scanned for encoding files, the list of which  is
       then  written  to  an  &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file in every font directory.  The
       &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file is used by the server to find encoding information.

       The &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file has the same format  as  &quot;fonts.dir&quot;.   It  maps
       encoding  names  (strings of the form CHARSET_REGISTRY-CHARSET_ENCODING )
       to encoding file names.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -e     Specify a directory containing encoding files.  The -e option  may
              be  specified  multiple  times,  and all the specified directories
              will be read.  The order of the entries is significant, as  encod&#8208;
              ings  found  in  earlier directories override those in later ones;
              encoding files in the same directory are discriminated by  prefer&#8208;
              ring compressed versions.

       -n     do  not  scan  for fonts, do not write font directory files.  This
              option is useful when generating encoding directories only.

       -p     Specify a prefix that is prepended to the encoding file path names
              when  they are written to the &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file.  The prefix is
              prepended as-is.  If a `/&apos; is required between the prefix and  the
              path names, it must be supplied explicitly as part of the prefix.

       -r     Keep non-absolute encoding directories in their relative form when
              writing the &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file.  The default is to convert rela&#8208;
              tive  encoding  directories  to absolute directories by prepending
              the current directory.  The positioning of this options is signif&#8208;
              icant, as this option only applies to subsequent -e options.

       -x suffix
              Ignore fonts files of type suffix.

       --     End options.

FILES
       fonts.dir      List  of  fonts  in  the  directory and the files they are
                      stored in.  Created by mkfontdir.  Read by  the  X  server
                      and  font  server  each  time  the  font  path is set (see
                      xset(1)).

       fonts.scale    List of scalable fonts in  the  directory.   Contents  are
                      copied  to  fonts.dir  by mkfontdir.   Can be created with
                      mkfontscale(1).

       fonts.alias    List of font name aliases.  Read by the X server and  font
                      server each time the font path is set (see xset(1)).

       encodings.dir  List  of known encodings and the files they are stored in.
                      Created by mkfontdir.  Read  by  the  X  server  and  font
                      server each time a font with an unknown charset is opened.
