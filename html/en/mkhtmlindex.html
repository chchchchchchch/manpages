mkhtmlindex(1)                                                    mkhtmlindex(1)



NAME
       mkhtmlindex - generate index files for HTML man pages

SYNOPSIS
       mkhtmlindex htmlmandir

DESCRIPTION
       The  mkhtmlindex  program  generates index files for a directory of HTML-
       formatted manual pages.  It searches for files whose  names  are  of  the
       form  &#8220;name.1.html&#8221;,  and  outputs  index files &#8220;manindex1.html&#8221;, &#8220;manin&#8208;
       dex.2.html&#8221;, and so on, one for each manual volume.   Empty  index  files
       will  be removed.  Names and descriptions are found by scanning the first
       &lt;H2&gt; section of each page.

OPTIONS
       mkhtmlindex takes only one argument: the directory to process.

NOTES
       This utility is currently rather specific to X manual pages.  In particu&#8208;
       lar, the format of the index files it outputs is not configurable, nor is
       the HTML formatting it expects of manual pages.

AUTHOR
       The version of the mkhtmlindex included in this X.Org Foundation  release
       was originally written by David Dawes wrote as a part of XFree86.

       Colin Watson wrote this manual page, originally for the Debian Project.
