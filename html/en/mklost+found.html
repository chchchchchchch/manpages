MKLOST+FOUND(8)                                                  MKLOST+FOUND(8)



NAME
       mklost+found  -  create  a lost+found directory on a mounted Linux second
       extended file system

SYNOPSIS
       mklost+found

DESCRIPTION
       mklost+found is used to create a  lost+found  directory  in  the  current
       working  directory on a Linux second extended file system.  There is nor&#8208;
       mally a lost+found directory in the root directory of each filesystem.

       mklost+found pre-allocates disk blocks to  the  lost+found  directory  so
       that  when  e2fsck(8)  is  being run to recover a filesystem, it does not
       need to allocate blocks in the filesystem to  store  a  large  number  of
       unlinked  files.  This ensures that e2fsck will not have to allocate data
       blocks in the filesystem during recovery.

OPTIONS
       There are none.
