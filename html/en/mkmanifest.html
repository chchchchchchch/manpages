Name
       mkmanifest - makes list of file names and their DOS 8+3 equivalent



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mkmanifest command is used to create a shell script (packing list) to
       restore Unix filenames. Its syntax is:

       mkmanifest [ files ]

       Mkmanifest creates a shell script that aids in the  restoration  of  Unix
       filenames that got clobbered by the MS-DOS filename restrictions.  MS-DOS
       filenames are restricted to 8 character names,  3  character  extensions,
       upper case only, no device names, and no illegal characters.

       The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used in pcomm, arc,
       and mtools to change perfectly good Unix  filenames  to  fit  the  MS-DOS
       restrictions. This command is only useful if the target system which will
       read the diskette cannot handle VFAT long names.

Example
       You want to copy the following Unix files to a MS-DOS diskette (using the
       mcopy command).

            very_long_name
            2.many.dots
            illegal:
            good.c
            prn.dev
            Capital



       ASCII converts the names to:

            very_lon
            2xmany.dot
            illegalx
            good.c
            xprn.dev
            capital



       The command:

          mkmanifest very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c prn.dev Capital &gt;manifest

       would produce the following:

            mv very_lon very_long_name
            mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots
            mv illegalx illegal:
            mv xprn.dev prn.dev
            mv capital Capital
&#12;

       Notice that &quot;good.c&quot; did not require any conversion, so it did not appear
       in the output.

       Suppose I&apos;ve copied these files from the diskette to another Unix system,
       and I now want the files back to their original names.  If the file &quot;man&#8208;
       ifest&quot; (the output captured above) was sent along with  those  files,  it
       could be used to convert the filenames.

Bugs
       The  short  names generated by mkmanifest follow the old convention (from
       mtools-2.0.7) and not the one from Windows 95 and mtools-3.0.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
