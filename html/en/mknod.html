SYNOPSIS
       mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

DESCRIPTION

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

       Both  MAJOR and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b, c, or u, and they
       must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x or  0X,
       it  is  interpreted  as  hexadecimal;  otherwise, if it begins with 0, as
       octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of mknod, which usually  super&#8208;
       sedes  the version described here.  Please refer to your shell&apos;s documen&#8208;
       tation for details about the options it supports.
