NAME
       mkocp - frontend to otp2ocp(1)

SYNOPSIS
       mkocp OTPFILE

DESCRIPTION
       mkocp is used to create or recreate Omega Compiled Process files (binary)
       from Omega Translation Process (text) files.

       Omega Translation Processes are used to translate one  character  set  to
       another  and to choose between characters with one or more context-sensi&#8208;
       tive variants.  OTPs could also be used to change the case or hyphenation
       of text.

       OTPs  are  defined  in  text  files, and compiled into binary code (OCPs)
       using mkocp (this script) or directly with otp2ocp(1).

FILES
       OTPFILE
              An Omega Typesetting Process filter file.
