MKTUNES(1)                        User Commands                       MKTUNES(1)



NAME
       mktunes - convert GNUtunesDB&apos;s XML into iTunesDB format

SYNOPSIS
       mktunes [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Convert GNUtunesDB.xml into iTunesDB format

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       -m, --mount=DIRECTORY
              iPod mountpoint. Default is $IPOD_MOUNTPOINT

       -n, --ipod-name=NAME
              iPod  Name  (For  unlabeled iPods). iTunes displays this name, not
              the label.

       -v, --volume=VALUE
              Adjust volume +-VALUE% (example: --volume +5)

       -e, --energy
              Save energy (= Disable scrolling title)

       -g, --fwguid=HEXVAL
              Enforce iPod serial/firewire-guid. Late  2007  iPod  models  (3gen
              Nano,  Classic, Touch) refuse to work unless the iTunesDB has been
              signed with a sha1 hash. This hash helps to detect corrupted data&#8208;
              bases,  prevents  sharing  an  iTunesDB between multiple iPods and
              locks out non-apple  software.   GNUpod  is  able  to  create  the
              required hash value if it knows the iPods serial number, this is a
              16 chars long hex value such as: &apos;000ba3100310abcf&apos; and should  be
              autodetected  on GNU/Linux (via /proc/bus/usb/devices) and Solaris
              (via prtconf -v). Use this switch to set the serial if the autode&#8208;
              tection  somehow  fails  to find the correct serial number of your
              iPod.  You can also specify  the value in your configuration  file
              (gnupodrc) as &apos;mktunes.fwguid = 000ba3100310abcf&apos;.
