NAME
       mlocate.db - a mlocate database


DESCRIPTION
       A  mlocate database starts with a file header: 8 bytes for a magic number
       (&quot;\0mlocate&quot; like a C literal), 4 bytes for the configuration block  size
       in  big  endian,  1  byte  for  file  format  version (0), 1 byte for the
       &#8220;require visibility&#8221; flag (0 or 1), 2 bytes padding, and a NUL-terminated
       path name of the root of the database.

       The header is followed by a configuration block, included to ensure data&#8208;
       bases are not reused if some configuration  changes  could  affect  their
       contents.   The size of the configuration block in bytes is stored in the
       file header.  The configuration block is a sequence of  variable  assign&#8208;
       ments,  ordered by variable name.  Each variable assignment consists of a
       NUL-terminated variable name and an ordered list of  NUL-terminated  val&#8208;
       ues.  The value list is terminated by one more NUL character.  The order&#8208;
       ing used is defined by the strcmp () function.

       Currently defined variables are:

       prune_bind_mounts
              A single entry, the value of PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS; one of the strings
              0 or 1.


       prunefs
              The value of PRUNEFS, each entry is converted to uppercase.


       prunepaths
              The value of PRUNEPATHS.


       The  rest of the file until EOF describes directories and their contents.
       Each directory starts with a header: 8 bytes for directory time (seconds)
       in  big endian, 4 bytes for directory time (nanoseconds) in big endian (0
       if unknown, less than 1,000,000,000), 4 bytes padding, and  a  NUL-termi&#8208;
       nated  path name of the the directory.  Directory contents, a sequence of
       file entries sorted by name, follow.

       Directory time is the maximum of st_ctime and st_mtime of the  directory.
       updatedb(8)  uses the original data if the directory time in the database
       and in the file system match exactly.  Directory time equal to  0  always
       causes  rescanning of the directory: this is necessary to handle directo&#8208;
       ries which were being updated while building the database.

       Each file entry starts with a single byte, marking its type:

       0      A non-directory file.  Followed  by  a  NUL-terminated  file  (not
              path) name.


       1      A  subdirectory.   Followed  by  a  NUL-terminated file (not path)
              name.


       2      Marks the end of the current directory.


       locate(1) only reports file entries, directory  names  are  not  reported
       because  they  are  reported  as an entry in their parent directory.  The
       only exception is the root directory of the database, which is stored  in
       the file header.
