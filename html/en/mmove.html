mmove(1)                                                                mmove(1)



Name
       mmove - move or rename an MSDOS file or subdirectory



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mmove command is used to moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or
       subdirectory.
       mmove [-v] [-D clash_option] sourcefile targetfile
       mmove [-v]  [-D clash_option] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory

       Mmove moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file  or  subdirectory.  Unlike
       the  MS-DOS version of MOVE, mmove is able to move subdirectories.  Files
       or directories can only be moved within one file system. Data  cannot  be
       moved  from  MS-DOS  to Unix or vice-versa.  If you omit the drive letter
       from the target file or directory, the same letter as for the  source  is
       assumed.   If  you omit the drive letter from all parameters, drive a: is
       assumed by default.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
