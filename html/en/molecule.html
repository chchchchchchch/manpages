NAME
       molecule - draws 3D molecular structures

SYNOPSIS
       molecule  [-display  host:display.screen] [-window] [-root] [-visual vis&#8208;
       ual] [-delay microseconds] [-wander] [-no-wander] [-spin axes] [-no-spin]
       [-timeout seconds] [-labels] [-no-labels] [-titles] [-no-titles] [-atoms]
       [-no-atoms] [-bonds] [-no-bonds] [-shells] [-no-shells] [-molecule  file-
       or-directory] [-verbose] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The  molecule  program  draws  several different representations of mole&#8208;
       cules.  Some common molecules are built in, and it can read PDB  (Protein
       Data Base) files as input.

OPTIONS
       molecule accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -verbose
               Print debugging info on stderr about files being loaded, etc.

       -wander Move the molecules around the screen.

       -no-wander
               Keep the molecule centered on the screen.  This is the default.

       -spin   Which axes around which the molecule should spin.  The default is
               &quot;XYZ&quot;, meaning rotate it freely in space.  &quot;-spin Z&quot; would rotate
               the  molecule  in  the  plane of the screen while not rotating it
               into or out of the screen; etc.

       -no-spin
               Don&apos;t spin it at all: the same as -spin &quot;&quot;.

       -labels Draw labels on the atoms (or the spot where the atoms would  be.)
               This is the default.

       -no-labels
               Do not draw labels on the atoms.

       -titles Print  the  name  of the molecule and its chemical formula at the
               top of the screen.

       -no-titles
               Do not print the molecule name.

       -atoms  Represent the atoms as shaded spheres of appropriate sizes.  This
               is the default.

       -no-atoms
               Do not draw spheres for the atoms: only draw bond lines.

       -bonds  Represent  the  atomic bonds as solid tubes of appropriate thick&#8208;
               nesses.  This is the default.

       -no-bonds
               Do not draw the bonds: instead, make the spheres for the atoms be
               larger, for a &quot;space-filling&quot; representation of the molecule.

       -shells Draw  transparent  electron  shells  around the atoms.  This only
               works if bonds are also being drawn.

       -no-shells
               Do not draw electron shells.  This is the default.

       -shell-alpha
               When drawing shells, how transparent to make them.  Default 0.4.

       -wireframe
               Draw a wireframe rendition of the  molecule:  this  will  consist
               only  of  single-pixel lines for the bonds, and text labels where
               the atoms go.  This will be very fast.

       -timeout seconds
               When using the built-in data set, change to a new molecule  every
               this-many seconds.  Default is 20 seconds.

       -molecule file-or-directory
               Instead  of using the built-in molecules, read one from the given
               file.  This file must be  in  PDB  (Protein  Data  Base)  format.
               (Note  that  it&apos;s  not uncommon for PDB files to contain only the
               atoms, with no (or little) information about the atomic bonds.)

               This can also be a directory, in which  case,  all  of  the  .pdb
               files  in  that directory will be loaded.  A new one will be dis&#8208;
               played at random every few seconds (as per the -timeout option.)

       When the molecule is too large (bigger than about 30 angstroms from  side
       to  side),  the  -label  option will be automatically turned off, because
       otherwise, the labels would overlap and completely obscure the display.

       When the molecule is around 150 angstroms from side  to  side,  wireframe
       mode will be turned on (because otherwise it would be too slow.)

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
