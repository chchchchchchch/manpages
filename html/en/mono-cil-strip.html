NAME
       Mono CIL strip

SYNOPSIS
       mono-cil-strip assembly [output-assembly]

DESCRIPTION
       mono-cil-strip  is  a  tool which takes an assembly, and empty its method
       bodies.  This is useful to reduce an assembly size when an  assembly  has
       already  been  compiled  using Mono&apos;s Ahead Of Time compiler (AOT), where
       the CIL code is no longer necessary, but the metadata still is.
