Mono(Mono 1.0)                                                    Mono(Mono 1.0)



NAME
       mono-config - Mono runtime file format configuration

DESCRIPTION
       The  Mono runtime will load configuration data from the installation pre&#8208;
       fix /etc/mono/config file, the ~/.mono/config or from the file pointed by
       the MONO_CONFIG environment variable.

       For each assembly loaded a config file with the name: /path/to/the/assem&#8208;
       bly.exe.config  is  loaded  as  well  as  the   ~/.mono/assemblies/ASSEM&#8208;
       BLY/ASSEMBLY.EXT.config file.

       This file controls the behavior of the runtime.

       The  file  contains  an  XML-like file with various sections, all of them
       contained inside a section (It actually uses GMarkup to parse the file).

       This page describes the Unix-specific and Mono-specific extensions to the
       configuration  file;    For  complete  details,  see the http://www.mono-
       project.com/Config web page.

&lt;dllmap&gt; directive
       You use the dllmap  directive  to  map  shared  libraries  referenced  by
       P/Invoke in your assemblies to a different shared library.

       This  is  typically  used to map Windows libraries to Unix library names.
       The dllmap element takes two attributes:

       dll    This should be the same string used in  the  DllImport  attribute,
              optionally  prefixed with &quot;i:&quot; to indicate that the string must be
              matched in a case-insensitive way

       target This should be the name of the library where the function  can  be
              found:  this  name  should  be  suitable for use with the platform
              native shared library loading routines (dlopen etc.), so  you  may
              want to check the manpages for that, too.

&lt;dllentry&gt; directive
       This  directive can be used to map a specific dll/function pair to a dif&#8208;
       ferent library and also a  different  function  name.  It  should  appear
       inside a dllmap element with only the dll attribute specified.

       The dllentry element takes 3 attributes:

       dll    This is the target library, where the function can be found.

       name   This is the name of the function as it appears in the metadata: it
              is the name of the P/Invoke method.

       target This is the name of the function to lookup  instead  of  the  name
              specified in the P/Invoke method.

Mapping based on operating system and cpu
       Both  the  dllmap  and  the  dllentry  elements  allow  the following two
       attributes which make it easy to use a single configuration file and sup&#8208;
       port  multiple operating systems and architectures with different mapping
       requirements:

       os     This is the name of the operating system  for  which  the  mapping
              should be applied.  Allowed values are: linux, osx, solaris, free&#8208;
              bsd, openbsd, netbsd, windows, aix, hpux.
&#12;       cpu    This is the name of the architecture for which the mapping  should
              be  applied.   Allowed  values are: x86, x86-64, sparc, ppc, s390,
              s390x, arm, mips, alpha, hppa, ia64.

       wordsize
              This is the size of registers on the target architecture,  it  can
              be either 32 or 64.

       The  attribute value for both attributes can be a comma-separated list of
       the allowed values. Additionally, the first character may be  a  &apos;!&apos;   to
       reverse  the  meaning. An attribute value of &quot;!windows,osx&quot;, for example,
       would mean that the entry is considered on all operating systems,  except
       on Windows and OS X.  No spaces are allowed in any part of the value.

       Note  that later entries will override the entries defined earlier in the
       file.

EXAMPLES
       The following example maps references to the `cygwin1.dll&apos; shared library
       to the `libc.so.6&apos; file.
       &lt;configuration&gt;
            &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;i:cygwin1.dll&quot; target=&quot;libc.so.6&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/configuration&gt;
       The  library name in the DllImport attribute is allowed to be in any case
       variant, like the following examples:
            [DllImport (&quot;cygwin1.dll&quot;)]
            [DllImport (&quot;Cygwin1.dll&quot;)]
            [DllImport (&quot;cygwiN1.Dll&quot;)]

       This one maps the following C# method:
            [DllImport (&quot;libc&quot;)]
            static extern void somefunction ();
       to differentfunction in libdifferent.so , but to the same function in the
       library  libanother.so when running under the Solaris and FreeBSD operat&#8208;
       ing systems.
       &lt;configuration&gt;
            &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libc&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;dllentry dll=&quot;libdifferent.so&quot; name=&quot;somefunction&quot; target=&quot;differentfunction&quot; /&gt;
                 &lt;dllentry os=&quot;solaris,freebsd&quot; dll=&quot;libanother.so&quot; name=&quot;somefunction&quot; target=&quot;differentfunction&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/dllmap&gt;
       &lt;/configuration&gt;
