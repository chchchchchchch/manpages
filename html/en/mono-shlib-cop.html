NAME
       mono-shlib-cop - Shared Library Usage Checker

SYNOPSIS
       mono-shlib-cop [OPTIONS]* [ASSEMBLY-FILE-NAME]*

OPTIONS
       -p, --prefixes=PREFIX
              Mono installation prefixes.  This is to find $prefix/etc/mono/con&#8208;
              fig.  The default is based upon the location of mscorlib.dll,  and
              is normally correct.

DESCRIPTION
       mono-shlib-cop  is  a  tool  that inspects a managed assembly looking for
       erroneous or suspecious usage of shared libraries.

       The tool takes one or more assembly filenames, and inspects each assembly
       specified.

       The errors checked for include:

       *      Does the shared library exist?

       *      Does the requested symbol exist within the shared library?

       The warnings checked for include:

       *      Is  the target shared library a versioned library?  (Relevant only
              on Unix systems, not Mac OS X or Windows.)

       In general, only versioned libraries such as libc.so.6 are present on the
       user&apos;s  machine, and efforts to load libc.so will result in a System.Dll&#8208;
       NotFoundException.  There are three solutions to this:

       1.     Require that the user install any -devel  packages  which  provide
              the  unversioned  library.   This  usually  requires that the user
              install a large number of additional  packages,  complicating  the
              installation process.

       2.     Use  a  fully  versioned  name in your DllImport statements.  This
              requires editing your source code  and  recompiling  whenever  you
              need to target a different version of the shared library.

       3.     Provide  an assembly.config file which contains &lt;dllmap/&gt; elements
              to remap the shared library name used  by  your  assembly  to  the
              actual versioned shared library present on the users system.  Mono
              provides a number of  pre-existing  &lt;dllmap/&gt;  entries,  including
              ones for libc.so and libX11.so.

EXAMPLE
       The following code contains examples of the above errors and warnings:
            using System.Runtime.InteropServices; // for DllImport
            class Demo {
                 [DllImport (&quot;bad-library-name&quot;)]
                 private static extern void BadLibraryName ();

                 [DllImport (&quot;libc.so&quot;)]
                 private static extern void BadSymbolName ();

                 [DllImport (&quot;libcap.so&quot;)]
                 private static extern int cap_clear (IntPtr cap_p);
            }

       Bad library name
              Assuming  that  the library bad-library-name doesn&apos;t exist on your
              machine,  Demo.BadLibraryName  will  generate  an  error,  as   it
              requires  a  shared  library  which cannot be loaded.  This may be
              ignorable; see BUGS

       Bad symbol name
              Demo.BadSymbolName will generate an error, as libc.so (remapped to
              libc.so.6  by mono&apos;s $prefix/etc/mono/config file) doesn&apos;t contain
              the function BadSymbolName

       Unversioned library dependency
              Assuming you have the file libcap.so , Demo.cap_clear will  gener&#8208;
              ate  a warning because, while libcap.so could be loaded, libcap.so
              might not exist on the users machine (on  FC2,  /lib/libcap.so  is
              provided  by  libcap-devel  ,  and you can&apos;t assume that end users
              will have any -devel packages installed).

FIXING CODE
       The fix depends on the warning or error:

       Bad library names
              Use a valid library name in the DllImport attribute, or provide  a
              &lt;dllmap/&gt;  entry  to  map  your  existing  library name to a valid
              library name.

       Bad symbol names
              Reference a symbol that actually exists in the target library.

       Unversioned library dependency
              Provide a  &lt;dllmap/&gt;  entry  to  reference  a  properly  versioned
              library, or ignore the warning (see BUGS ).

DLLMAP ENTRIES
       Mono  looks  for an ASSEMBLY-NAME mapping information.  For example, with
       mcs.exe , Mono would read mcs.exe.config , and for Mono.Posix.dll ,  Mono
       would read Mono.Posix.dll.config

       The  .config  file  is an XML document containing a top-level &lt;configura&#8208;
       tion/&gt; section with nested &lt;dllmap/&gt; entries, which contains dll and tar&#8208;
       get attributes.  The dll attribute should contain the same string used in
       your DllImport attribute value, and the target attribute specifies  which
       shared library mono should actually load at runtime.

       A sample .config file is:
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                 &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;gtkembedmoz&quot; target=&quot;libgtkembedmoz.so&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;

BUGS
       *      Only DllImport entries are checked; the surrounding IL is ignored.
              Consequently, if a runtime check  is  performed  to  choose  which
              shared  library  to  invoke, an error will be reported even though
              the specified library is never used.  Consider this code:
                   using System.Runtime.InteropServices; // for DllImport
                   class Beep {
                        [DllImport (&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;)]
                        private static extern int Beep (int dwFreq, int dwDuration);

                        [DllImport (&quot;libcurses.so&quot;)]
                        private static extern int beep ();

                        public static void Beep ()
                        {
                             if (System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar == &apos;\\&apos;) {
                                  Beep (750, 300);
                             }
                             else {
                                  beep ();
                             }
                        }
                   }
              If mono-shlib-cop is run  on  this  assembly,  an  error  will  be
              reported  for  using  kernel32.dll , even though kernel32.dll will
              never be used on Unix platforms.

       *      mono-shlib-cop currently only examines  the  shared  library  file
              extension  to  determine  if a warning should be generated.  A .so
              extension will always generate a warning, even if the .so is not a
              symlink,  isn&apos;t provided in a -devel package, and there is no ver&#8208;
              sioned    shared    library    (possible    examples     including
              /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so, /usr/lib/libubsec.so, etc.).

              Consequently,  warnings  for  any  such libraries are useless, and
              incorrect.

              Windows and Mac OS X will never generate warnings, as these  plat&#8208;
              forms use different shared library extensions.
