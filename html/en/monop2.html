DESCRIPTION
       Monop  is  a tool that allows you to view the outline of a class. You can
       see the signature of each member of the class.   Use monop to explore 1.0
       assemblies, use monop2 to explore 2.0 assemblies.

       The  tool  takes one option, the class to view. You must specify the full
       name of the class, including namespace.

       For generic classes, you must specify the generic arguments, for example:
       monop2 &apos;System.Collections.Generic.List`1&apos;
       The above is the string representation for the List&lt;T&gt; in  System.Collec&#8208;
       tions.Generic

       If  you  are  unsure  of  the  full  name  of  the class, you can use the
       `--search&apos; option to search through all known assemblies.
