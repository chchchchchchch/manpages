morph3d(6x)                    XScreenSaver manual                   morph3d(6x)



NAME
       morph3d - 3d morphing objects.

SYNOPSIS
       morph3d [-display host:display.screen] [-visual visual] [-window] [-root]
       [-count number] [-delay number] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       Another 3d shape-changing GL hack. It has the same shiny-plastic feel  as
       Superquadrics, as many computer-generated objects do...

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -count number
               0 - 20.  Default: 0.

       -delay number
               Per-frame  delay,  in  microseconds.   Default:  40000 (0.04 sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
