MOTD(5)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    MOTD(5)



NAME
       motd - message of the day

DESCRIPTION
       The contents of /etc/motd are displayed by pam_motd(8) after a successful
       login but just before it executes the login shell.

       The abbreviation &quot;motd&quot; stands for &quot;message of the day&quot;,  and  this  file
       has  been traditionally used for exactly that (it requires much less disk
       space than mail to all users).

       On Debian GNU/Linux, the content of /run/motd.dynamic is also  displayed.
       This file is generated by /etc/init.d/motd at boot.

FILES
       /etc/motd
       /run/motd.dynamic
       /etc/init.d/motd
