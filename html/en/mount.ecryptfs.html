mount.ecryptfs(8)                   eCryptfs                   mount.ecryptfs(8)



NAME
       mount.ecryptfs - eCryptfs mount helper.


SYNOPSIS
       mount -t ecryptfs [lower directory] [ecryptfs mount point]


DESCRIPTION
       mount.ecryptfs  is eCryptfs mount helper. The mount utility will defer to
       the mount helper to perform  various  configuration  tasks;  use  the  -i
       option  to  bypass  the mount helper if you would rather manually specify
       your mount options. To mount eCryptfs, specify the lower directory (i.e.,
       /root/crypt)  for  the encrypted files and the eCryptfs mountpoint (i.e.,
       /mnt/crypt) for the decrypted view of the files:

       mount -t ecryptfs /root/crypt /mnt/crypt
