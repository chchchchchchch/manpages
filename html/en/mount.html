MOUNT(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   MOUNT(2)



NAME
       mount - mount file system

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;

       int mount(const char *source, const char *target,
                 const char *filesystemtype, unsigned long mountflags,
                 const void *data);

DESCRIPTION
       mount()  attaches  the  file system specified by source (which is often a
       device name, but can also be a directory name or a dummy) to  the  direc&#8208;
       tory specified by target.

       Appropriate  privilege  (Linux: the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) is required
       to mount file systems.

       Since Linux 2.4 a single file system can be  visible  at  multiple  mount
       points, and multiple mounts can be stacked on the same mount point.

       Values for the filesystemtype argument supported by the kernel are listed
       in /proc/filesystems (e.g., &quot;minix&quot;, &quot;ext2&quot;, &quot;ext3&quot;, &quot;jfs&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot;, &quot;reis&#8208;
       erfs&quot;,  &quot;msdos&quot;,  &quot;proc&quot;,  &quot;nfs&quot;,  &quot;iso9660&quot;).   Further types may become
       available when the appropriate modules are loaded.

       The mountflags argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED (MS_MGC_VAL)  in
       the  top  16 bits (this was required in kernel versions prior to 2.4, but
       is no longer required and ignored if specified), and various mount  flags
       in the low order 16 bits:

       MS_BIND (Linux 2.4 onward)
              Perform a bind mount, making a file or a directory subtree visible
              at another point within a file system.  Bind mounts may cross file
              system  boundaries  and  span chroot(2) jails.  The filesystemtype
              and data arguments are ignored.  Up until Linux 2.6.26, mountflags
              was also ignored (the bind mount has the same mount options as the
              underlying mount point).

       MS_DIRSYNC (since Linux 2.5.19)
              Make directory changes on this  file  system  synchronous.   (This
              property  can  be  obtained for individual directories or subtrees
              using chattr(1).)

       MS_MANDLOCK
              Permit mandatory locking on files in this file system.  (Mandatory
              locking must still be enabled on a per-file basis, as described in
              fcntl(2).)

       MS_MOVE
              Move a subtree.  source specifies an existing mount point and tar&#8208;
              get  specifies  the new location.  The move is atomic: at no point
              is the subtree unmounted.   The  filesystemtype,  mountflags,  and
              data arguments are ignored.

       MS_NOATIME
              Do  not  update access times for (all types of) files on this file
              system.

       MS_NODEV
              Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this  file  sys&#8208;
              tem.

       MS_NODIRATIME
              Do  not  update  access times for directories on this file system.
              This flag provides a  subset  of  the  functionality  provided  by
              MS_NOATIME; that is, MS_NOATIME implies MS_NODIRATIME.

       MS_NOEXEC
              Do not allow programs to be executed from this file system.

       MS_NOSUID
              Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits when executing pro&#8208;
              grams from this file system.

       MS_RDONLY
              Mount file system read-only.

       MS_RELATIME (Since Linux 2.6.20)
              When a file on this file  system  is  accessed,  only  update  the
              file&apos;s  last  access time (atime) if the current value of atime is
              less than or equal to the file&apos;s last modification time (mtime) or
              last  status  change time (ctime).  This option is useful for pro&#8208;
              grams, such as mutt(1), that need to know when  a  file  has  been
              read  since  it was last modified.  Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel
              defaults to the behavior provided by this flag (unless  MS_NOATIME
              was  specified), and the MS_STRICTATIME flag is required to obtain
              traditional semantics.   In  addition,  since  Linux  2.6.30,  the
              file&apos;s last access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day
              old.

       MS_REMOUNT
              Remount an existing mount.  This allows you to change  the  mount&#8208;
              flags  and data of an existing mount without having to unmount and
              remount the file system.  target should be the same  value  speci&#8208;
              fied  in  the  initial mount() call; source and filesystemtype are
              ignored.

              The following mountflags can be  changed:  MS_RDONLY,  MS_SYNCHRO&#8208;
              NOUS,  MS_MANDLOCK; before kernel 2.6.16, the following could also
              be  changed:  MS_NOATIME  and  MS_NODIRATIME;  and,  additionally,
              before  kernel  2.4.10,  the  following  could  also  be  changed:
              MS_NOSUID, MS_NODEV, MS_NOEXEC.

       MS_SILENT (since Linux 2.6.17)
              Suppress the display of certain (printk()) warning messages in the
              kernel  log.   This  flag  supersedes  the  misnamed  and obsolete
              MS_VERBOSE flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which has the same
              meaning.

       MS_STRICTATIME (Since Linux 2.6.30)
              Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this file
              system are accessed.  (This was the default behavior before  Linux
              2.6.30.)  Specifying this flag overrides the effect of setting the
              MS_NOATIME and MS_RELATIME flags.

       MS_SYNCHRONOUS
              Make writes on this file system synchronous (as though the  O_SYNC
              flag to open(2) was specified for all file opens to this file sys&#8208;
              tem).

       From Linux 2.4 onward, the MS_NODEV, MS_NOEXEC, and MS_NOSUID  flags  are
       settable on a per-mount-point basis.  From kernel 2.6.16 onward, MS_NOAT&#8208;
       IME and MS_NODIRATIME are also settable on a per-mount-point basis.   The
       MS_RELATIME flag is also settable on a per-mount-point basis.

       The  data  argument  is interpreted by the different file systems.  Typi&#8208;
       cally it is a string of comma-separated options understood by  this  file
       system.   See  mount(8)  for  details  of  the options available for each
       filesystem type.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       The  error  values  given  below  result from filesystem type independent
       errors.  Each file-system type may have its own special  errors  and  its
       own special behavior.  See the Linux kernel source code for details.

       EACCES A  component of a path was not searchable.  (See also path_resolu&#8208;
              tion(7).)  Or, mounting a  read-only  file  system  was  attempted
              without giving the MS_RDONLY flag.  Or, the block device source is
              located on a file system mounted with the MS_NODEV option.

       EBUSY  source is already mounted.  Or, it cannot be remounted  read-only,
              because  it  still holds files open for writing.  Or, it cannot be
              mounted on target because target is still busy (it is the  working
              directory  of  some thread, the mount point of another device, has
              open files, etc.).

       EFAULT One of the pointer  arguments  points  outside  the  user  address
              space.

       EINVAL source  had an invalid superblock.  Or, a remount (MS_REMOUNT) was
              attempted, but source was not already mounted on  target.   Or,  a
              move (MS_MOVE) was attempted, but source was not a mount point, or
              was &apos;/&apos;.

       ELOOP  Too many links encountered during pathname resolution.  Or, a move
              was attempted, while target is a descendant of source.

       EMFILE (In  case  no block device is required:) Table of dummy devices is
              full.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              A pathname was longer than MAXPATHLEN.

       ENODEV filesystemtype not configured in the kernel.

       ENOENT A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.

       ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate a free page  to  copy  filenames  or
              data into.

       ENOTBLK
              source is not a block device (and a device was required).

       ENOTDIR
              target, or a prefix of source, is not a directory.

       ENXIO  The major number of the block device source is out of range.

       EPERM  The caller does not have the required privileges.

VERSIONS
       The   definitions   of  MS_DIRSYNC,  MS_MOVE,  MS_REC,  MS_RELATIME,  and
       MS_STRICTATIME were only added to glibc headers in version 2.12.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is Linux-specific  and  should  not  be  used  in  programs
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       The  original  MS_SYNC  flag  was renamed MS_SYNCHRONOUS in 1.1.69 when a
       different MS_SYNC was added to &lt;mman.h&gt;.

       Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID pro&#8208;
       gram  on  a  file  system  mounted  with MS_NOSUID would fail with EPERM.
       Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are  just  silently
       ignored in this case.

   Per-process Namespaces
       Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides per-process mount namespaces.
       A mount namespace is the set of file system mounts that are visible to  a
       process.   Mount-point namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between
       multiple processes, and  changes  to  the  namespace  (i.e.,  mounts  and
       unmounts)  by  one process are visible to all other processes sharing the
       same namespace.  (The pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one
       in which a single namespace was shared by every process on the system.)

       A  child  process created by fork(2) shares its parent&apos;s mount namespace;
       the mount namespace is preserved across an execve(2).

       A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was  created  using
       the  clone(2)  CLONE_NEWNS  flag, in which case its new namespace is ini&#8208;
       tialized to be a copy  of  the  namespace  of  the  process  that  called
       clone(2);  or it calls unshare(2) with the CLONE_NEWNS flag, which causes
       the caller&apos;s mount namespace to obtain a private copy  of  the  namespace
       that  it  was  previously  sharing  with  other processes, so that future
       mounts and unmounts by  the  caller  are  invisible  to  other  processes
       (except  child  processes  that the caller subsequently creates) and vice
       versa.

       The Linux-specific /proc/PID/mounts file exposes the list of mount points
       in  the mount namespace of the process with the specified ID; see proc(5)
       for details.
