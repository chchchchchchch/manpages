mouse_close(3)                 Svgalib User Manual                mouse_close(3)



NAME
       mouse_close - explicitly close a mouse

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       void mouse_close(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Closes  the  mouse  device file.  This should be called at the end of the
       program (if a mouse is used) because it tries  to  restore  the  original
       mouse state, if it has changed.  In particular - don&apos;t call mouse_init(),
       mouse_close(), mouse_init() this sequence is not going to work. Leave the
       mouse device open until the end of the program.
