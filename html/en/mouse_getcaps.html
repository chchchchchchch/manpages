vga_getmousetype(3)            Svgalib User Manual           vga_getmousetype(3)



NAME
       mouse_getcaps - returns the capabilities of the mouse

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       int mouse_getcaps(struct MouseCaps *caps);


DESCRIPTION
       This  fills  a  structure  with information about the capabilities of the
       mouse as configured in /etc/vga/libvga.config.

       The return value is 0 on success, -1 on failure. Failure  indicates  that
       an  older version of the svgalib library is being used that does not sup&#8208;
       port this function, and the capabilities  should  be  inferred  from  the
       mouse type as retrieved by the function vga_getmousetype(3).

       The MouseCaps structure contains the following members:

       int key;
              After  a  successful  call  of mouse_getcaps this should be set to
              MOUSE_GOTCAPS.  The values of this and the other members are unde&#8208;
              fined in the case of failure.
       int buttons;
              A  bitmask  indicating  which buttons are supported by the device,
              composed of the  constants  MOUSE_LEFTBUTTON,  MOUSE_MIDDLEBUTTON,
              MOUSE_RIGHTBUTTON,      MOUSE_FOURTHBUTTON,     MOUSE_FIFTHBUTTON,
              MOUSE_SIXTHBUTTON, and MOUSE_RESETBUTTON. Note that  MOUSE_MIDDLE&#8208;
              BUTTON may be set when using mouse protocols that support a middle
              button even if there is no button physically present on the mouse.
       int axes;
              A bitmask indicating which axes are supported by the device,  com&#8208;
              posed   of   the  constants  MOUSE_XDIM,  MOUSE_YDIM,  MOUSE_ZDIM,
              MOUSE_RXDIM, MOUSE_RYDIM, and MOUSE_RZDIM.
       int info;
              A bitmask indicating other information about the mouse.  Currently
              the  only  field defined is MOUSE_INFO_WHEEL, which indicates that
              the mouse is a wheel mouse.
       int reserved0;
              Reserved for future use.
       int reserved1;
              Reserved for future use.

       Your application may use this info to perform specific actions (go into a
       3d pointer device mode or make use of a wheel for scrolling for example).
