mouse_getx(3)                  Svgalib User Manual                 mouse_getx(3)



NAME
       mouse_getx, mouse_gety, mouse_getbutton - query the mouse state

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       int mouse_getx(void);
       int mouse_gety(void);
       int mouse_getbutton(void);


DESCRIPTION
       These  three  routines  do  the  obvious,  namely returning current mouse
       pointer position and button state.  mouse_getbutton() returns an  integer
       which  can  be  bitwise  &amp;&apos;d  with  MOUSE_LEFTBUTTON, MOUSE_MIDDLEBUTTON,
       MOUSE_RIGHTBUTTON, MOUSE_FOURTHBUTTON, MOUSE_FIFTHBUTTON, MOUSE_SIXTHBUT&#8208;
       TON, or MOUSE_RESETBUTTON.

       A  1 on any of these bits means the button has been pressed, a 0 means it
       hasn&apos;t.

       Please note that you need to  call  mouse_update(3)  or  mouse_waitforup&#8208;
       date(3) for the mouse state actually to change.

       For  3d  pointer  devices,  there  is  actually  another  interface.  See
       mouse_getposition_6d(3).
