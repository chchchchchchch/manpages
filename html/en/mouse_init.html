mouse_init(3)                  Svgalib User Manual                 mouse_init(3)



NAME
       mouse_init, mouse_init_return_fd - specifically initialize a mouse

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       int mouse_init(char *dev, int type, int samplerate);
       int mouse_init_return_fd(char *dev, int type, int samplerate);


DESCRIPTION
       These routines can be used to open the mouse manually, ignoring the mouse
       types or devices specified in the config file.

       dev is the name of the mouse device (defaults to /dev_mouse).

       samplerate may be one MOUSE_DEFAULTSAMPLERATE(150) or  any  other  value.
       Probably it is in Hz.

       type is one of the types which are listed already in vga_getmousetype(3).

       If  these  routines are used it is not necessary to call vga_setmousesup&#8208;
       port(3), but it&apos;s probably better to not use these and  use  vga_setmous&#8208;
       esupport(3) instead.

       The  return_fd version returns the file descriptor of the mouse device to
       allow you to do further tricks with the mouse  (but  the  filehandle  may
       change  during a VC switch). The other version just returns 0 if success&#8208;
       ful.  Both return -1 on error.
