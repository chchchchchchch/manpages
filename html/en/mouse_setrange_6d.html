mouse_getposition_6d(3)        Svgalib User Manual       mouse_getposition_6d(3)



NAME
       mouse_getposition_6d,  mouse_setposition_6d,  mouse_setrange_6d - provide
       an interface to 3d mice

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       void mouse_getposition_6d(int *x, int *y, int *z, int *rx , int *ry,  int
       *rz);
       void  mouse_setposition_6d(int  x, int y, int z, int rx , int ry, int rz,
       int dim_mask);
       void mouse_setrange_6d(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2, int z1 ,  int  z2,
       int rx1, int rx2, int ry1, int ry2 , int rz1, int rz2, int dim_mask);


DESCRIPTION
       These routines provide the same function as mouse_getx(3), mouse_gety(3),
       mouse_setxrange(3),   mouse_setyrange(3),    mouse_setposition(3),    and
       mouse_getx(3),  except that they work in all six dimensions, x, y, z, and
       rotations about those axes.

       For mouse_getposition_6d(), NULL pointers may be passed for  any  coordi&#8208;
       nate you don&apos;t care to know about.  Those dimensions will be ignored.

       mouse_setposition_6d()  and  mouse_setrange_6d() take an additional argu&#8208;
       ment called dim_mask, which should be an logical  or  of  the  following:
       MOUSE_XDIM,   MOUSE_YDIM,   MOUSE_ZDIM,   MOUSE_RXDIM,   MOUSE_RYDIM,  or
       MOUSE_RZDIM.  MOUSE_2DIM, MOUSE_3DIM, MOUSE_6DIM can be used as shorthand
       for  the  XY,  XYZ, or XYZRxRyRz dimensions.  The position or ranges will
       only be set if that dimension is included in dim_mask.

       The 6d mouse routines can be used safely with any mouse  type,  including
       standard 2D mice.

       When  used  with mice that support fewer than six axes, the other coordi&#8208;
       nates will always return zero (or whatever value you set them to).
