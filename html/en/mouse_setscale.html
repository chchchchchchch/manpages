mouse_setscale(3)              Svgalib User Manual             mouse_setscale(3)



NAME
       mouse_setscale - sets a mouse scale factor

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       void mouse_setscale(int s);


DESCRIPTION
       This  routine  sets  the  scale factor between the motion reported by the
       mouse and the size of one pixel.  The larger the scale is, the slower the
       mouse cursor appears to move.  The scale may be set to any non-zero inte&#8208;
       ger.  Negative scales result in flipped axes.   Currently,  there  is  no
       support  for  scale  factors  between  0 and 1 which would make the mouse
       appear faster than usual.

       If this routine is never called, scale s defaults to 1.
