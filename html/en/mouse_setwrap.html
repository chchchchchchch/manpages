mouse_setwrap(3)               Svgalib User Manual              mouse_setwrap(3)



NAME
       mouse_setwrap - set what happens at the mouse boundaries

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       void mouse_setwrap(int state);


DESCRIPTION
       This routine determines what to do if the mouse position reaches a bound&#8208;
       ary.

       state should be either MOUSE_WRAP,  MOUSE_NOWRAP,  or  a  bitwise  or  of
       MOUSE_WRAPX,  MOUSE_WRAPY,  MOUSE_WRAPZ,  MOUSE_WRAPRX,  MOUSE_WRAPRY, or
       MOUSE_WRAPRZ.  These define if all or the respective coordinates wrap  or
       are clipped at the ends.

       This  variable has been overloaded for the case of multi-dimensional mice
       that support rotations and can be used to select  the  coordinate  system
       used to return the current position of the mouse.

       If  the  above value of state is also ored with MOUSE_ROT_RX_RY_RZ, rota&#8208;
       tional information will be returned as the angular position as  expressed
       by  the  total angle wound around the X, Y, and Z axes.  This is the sim&#8208;
       plest coordinate system to use, but it&apos;s also  the  least  useful,  since
       angular rotations about perpendicular axes don&apos;t commute.  There are sit&#8208;
       uations where this system might be useful, for controlling truly indepen&#8208;
       dent quantities, such as color, with each axis being used to dial a level
       of red, green, or blue, but for modeling  the  actual  orientation  of  a
       physical object, it&apos;s utterly hopeless.

       If  state is instead ored with MOUSE_ROT_INFINITESIMAL, the angular posi&#8208;
       tions returned are expressed as differences from the previously  reported
       position.   If  the  differences are sufficiently small, the angular dis&#8208;
       placements will commute with each other and can  be  used  to  track  the
       motion  of  a  physical  object.   Other coordinate systems, such as yaw,
       pitch, and roll, could be defined, but haven&apos;t been done due to  lack  of
       time.   If  you  feel  you  need  this feature, send mail to Eric Sharkey
       &lt;sharkey@superk.physics.sunysb.edu&gt; and he just might consider coding  it
       up.

       MOUSE_WRAP and MOUSE_ROT_COORDS can be used to mask out the bits used for
       wrap and coordinate states, respectively.
