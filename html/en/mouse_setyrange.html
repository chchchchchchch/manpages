mouse_setxrange(3)             Svgalib User Manual            mouse_setxrange(3)



NAME
       mouse_setxrange,  mouse_setyrange  -  define the boundaries for the mouse
       cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vgamouse.h&gt;

       void mouse_setxrange(int x1, int x2);
       void mouse_setyrange(int y1, int y2);


DESCRIPTION
       These two define the boundaries for mouse cursor.  x1, x2, y1, and y2 are
       the  coordinates of the left, right, bottom, and top edges of the screen,
       respectively.

       The return values of mouse_getx(3) and mouse_gety(3) will always stay  in
       these boundaries.

       For  3d  pointer  devices,  there  is  actually  another  interface.  See
       mouse_getposition_6d(3).
