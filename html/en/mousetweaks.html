DESCRIPTION
       mousetweaks  is  a  collection of accessibility enhancements for pointing
       devices. This manual page describes the mousetweaks daemon.

OPTIONS
       --dwell
              Automatically perform mouse clicks without using a  physical  but&#8208;
              ton.

       --ssc  Trigger  the  secondary mouse button when the primary mouse button
              is held down for a specified amount of time.

       --dwell-time=FLOAT
              Time to keep the pointer motionless before a dwell click  is  per&#8208;
              formed.  Range: 0.2 - 3.0 seconds.

       --ssc-time=FLOAT
              Time to hold the primary mouse button before a simulated secondary
              click is performed. Range: 0.5 - 3.0 seconds.

       -m, --dwell-mode=STRING
              Select a dwell mode. Available options: window - Select the  click
              type from a window or a panel applet.  gesture - Perform different
              clicks by moving in different directions.

       -c, --show-ctw
              Show the  click-type  window.  Only  useful  in  combination  with
              --dwell-mode=window.

       -t, --threshold=INT
              Ignore small pointer movements. Range: 0 - 30 pixels.

       -g, --geometry
              Size  and  position of the click-type window. Expects a standard X
              Window System geometry string. ie. WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y

       -s, --shutdown
              Stop the mousetweaks daemon.

       --daemonize
              Start mousetweaks in the background, ie. spawn a child process.

              specific to GDM. Currently unused.
