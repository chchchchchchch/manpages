Mono(MozRoots)                                                    Mono(MozRoots)



NAME
       mozroots  -  Download and import trusted root certificates from Mozilla&apos;s
       LXR into Mono&apos;s certificate store

SYNOPSIS
       mozroots [--import [--machine] [--sync  |  --ask  |  --ask-add  |  --ask-
       remove]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program downloads the trusted root certificates from the Mozilla LXR
       web site into the Mono certificate store.

       Mono by default does not ship with any default  certificates  and  allows
       the  user  to  pick  its trusted certificates.  The mozroots command will
       bring the Mozilla certificates into your local machine.

OPTIONS
       --import
              Import the certificates into the trust store.

       --sync Synchronize (add/remove) the trust store  with  the  certificates.
              Synchronize  is  useful  for new Mono installations (no roots) and
              for automated  updates  (no  user  confirmation  for  addition  or
              removal).

       --ask  Always  confirm  before  adding  or removing trusted certificates.
              Note: The initial import will likely add  about  100  new  trusted
              root  certificates  into  your store. You&apos;ll have to answer yes to
              every one of them if this option is specified.

       --ask-add
              Always confirm before adding a new trusted certificate.  Note: The
              initial import will likely add about 100 new trusted root certifi&#8208;
              cates into your store. You&apos;ll have to answer yes to every  one  of
              them if this option is specified.

       --ask-remove
              Always confirm before removing an existing trusted certificate.

ADVANCED OPTIONS
       --url url
              Specify  an  alternative  URL for downloading the trusted certifi&#8208;
              cates (LXR source format). This should only be useful for  testing
              or  if  the Mozilla&apos;s LXR web site address is changed. It can also
              be used to cache a local copy of the  LXR  file  into  your  local
              intranet.

       --file name
              Do  not download from LXR but use the specified file. This is use&#8208;
              ful if many computers have to download  the  same  file  from  the
              Internet.   This  way  you  can keep a local copy on a file server
              (and minimize network traffic).

       --pkcs7 name
              Export the certificates into a PKCS#7 file.  This  is  useful  for
              debugging  purpose  or  for  re-importing the same list into other
              software.

       --machine
              Import the certificate in the machine trust store. The default  is
              to  import  all  trusted  root  certificates into the current user
              store.

       --quiet
              Limit console output to errors and confirmations messages. This is
              useful when scripting.

EXAMPLES
       After the initial Mono installation you&apos;ll have no trusted roots certifi&#8208;
       cates pre-installed.  Neither will you have some root  test  certificates
       installed  (your own or the ones provided by using setreg ). In this case
       the simplest thing to do, if you want to trust all those certificates, is
       to import and synchronize.

       If  you  created some test certificates (e.g. for using SSL/TLS with XSP)
       and/or if your enterprise  requires  some  additional  root  certificates
       (e.g.  intranet)  then  you  may  want  to  skip  the removal part of the
       process. You can do this by asking for  a  removal  confirmation  (--ask-
       remove option) and answer no when prompted.

       You can still use the synchronize option (--sync) if you have activated
       the default test roots certificate on your system. They will be removed
       at the end of the synchronization process but you can quickly add them
       back with the
       setreg
       tool.
            $ setreg 1 true

       Another option to ease updates is to synchronize your machine trust store
       (using the --machine option) and keep your customized (test) certificates
       in your personal store (or vice versa). Note that every user on this com&#8208;
       puter will be trusting all the newly imported certificates.

       Once the initial import is complete the number of changes  (additions  or
       removals)  is  generally  very  low.  In this case it makes sense to know
       about any changes (i.e. ask for confirmation). No  confirmation  will  be
       required if no changes are made to your trust store.
