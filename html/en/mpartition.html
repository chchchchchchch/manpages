Name
       mpartition - partition an MSDOS hard disk



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mpartition  command  is used to create MS-DOS file systems as parti&#8208;
       tions.  This is intended to be used on non-Linux  systems,  i.e.  systems
       where fdisk and easy access to SCSI devices are not available.  This com&#8208;
       mand only works on drives whose partition variable is set.

       mpartition -p drive
       mpartition -r drive
       mpartition -I [-B bootSector] drive
       mpartition -a drive
       mpartition -d drive
       mpartition -c [-s sectors] [-h heads]
       [-t cylinders] [-v [-T type] [-b
       begin] [-l length] [-f]



       Mpartition supports the following operations:

       p      Prints a command line to recreate the  partition  for  the  drive.
              Nothing  is printed if the partition for the drive is not defined,
              or an inconsistency has been detected.  If verbose  (-v)  is  also
              set, prints the current partition table.

       r      Removes the partition described by drive.

       I      Initializes the partition table, and removes all partitions.

       c      Creates the partition described by drive.

       a      &quot;Activates&quot;  the partition, i.e. makes it bootable.  Only one par&#8208;
              tition can be bootable at a time.

       d      &quot;Deactivates&quot; the partition, i.e. makes it unbootable.

       If no operation is given, the current settings are printed.

       For partition creations, the following options are available:

       s sectors
              The number of sectors per track of the partition  (which  is  also
              the number of sectors per track for the whole drive).

       h heads
              The  number of heads of the partition (which is also the number of
              heads for the whole drive).  By default, the geometry  information
              (number of sectors and heads) is figured out from neighboring par&#8208;
              tition table entries, or guessed from the size.

       t cylinders
              The number of cylinders of the partition (not the number of cylin&#8208;
              ders of the whole drive.

       b begin
              The  starting  offset  of  the partition, expressed in sectors. If
              begin is not given, mpartition lets the  partition  begin  at  the
              start  of  the disk (partition number 1), or immediately after the
              end of the previous partition.

       l length
              The size (length) of the partition, expressed in sectors.  If  end
              is  not  given, mpartition figures out the size from the number of
              sectors, heads and cylinders.  If these are not given  either,  it
              gives  the  partition  the biggest possible size, considering disk
              size and start of the next partition.

       The following option is available for all operation which modify the par&#8208;
       tition table:

       f      Usually, before writing back any changes to the partition, mparti&#8208;
              tion performs certain consistency checks,  such  as  checking  for
              overlaps  and proper alignment of the partitions.  If any of these
              checks fails, the partition table is not changes.  The  -f  allows
              you to override these safeguards.

       The following options are available for all operations:

       v      Together  with  -p  prints  the  partition  table as it is now (no
              change operation), or as it is after it is modified.

       vv     If the verbosity flag is given twice, mpartition will print out  a
              hexdump of the partition table when reading it from and writing it
              to the device.

       The following option is available for partition table initialization:

       B bootSector
              Reads the template master boot record from file bootSector.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:
&#12;                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
