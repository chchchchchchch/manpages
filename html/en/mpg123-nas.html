mpg123(1)                                                              mpg123(1)



NAME
       mpg123 - play audio MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 stream (layers 1, 2 and 3)

SYNOPSIS
       mpg123 [ options ] file ... | URL ... | -

DESCRIPTION
       mpg123  reads one or more files (or standard input if ``-&apos;&apos; is specified)
       or URLs and plays them on the audio device (default) or outputs  them  to
       stdout.  file/URL is assumed to be an MPEG audio bit stream.

OPERANDS
       The following operands are supported:

       file(s) The  path name(s) of one or more input files.  They must be valid
               MPEG-1.0/2.0/2.5 audio layer 1, 2 or 3 bit streams.   If  a  dash
               ``-&apos;&apos;  is  specified,  MPEG  data  will be read from the standard
               input.  Furthermore, any name starting with ``http://&apos;&apos; is recog&#8208;
               nized as URL (see next section).

OPTIONS
       mpg123 options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or
       the GNU style long options.  POSIX style  options  start  with  a  single
       ``-&apos;&apos;,  while  GNU  long options start with ``--&apos;&apos;.  Option arguments (if
       needed) follow separated by  whitespace  (not  ``=&apos;&apos;).   Note  that  some
       options  can  be absent from your installation when disabled in the build
       process.

INPUT OPTIONS
       -k num, --skip num
              Skip first num frames.  By default  the  decoding  starts  at  the
              first frame.

       -n num, --frames num
              Decode  only  num  frames.   By  default  the  complete  stream is
              decoded.

       --fuzzy
              Enable fuzzy seeks (guessing byte  offsets  or  using  approximate
              seek points from Xing TOC).  Without that, seeks need a first scan
              through the file before they  can  jump  at  positions.   You  can
              decide  here:  sample-accurate  operation with gapless features or
              faster (fuzzy) seeking.

       -y, --no-resync
              Do NOT try to resync and continue decoding if an error  occurs  in
              the  input file. Normally, mpg123 tries to keep the playback alive
              at all costs, including skipping invalid  material  and  searching
              new  header  when  something goes wrong.  With this switch you can
              make it bail out on data errors (and perhaps spare your ears a bad
              time).  Note that this switch has been renamed from --resync.  The
              old name still works, but is not advertised or recommened  to  use
              (subject to removal in future).

       --resync-limit bytes
              Set  number  of  bytes  to search for valid MPEG data once lost in
              stream; &lt;0 means search whole stream.  If you know there are  huge
              chunks  of  invalid  data  in  your  files... here is your hammer.
              Note: Only since version 1.14 this also increases  the  amount  of
              junk skipped on beginning.

       -p URL | none, --proxy URL | none
              The  specified proxy will be used for HTTP requests.  It should be
              specified as  full  URL  (``http://host.domain:port/&apos;&apos;),  but  the
              ``http://&apos;&apos;  prefix,  the  port  number and the trailing slash are
              optional (the default port is 80).  Specifying none means  not  to
              use  any proxy, and to retrieve files directly from the respective
              servers.  See also the ``HTTP SUPPORT&apos;&apos; section.

       -u auth, --auth auth
              HTTP authentication to use when recieving  files  via  HTTP.   The
              format used is user:password.

       -@ file, --list file
              Read  filenames  and/or URLs of MPEG audio streams from the speci&#8208;
              fied file in addition to the ones specified on  the  command  line
              (if  any).   Note that file can be either an ordinary file, a dash
              ``-&apos;&apos; to indicate that a list of filenames/URLs is to be read from
              the  standard  input,  or an URL pointing to a an appropriate list
              file.  Note: only one -@ option can be used (if more than  one  is
              specified, only the last one will be recognized).

       -l n, --listentry n
              Of  the  playlist,  play specified entry only.  n is the number of
              entry starting at 1. A  value  of  0  is  the  default  and  means
              playling  the  whole  list,  a negative value means showing of the
              list of titles with their numbers...

       --loop times
              for looping track(s) a certain number of times, &lt; 0 means infinite
              loop (not with --random!).

       --keep-open
              For remote control mode: Keep loaded file open after reaching end.

       --timeout seconds
              Timeout in (integer) seconds before declaring a stream dead (if &lt;=
              0, wait forever).

       -z, --shuffle
              Shuffle play.  Randomly shuffles the order of files  specified  on
              the command line, or in the list file.

       -Z, --random
              Continuous random play.  Keeps picking a random file from the com&#8208;
              mand line or the play list.  Unlike  shuffle  play  above,  random
              play never ends, and plays individual songs more than once.

       --no-icy-meta
              Do not accept ICY meta data.

       -i, --index
              Index  /  scan  through the track before playback.  This fills the
              index table for seeking (if enabled in libmpg123) and may make the
              operating system cache the file contents for smoother operating on
              playback.

       --index-size size
              Set the number of entries in the seek frame index table.

       --preframes num
              Set the number of frames to be read as lead-in before a  seeked-to
              position.  This serves to fill the layer 3 bit reservoir, which is
              needed to faithfully reproduce a certain sample at a certain posi&#8208;
              tion.   Note that for layer 3, a minimum of 1 is enforced (because
              of frame overlap), and for layer 1 and 2, this is limited to 2 (no
              bit reservoir in that case, but engine spin-up anyway).


OUTPUT and PROCESSING OPTIONS
       -o module, --output module
              Select audio output module. You can provide a comma-separated list
              to use the first one that works.

       --list-modules
              List the available modules.

       -a dev, --audiodevice dev
              Specify the audio device to use.  The default is  system-dependent
              (usually  /dev/audio  or  /dev/dsp).   Use this option if you have
              multiple audio devices and the default is not what you want.

       -s, --stdout
              The decoded audio samples are written to standard output,  instead
              of  playing  them  through  the audio device.  This option must be
              used if your audio hardware is not supported by mpg123.  The  out&#8208;
              put  format per default is raw (headerless) linear PCM audio data,
              16 bit, stereo, host byte order (you can force mono or 8bit).

       -O file, --outfile
              Write raw output into a file (instead of simply redirecting  stan&#8208;
              dard output to a file with the shell).

       -w file, --wav
              Write  output  as  WAV file. This will cause the MPEG stream to be
              decoded and saved as file file , or standard output if -  is  used
              as  file name. You can also use --au and --cdr for AU and CDR for&#8208;
              mat, respectively.

       --au file
              Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to  file  in  SUN  audio
              format.   If  - is used as the filename, the AU file is written to
              stdout.

       --cdr file
              Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to file as a  CDR  file.
              If - is used as the filename, the CDR file is written to stdout.

       --reopen
              Forces reopen of the audiodevice after ever song

       --cpu decoder-type
              Selects  a certain decoder (optimized for specific CPU), for exam&#8208;
              ple i586 or MMX.  The list of available decoders can vary; depend&#8208;
              ing on the build and what your CPU supports.  This options is only
              availabe  when  the  build  actually  includes  several  optimized
              decoders.

       --test-cpu
              Tests your CPU and prints a list of possible choices for --cpu.

       --list-cpu
              Lists all available decoder choices, regardless of support by your
              CPU.

       -g gain, --gain gain
              [DEPRECATED]  Set  audio  hardware  output  gain  (default:  don&apos;t
              change).  The unit of the gain value is hardware and output module
              dependent.  (This parameter is only provided for backwards compat&#8208;
              ibility and may be removed in the future without prior notice. Use
              the audio player for playing and a  mixer  app  for  mixing,  UNIX
              style!)

       -f factor, --scale factor
              Change scale factor (default: 32768).

       --rva-mix, --rva-radio
              Enable  RVA  (relative  volume adjustment) using the values stored
              for ReplayGain radio mode / mix mode with all tracks roughly equal
              loudness.   The  first valid information found in ID3V2 Tags (Com&#8208;
              ment named  RVA  or  the  RVA2  frame)  or  ReplayGain  header  in
              Lame/Info Tag is used.

       --rva-album, --rva-audiophile
              Enable  RVA  (relative  volume adjustment) using the values stored
              for ReplayGain audiophile mode  /  album  mode  with  usually  the
              effect  of  adjusting album loudness but keeping relative loudness
              inside album.  The first valid information  found  in  ID3V2  Tags
              (Comment  named  RVA_ALBUM or the RVA2 frame) or ReplayGain header
              in Lame/Info Tag is used.

       -0, --single0; -1, --single1
              Decode only channel 0 (left) or channel 1  (right),  respectively.
              These options are available for stereo MPEG streams only.

       -m, --mono, --mix, --singlemix
              Mix  both channels / decode mono. It takes less CPU time than full
              stereo decoding.

       --stereo
              Force stereo output

       -r rate, --rate rate
              Set sample rate (default: automatic).  You may want to change this
              if  you  need  a  constant  bitrate independent of the mpeg stream
              rate. mpg123 automagically converts the rate. You should then com&#8208;
              bine this with --stereo or --mono.

       -2, --2to1; -4, --4to1
              Performs  a  downsampling of ratio 2:1 (22 kHz) or 4:1 (11 kHz) on
              the output stream, respectively. Saves some  CPU  cycles,  but  at
              least the 4:1 ratio sounds ugly.

       --pitch value
              Set  hardware pitch (speedup/down, 0 is neutral; 0.05 is 5%). This
              changes the output sampling rate, so it only works  in  the  range
              your audio system/hardware supports.

       --8bit Forces 8bit output

       --float
              Forces f32 encoding

       -e enc, --encoding enc
              Choose  output  sample  encoding.  Possible  values  look like f32
              (32-bit floating point), s32 (32-bit signed integer), u32  (32-bit
              unsigned  integer) and the variants with different numbers of bits
              (s24, u24, s16, u16, s8, u8) and also special variants  like  ulaw
              and  alaw 8-bit.  See the output of mpg123&apos;s longhelp for actually
              available encodings.

       -d n, --doublespeed n
              Only play every n&apos;th frame.  This will cause the MPEG stream to be
              played n times faster, which can be used for special effects.  Can
              also be combined with the --halfspeed option to play 3  out  of  4
              frames  etc.   Don&apos;t  expect  great  sound quality when using this
              option.

       -h n, --halfspeed n
              Play each frame n times.  This will cause the MPEG  stream  to  be
              played  at  1/n&apos;th  speed  (n times slower), which can be used for
              special effects. Can  also  be  combined  with  the  --doublespeed
              option  to  double  every  third frame or things like that.  Don&apos;t
              expect great sound quality when using this option.

       -E file, --equalizer
              Enables equalization, taken from file.  The file needs to  contain
              32 lines of data, additional comment lines may be prefixed with #.
              Each data line consists of two floating-point  entries,  separated
              by  whitespace.   They  specify the multipliers for left and right
              channel of a certain frequency band, respectively.  The first line
              corresponds to the lowest, the 32nd to the highest frequency band.
              Note that you can control the  equalizer  interactively  with  the
              generic control interface.

       --gapless
              Enable  code  that  cuts  (junk)  samples  at beginning and end of
              tracks, enabling  gapless  transitions  between  MPEG  files  when
              encoder  padding  and  codec  delays  would  prevent  it.  This is
              enabled per default beginning with mpg123 version 1.0.0 .

       --no-gapless
              Disable the gapless  code.  That  gives  you  MP3  decodings  that
              include encoder delay and padding plus mpg123&apos;s decoder delay.

       -D n, --delay n
              Insert a delay of n seconds before each track.

       -o h, --headphones
              Direct  audio  output  to  the  headphone connector (some hardware
              only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       -o s, --speaker
              Direct audio output to the speaker  (some hardware only; AIX,  HP,
              SUN).

       -o l, --lineout
              Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware only;
              AIX, HP, SUN).

       -b size, --buffer size
              Use an audio output buffer of size  Kbytes.   This  is  useful  to
              bypass  short  periods  of heavy system activity, which would nor&#8208;
              mally cause the audio output to be interrupted.  You should  spec&#8208;
              ify  a buffer size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about
              6 seconds of audio data) or more; less than  about  300  does  not
              make much sense.  The default is 0, which turns buffering off.

       --preload fraction
              Wait for the buffer to be filled to fraction before starting play&#8208;
              back (fraction between 0 and 1). You can tune this prebuffering to
              either  get  faster  sound to your ears or safer uninterrupted web
              radio.  Default is 1 (wait for full buffer before playback).

       --smooth
              Keep buffer over track boundaries -- meaning,  do  not  empty  the
              buffer between tracks for possibly some added smoothness.


MISC OPTIONS
       -t, --test
              Test mode.  The audio stream is decoded, but no output occurs.

       -c, --check
              Check  for filter range violations (clipping), and report them for
              each frame if any occur.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity level.  For  example,  displays  the  frame
              numbers during decoding.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.

       -C, --control
              Enable  terminal control keys. By default use &apos;s&apos; or the space bar
              to stop/restart (pause, unpause) playback, &apos;f&apos; to jump forward  to
              the  next song, &apos;b&apos; to jump back to the beginning of the song, &apos;,&apos;
              to rewind, &apos;.&apos; to fast forward, and &apos;q&apos; to quit.  Type &apos;h&apos;  for  a
              full list of available controls.

       --title
              In  an  xterm,  or  rxvt (compatible, TERM environment variable is
              examined), change the window&apos;s title to the name of song currently
              playing.

       --long-tag
              Display  ID3 tag info always in long format with one line per item
              (artist, title, ...)

       --utf8 Regardless of environment, print  metadata  in  UTF-8  (otherwise,
              when not using UTF-8 locale, you&apos;ll get ASCII stripdown).

       -R, --remote
              Activate  generic  control  interface.   mpg123 will then read and
              execute commands from stdin. Basic usage is ``load  &lt;filename&gt;  &apos;&apos;
              to  play  some  file and the obvious ``pause&apos;&apos;, ``command.  ``jump
              &lt;frame&gt;&apos;&apos; will jump/seek to a given  point  (MPEG  frame  number).
              Issue ``help&apos;&apos; to get a full list of commands and syntax.

       --remote-err
              Print  responses  for  generic control mode to standard error, not
              standard out.  This is automatically triggered when using -s .

       --fifo path
              Create a fifo / named pipe on the given  path  and  use  that  for
              reading commands instead of standard input.

       --aggressive
              Tries to get higher priority

       -T, --realtime
              Tries  to  gain  realtime  priority.  This option usually requires
              root privileges to have any effect.

       -?, --help
              Shows short usage instructions.

       --longhelp
              Shows long usage instructions.

       --version
              Print the version string.

HTTP SUPPORT
       In addition to reading MPEG audio streams from ordinary  files  and  from
       the  standard  input,  mpg123  supports  retrieval of MPEG audio files or
       playlists via the HTTP protocol, which is used  in  the  World  Wide  Web
       (WWW).  Such files are specified using a so-called URL, which starts with
       ``http://&apos;&apos;.  When  a  file  with  that  prefix  is  encountered,  mpg123
       attempts  to  open  an HTTP connection to the server in order to retrieve
       that file to decode and play it.

       It is often useful to retrieve files through a  WWW  cache  or  so-called
       proxy.  To accomplish this, mpg123 examines the environment for variables
       named MP3_HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy and  HTTP_PROXY,  in  this  order.   The
       value  of  the first one that is set will be used as proxy specification.
       To override this, you can  use  the  -p  command  line  option  (see  the
       ``OPTIONS&apos;&apos;  section).   Specifying  -p  none will enforce contacting the
       server directly without using any proxy, even if one of the  above  envi&#8208;
       ronment variables is set.

       Note  that,  in  order  to play MPEG audio files from a WWW server, it is
       necessary that the connection to that server is fast enough.   For  exam&#8208;
       ple,  a  128  kbit/s  MPEG  file requires the network connection to be at
       least 128 kbit/s (16 kbyte/s) plus protocol overhead.  If you suffer from
       short  network  outages,  you should try the -b option (buffer) to bypass
       such outages.  If your network connection is generally not fast enough to
       retrieve  MPEG  audio files in realtime, you can first download the files
       to your local harddisk (e.g. using  wget(1))  and  then  play  them  from
       there.

       If  authentication  is needed to access the file it can be specified with
       the -u user:pass.

INTERRUPT
       When in terminal control mode, you can quit via pressing the q key, while
       any time you can abort mpg123 by pressing Ctrl-C. If not in terminal con&#8208;
       trol mode, this will skip to the next file (if any). If you want to abort
       playing  immediately in that case, press Ctrl-C twice in short succession
       (within about one second).

       Note that the result of quitting mpg123  pressing  Ctrl-C  might  not  be
       audible  immediately,  due  to  audio data buffering in the audio device.
       This delay is system dependent, but it is usually not more  than  one  or
       two seconds.

NOTES
       MPEG  audio  decoding requires a good deal of CPU performance, especially
       layer-3.  To decode it in realtime, you should have at least an  i486DX4,
       Pentium, Alpha, SuperSparc or equivalent processor.  You can also use the
       -m option to decode mono only, which reduces the CPU  load  somewhat  for
       layer-3 streams.  See also the -2 and -4 options.

       If everything else fails, use the -s option to decode to standard output,
       direct it into a file and then use an appropriate utility  to  play  that
       file.   You might have to use a tool such as sox(1) to convert the output
       to an audio format suitable for your audio player.

       If your system is generally fast enough to decode in realtime, but  there
       are  sometimes periods of heavy system load (such as cronjobs, users log&#8208;
       ging in remotely, starting of ``big&apos;&apos; programs etc.)  causing  the  audio
       output to be interrupted, then you should use the -b option to use a buf&#8208;
       fer of reasonable size (at least 1000 Kbytes).

BUGS
       Mostly MPEG-1 layer 2 and 3 are tested in real life.  Please  report  any
       issues and provide test files to help fixing them.

       Free  format  streams are not supported, but they could be (there is some
       code).

       No CRC error checking is performed.

       Some platforms lack audio hardware support; you may be able to use the -s
       switch  to  feed  the  decoded data to a program that can play it on your
       audio device.  Notably, this includes Tru64 with MME, but you  should  be
       able  to install and use OSS there (it perhaps will perform better as MME
       would anyway).
