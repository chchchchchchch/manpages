MPG321(1)                                                              MPG321(1)



NAME
       mpg321 &#8212; Simple and lightweight command line MP3 player

SYNOPSIS
       mpg321 [options] file(s) | URL(s) | -

DESCRIPTION
       mpg321 is a free command-line mp3 player, which uses the mad audio decod&#8208;
       ing library. mpg321 was written to be a drop-in replacement for the  (by-
       then)  non-free  mpg123 player.  Some functions remain unimplemented, but
       mpg321 should function as a basic drop-in replacement for  mpg123  front-
       ends  such  as  gqmpeg, and those programs which use mpg123 to decode mp3
       files (like gtoaster, and other CD-recording software).

OPTIONS
       -o devicetype
                 Set the output device type to devicetype.   devicetype  can  be
                 one of:

                 oss - the Linux Open Sound System;

                 sun - the Sun audio system;

                 alsa - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture;

                 alsa09 - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, version 0.9;

                 esd - the Enlightened Sound Daemon;

                 arts - the analog real-time synthesiser

                 See -a device, below.

       -a device, --audiodevice device
                 Use device for audio-out instead of the default device, depend&#8208;
                 ing on the output device you&apos;ve chosen (via -o devicetype).  By
                 default this is the native sound device.  Generally this is the
                 device for devicetype (or the default system device) to use for
                 output (i.e. /dev/sound/dsp1).


                 This option has no effect with -o arts.

                 For  -o esd, specify the host on which esd is running; defaults
                 to localhost.

                 For -o alsa, specify audio  device  using  the  hw:x,y  syntax,
                 where  x and y are numbers, default is hw:0,0.  For example, if
                 there is only one device installed, in most cases,  the  device
                 should  be  named  hw:0,0.   When there is only one device, the
                 device should always have the same name and numbers.

       -g N, --gain N
                 Set gain (volume) to N (1-100).

       -k N, --skip N
                 Skip N frames into the file being played.

       -n N, --frames N
                 Decode only the first N frames of the stream. By  default,  the
                 entire stream is decoded.
&#12;       -@ list, --list list
                 Use  the file list for a playlist. The list should be in a for&#8208;
                 mat of filenames followed by a line feed. Multiple -@ or --list
                 specifiers  will  be ignored; only the last -@ or --list option
                 will be used. The playlist is concatenated with filenames spec&#8208;
                 ified  on  the  command-line  to produce one master playlist. A
                 filename of &apos;-&apos; will cause standard  input  to  be  read  as  a
                 playlist.


       -z, --shuffle
                 Shuffle playlists and files specified on the command-line. Pro&#8208;
                 duces a randomly-sorted playlist which is then  played  through
                 once.

       -Z, --random
                 Randomise  playlists  and  files specified on the command-line.
                 Files are played through, choosing at random; this  means  that
                 random files will be played for as long as mpg321 is running.

       -v, --verbose
                 Be  more verbose. Show current byte, bytes remaining, time, and
                 time remaining, as well as more information about the mp3 file.

       -s, --stdout
                 Use standard output instead of an audio device for output. Out&#8208;
                 put is in 16-bit PCM, little-endian.

       -w N, --wav N
                 Write  to  wav  file  N instead of using the audio device. This
                 option will be preferred if --cdr or --au  are  specified  too.
                 Specifying &apos;-&apos; for N will cause the file to be written to stan&#8208;
                 dard output.

       --cdr N   Write to cdr file N instead of using the audio device. Specify&#8208;
                 ing  &apos;-&apos;  for  N  will cause the file to be written to standard
                 output.

       --au N    Write to au file N instead of using the audio device.  Specify&#8208;
                 ing  &apos;-&apos;  for  N  will cause the file to be written to standard
                 output.

       -t, --test
                 Test mode; do no output at all.


       -q, --quiet
                 Quiet mode; suppress output of mpg123 boilerplate and file  and
                 song name.


       -B        Read  recursively  the  given directories. Allows you to define
                 only the directory or directories and then  mpg321  recursively
                 plays all the songs.


       -F        Turn on FFT analysis on PCM data. Remote mode only


       -S        Report song to AudioScrobbler (last.fm).


       -x        Set xterm title setting


       -b        Number of decoded frames for the output buffer.
&#12;
       -K        Enable Basic Keys.


       -R        &quot;Remote  control&quot;  mode.  Useful for front-ends. Allows seeking
                 and   pausing   of   mp3   files.   See    README.remote    (in
                 /usr/share/doc/mpg321 on Debian and some other systems.)


       -3, --restart
                 Restart  &quot;remote  shell&quot;.  Used  only  when in &quot;Remote control&quot;
                 mode.

       --stereo  Force stereo output: duplicates mono stream  on  second  output
                 channel.  Useful  for  output for devices that don&apos;t understand
                 mono, such as some CD players.


       --aggressive
                 Aggressive mode; try to get  higher  priority  on  the  system.
                 Needs root permissions.


       --skip-printing-frames=N
                 Skip  N  frames between printing a frame status update, in both
                 Remote Control (-R) and verbose (-v) mode. Can help CPU  utili&#8208;
                 sation on slower machines. This is an mpg321-specific option.


       -l N, --loop N
                 Loop song or playlist N times.If N is 0 means infinite times.

       --help, --longhelp
                 Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
                 Show version of program.

Basic keys:
        * or /   Increase or decrease volume.

        n        Skip song.

        m        Mute/unmute.
