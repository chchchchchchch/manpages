MPOST(1)                                                                MPOST(1)



NAME
       mpost - MetaPost, a system for creating graphics

SYNOPSIS
       mpost [options] [commands]

       mpost --dvitomp dvifile[.dvi] [mpxfile[.mpx]]


DESCRIPTION
       MetaPost  interprets  the MetaPost language and produces PostScript (EPS)
       or Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) pictures.   The  MetaPost  language  is
       similar to Knuth&apos;s Metafont with additional features for including tex(1)
       or troff(1) commands and accessing features of PostScript  not  found  in
       Metafont.

       MetaPost is normally used with some preloaded macros, and it will use its
       executable name as the name of the preload file to  use.    For  example,
       when  called  as  mpost  the mpost.mp file is used, which is identical to
       plain.mp.  When the --ini option is given, preloading does not happen.

       The commands given on the command line to the MetaPost program are passed
       to  it as the first input line.  (But it is often easier to type extended
       arguments as the first input line, since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or
       misinterpret  MetaPost&apos;s  favorite  symbols,  like semicolons, unless you
       quote them.) The normal usage is to say mpost figs to  process  the  file
       figs.mp.   The  basename  of figs becomes the ``jobname&apos;&apos;, and is used in
       forming output file names.  If no file  is  named,  the  jobname  becomes
       mpout.   The  default  extension, .mp, can be overridden by specifying an
       extension explicitly.

       When the --dvitomp option is given, MetaPost acts as DVI-to-MPX converter
       only.  See dvitomp (1) for details.

       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documenta&#8208;
       tion for this version of MetaPost can be found in the  User  Manual  that
       should  have  been installed along with the program and is also available
       from http://tug.org/metapost.  See the FILES section below.

       The MetaPost language is similar to Metafont, but the manual  assumes  no
       knowledge  of Metafont.  MetaPost does not have bitmap output commands or
       Metafont&apos;s online display mechanism.

AUTHORS
       MetaPost  was  designed  by  John D. Hobby, incorporating algorithms from
       Metafont by Donald E. Knuth.  It  was  originally  implemented  on  Unix,
       incorporating  system-dependent routines from web2c, while not relying on
       it except for the actual Web-to-C translator.

       Ulrik Vieth adapted MetaPost to  take  advantage  of  the  advanced  path
       searching  features  in  more recent versions of web2c and worked towards
       fully integrating MetaPost into the canonical Unix TeX distribution.

       The current, CWEB based version of MetaPost is maintained by Taco Hoekwa&#8208;
       ter.

       The manual and tutorial are maintained by Stephan Hennig and Troy Hender&#8208;
       son.
