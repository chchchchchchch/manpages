MCHECK(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  MCHECK(3)



NAME
       mcheck,  mcheck_check_all,  mcheck_pedantic,  mprobe  -  heap consistency
       checking

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;mcheck.h&gt;

       int mcheck(void (*abortfunc)(enum mcheck_status mstatus));

       int mcheck_pedantic(void (*abortfunc)(enum mcheck_status mstatus));

       void mcheck_check_all(void);

       enum mcheck_status mprobe(void *ptr);


DESCRIPTION
       The mcheck() function installs a set of debugging hooks for the malloc(3)
       family of memory-allocation functions.  These hooks cause certain consis&#8208;
       tency checks to be performed on the state of the heap.   The  checks  can
       detect  application  errors  such  as freeing a block of memory more than
       once or corrupting the bookkeeping data structures that immediately  pre&#8208;
       cede a block of allocated memory.

       To  be  effective,  the mcheck() function must be called before the first
       call to malloc(3) or a related function.  In cases where this  is  diffi&#8208;
       cult to ensure, linking the program with -mcheck inserts an implicit call
       to mcheck() (with a NULL argument) before the first  call  to  a  memory-
       allocation function.

       The  mcheck_pedantic()  function  is  similar  to  mcheck(), but performs
       checks on all allocated blocks  whenever  one  of  the  memory-allocation
       functions is called.  This can be very slow!

       The  mcheck_check_all()  function  causes an immediate check on all allo&#8208;
       cated blocks.  This call is only effective if mcheck() is called  before&#8208;
       hand.

       If  the  system detects an inconsistency in the heap, the caller-supplied
       function pointed to by abortfunc is invoked with a single argument  argu&#8208;
       ment,  mstatus,  that  indicates what type of inconsistency was detected.
       If abortfunc is NULL, a default  function  prints  an  error  message  on
       stderr and calls abort(3).

       The  mprobe() function performs a consistency check on the block of allo&#8208;
       cated memory pointed to by ptr.  The mcheck() function should  be  called
       beforehand (otherwise mprobe() returns MCHECK_DISABLED).

       The following list describes the values returned by mprobe() or passed as
       the mstatus argument when abortfunc is invoked:

       MCHECK_DISABLED (mprobe() only)
              mcheck() was not called before the first memory  allocation  func&#8208;
              tion was called.  Consistency checking is not possible.

       MCHECK_OK (mprobe() only)
              No inconsistency detected.

       MCHECK_HEAD
              Memory preceding an allocated block was clobbered.

       MCHECK_TAIL
              Memory following an allocated block was clobbered.
&#12;       MCHECK_FREE
              A block of memory was freed twice.

RETURN VALUE
       mcheck() and mcheck_pedantic() return 0 on success, or -1 on error.

VERSIONS
       The  mcheck_pedantic()  and  mcheck_check_all()  functions  are available
       since glibc 2.2.  The mcheck() and mprobe() functions are  present  since
       at least glibc 2.0

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.

NOTES
       Linking  a  program with -lmcheck and using the MALLOC_CHECK_ environment
       variable (described in mallopt(3)) cause the same kinds of errors  to  be
       detected.   But,  using MALLOC_CHECK_ does not require the application to
       be relinked.


EXAMPLE
       The program below calls mcheck() with a NULL argument and then frees  the
       same  block  of  memory  twice.  The following shell session demonstrates
       what happens when running the program:

           $ ./a.out
           About to free

           About to free a second time
           block freed twice
           Aborted (core dumped)

   Program source

       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;mcheck.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           char *p;

           if (mcheck(NULL) != 0) {
               fprintf(stderr, &quot;mcheck() failed\n&quot;);

               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           p = malloc(1000);

           fprintf(stderr, &quot;About to free\n&quot;);
           free(p);
           fprintf(stderr, &quot;\nAbout to free a second time\n&quot;);
           free(p);

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
