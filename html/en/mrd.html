Name
       mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mrd command is used to remove an MS-DOS subdirectory. Its syntax is:

       mrd [-v] msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories... ]


       Mrd  removes  a  directory from an MS-DOS file system. An error occurs if
       the directory does not exist or is not empty.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
