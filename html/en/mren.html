Name
       mren - rename an existing MSDOS file



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mren  command  is  used to rename or move an existing MS-DOS file or
       subdirectory. Its syntax is:

       mren [-voOsSrRA] sourcefile targetfile


       Mren renames an existing file on an MS-DOS file system.

       In verbose mode, Mren displays the new filename if the name  supplied  is
       invalid.

       If  the  first  syntax  is used (only one source file), and if the target
       name doesn&apos;t contain any slashes or colons, the file (or subdirectory) is
       renamed  in the same directory, instead of being moved to the current mcd
       directory as would be the case with mmove. Unlike the MS-DOS  version  of
       REN, mren can be used to rename directories.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation. However, this process is only approximative, and  some  items,
       such  as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla&#8208;
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation  in
       the  manpage  format.   Moreover, not all information has been translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo  doc.   See  the end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A  premade  html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as  html.   Indeed,  in
       the  info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
