NAME
       msgexec - process translations of message catalog

SYNOPSIS
       msgexec [OPTION] COMMAND [COMMAND-OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Applies a command to all translations of a translation catalog.  The COM&#8208;
       MAND can be any program that reads a translation from standard input.  It
       is  invoked once for each translation.  Its output becomes msgexec&apos;s out&#8208;
       put.  msgexec&apos;s return code is the maximum return code across all invoca&#8208;
       tions.

       A special builtin command called &apos;0&apos; outputs the translation, followed by
       a null byte.  The output of &quot;msgexec 0&quot; is suitable as input  for  &quot;xargs
       -0&quot;.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

   Input file location:
       -i, --input=INPUTFILE
              input PO file

       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
              add DIRECTORY to list for input files search

       If no input file is given or if it is -, standard input is read.

   Input file syntax:
       -P, --properties-input
              input file is in Java .properties syntax

       --stringtable-input
              input file is in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings syntax

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
