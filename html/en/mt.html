MT(1)                                                                      MT(1)



NAME
       mt - control magnetic tape drive operation

SYNOPSIS
       mt  [-V]  [-f device] [--file=device] [--rsh-command=command] [--version]
       operation [count]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of mt.  mt performs the  given
       operation,  which  must  be one of the tape operations listed below, on a
       tape drive.

       The  default  tape  device  to  operate  on  is  taken  from   the   file
       /usr/include/sys/mtio.h  when  mt  is  compiled.  It can be overridden by
       giving a device file name in the environment variable TAPE or by  a  com&#8208;
       mand  line option (see below), which also overrides the environment vari&#8208;
       able.

       The device must be either a character  special  file  or  a  remote  tape
       drive.   To  use  a  tape  drive on another machine as the archive, use a
       filename that starts with `HOSTNAME:&apos;.  The hostname can be preceded by a
       username  and an `@&apos; to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that  user&apos;s  `~/.rhosts&apos;
       file).

       The  available  operations  are  listed  below.  Unique abbreviations are
       accepted.  Not all operations are available on all systems,  or  work  on
       all  types  of  tape  drives.   Some  operations optionally take a repeat
       count, which can be given after the operation name and defaults to 1.

       eof, weof
              Write count EOF marks at current position.

       fsf    Forward space count files.  The tape is positioned  on  the  first
              block of the next file.

       bsf    Backward  space  count files.  The tape is positioned on the first
              block of the next file.

       fsr    Forward space count records.

       bsr    Backward space count records.

       bsfm   Backward space count file marks.  The tape is  positioned  on  the
              beginning-of-the-tape side of the file mark.

       fsfm   Forward  space  count  file  marks.  The tape is positioned on the
              beginning-of-the-tape side of the file mark.

       asf    Absolute space to file number count.  Equivalent  to  rewind  fol&#8208;
              lowed by fsf count.

       seek   Seek to block number count.

       eom    Space  to the end of the recorded media on the tape (for appending
              files onto tapes).

       rewind Rewind the tape.

       offline, rewoffl
              Rewind the tape and, if applicable, unload the tape.
&#12;       status Print status information about the tape unit.

       retension
              Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of the reel, then  rewind
              it again.

       erase  Erase the tape.

       mt  exits  with a status of 0 if the operation succeeded, 1 if the opera&#8208;
       tion or device name given was invalid, or 2 if the operation failed.

   OPTIONS
       -f, --file=device
              Use device as the file name of the tape drive to operate  on.   To
              use  a  tape  drive on another machine, use a filename that starts
              with `HOSTNAME:&apos;.  The hostname can be preceded by a username  and
              an  `@&apos;  to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have
              permission to do so (typically an entry in that user&apos;s `~/.rhosts&apos;
              file).

       --rsh-command=command
              Notifies  mt that it should use command to communicate with remote
              devices instead of /usr/bin/ssh or /usr/bin/rsh.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of mt.
