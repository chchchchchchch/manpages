mtools(5)                            MTOOLS                            mtools(5)



Name
       mtools.conf - mtools configuration files



Description
       This  manual  page describes the configuration files for mtools. They are
       called `/etc/mtools.conf&apos; and `~/.mtoolsrc&apos;. If the  environmental  vari&#8208;
       able  MTOOLSRC  is  set, its contents is used as the filename for a third
       configuration file. These  configuration  files  describe  the  following
       items:

       *  Global configuration flags and variables

       *  Per drive flags and variables

   Location of the configuration files
       `/etc/mtools.conf&apos;  is the system-wide configuration file, and `~/.mtool&#8208;
       src&apos; is the user&apos;s private configuration file.

       On  some  systems,  the  system-wide   configuration   file   is   called
       `/etc/default/mtools.conf&apos; instead.

     General configuration file syntax
       The  configuration files is made up of sections. Each section starts with
       a keyword identifying the section followed by a colon.  Then follow vari&#8208;
       able assignments and flags. Variable assignments take the following form:
       name=value

       Flags  are  lone keywords without an equal sign and value following them.
       A section either ends at the end of the file or where  the  next  section
       begins.

       Lines  starting  with  a  hash  (#)  are comments. Newline characters are
       equivalent to whitespace (except where ending a comment). The  configura&#8208;
       tion  file  is case insensitive, except for item enclosed in quotes (such
       as filenames).

   Default values
       For most platforms, mtools contains reasonable compiled-in  defaults  for
       physical  floppy drives.  Thus, you usually don&apos;t need to bother with the
       configuration file, if all you want to do with mtools is to  access  your
       floppy drives. On the other hand, the configuration file is needed if you
       also want to use mtools to access your hard disk  partitions  and  DOSEMU
       image files.

   Global variables
       Global flags may be set to 1 or to 0.

       The following global flags are recognized:

       MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK
              If  this is set to 1, mtools skips most of its sanity checks. This
              is needed to read some Atari disks which have been made  with  the
              earlier ROMs, and which would not be recognized otherwise.

       MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY
              If  this is set to 1, mtools skips the fat size checks. Some disks
              have a bigger FAT than they really need to. These are rejected  if
              this option is not set.

       MTOOLS_LOWER_CASE
              If  this  is  set to 1, mtools displays all-upper-case short file&#8208;
              names as lowercase. This has been done to allow a  behavior  which
              is  consistent  with  older  versions  of mtools which didn&apos;t know
              about the case bits.

       MTOOLS_NO_VFAT
              If this is set to 1, mtools won&apos;t generate VFAT entries for  file&#8208;
              names  which  are  mixed-case,  but otherwise legal dos filenames.
              This is useful when working with DOS  versions  which  can&apos;t  grok
              VFAT long names, such as FreeDOS.

       MTOOLS_DOTTED_DIR
              In  a  wide directory, prints the short name with a dot instead of
              spaces separating the basename and the extension.

       MTOOLS_NAME_NUMERIC_TAIL
              If this is set to one (default), generate numeric  tails  for  all
              long  names  (~1).  If set to zero, only generate numeric tails if
              otherwise a clash would have happened.

       MTOOLS_TWENTY_FOUR_HOUR_CLOCK
              If 1, uses the European  notation  for  times  (twenty  four  hour
              clock), else uses the UK/US notation (am/pm)

       Example:  Inserting  the  following  line  into  your  configuration file
       instructs mtools to skip the sanity checks:

            MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1



       Global variables may also be set via the environment:

            export MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1



       Global string variables may be set to any value:

       MTOOLS_DATE_STRING
              The format used for printing dates of files.  By default,  is  dd-
              mm-yyyy.

   Per drive flags and variables
     General information
       Per  drive  flags and values may be described in a drive section. A drive
       section starts with drive &quot;driveletter&quot; :

       Then follow variable-value pairs and flags.

       This is a sample drive description:

            drive a:
              file=&quot;/dev/fd0&quot; use_xdf=1



     Location information
       For each drive, you need to describe where its data is physically  stored
       (image file, physical device, partition, offset).

       file   The  name  of  the  file or device holding the disk image. This is
              mandatory. The file name should be enclosed in quotes.

       partition
              Tells mtools to treat the drive as a partitioned  device,  and  to
              use  the  given  partition. Only primary partitions are accessible
              using this method, and they are numbered from 1 to 4. For  logical
              partitions,  use  the  more general offset variable. The partition
              variable is intended for removable media such  as  Syquest  disks,
              ZIP  drives,  and  magneto-optical disks. Although traditional DOS
              sees Syquest disks and  magneto-optical  disks  as  `giant  floppy
              disks&apos;  which  are  unpartitioned,  OS/2 and Windows NT treat them
              like hard disks, i.e. partitioned devices. The partition  flag  is
              also  useful DOSEMU hdimages. It is not recommended for hard disks
              for which direct access to partitions is available through  mount&#8208;
              ing.

       offset
              Describes where in the file the MS-DOS file system starts. This is
              useful for logical partitions in DOSEMU hdimages,  and  for  ATARI
              ram  disks. By default, this is zero, meaning that the file system
              starts right at the beginning of the device or file.

     Disk Geometry Configuration
       Geometry information describes the  physical  characteristics  about  the
       disk. Its has three purposes:

       formatting
              The  geometry  information  is written into the boot sector of the
              newly made disk. However,  you  may  also  describe  the  geometry
              information on the command line. See section mformat, for details.

       filtering
              On some Unixes there are device nodes which only support one phys&#8208;
              ical geometry. For instance, you might need a  different  node  to
              access  a  disk as high density or as low density. The geometry is
              compared to the actual geometry stored on the boot sector to  make
              sure  that this device node is able to correctly read the disk. If
              the geometry doesn&apos;t match, this drive entry fails, and  the  next
              drive  entry  bearing  the same drive letter is tried. See section
              multiple descriptions,  for  more  details  on  supplying  several
              descriptions for one drive letter.

              If  no geometry information is supplied in the configuration file,
              all disks are accepted. On Linux (and on SPARC) there exist device
              nodes with configurable geometry (`/dev/fd0&apos;, `/dev/fd1&apos; etc), and
              thus filtering is  not  needed  (and  ignored)  for  disk  drives.
              (Mtools  still  does  do filtering on plain files (disk images) in
              Linux: this is mainly intended for test purposes, as I don&apos;t  have
              access to a Unix which would actually need filtering).

              If  you  do  not need filtering, but want still a default geometry
              for mformatting, you may switch  off  filtering  using  the  mfor&#8208;
              mat_only flag.

              If  you want filtering, you should supply the filter flag.  If you
              supply a geometry, you must supply one of both flags.

       initial geometry
              On devices that support it (usually floppy devices), the  geometry
              information is also used to set the initial geometry. This initial
              geometry is applied while reading the boot sector, which  contains
              the  real geometry.  If no geometry information is supplied in the
              configuration file, or if the mformat_only flag  is  supplied,  no
              initial configuration is done.

              On  Linux,  initial  geometry is not really needed, as the config&#8208;
              urable devices are able to auto-detect the  disk  type  accurately
              enough (for most common formats) to read the boot sector.

       Wrong  geometry information may lead to very bizarre errors. That&apos;s why I
       strongly recommend that you add  the  mformat_only  flag  to  your  drive
       description, unless you really need filtering or initial geometry.

       The following geometry related variables are available:

       cylinders
       tracks The  number of cylinders. (cylinders is the preferred form, tracks
              is considered obsolete)

       heads  The number of heads (sides).

       sectors
              The number of sectors per track.

       Example: the following drive section describes a 1.44M drive:

            drive a:
                file=&quot;/dev/fd0H1440&quot;
                fat_bits=12
                cylinders=80 heads=2 sectors=18
                mformat_only



       The following shorthand geometry descriptions are available:

       1.44m  high density 3 1/2 disk. Equivalent to:  fat_bits=12  cylinders=80
              heads=2 sectors=18

       1.2m   high  density  5 1/4 disk. Equivalent to: fat_bits=12 cylinders=80
              heads=2 sectors=15

       720k   double density 3 1/2 disk. Equivalent to: fat_bits=12 cylinders=80
              heads=2 sectors=9

       360k   double density 5 1/4 disk. Equivalent to: fat_bits=12 cylinders=40
              heads=2 sectors=9

       The shorthand format descriptions may be amended. For example, 360k  sec&#8208;
       tors=8  describes  a  320k  disk and is equivalent to: fat_bits=12 cylin&#8208;
       ders=40 heads=2 sectors=8

     Open Flags
       Moreover, the following flags are available:

       sync   All i/o operations are done synchronously

       nodelay
              The device or file is opened  with  the  O_NDELAY  flag.  This  is
              needed on some non-Linux architectures.

       exclusive
              The  device or file is opened with the O_EXCL flag. On Linux, this
              ensures exclusive access to the floppy drive. On most other archi&#8208;
              tectures, and for plain files it has no effect at all.

     General Purpose Drive Variables
       The  following  general purpose drive variables are available.  Depending
       to their type, these variables can be set to  a  string  (precmd)  or  an
       integer (all others)

       fat_bits
              The  number of FAT bits. This may be 12 or 16. This is very rarely
              needed, as it can almost always be deduced from information in the
              boot  sector.  On  the contrary, describing the number of fat bits
              may actually be harmful if you get it wrong. You should  only  use
              it  if  mtools gets the auto-detected number of fat bits wrong, or
              if you want to mformat a disk with a weird number of fat bits.

       codepage
              Describes the DOS code page used for short filenames.  This  is  a
              number  between  1 and 999. By default, code page 850 is used. The
              reason for this is because this code page  contains  most  of  the
              characters  that  are  also available in ISO-Latin-1. You may also
              specify a global code page for all  drives  by  using  the  global
              default_codepage  parameter  (outside  of  any drive description).
              This parameters exists starting at version 4.0.0
&#12;       precmd
              On some variants of Solaris, it is necessary to call &apos;volcheck -v&apos;
              before  opening a floppy device, in order for the system to notice
              that there is indeed a disk in the drive. precmd=&quot;volcheck -v&quot;  in
              the drive clause establishes the desired behavior.

       blocksize
              This  parameter  represents a default block size to be always used
              on this device.  All I/O is done  with  multiples  of  this  block
              size, independently of the sector size registered in the file sys&#8208;
              tem&apos;s boot sector.  This is useful  for  character  devices  whose
              sector  size  is  not  512,  such  as for example CD-ROM drives on
              Solaris.

       Only the file variable is mandatory. The other  parameters  may  be  left
       out. In that case a default value or an auto-detected value is used.

     General Purpose Drive Flags
       A  flag can either be set to 1 (enabled) or 0 (disabled). If the value is
       omitted, it is enabled.  For example, scsi is equivalent to scsi=1

       nolock
              Instruct mtools to not use locking on this drive.  This is  needed
              on  systems  with buggy locking semantics.  However, enabling this
              makes operation less safe in cases where several users may  access
              the same drive at the same time.

       scsi   When  set  to  1,  this  option  tells  mtools to use raw SCSI I/O
              instead of the standard read/write calls  to  access  the  device.
              Currently, this is supported on HP-UX, Solaris and SunOS.  This is
              needed because on some architectures, such as SunOS or Solaris, PC
              media  can&apos;t  be  accessed  using the read and write system calls,
              because the OS expects  them  to  contain  a  Sun  specific  &quot;disk
              label&quot;.

              As raw SCSI access always uses the whole device, you need to spec&#8208;
              ify the &quot;partition&quot; flag in addition

              On some architectures, such as Solaris, mtools needs  root  privi&#8208;
              leges  to  be  able to use the scsi option.  Thus mtools should be
              installed setuid root on Solaris if you  want  to  access  Zip/Jaz
              drives.   Thus, if the scsi flag is given, privileged is automati&#8208;
              cally implied, unless explicitly disabled by privileged=0

              Mtools uses its root privileges to open the device, and  to  issue
              the  actual  SCSI  I/O  calls.  Moreover, root privileges are only
              used for drives described in a system-wide configuration file such
              as  `/etc/mtools.conf&apos;,  and not for those described in `~/.mtool&#8208;
              src&apos; or `$MTOOLSRC&apos;.

       privileged
              When set to 1, this instructs mtools to use its setuid and  setgid
              privileges for opening the given drive.  This option is only valid
              for drives described in the system-wide configuration files  (such
              as  `/etc/mtools.conf&apos;,  not `~/.mtoolsrc&apos; or `$MTOOLSRC&apos;).  Obvi&#8208;
              ously, this option is also a no op  if  mtools  is  not  installed
              setuid  or  setgid.  This option is implied by &apos;scsi=1&apos;, but again
              only for drives defined in system-wide configuration files.  Priv&#8208;
              ileged  may  also  be set explicitly to 0, in order to tell mtools
              not to use its privileges for a given drive even if scsi=1 is set.

              Mtools only needs to be installed setuid if you use the privileged
              or  scsi drive variables.  If you do not use these options, mtools
              works perfectly well even when not installed setuid root.

       vold

              Instructs mtools to interpret the device name as a vold identifier
              rather than as a filename.  The vold identifier is translated into
              a real filename using the media_findname() and  media_oldaliases()
              functions  of  the volmgt library.  This flag is only available if
              you configured mtools with  the  --enable-new-vold  option  before
              compilation.

       swap

              Consider the media as a word-swapped Atari disk.

       use_xdf
              If  this  is  set to a non-zero value, mtools also tries to access
              this disk as an XDF disk. XDF is a high capacity  format  used  by
              OS/2. This is off by default. See section XDF, for more details.

       mformat_only
              Tells  mtools to use the geometry for this drive only for mformat&#8208;
              ting and not for filtering.

       filter
              Tells mtools to use the geometry for this drive both for  mformat&#8208;
              ting and filtering.

       remote
              Tells mtools to connect to floppyd (see section  floppyd).

     Supplying multiple descriptions for a drive
       It is possible to supply multiple descriptions for a drive. In that case,
       the descriptions are tried  in  order  until  one  is  found  that  fits.
       Descriptions may fail for several reasons:

       1.     because the geometry is not appropriate,

       2.     because there is no disk in the drive,

       3.     or because of other problems.

       Multiple  definitions  are  useful  when using physical devices which are
       only able to support one single disk geometry.  Example:

            drive a: file=&quot;/dev/fd0H1440&quot; 1.44m
            drive a: file=&quot;/dev/fd0H720&quot; 720k



       This instructs mtools to use /dev/fd0H1440 for 1.44m (high density) disks
       and  /dev/fd0H720 for 720k (double density) disks. On Linux, this feature
       is not really needed, as the /dev/fd0 device is able to handle any geome&#8208;
       try.

       You may also use multiple drive descriptions to access both of your phys&#8208;
       ical drives through one drive letter:

            drive z: file=&quot;/dev/fd0&quot;
            drive z: file=&quot;/dev/fd1&quot;



       With this description, mdir z: accesses your first physical drive  if  it
       contains a disk. If the first drive doesn&apos;t contain a disk, mtools checks
       the second drive.

       When using multiple configuration files, drive descriptions in the  files
       parsed last override descriptions for the same drive in earlier files. In
       order to avoid this, use the drive+ or +drive keywords instead of  drive.
       The  first  adds  a  description  to the end of the list (i.e. it will be
       tried last), and the first adds it to the start of the list.

   Location of configuration files and parsing order
       The configuration files are parsed in the following order:

       1.     compiled-in defaults
&#12;       2.     `/etc/mtools.conf&apos;

       3.     `~/.mtoolsrc&apos;.

       4.     `$MTOOLSRC&apos; (file pointed by the MTOOLSRC environmental variable)

       Options described in the later files override those described in the ear&#8208;
       lier files. Drives defined in earlier files persist if they are not over&#8208;
       ridden in the later files. For instance, drives A and B may be defined in
       `/etc/mtools.conf&apos;  and  drives  C  and D may be defined in `~/.mtoolsrc&apos;
       However, if `~/.mtoolsrc&apos; also defines  drive  A,  this  new  description
       would  override  the description of drive A in `/etc/mtools.conf&apos; instead
       of adding to it. If you want to add a new description to a drive  already
       described in an earlier file, you need to use either the +drive or drive+

   Backwards compatibility with old configuration file syntax
       The syntax described herein is new for version mtools-3.0. The old  line-
       oriented  syntax  is  still  supported. Each line beginning with a single
       letter is considered to be a drive description using the old syntax.  Old
       style  and new style drive sections may be mixed within the same configu&#8208;
       ration file, in order to make upgrading easier. Support for the old  syn&#8208;
       tax  will be phased out eventually, and in order to discourage its use, I
       purposefully omit its description here.
