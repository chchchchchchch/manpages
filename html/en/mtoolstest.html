mtoolstest(1)                                                      mtoolstest(1)



Name
       mtoolstest - tests and displays the configuration



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mtoolstest  command is used to tests the mtools configuration files.
       To invoke it, just type mtoolstest  without  any  arguments.   Mtoolstest
       reads  the mtools configuration files, and prints the cumulative configu&#8208;
       ration to stdout. The output can be used as a configuration  file  itself
       (although  you might want to remove redundant clauses).  You may use this
       program to convert old-style configuration files into new style  configu&#8208;
       ration files.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation. However, this process is only approximative, and  some  items,
       such  as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla&#8208;
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation  in
       the  manpage  format.   Moreover, not all information has been translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo  doc.   See  the end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A  premade  html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as  html.   Indeed,  in
       the  info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
