NAME
       mtr - a network diagnostic tool



SYNOPSIS
       mtr  [-hvrctglspeniu46]  [--help]  [--version] [--report] [--report-wide]
       [--report-cycles COUNT] [--curses] [--split] [--raw] [--mpls]  [--no-dns]
       [--gtk] [--address IP.ADD.RE.SS] [--interval SECONDS] [--psize BYTES | -s
       BYTES] HOSTNAME [PACKETSIZE]



DESCRIPTION
       mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs  in  a
       single network diagnostic tool.


       As  mtr  starts,  it investigates the network connection between the host
       mtr runs on and HOSTNAME.  by sending packets with purposly low TTLs.  It
       continues  to  send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the
       intervening routers.  This allows mtr to print  the  response  percentage
       and  response times of the internet route to HOSTNAME.  A sudden increase
       in packetloss or response time is often an indication of a bad (or simply
       overloaded) link.


OPTIONS
       -h

       --help
              Print the summary of command line argument options.


       -v

       --version
              Print the installed version of mtr.


       -r

       --report
              This  option  puts  mtr  into report mode.  When in this mode, mtr
              will run for the number of cycles specified by the -c option,  and
              then print statistics and exit.

              This  mode is useful for generating statistics about network qual&#8208;
              ity.  Note that each running instance of mtr generates a  signifi&#8208;
              cant  amount of network traffic.  Using mtr to measure the quality
              of your network may result in decreased network performance.


       -w

       --report-wide
              This option puts mtr into wide report mode.  When  in  this  mode,
              mtr will not cut hostnames in the report.


       -c COUNT

       --report-cycles COUNT
              Use  this option to set the number of pings sent to determine both
              the machines on the network and the reliability of those machines.
              Each cycle lasts one second.


       -s BYTES

       --psize BYTES

       PACKETSIZE
              These options or a trailing PACKETSIZE on the commandline sets the
              packet size used for probing.  It is in  bytes  inclusive  IP  and
              ICMP headers

              If set to a negative number, every iteration will use a different,
              random packetsize upto that number.

       -t

       --curses
              Use this option to force mtr to  use  the  curses  based  terminal
              interface (if available).


       -e

       --mpls
              Use  this  option  to  tell  mtr  to display information from ICMP
              extensions for MPLS (RFC 4950) that are encoded  in  the  response
              packets.


       -n

       --no-dns
              Use this option to force mtr to display numeric IP numbers and not
              try to resolve the host names.


       -o fields order

       --order fields order
              Use this option to specify the fields and their order when loading
              mtr.
              Example: -o &quot;LSD NBAW&quot;


       -g

       --gtk
              Use  this  option  to  force  mtr to use the GTK+ based X11 window
              interface (if available).  GTK+ must have been  available  on  the
              system when mtr was built for this to work.  See the GTK+ web page
              at http://www.gimp.org/gtk/ for more information about GTK+.


       -p

       --split
              Use this option to set mtr to spit out a format that  is  suitable
              for a split-user interface.


       -l

       --raw
              Use  this  option  to  tell mtr to use the raw output format. This
              format is better suited for archival of the  measurement  results.
              It  could  be parsed to be presented into any of the other display
              methods.
&#12;
       -a IP.ADD.RE.SS

       --address IP.ADD.RE.SS
              Use this option to  bind  outgoing  packets&apos;  socket  to  specific
              interface, so that any packet will be sent through this interface.
              NOTE that this option doesn&apos;t apply to DNS requests  (which  could
              be and could not be what you want).


       -i SECONDS

       --interval SECONDS
              Use  this option to specify the positive number of seconds between
              ICMP ECHO requests.  The default value for this parameter  is  one
              second.


       -u
              Use UDP datagrams instead of ICMP ECHO.


       -4
              Use IPv4 only.


       -6
              Use IPv6 only.


BUGS
       Some  modern  routers  give a lower priority to ICMP ECHO packets than to
       other network traffic.  Consequently, the reliability  of  these  routers
       reported  by  mtr will be significantly lower than the actual reliability
       of these routers.
