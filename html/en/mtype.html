mtype(1)                                                                mtype(1)



Name
       mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The mtype command is used to display contents of an MS-DOS file. Its syn&#8208;
       tax is:

       mtype [-ts] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ]


       Mtype displays the specified MS-DOS file on the screen.

       In addition to the standard options, Mtype allows the  following  command
       line options:

       t      Text file viewing.  Mtype translates incoming carriage return/line
              feeds to line feeds.

       s      Mtype strips the high bit from the data.

       The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the current work&#8208;
       ing directory (relative to MS-DOS), otherwise the default is A:/.

       Mtype returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on partial failure.

       Unlike the MS-DOS version of TYPE, mtype allows multiple arguments.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation. However, this process is only approximative, and  some  items,
       such  as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla&#8208;
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation  in
       the  manpage  format.   Moreover, not all information has been translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo  doc.   See  the end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A  premade  html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:
&#12;                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as  html.   Indeed,  in
       the  info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
