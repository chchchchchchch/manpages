NAME
       mutt_dotlock - Lock mail spool files.

SYNOPSIS
       mutt_dotlock [-t|-f|-u|-d] [-p] [-r retries] file

DESCRIPTION
       mutt_dotlock  implements  the traditional mail spool file locking method:
       To lock file, a file named file.lock is  created.  The  program  operates
       with group mail privileges if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -t     Just try.  mutt_dotlock won&apos;t actually lock a file, but inform the
              invoking process if it&apos;s at all possible to lock file.

       -f     Force the lock.  If another process holds a lock  on  file  longer
              than  a  certain amount of time, mutt_dotlock will break that lock
              by removing the lockfile.

       -u     Unlock.  mutt_dotlock will remove file.lock.

       -d     Delete.  mutt_dotlock will lock file, remove it if it  has  length
              0, and afterwards remove file.lock.

       -p     Use  privileges.   If given this option, mutt_dotlock will operate
              with group mail privileges when creating and deleting lock files.

       -r retries
              This command line option tells mutt_dotlock to try locking retries
              times  before  giving  up  or (if invoked with the -f command line
              option) break a lock.  The default value is 5.  mutt_dotlock waits
              one second between successive locking attempts.

FILES
       file.lock
              The lock file mutt_dotlock generates.

SEE ALSO

DIAGNOSTICS
       mutt_dotlock gives all diagnostics in its return values:

       0 - DL_EX_OK
              The program was successful.

       1 - DL_EX_ERROR
              An  unspecified error such as bad command line parameters, lack of
              system memory and the like has occured.

       3 - DL_EX_EXIST
              The user wants to lock a file which has  been  locked  by  another
              process  already.   If mutt_dotlock is invoked with the -f command
              line option, mutt_dotlock won&apos;t generate  this  error,  but  break
              other processes&apos; locks.

       4 - DL_EX_NEED_RPIVS
              This  return  value  only  occurs if mutt_dotlock has been invoked
              with the -t command line option.  It means that mutt_dotlock  will
              have to use its group mail privileges to lock file.

       5 - DL_EX_IMPOSSIBLE
              This  return  value  only  occurs if mutt_dotlock has been invoked
              with the -t command line option.  It means  that  mutt_dotlock  is
              unable to lock file even with group mail privileges.

NOTES
       mutt_dotlock  tries  to implement an NFS-safe dotlocking method which was
       borrowed from lockfile (1).

       If the user can&apos;t open file  for  reading  with  his  normal  privileges,
       mutt_dotlock  will  return  the  DL_EX_ERROR  exit value to avoid certain
       attacks against other users&apos; spool files. The code carefully avoids  race
       conditions  when  checking  permissions;  for details of all this see the
       comments in dotlock.c.

HISTORY
       mutt_dotlock is part of the Mutt mail user agent package.   It  has  been
       created to avoid running mutt with group mail privileges.
