NAME
       muttrc - Configuration file for the Mutt Mail User Agent

DESCRIPTION
       A  mutt configuration file consists of a series of &#8220;commands&#8221;.  Each line
       of the file may contain one or more commands.  When multiple commands are
       used, they must be separated by a semicolon (&#8220;;&#8221;).

       The hash mark, or pound sign (&#8220;#&#8221;), is used as a &#8220;comment&#8221; character. You
       can use it to annotate your initialization file. All text after the  com&#8208;
       ment character to the end of the line is ignored.

       Single  quotes (&#8220;&apos;&#8221;) and double quotes (&#8220;&quot;&#8221;) can be used to quote strings
       which contain spaces or other special characters.  The difference between
       the  two  types  of  quotes is similar to that of many popular shell pro&#8208;
       grams, namely that a single quote is used to  specify  a  literal  string
       (one  that is not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with a back&#8208;
       slash [see next paragraph]), while double quotes indicate a string  which
       should be evaluated.  For example, backticks are evaluated inside of dou&#8208;
       ble quotes, but not single quotes.

       \ quotes the next character, just as in shells such as bash and zsh.  For
       example,  if want to put quotes (&#8220;&quot;&#8221;) inside of a string, you can use &#8220;\&#8221;
       to force the next character to be a literal instead of interpreted  char&#8208;
       acter.

       &#8220;\\&#8221;  means  to  insert  a literal &#8220;\&#8221; into the line.  &#8220;\n&#8221; and &#8220;\r&#8221; have
       their usual C meanings of linefeed and carriage-return, respectively.

       A &#8220;\&#8221; at the end of a line can be used to split  commands  over  multiple
       lines,  provided that the split points don&apos;t appear in the middle of com&#8208;
       mand names.

       It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an ini&#8208;
       tialization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command in back&#8208;
       ticks (`command`).

       UNIX environment variables can be accessed like the way  it  is  done  in
       shells  like  sh  and  bash: Prepend the name of the variable by a dollar
       (&#8220;$&#8221;) sign.

COMMANDS
       alias [-group name [...]] key address [, address [ ... ]]
       unalias [ *  | key ]

              alias defines an alias key for the given addresses.  Each  address
              will  be  resolved into either an email address (user@example.com)
              or a named  email  address  (User  Name  &lt;user@example.com&gt;).  The
              address  may  be  specified  in  either  format,  or in the format
              &#8220;user@example.com (User Name)&#8221;.  unalias removes the alias  corre&#8208;
              sponding  to  the  given key or all aliases when &#8220;*&#8221; is used as an
              argument. The optional -group argument to alias causes the aliased
              address(es) to be added to the named group.

       group [-group name] [-rx EXPR [ ... ]] [-addr address [ ... ]]
       ungroup [-group name ] [ * | [[-rx EXPR [ ... ]] [-addr address [ ... ]]]

              group  is used to directly add either addresses or regular expres&#8208;
              sions to the specified group or groups. The  different  categories
              of  arguments  to the group command can be in any order. The flags
              -rx and -addr specify what  the  following  strings  (that  cannot
              begin  with  a  hyphen) should be interpreted as: either a regular
              expression or an email address, respectively.  ungroup is used  to
              remove  addresses  or regular expressions from the specified group
              or groups. The syntax is similar to the group command, however the
              special  character  *  can  be used to empty a group of all of its
              contents.

              These address groups can also be created implicitly by the  alias,
              lists,   subscribe  and  alternates  commands  by  specifying  the
              optional -group option.

              Once defined, these address groups can  be  used  in  patterns  to
              search for and limit the display to messages matching a group.

       alternates [-group name] regexp [ regexp [ ... ]]
       unalternates [ *  | regexp [ regexp [ ... ]] ]

              alternates  is used to inform mutt about alternate addresses where
              you receive mail; you  can  use  regular  expressions  to  specify
              alternate addresses.  This affects mutt&apos;s idea about messages from
              you, and messages addressed to you.  unalternates removes a  regu&#8208;
              lar  expression from the list of known alternates. The -group flag
              causes all of the subsequent regular expressions to  be  added  to
              the named group.

       alternative_order type[/subtype] [ ... ]
       unalternative_order [ *  | type/subtype] [...]

              alternative_order  command permits you to define an order of pref&#8208;
              erence which is used by mutt to determine which part of  a  multi&#8208;
              part/alternative  body  to  display.  A subtype of &#8220;*&#8221; matches any
              subtype, as does an empty subtype.    unalternative_order  removes
              entries  from the ordered list or deletes the entire list when &#8220;*&#8221;
              is used as an argument.

       auto_view type[/subtype] [ ... ]
       unauto_view type[/subtype] [ ... ]

              This commands permits you to specify that  mutt  should  automati&#8208;
              cally  convert  the given MIME types to text/plain when displaying
              messages.  For this to work, there must be a mailcap(5) entry  for
              the given MIME type with the copiousoutput flag set.  A subtype of
              &#8220;*&#8221; matches any subtype, as does an empty subtype.

       mime_lookup type[/subtype] [ ... ]
       unmime_lookup type[/subtype] [ ... ]

              This command permits you to define a list of &quot;data&quot;  MIME  content
              types  for  which  mutt will try to determine the actual file type
              from the file name, and not use a mailcap(5) entry given  for  the
              original  MIME  type.   For  instance,  you  may  add the applica&#8208;
              tion/octet-stream MIME type to this list.

       bind map1,map2,... key function
              This command binds the given key for the given map or maps to  the
              given  function. Multiple maps may be specified by separating them
              with commas (no whitespace is allowed).

              Valid maps are: generic, alias, attach,  browser,  editor,  index,
              compose, pager, pgp, postpone, mix.

              For  more  information  on  keys and functions, please consult the
              Mutt Manual. Note that the function name is to be specified  with&#8208;
              out angle brackets.

       account-hook [!]regexp command
              This hook is executed whenever you access a remote mailbox. Useful
              to adjust configuration settings to different IMAP or POP servers.

       charset-hook alias charset
              This command defines an alias for a character set.  This is useful
              to properly display messages which are tagged with a character set
              name not known to mutt.

       iconv-hook charset local-charset
              This command defines a system-specific name for a  character  set.
              This is useful when your system&apos;s iconv(3) implementation does not
              understand MIME character set  names  (such  as  iso-8859-1),  but
              instead  insists on being fed with implementation-specific charac&#8208;
              ter set names (such as 8859-1).  In this specific case, you&apos;d  put
              this into your configuration file:

              iconv-hook iso-8859-1 8859-1

       message-hook [!]pattern command
              Before  mutt  displays  (or  formats for replying or forwarding) a
              message which matches the given pattern (or, when it  is  preceded
              by  an  exclamation  mark,  does not match the pattern), the given
              command is executed.  When multiple message-hooks match, they  are
              executed   in   the order in which they occur in the configuration
              file.

       folder-hook [!]regexp command
              When mutt enters a folder which matches regexp (or, when regexp is
              preceded by an exclamation mark, does not match regexp), the given
              command is executed.

              When several folder-hooks match a given mail folder, they are exe&#8208;
              cuted in the order given in the configuration file.

       macro map key sequence [ description ]
              This  command binds the given sequence of keys to the given key in
              the given map or maps.  For valid maps, see bind. To specify  mul&#8208;
              tiple maps, put only a comma between the maps.

       color object foreground background [  regexp ]
       color index foreground background [  pattern ]
       uncolor index pattern [ pattern ... ]

              If  your  terminal  supports  color, these commands can be used to
              assign  foreground/background  combinations  to  certain  objects.
              Valid  objects  are:  attachment,  body, bold, header, hdrdefault,
              index,  indicator,  markers,  message,  normal,  quoted,  quotedN,
              search,  signature,  status, tilde, tree, underline.  The body and
              header objects allow you to restrict the colorization to a regular
              expression.   The  index object permits you to select colored mes&#8208;
              sages by pattern.

              Valid colors include: white, black, green,  magenta,  blue,  cyan,
              yellow, red, default, colorN.

       mono object attribute [ regexp ]
       mono index attribute [ pattern ]

              For  terminals  which  don&apos;t  support  color, you can still assign
              attributes to objects.   Valid  attributes  include:  none,  bold,
              underline, reverse, and standout.

       [un]ignore pattern [ pattern ... ]
              The  ignore command permits you to specify header fields which you
              usually don&apos;t wish to see.  Any header field whose tag begins with
              an &#8220;ignored&#8221; pattern will be ignored.

              The  unignore  command  permits  you to define exceptions from the
              above mentioned list of ignored headers.

       lists [-group name] regexp [ regexp ... ]
       unlists regexp [ regexp ... ]
       subscribe [-group name] regexp [ regexp ... ]
       unsubscribe regexp [ regexp ... ]

              Mutt maintains two lists of mailing list address patterns, a  list
              of  subscribed  mailing  lists, and a list of known mailing lists.
              All subscribed mailing lists  are  known.   Patterns  use  regular
              expressions.

              The lists command adds a mailing list address to the list of known
              mailing lists.  The unlists command removes a  mailing  list  from
              the  lists  of  known and subscribed mailing lists.  The subscribe
              command adds a mailing list to the lists of known  and  subscribed
              mailing  lists.   The unsubscribe command removes it from the list
              of subscribed mailing lists. The -group flag adds all of the  sub&#8208;
              sequent regular expressions to the named group.

       mbox-hook [!]pattern mailbox
              When  mutt changes to a mail folder which matches pattern, mailbox
              will be used as the &#8220;mbox&#8221; folder, i.e.,  read  messages  will  be
              moved to that folder when the mail folder is left.

              The first matching mbox-hook applies.

       mailboxes filename [ filename ... ]
       unmailboxes [ * | filename ... ]

              The  mailboxes  specifies folders which can receive mail and which
              will be checked for new messages.  When changing folders, pressing
              space  will  cycle through folders with new mail.  The unmailboxes
              command is used to remove a file name from  the  list  of  folders
              which can receive mail.  If &quot;*&quot; is specified as the file name, the
              list is emptied.

       my_hdr string
       unmy_hdr field

              Using my_hdr, you can define headers which will be  added  to  the
              messages you compose.  unmy_hdr will remove the given user-defined
              headers.

       hdr_order header1 header2 [ ... ]
              With this command, you can specify an order  in  which  mutt  will
              attempt to present headers to you when viewing messages.

       save-hook [!]pattern filename
              When  a message matches pattern, the default file name when saving
              it will be the given filename.

       fcc-hook [!]pattern filename
              When an outgoing message matches pattern, the  default  file  name
              for storing a copy (fcc) will be the given filename.

       fcc-save-hook [!]pattern filename
              This  command  is an abbreviation for identical fcc-hook and save-
              hook commands.

       send-hook [!]pattern command
              When composing a message matching pattern,  command  is  executed.
              When  multiple send-hooks match, they are executed in the order in
              which they occur in the configuration file.

       send2-hook [!]pattern command
              Whenever a message matching pattern is changed (either by  editing
              it or by using the compose menu), command is executed. When multi&#8208;
              ple send2-hooks match, they are executed in  the  order  in  which
              they  occur  in  the  configuration  file.   Possible applications
              include setting the  $sendmail  variable  when  a  message&apos;s  from
              header is changed.

              send2-hook execution is not triggered by use of enter-command from
              the compose menu.

       reply-hook [!]pattern command
              When replying to a message matching pattern, command is  executed.
              When multiple reply-hooks match, they are executed in the order in
              which they occur in the configuration file,  but  all  reply-hooks
              are  matched  and  executed before send-hooks, regardless of their
              order in the configuration file.

       crypt-hook pattern key-id
              The crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can  specify
              the  ID of the public key to be used when encrypting messages to a
              certain recipient.  The  meaning  of  &quot;key  ID&quot;  is  to  be  taken
              broadly:  This  can be a different e-mail address, a numerical key
              ID, or even just an arbitrary search string.

       open-hook regexp &quot;command&quot;
       close-hook regexp &quot;command&quot;
       append-hook regexp &quot;command&quot;

              These commands provide a way to  handle  compressed  folders.  The
              given regexp specifies which folders are taken as compressed (e.g.
              &quot;\\.gz$&quot;). The commands tell  Mutt  how  to  uncompress  a  folder
              (open-hook), compress a folder (close-hook) or append a compressed
              mail to a compressed folder (append-hook). The command  string  is
              the printf(3) like format string, and it should accept two parame&#8208;
              ters: %f, which is replaced with the (compressed) folder name, and
              %t  which  is  replaced  with  the name of the temporary folder to
              which to write.

       push string
              This command adds the named string to the keyboard buffer.

       set [no|inv|&amp;|?]variable[=value] [ ... ]
       toggle variable [ ... ]
       unset variable [ ... ]
       reset variable [ ... ]

              These commands are used to set and manipulate configuration  vari&#8208;
              ables.

              Mutt  knows four basic types of variables: boolean, number, string
              and quadoption.   Boolean  variables  can  be  set  (true),  unset
              (false),  or  toggled. Number variables can be assigned a positive
              integer value.

              String variables consist of any number  of  printable  characters.
              Strings must be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or tabs.
              You may also use the &#8220;C&#8221; escape sequences \n and  \t  for  newline
              and tab, respectively.

              Quadoption  variables  are  used  to  control whether or not to be
              prompted for certain actions, or to specify a default  action.   A
              value of yes will cause the action to be carried out automatically
              as if you had answered yes to the question.  Similarly, a value of
              no  will  cause  the  the  action  to be carried out as if you had
              answered &#8220;no.&#8221; A value of ask-yes  will  cause  a  prompt  with  a
              default  answer  of &#8220;yes&#8221; and ask-no will provide a default answer
              of &#8220;no.&#8221;

              The reset command resets all given variables to the  compile  time
              defaults.   If  you  reset the special variable all, all variables
              will reset to their compile time defaults.

       source filename
              The given file will be evaluated as a configuration file.

       spam pattern format
              nospam pattern
              These commands define spam-detection patterns from  external  spam
              filters, so that mutt can sort, limit, and search on ``spam tags&apos;&apos;
              or ``spam attributes&apos;&apos;, or display them in the index. See the Mutt
              manual for details.

       unhook [ *  | hook-type ]
              This  command  will remove all hooks of a given type, or all hooks
              when &#8220;*&#8221; is used as an argument.  hook-type  can  be  any  of  the
              -hook commands documented above.

PATTERNS
       In  various  places with mutt, including some of the above mentioned hook
       commands, you can specify patterns to match messages.

   Constructing Patterns
       A simple pattern consists of an operator of the form &#8220;~character&#8221;, possi&#8208;
       bly  followed  by a parameter against which mutt is supposed to match the
       object specified by this operator.  For some characters,  the  ~  may  be
       replaced  by another character to alter the behavior of the match.  These
       are described in the list of operators, below.

       With some of these operators, the object to be matched consists  of  sev&#8208;
       eral e-mail addresses.  In these cases, the object is matched if at least
       one of these e-mail addresses matches. You can prepend a hat (&#8220;^&#8221;)  char&#8208;
       acter  to  such  a  pattern  to indicate that all addresses must match in
       order to match the object.

       You can construct complex patterns by combining simple patterns with log&#8208;
       ical  operators.   Logical  AND  is specified by simply concatenating two
       simple patterns, for instance &#8220;~C mutt-dev ~s bug&#8221;.  Logical OR is speci&#8208;
       fied by inserting a vertical bar (&#8220;|&#8221;) between two patterns, for instance
       &#8220;~C mutt-dev | ~s bug&#8221;.   Additionally,  you  can  negate  a  pattern  by
       prepending  a  bang  (&#8220;!&#8221;)  character.   For logical grouping, use braces
       (&#8220;()&#8221;). Example: &#8220;!(~t mutt|~c mutt) ~f elkins&#8221;.

   Simple Patterns
       Mutt understands the following simple patterns:

       ~A          all messages
       ~b EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the message body.
       =b STRING   messages which contain STRING in the message body. If IMAP is
                   enabled, searches for STRING on the server, rather than down&#8208;
                   loading each message and searching it locally.
       ~B EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the whole message.
       ~c EXPR     messages carbon-copied to EXPR
       %c GROUP    messages carbon-copied to any member of GROUP
       ~C EXPR     messages either to: or cc: EXPR
       %C GROUP    messages either to: or cc: to any member of GROUP
       ~d MIN-MAX  messages with &#8220;date-sent&#8221; in a Date range
       ~D          deleted messages
       ~e EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the &#8220;Sender&#8221; field
       %e GROUP    messages which contain a member  of  GROUP  in  the  &#8220;Sender&#8221;
                   field
       ~E          expired messages
       ~f EXPR     messages originating from EXPR
       %f GROUP    messages originating from any member of GROUP
       ~F          flagged messages
       ~g          PGP signed messages
       ~G          PGP encrypted messages
       ~h EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the message header
       ~H EXPR     messages with spam tags matching EXPR
       ~i EXPR     messages which match EXPR in the &#8220;Message-ID&#8221; field
       ~k          messages containing PGP key material
       ~l          messages addressed to a known mailing list (defined by either
                   subscribe or list)
       ~L EXPR     messages either originated or received by EXPR
       %L GROUP    messages either originated or received by any member of GROUP
       ~m MIN-MAX  message in the range MIN to MAX
       ~n MIN-MAX  messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX
       ~N          new messages
       ~O          old messages
       ~p          messages addressed to you (as defined by alternates)
       ~P          messages from you (as defined by alternates)
       ~Q          messages which have been replied to
       ~r MIN-MAX  messages with &#8220;date-received&#8221; in a Date range
       ~R          read messages
       ~s EXPR     messages having EXPR in the &#8220;Subject&#8221; field.
       ~S          superseded messages
       ~t EXPR     messages addressed to EXPR
       ~T          tagged messages
       ~u          messages addressed to a subscribed mailing list  (defined  by
                   subscribe commands)
       ~U          unread messages
       ~v          message is part of a collapsed thread.
       ~V          cryptographically verified messages
       ~x EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the &#8220;References&#8221; or &#8220;In-Reply-
                   To&#8221; field
       ~X MIN-MAX  messages with MIN - MAX attachments
       ~y EXPR     messages which contain EXPR in the &#8220;X-Label&#8221; field
       ~z MIN-MAX  messages with a size in the range MIN to MAX
       ~=          duplicated messages (see $duplicate_threads)
       ~$          unreferenced message (requires threaded view)
       ~(PATTERN)  messages in threads containing messages  matching  a  certain
                   pattern, e.g. all threads containing messages from you: ~(~P)

       In the above, EXPR is a regular expression.

       With  the  ~d,  ~m,  ~n,  ~r,  ~X, and ~z operators, you can also specify
       ranges in the forms &lt;MAX, &gt;MIN, MIN-, and -MAX.

       With the ~z operator, the suffixes &#8220;K&#8221; and &#8220;M&#8221;  are  allowed  to  specify
       kilobyte and megabyte respectively.

   Matching dates
       The  ~d  and ~r operators are used to match date ranges, which are inter&#8208;
       preted to be given in your local time zone.

       A date is of the  form  DD[/MM[/[cc]YY]],  that  is,  a  two-digit  date,
       optionally  followed  by a two-digit month, optionally followed by a year
       specifications.  Omitted fields default to the current month and year.

       Mutt understands either two or  four  digit  year  specifications.   When
       given  a two-digit year, mutt will interpret values less than 70 as lying
       in the 21st century (i.e., &#8220;38&#8221; means 2038 and  not  1938,  and  &#8220;00&#8221;  is
       interpreted  as 2000), and values greater than or equal to 70 as lying in
       the 20th century.

       Note that this behavior is Y2K compliant,  but  that  mutt  does  have  a
       Y2.07K problem.

       If  a date range consists of a single date, the operator in question will
       match that precise date.  If the date range consists  of  a  dash  (&#8220;-&#8221;),
       followed  by  a date, this range will match any date before and up to the
       date given.  Similarly, a date followed by a dash matches the date  given
       and  any  later point of time.  Two dates, separated by a dash, match any
       date which lies in the given range of time.

       You can also modify any absolute date by giving an error range.  An error
       range  consists  of one of the characters +, -, *, followed by a positive
       number, followed by one of the unit characters y, m, w, or d,  specifying
       a  unit  of  years, months, weeks, or days.  + increases the maximum date
       matched by the given interval of  time,  -  decreases  the  minimum  date
       matched  by  the given interval of time, and * increases the maximum date
       and decreases the minimum date matched by the given interval of time.  It
       is  possible  to  give  multiple error margins, which cumulate.  Example:
       1/1/2001-1w+2w*3d
&#12;       You can also specify offsets relative to the current date.  An offset  is
       specified  as  one of the characters &lt;, &gt;, =, followed by a positive num&#8208;
       ber, followed by one of the unit characters y, m, w,  or  d.   &gt;  matches
       dates  which are older than the specified amount of time, an offset which
       begins with the character &lt; matches dates which are more recent than  the
       specified amount of time, and an offset which begins with the character =
       matches points of time which are precisely the given amount of time ago.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       abort_nosubject
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is given  at
              the  subject  prompt,  composition will be aborted.  If set to no,
              composing messages with no subject given  at  the  subject  prompt
              will never be aborted.



       abort_unmodified
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If  set to yes, composition will automatically abort after editing
              the message body if no changes are made to the  file  (this  check
              only  happens  after the first edit of the file).  When set to no,
              composition will never be aborted.



       alias_file
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/.muttrc&#8221;

              The default file in which to save aliases created by the  &lt;create-
              alias&gt;  function.  Entries  added  to this file are encoded in the
              character set specified by $config_charset if it  is  set  or  the
              current character set otherwise.

              Note:  Mutt  will  not  automatically  source  this file; you must
              explicitly use the &#8220;source&#8221; command for it to be executed in  case
              this option points to a dedicated alias file.

              The  default for this option is the currently used muttrc file, or
              &#8220;~/.muttrc&#8221; if no user muttrc was found.



       alias_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r&#8221;

              Specifies the format of the data displayed for the  &#8220;alias&#8221;  menu.
              The following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
              %a     alias name
              %f     flags - currently, a &#8220;d&#8221; for an alias marked for deletion
              %n     index number
              %r     address which alias expands to
              %t     character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclu&#8208;
                     sion


       allow_8bit
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether 8-bit data is converted  to  7-bit  using  either
              Quoted- Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
&#12;       allow_ansi
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  whether  ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in
              rich text messages) are to be  interpreted.   Messages  containing
              these  codes  are rare, but if this option is set, their text will
              be colored accordingly. Note that this  may  override  your  color
              choices,  and  even  present  a  security problem, since a message
              could include a line like


              [-- PGP output follows ...



              and give it the same color as  your  attachment  color  (see  also
              $crypt_timestamp).



       arrow_cursor
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  an  arrow  (&#8220;-&gt;&#8221;) will be used to indicate the current
              entry in menus instead of highlighting the whole  line.   On  slow
              network  or  modem  links  this  will make response faster because
              there is less that has to be redrawn on the screen when moving  to
              the next or previous entries in the menu.



       ascii_chars
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  Mutt  will  use  plain  ASCII characters when displaying
              thread and attachment trees, instead of the  default  ACS  charac&#8208;
              ters.



       askbcc
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipi&#8208;
              ents before editing an outgoing message.



       askcc
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, Mutt will  prompt  you  for  carbon-copy  (Cc)  recipients
              before editing the body of an outgoing message.



       assumed_charset
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  variable  is  a  colon-separated  list of character encoding
              schemes  for  messages  without  character  encoding   indication.
              Header  field  values  and  message body content without character
              encoding indication would be assumed that they are written in  one
              of  this list.  By default, all the header fields and message body
              without any charset indication are assumed to be in &#8220;us-ascii&#8221;.
&#12;              For example, Japanese users might prefer this:


              set assumed_charset=&#8221;iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8&#8221;



              However, only the first content is valid for the message body.



       attach_charset
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable is a  colon-separated  list  of  character  encoding
              schemes for text file attachments. Mutt uses this setting to guess
              which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them
              to a proper character set given in $send_charset.

              If  unset,  the value of $charset will be used instead.  For exam&#8208;
              ple, the following configuration would work for Japanese text han&#8208;
              dling:


              set attach_charset=&#8221;iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8&#8221;



              Note:  for Japanese users, &#8220;iso-2022-*&#8221; must be put at the head of
              the value as shown above if included.



       attach_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%&gt; [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] &#8221;

              This variable describes the format of the &#8220;attachment&#8221; menu.   The
              following printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
              %C     charset
              %c     requires charset conversion (&#8220;n&#8221; or &#8220;c&#8221;)
              %D     deleted flag
              %d     description
              %e     MIME content-transfer-encoding
              %f     filename
              %I     disposition (&#8220;I&#8221; for inline, &#8220;A&#8221; for attachment)
              %m     major MIME type
              %M     MIME subtype
              %n     attachment number
              %Q     &#8220;Q&#8221;, if MIME part qualifies for attachment counting
              %s     size
              %t     tagged flag
              %T     graphic tree characters
              %u     unlink (=to delete) flag
              %X     number  of qualifying MIME parts in this part and its chil&#8208;
                     dren (please see the  &#8220;attachments&#8221;  section  for  possible
                     speed effects)
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character
                     &#8220;X&#8221;
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character &#8220;X&#8221;
              %*X    soft-fill with character &#8220;X&#8221; as pad

              For an explanation of &#8220;soft-fill&#8221;, see the $index_format  documen&#8208;
              tation.



       attach_sep
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;\n&#8221;
&#12;              The  separator  to add between attachments when operating (saving,
              printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.



       attach_split
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing,  pip&#8208;
              ing,  etc)  on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate
              the attachments and will operate on them as a  single  attachment.
              The  $attach_sep  separator  is  added after each attachment. When
              set, Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.



       attribution
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;On %d, %n wrote:&#8221;

              This is the string that will precede  a  message  which  has  been
              included in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like
              sequences see the section on $index_format.



       auto_tag
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message  will
              be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When unset,
              you must first use the &lt;tag-prefix&gt;  function  (bound  to  &#8220;;&#8221;  by
              default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.



       autoedit
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set  along  with  $edit_headers,  Mutt will skip the initial
              send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you  to
              immediately begin editing the body of your message.  The send-menu
              may still be accessed once you have finished editing the  body  of
              your message.

              Note:  when  this  option  is  set, you cannot use send-hooks that
              depend on the recipients when composing a new (non-reply) message,
              as the initial list of recipients is empty.

              Also see $fast_reply.



       beep
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.



       beep_new
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  set, mutt will beep whenever it prints a
              message notifying you of new mail.  This  is  independent  of  the
              setting of the $beep variable.
&#12;

       bounce
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
              If set to yes you don&apos;t get asked if you want to bounce a message.
              Setting  this variable to no is not generally useful, and thus not
              recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.



       bounce_delivered
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When this variable is set, mutt will include Delivered-To  headers
              when  bouncing  messages.   Postfix  users  may wish to unset this
              variable.

              Note: On Debian systems,  this  option  is  unset  by  default  in
              /etc/Muttrc.



       braille_friendly
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  set,  mutt  will place the cursor at the
              beginning of the current line in menus, even when the  $arrow_cur&#8208;
              sor  variable  is  unset, making it easier for blind persons using
              Braille displays to follow these menus.  The option  is  unset  by
              default because many visual terminals don&apos;t permit making the cur&#8208;
              sor invisible.



       certificate_file
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/.mutt_certificates&#8221;

              This variable specifies the file where the certificates you  trust
              are  saved.  When  an  unknown certificate is encountered, you are
              asked if you accept it or not. If you accept it,  the  certificate
              can  also  be saved in this file and further connections are auto&#8208;
              matically accepted.

              You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
              certificate  that  is  signed with one of these CA certificates is
              also automatically accepted.

              Example:


              set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates





       charset
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Character set your terminal uses  to  display  and  enter  textual
              data.  It is also the fallback for $send_charset.

              Upon  startup  Mutt  tries  to  derive this value from environment
              variables such as $LC_CTYPE or $LANG.
&#12;              Note: It should only be set in case Mutt isn&apos;t able  to  determine
              the character set used correctly.



       check_mbox_size
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  set,  mutt  will use file size attribute
              instead of access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf
              folders.

              This  variable is unset by default and should only be enabled when
              new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn&apos;t
              work.

              Note  that  enabling this variable should happen before any &#8220;mail&#8208;
              boxes&#8221; directives occur in configuration files regarding  mbox  or
              mmdf  folders because mutt needs to determine the initial new mail
              status of such a mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it
              is  defined.   Afterwards  the  new mail status is tracked by file
              size changes.



       check_new
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style mailboxes.

              When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the mailbox
              is  open.   Especially  with MH mailboxes, this operation can take
              quite some time since  it  involves  scanning  the  directory  and
              checking  each  file  to see if it has already been looked at.  If
              this variable is unset, no check for new mail is  performed  while
              the mailbox is open.



       collapse_unread
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  unset,  Mutt  will  not collapse a thread if it contains any
              unread messages.



       compose_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%&gt;-&#8221;

              Controls the format of the status line displayed in the  &#8220;compose&#8221;
              menu.   This  string is similar to $status_format, but has its own
              set of printf(3)-like sequences:
              %a     total number of attachments
              %h     local hostname
              %l     approximate size (in bytes) of the current message
              %v     Mutt version string

              See the text describing the $status_format option for more  infor&#8208;
              mation on how to set $compose_format.



       config_charset
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              When  defined,  Mutt  will  recode  commands in rc files from this
              encoding to the current character set as specified by $charset and
              aliases written to $alias_file from the current character set.

              Please  note  that if setting $charset it must be done before set&#8208;
              ting $config_charset.

              Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertable  charac&#8208;
              ters  as  question  marks which can lead to undesired side effects
              (for example in regular expressions).



       confirmappend
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation  when  appending  mes&#8208;
              sages to an existing mailbox.



       confirmcreate
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  set,  Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages
              to a mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.



       connect_timeout
              Type: number
              Default: 30

              Causes Mutt to timeout a network  connection  (for  IMAP,  POP  or
              SMTP)  after this many seconds if the connection is not able to be
              established.  A negative value causes Mutt  to  wait  indefinitely
              for the connection attempt to succeed.



       content_type
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;text/plain&#8221;

              Sets  the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed mes&#8208;
              sages.



       copy
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing mes&#8208;
              sages  will  be  saved  for  later  references.  Also see $record,
              $save_name, $force_name and &#8220;fcc-hook&#8221;.



       crypt_autoencrypt
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause Mutt to  always  attempt  to  PGP
              encrypt  outgoing  messages.  This is probably only useful in con&#8208;
              nection to the &#8220;send-hook&#8221; command.  It can be overridden  by  use
              of  the  pgp  menu,  when encryption is not required or signing is
              requested as well.  If $smime_is_default is set, then  OpenSSL  is
              used  instead  to create S/MIME messages and settings can be over&#8208;
              ridden by use of the smime menu instead.  (Crypto only)
&#12;       crypt_autopgp
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls  whether  or  not  mutt  may  automatically
              enable    PGP   encryption/signing   for   messages.    See   also
              $crypt_autoencrypt,     $crypt_replyencrypt,      $crypt_autosign,
              $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.



       crypt_autosign
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to crypto&#8208;
              graphically sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden by use
              of  the  pgp  menu,  when signing is not required or encryption is
              requested as well. If $smime_is_default is set,  then  OpenSSL  is
              used  instead  to create S/MIME messages and settings can be over&#8208;
              ridden by use of the smime menu instead of the pgp menu.   (Crypto
              only)



       crypt_autosmime
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  variable  controls  whether  or  not  mutt may automatically
              enable  S/MIME   encryption/signing   for   messages.   See   also
              $crypt_autoencrypt,      $crypt_replyencrypt,     $crypt_autosign,
              $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.



       crypt_replyencrypt
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL encrypt replies  to  messages
              which are encrypted.  (Crypto only)



       crypt_replysign
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  automatically  PGP  or  OpenSSL sign replies to messages
              which are signed.

              Note: this does not  work  on  messages  that  are  encrypted  and
              signed!  (Crypto only)



       crypt_replysignencrypted
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  automatically  PGP  or  OpenSSL sign replies to messages
              which  are  encrypted.  This  makes  sense  in  combination   with
              $crypt_replyencrypt,  because  it  allows you to sign all messages
              which are automatically encrypted.  This works around the  problem
              noted  in  $crypt_replysign,  that  mutt  is  not able to find out
              whether an encrypted message is also signed.  (Crypto only)



       crypt_timestamp
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, mutt will include a time stamp in  the  lines  surrounding
              PGP  or  S/MIME  output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
              If you are using colors to mark these lines, and  rely  on  these,
              you may unset this setting.  (Crypto only)



       crypt_use_gpgme
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable  controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto back&#8208;
              ends.  If it is set and Mutt was built  with  gpgme  support,  the
              gpgme  code for S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic
              code.  Note that you need to set this option in .muttrc; it  won&apos;t
              have any effect when used interactively.



       crypt_use_pka
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls        whether       mutt       uses       PKA       (see
              http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf) during signature ver&#8208;
              ification (only supported by the GPGME backend).



       crypt_verify_sig
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If  &#8220;yes&#8221;,  always attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME signatures.  If
              &#8220;ask-*&#8221;, ask whether or not to verify  the  signature.   If  &#8220;no&#8221;,
              never attempt to verify cryptographic signatures.  (Crypto only)



       date_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z&#8221;

              This  variable controls the format of the date printed by the &#8220;%d&#8221;
              sequence in $index_format.  This  is  passed  to  the  strftime(3)
              function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syn&#8208;
              tax.

              Unless the first character in the string  is  a  bang  (&#8220;!&#8221;),  the
              month  and  week  day  names  are expanded according to the locale
              specified in the variable $locale. If the first character  in  the
              string  is  a  bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week
              day names in the rest of the string are expanded in the  C  locale
              (that is in US English).



       default_hook
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)&#8221;

              This  variable  controls  how &#8220;message-hook&#8221;, &#8220;reply-hook&#8221;, &#8220;send-
              hook&#8221;, &#8220;send2-hook&#8221;, &#8220;save-hook&#8221;, and &#8220;fcc-hook&#8221;  will  be  inter&#8208;
              preted if they are specified with only a simple regexp, instead of
              a  matching  pattern.   The  hooks  are  expanded  when  they  are
              declared,  so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of
              this variable at the time the hook is declared.

              The default value matches if the message is  either  from  a  user
              matching  the  regular  expression given, or if it is from you (if
              the from address matches &#8220;alternates&#8221;) and is to  or  cc&apos;ed  to  a
              user matching the given regular expression.



       delete
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  or not messages are really deleted when closing
              or synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to yes,  messages  marked  for
              deleting  will  automatically be purged without prompting.  If set
              to no, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.



       delete_untag
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when marking  them
              for  deletion.   This  applies when you either explicitly delete a
              message, or when you save it to another folder.



       digest_collapse
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If this option is set, mutt&apos;s received-attachments menu  will  not
              show  the  subparts  of individual messages in a multipart/digest.
              To see these subparts, press &#8220;v&#8221; on that menu.



       display_filter
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              When set, specifies a command used to  filter  messages.   When  a
              message  is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_fil&#8208;
              ter, and the filtered message is read from the standard output.



       dotlock_program
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock&#8221;

              Contains the path of the mutt_dotlock(8)  binary  to  be  used  by
              mutt.



       dsn_notify
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  variable sets the request for when notification is returned.
              The string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of  one
              or  more  of  the following: never, to never request notification,
              failure, to request notification on transmission  failure,  delay,
              to  be notified of message delays, success, to be notified of suc&#8208;
              cessful transmission.

              Example:


              set dsn_notify=&#8221;failure,delay&#8221;



              Note: when using $sendmail for delivery,  you  should  not  enable
              this  unless  you  are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a
              MTA providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -N
              option for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so
              that it depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.



       dsn_return
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
              messages.  It may be set to either hdrs to return just the message
              header, or full to return the full message.

              Example:


              set dsn_return=hdrs



              Note: when using $sendmail for delivery,  you  should  not  enable
              this  unless  you  are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a
              MTA providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -R
              option for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so
              that it depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.



       duplicate_threads
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether mutt, when $sort is set to threads,
              threads messages with the same Message-Id together.  If it is set,
              it will indicate that it thinks they are duplicates of each  other
              with an equals sign in the thread tree.



       edit_headers
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  option  allows  you to edit the header of your outgoing mes&#8208;
              sages along with the body of your message.

              Note that changes made to the References: and  Date:  headers  are
              ignored for interoperability reasons.



       editor
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt.  It defaults
              to the value of the $VISUAL, or $EDITOR, environment variable,  or
              to the string &#8220;/usr/bin/editor&#8221; if neither of those are set.



       encode_from
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  mutt  will  quoted-printable encode messages when they
              contain the string &#8220;From &#8221; (note the trailing space) in the begin&#8208;
              ning  of  a  line.   This is useful to avoid the tampering certain
              mail delivery and transport agents tend to do  with  messages  (in
              order  to  prevent  tools  from misinterpreting the line as a mbox
              message separator).
&#12;

       envelope_from_address
              Type: e-mail address
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Manually sets the envelope sender  for  outgoing  messages.   This
              value is ignored if $use_envelope_from is unset.



       escape
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;~&#8221;

              Escape character to use for functions in the built-in editor.



       fast_reply
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  the  initial  prompt  for  recipients  and subject are
              skipped when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for sub&#8208;
              ject is skipped when forwarding messages.

              Note:  this  variable has no effect when the $autoedit variable is
              set.



       fcc_attach
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing mes&#8208;
              sages are saved along with the main body of your message.



       fcc_clear
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and
              unsigned, even when the actual message is encrypted and/or signed.
              (PGP only)



       folder
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/Mail&#8221;

              Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;=&#8221; at
              the beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of  this
              variable.   Note  that  if  you  change  this  variable  (from the
              default) value you need to make sure that  the  assignment  occurs
              before  you use &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;=&#8221; for any other variables since expansion
              takes place when handling the &#8220;mailboxes&#8221; command.



       folder_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f&#8221;

              This variable allows you to customize the file browser display  to
              your personal taste.  This string is similar to $index_format, but
              has its own set of printf(3)-like sequences:
              %C     current file number
              %d     date/time folder was last modified
              %D     date/time folder was last modified using $date_format.
              %f     filename (&#8220;/&#8221; is appended to directory names, &#8220;@&#8221;  to  sym&#8208;
                     bolic links and &#8220;*&#8221; to executable files)
              %F     file permissions
              %g     group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
              %l     number of hard links
              %N     N if folder has new mail, blank otherwise
              %s     size in bytes
              %t     &#8220;*&#8221; if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
              %u     owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character
                     &#8220;X&#8221;
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character &#8220;X&#8221;
              %*X    soft-fill with character &#8220;X&#8221; as pad

              For an explanation of &#8220;soft-fill&#8221;, see the $index_format  documen&#8208;
              tation.



       followup_to
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether  or  not the &#8220;Mail-Followup-To:&#8221; header field is
              generated when sending mail.  When set, Mutt  will  generate  this
              field  when  you  are  replying to a known mailing list, specified
              with the &#8220;subscribe&#8221; or &#8220;lists&#8221; commands.

              This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from receiving
              duplicate  copies of replies to messages which you send to mailing
              lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply separately for
              any messages sent to known lists to which you are not subscribed.

              The  header  will  contain  only the list&apos;s address for subscribed
              lists, and both the list address and your own  email  address  for
              unsubscribed  lists.   Without  this header, a group reply to your
              message sent to a subscribed list will be sent to  both  the  list
              and  your  address,  resulting in two copies of the same email for
              you.



       force_name
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable is similar to  $save_name,  except  that  Mutt  will
              store  a  copy  of  your  outgoing  message by the username of the
              address you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.

              Also see the $record variable.



       forward_decode
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls the decoding of complex  MIME  messages  into  text/plain
              when  forwarding  a  message.   The message header is also RFC2047
              decoded.  This variable is only used, if $mime_forward  is  unset,
              otherwise $mime_forward_decode is used instead.



       forward_decrypt
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls the handling of encrypted messages when forwarding a mes&#8208;
              sage.  When set, the outer layer of encryption  is  stripped  off.
              This  variable is only used if $mime_forward is set and $mime_for&#8208;
              ward_decode is unset.  (PGP only)



       forward_edit
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This quadoption controls whether or not the user is  automatically
              placed  in  the  editor  when  forwarding messages.  For those who
              always want to forward with no  modification,  use  a  setting  of
              &#8220;no&#8221;.



       forward_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;[%a: %s]&#8221;

              This  variable controls the default subject when forwarding a mes&#8208;
              sage.  It uses the same  format  sequences  as  the  $index_format
              variable.



       forward_quote
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, forwarded messages included in the main body of the mes&#8208;
              sage  (when  $mime_forward  is  unset)  will   be   quoted   using
              $indent_string.



       from
              Type: e-mail address
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              When  set,  this variable contains a default from address.  It can
              be overridden using &#8220;my_hdr&#8221; (including from  a  &#8220;send-hook&#8221;)  and
              $reverse_name.  This variable is ignored if $use_from is unset.

              This  setting defaults to the contents of the environment variable
              $EMAIL.



       gecos_mask
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;^[^,]*&#8221;

              A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS  field  of  a
              password  entry  when expanding the alias.  The default value will
              return the string up to the first &#8220;,&#8221; encountered.  If  the  GECOS
              field contains a string like &#8220;lastname, firstname&#8221; then you should
              set it to &#8220;.*&#8221;.

              This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you  address
              an e-mail to user ID &#8220;stevef&#8221; whose full name is &#8220;Steve Franklin&#8221;.
              If mutt expands &#8220;stevef&#8221; to &#8220;&#8221;Franklin&#8221; stevef@foo.bar&#8221;  then  you
              should set the $gecos_mask to a regular expression that will match
              the whole name  so  mutt  will  expand  &#8220;Franklin&#8221;  to  &#8220;Franklin,
              Steve&#8221;.



       hdrs
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  unset, the header fields normally added by the &#8220;my_hdr&#8221; com&#8208;
              mand are not created.  This variable must be unset before  compos&#8208;
              ing  a  new  message or replying in order to take effect.  If set,
              the user defined header fields are added to every new message.



       header
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the header  of  the
              message  you are replying to into the edit buffer.  The $weed set&#8208;
              ting applies.



       header_cache
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable points to the header cache database.  If pointing to
              a  directory  Mutt  will  contain a header cache database file per
              folder, if pointing to a file that file will be  a  single  global
              header  cache. By default it is unset so no header caching will be
              used.

              Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP MH
              or Maildir folders, see &#8220;caching&#8221; for details.



       header_cache_compress
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  mutt  is  compiled with qdbm or tokyocabinet as header cache
              backend, this option determines whether the database will be  com&#8208;
              pressed.   Compression results in database files roughly being one
              fifth of the usual diskspace, but the decompression can result  in
              a  slower  opening  of  cached folder(s) which in general is still
              much faster than opening non header cached folders.



       help
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, help lines describing the bindings for the  major  func&#8208;
              tions provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the
              screen.

              Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the  function
              is  bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also, the
              help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
              running.   Since  this  variable  is primarily aimed at new users,
              neither of these should present a major problem.



       hidden_host
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt will skip the host name part of $hostname  variable
              when  adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
              affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to  the
              cut-off of first-level domains.



       hide_limited
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  mutt  will  not show the presence of messages that are
              hidden by limiting, in the thread tree.



       hide_missing
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing  messages  in
              the thread tree.
&#12;       hide_thread_subject
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread
              tree that have the same subject as their parent or closest  previ&#8208;
              ously displayed sibling.



       hide_top_limited
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  mutt  will  not show the presence of messages that are
              hidden by limiting, at the top of  threads  in  the  thread  tree.
              Note  that  when  $hide_limited  is  set, this option will have no
              effect.



       hide_top_missing
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing  messages  at
              the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_miss&#8208;
              ing is set, this option will have no effect.



       history
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              This variable controls the size (in number of strings  remembered)
              of  the  string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared
              each time the variable is set.



       history_file
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/.mutthistory&#8221;

              The file in which Mutt will save its history.



       honor_disposition
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, Mutt will not display attachments with a disposition  of
              &#8220;attachment&#8221;  inline  even  if  it  could render the part to plain
              text. These MIME parts can only  be  viewed  from  the  attachment
              menu.

              If  unset,  Mutt will render all MIME parts it can properly trans&#8208;
              form to plain text.



       honor_followup_to
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
              honored when group-replying to a message.



       hostname
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Specifies  the fully-qualified hostname of the system mutt is run&#8208;
              ning on containing the host&apos;s name and the DNS domain  it  belongs
              to.  It  is  used  as  the domain part (after &#8220;@&#8221;) for local email
              addresses as well as Message-Id headers.

              Its value is determined at startup as follows: If the node&apos;s  name
              as returned by the uname(3) function contains the hostname and the
              domain, these are used to construct  $hostname.  If  there  is  no
              domain  part  returned,  Mutt will look for a &#8220;domain&#8221; or &#8220;search&#8221;
              line in /etc/resolv.conf to determine the domain. Optionally, Mutt
              can  be compiled with a fixed domain name in which case a detected
              one is not used.

              Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.

              Note: On Debian systems, the default for this variable is obtained
              from /etc/mailname when Mutt starts.



       ignore_linear_white_space
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  option  replaces linear-white-space between encoded-word and
              text to a single space to  prevent  the  display  of  MIME-encoded
              &#8220;Subject:&#8221; field from being divided into multiple lines.



       ignore_list_reply_to
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Affects the behavior of the &lt;reply&gt; function when replying to mes&#8208;
              sages from mailing lists (as defined by the &#8220;subscribe&#8221; or &#8220;lists&#8221;
              commands).   When set, if the &#8220;Reply-To:&#8221; field is set to the same
              value as the &#8220;To:&#8221; field, Mutt assumes that the &#8220;Reply-To:&#8221;  field
              was set by the mailing list to automate responses to the list, and
              will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the mailing  list
              when   this   option   is  set,  use  the  &lt;list-reply&gt;  function;
              &lt;group-reply&gt; will reply to both the sender and the list.



       imap_authenticators
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt  may
              attempt  to  use  to  log  in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt
              should try them.  Authentication methods are either &#8220;login&#8221; or the
              right   side   of  an  IMAP  &#8220;AUTH=xxx&#8221;  capability  string,  e.g.
              &#8220;digest-md5&#8221;, &#8220;gssapi&#8221; or &#8220;cram-md5&#8221;. This option is case-insensi&#8208;
              tive.  If  it&apos;s  unset  (the  default) mutt will try all available
              methods, in order from most-secure to least-secure.

              Example:


              set imap_authenticators=&#8221;gssapi:cram-md5:login&#8221;



              Note: Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods  if
              the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
              authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.



       imap_check_subscribed
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from  your
              server  on  connection,  and  add  them to the set of mailboxes it
              polls for new mail just as if you  had  issued  individual  &#8220;mail&#8208;
              boxes&#8221; commands.
&#12;
       imap_delim_chars
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;/.&#8221;

              This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
              as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In  particular  it
              helps in using the &#8220;=&#8221; shortcut for your folder variable.



       imap_headers
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Mutt requests these header fields in addition to the default head&#8208;
              ers (&#8220;Date:&#8221;, &#8220;From:&#8221;, &#8220;Subject:&#8221;,  &#8220;To:&#8221;,  &#8220;Cc:&#8221;,  &#8220;Message-Id:&#8221;,

              from  IMAP  servers before displaying the index menu. You may want
              to add more headers for spam detection.

              Note: This is a space separated list, items  should  be  uppercase
              and not contain the colon, e.g. &#8220;X-BOGOSITY X-SPAM-STATUS&#8221; for the
              &#8220;X-Bogosity:&#8221; and &#8220;X-Spam-Status:&#8221; header fields.



       imap_idle
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt will attempt to use  the  IMAP  IDLE  extension  to
              check  for  new mail in the current mailbox. Some servers (dovecot
              was the inspiration for this option) react badly to mutt&apos;s  imple&#8208;
              mentation. If your connection seems to freeze up periodically, try
              unsetting this.



       imap_keepalive
              Type: number
              Default: 900

              This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that
              mutt  will  wait  before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent
              the server from closing them before mutt has finished  with  them.
              The  default  is  well  within the RFC-specified minimum amount of
              time (30 minutes) before a server is allowed to do  this,  but  in
              practice the RFC does get violated every now and then. Reduce this
              number if you find yourself getting disconnected  from  your  IMAP
              server due to inactivity.



       imap_list_subscribed
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable  configures  whether IMAP folder browsing will look
              for only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can  be  toggled
              in the IMAP browser with the &lt;toggle-subscribed&gt; function.



       imap_login
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Your login name on the IMAP server.

              This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.



       imap_pass
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, Mutt will
              prompt you for your password when you invoke the &lt;imap-fetch-mail&gt;
              function or try to open an IMAP folder.

              Warning:  you should only use this option when you are on a fairly
              secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even if
              you are the only one who can read the file.



       imap_passive
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
              mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing  IMAP  con&#8208;
              nections.   This  is  useful  if  you don&apos;t want to be prompted to
              user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the  connec&#8208;
              tion is slow.



       imap_peek
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  set,  mutt  will  avoid implicitly marking your mail as read
              whenever you fetch a message from the server. This is generally  a
              good  thing,  but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower.
              This option exists to appease speed freaks.



       imap_pipeline_depth
              Type: number
              Default: 15

              Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up  before
              they  are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline reduces the amount
              of time mutt must wait for the server, and can make  IMAP  servers
              feel  much  more  responsive. But not all servers correctly handle
              pipelined commands, so if you have problems you might want to  try
              setting this variable to 0.

              Note: Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.



       imap_servernoise
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP server
              as error messages. Since these messages  are  often  harmless,  or
              generated  due  to  configuration problems on the server which are
              out of the users&apos; hands, you may wish to  suppress  them  at  some
              point.



       imap_user
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              The  name  of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP
              server.

              This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.



       implicit_autoview
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, mutt will look  for  a  mailcap  entry  with  the
              &#8220;copiousoutput&#8221; flag set for every MIME attachment it doesn&apos;t have
              an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is  found,  mutt
              will use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part
              to text form. MIME attachments with &apos;text&apos; types,  with  the  only
              exception  of  text/html, are excluded: they will be shown as they
              are unless auto_view is specified.



       include
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are  replying
              to is included in your reply.



       include_onlyfirst
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether or not Mutt includes only the first attachment of
              the message you are replying.



       indent_string
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&gt; &#8221;

              Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted  in  a
              message  to  which  you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged
              not to change this value, as it tends to agitate the more  fanati&#8208;
              cal netizens.

              The  value  of  this option is ignored if $text_flowed is set, too
              because  the  quoting  mechanism  is  strictly  defined  for  for&#8208;
              mat=flowed.

              This  option  is  a  format  string, please see the description of
              $index_format for supported printf(3)-style sequences.



       index_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&amp;%4c?) %s&#8221;

              This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
              your personal taste.

              &#8220;Format strings&#8221; are similar to the strings used in the C function
              printf(3) to format output (see the man page  for  more  details).
              The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
              %a     address of the author
              %A     reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
              %b     filename of the original message folder (think mailbox)
              %B     the  list  to which the letter was sent, or else the folder
                     name (%b).
              %c     number of characters (bytes) in the message
              %C     current message number
              %d     date and time of the message in  the  format  specified  by
                     $date_format converted to sender&apos;s time zone
              %D     date  and  time  of  the message in the format specified by
                     $date_format converted to the local time zone
              %e     current message number in thread
              %E     number of messages in current thread
              %f     sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
              %F     author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
              %H     spam attribute(s) of this message
              %i     message-id of the current message
              %l     number of lines in the message (does not work with maildir,
                     mh, and possibly IMAP folders)
              %L     If an address in the &#8220;To:&#8221; or &#8220;Cc:&#8221; header field matches an
                     address defined by the users &#8220;subscribe&#8221; command, this dis&#8208;
                     plays &#8221;To &lt;list-name&gt;&#8221;, otherwise the same as %F.
              %m     total number of message in the mailbox
              %M     number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.
              %N     message score
              %n     author&apos;s real name (or address if missing)
              %O     original save folder where mutt would formerly have stashed
                     the message: list name or recipient name if not sent  to  a
                     list
              %P     progress  indicator for the built-in pager (how much of the
                     file has been displayed)
              %s     subject of the message
              %S     status of the message (&#8220;N&#8221;/&#8220;D&#8221;/&#8220;d&#8221;/&#8220;!&#8221;/&#8220;r&#8221;/*)
              %t     &#8220;To:&#8221; field (recipients)
              %T     the appropriate character from the $to_chars string
              %u     user (login) name of the author
              %v     first name of the author, or the recipient if  the  message
                     is from you
              %X     number of attachments (please see the &#8220;attachments&#8221; section
                     for possible speed effects)

              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character
                     &#8220;X&#8221;
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character &#8220;X&#8221;
              %*X    soft-fill with character &#8220;X&#8221; as pad

              &#8220;Soft-fill&#8221; deserves some explanation: Normal  right-justification
              will  print everything to the left of the &#8220;%&gt;&#8221;, displaying padding
              and whatever lies to the right only if there&apos;s room. By  contrast,
              soft-fill  gives  priority  to  the  right-hand side, guaranteeing
              space to display it and showing  padding  only  if  there&apos;s  still
              room. If necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room
              for rightward text.

              Note that these expandos are supported in &#8220;save-hook&#8221;,  &#8220;fcc-hook&#8221;
              and &#8220;fcc-save-hook&#8221;, too.



       ispell
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;ispell&#8221;

              How to invoke ispell (GNU&apos;s spell-checking software).



       keep_flagged
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  read  messages  marked as flagged will not be moved from
              your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or  as  a  result  of  a
              &#8220;mbox-hook&#8221; command.



       locale
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;C&#8221;

              The  locale  used by strftime(3) to format dates. Legal values are
              the strings your system accepts for the locale  environment  vari&#8208;
              able $LC_TIME.



       mail_check
              Type: number
              Default: 5

              This  variable  configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look
              for new mail. Also see the $timeout variable.
&#12;
       mail_check_recent
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will only notify you about new mail that  has  been
              received  since the last time you opened the mailbox.  When unset,
              Mutt will notify you if  any  new  mail  exists  in  the  mailbox,
              regardless of whether you have visited it recently.

              When  $mark_old is set, Mutt does not consider the mailbox to con&#8208;
              tain new mail if only old messages exist.



       mailcap_path
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting  to
              display MIME bodies not directly supported by Mutt.



       mailcap_sanitize
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  set,  mutt  will  restrict  possible  characters  in mailcap %
              expandos to a well-defined set of safe characters.   This  is  the
              safe  setting,  but  we  are  not  sure it doesn&apos;t break some more
              advanced MIME stuff.

              DON&apos;T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU  ARE
              DOING!



       maildir_header_cache_verify
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Check for Maildir unaware programs other than mutt having modified
              maildir files when the header cache is in use.   This  incurs  one
              stat(2)  per message every time the folder is opened (which can be
              very slow for NFS folders).



       maildir_trash
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the  maildir
              trashed  flag  instead  of  unlinked.   Note: this only applies to
              maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on  other
              mailbox types.



       mark_old
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether  or not mutt marks new unread messages as old if
              you exit a mailbox without reading them.  With  this  option  set,
              the  next  time  you start mutt, the messages will show up with an
              &#8220;O&#8221; next to them in the index menu, indicating that they are old.



       markers
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls the display of wrapped lines in the  internal  pager.  If
              set, a &#8220;+&#8221; marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines.

              Also see the $smart_wrap variable.
&#12;       mask
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;!^\.[^.]&#8221;

              A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded
              by the not operator &#8220;!&#8221;.  Only files whose names match  this  mask
              will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.



       mbox
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/mbox&#8221;

              This  specifies the folder into which read mail in your $spoolfile
              folder will be appended.

              Also see the $move variable.



       mbox_type
              Type: folder magic
              Default: mbox

              The default mailbox type used when creating new  folders.  May  be
              any  of  &#8220;mbox&#8221;, &#8220;MMDF&#8221;, &#8220;MH&#8221; and &#8220;Maildir&#8221;. This is overridden by
              the -m command-line option.



       menu_context
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable controls the number of lines  of  context  that  are
              given when scrolling through menus. (Similar to $pager_context.)



       menu_move_off
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  unset,  the  bottom entry of menus will never scroll up past
              the bottom of the screen,  unless  there  are  less  entries  than
              lines.  When set, the bottom entry may move off the bottom.



       menu_scroll
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  menus  will  be  scrolled up or down one line when you
              attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen is
              cleared  and  the  next  or previous page of the menu is displayed
              (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).



       message_cache_clean
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, mutt will clean out  obsolete  entries  from  the  message
              cache  when the mailbox is synchronized. You probably only want to
              set it every once in a while, since it can be a little slow (espe&#8208;
              cially for large folders).



       message_cachedir
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Set  this  to  a  directory and mutt will cache copies of messages
              from your IMAP and POP  servers  here.  You  are  free  to  remove
              entries at any time.

              When  setting  this  variable  to a directory, mutt needs to fetch
              every remote message only once and can perform regular  expression
              searches as fast as for local folders.

              Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.



       message_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%s&#8221;

              This  is the string displayed in the &#8220;attachment&#8221; menu for attach&#8208;
              ments of type message/rfc822.   For  a  full  listing  of  defined
              printf(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.



       meta_key
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit
              8) set as if the user had pressed the Esc  key  and  whatever  key
              remains  after  having  the high bit removed.  For example, if the
              key pressed has an ASCII value of 0xf8, then this is treated as if
              the  user had pressed Esc then &#8220;x&#8221;.  This is because the result of
              removing the high bit from 0xf8 is 0x78, which is the ASCII  char&#8208;
              acter &#8220;x&#8221;.



       metoo
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the &#8220;alternates&#8221; com&#8208;
              mand) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.



       mh_purge
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When unset, mutt will mimic mh&apos;s behavior and rename deleted  mes&#8208;
              sages to ,&lt;old file name&gt; in mh folders instead of really deleting
              them. This leaves the message on disk but makes  programs  reading
              the  folder  ignore  it. If the variable is set, the message files
              will simply be deleted.

              This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir folders.



       mh_seq_flagged
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;flagged&#8221;

              The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.



       mh_seq_replied
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;replied&#8221;

              The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.



       mh_seq_unseen
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;unseen&#8221;

              The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.



       mime_forward
              Type: quadoption
              Default: no

              When set, the message you are forwarding will  be  attached  as  a
              separate  message/rfc822 MIME part instead of included in the main
              body of the message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME  messages
              so  the receiver can properly view the message as it was delivered
              to you. If you like to switch between MIME and not MIME from  mail
              to mail, set this variable to &#8220;ask-no&#8221; or &#8220;ask-yes&#8221;.

              Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.



       mime_forward_decode
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  the  decoding  of  complex MIME messages into text/plain
              when forwarding a message while $mime_forward  is  set.  Otherwise
              $forward_decode is used instead.



       mime_forward_rest
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              When  forwarding  multiple  attachments of a MIME message from the
              attachment menu, attachments which cannot be decoded in a  reason&#8208;
              able manner will be attached to the newly composed message if this
              option is set.



       mix_entry_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%4n %c %-16s %a&#8221;

              This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the  mix&#8208;
              master  chain  selection  screen.   The  following  printf(3)-like
              sequences are supported:
              %n     The running number on the menu.
              %c     Remailer capabilities.
              %s     The remailer&apos;s short name.
              %a     The remailer&apos;s e-mail address.


       mixmaster
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;mixmaster&#8221;

              This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster  binary  on  your
              system.   It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
              list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
              mixmaster chain.

              Note: On Debian systems, this option is set by default to &#8220;mixmas&#8208;
              ter-filter&#8221; in /etc/Muttrc.



       move
              Type: quadoption
              Default: no

              Controls whether or not Mutt will move  read  messages  from  your
              spool  mailbox  to  your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of a &#8220;mbox-
              hook&#8221; command.



       narrow_tree
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable, when set, makes the thread tree narrower,  allowing
              deeper threads to fit on the screen.



       net_inc
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              Operations that expect to transfer a large amount of data over the
              network will update their progress every $net_inc  kilobytes.   If
              set to 0, no progress messages will be displayed.

              See also $read_inc, $write_inc and $net_inc.



       pager
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;builtin&#8221;

              This  variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
              messages. The value &#8220;builtin&#8221; means to  use  the  built-in  pager,
              otherwise  this variable should specify the pathname of the exter&#8208;
              nal pager you would like to use.

              Using an external pager may have  some  disadvantages:  Additional
              keystrokes  are  necessary  because  you can&apos;t call mutt functions
              directly from the pager, and screen  resizes  cause  lines  longer
              than the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.



       pager_context
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This  variable  controls  the  number of lines of context that are
              given when displaying the next or previous page  in  the  internal
              pager.   By default, Mutt will display the line after the last one
              on the screen at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).

              This variable also specifies  the  amount  of  context  given  for
              search  results. If positive, this many lines will be given before
              a match, if 0, the match will be top-aligned.



       pager_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s%*  -- (%P)&#8221;

              This variable controls the format of the one-line message &#8220;status&#8221;
              displayed  before each message in either the internal or an exter&#8208;
              nal pager.  The valid sequences are listed  in  the  $index_format
              section.



       pager_index_lines
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when
              in the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or  bottom
              of  the  folder,  will  be  roughly one third of the way down this
              mini-index, giving the reader the context of a few messages before
              and  after the message.  This is useful, for example, to determine
              how many messages remain to be read in the current thread.  One of
              the lines is reserved for the status bar from the index, so a set&#8208;
              ting of 6 will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value  of
              0  results  in no index being shown.  If the number of messages in
              the current folder is less than $pager_index_lines, then the index
              will only use as many lines as it needs.



       pager_stop
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  set,  the  internal-pager  will not move to the next message
              when you are at the end of a message and  invoke  the  &lt;next-page&gt;
              function.



       pgp_auto_decode
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, mutt will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP
              messages whenever the user performs an operation which  ordinarily
              would  result  in  the  contents of the message being operated on.
              For example, if the user displays a pgp-traditional message  which
              has  not  been  manually  checked with the &lt;check-traditional-pgp&gt;
              function, mutt will automatically check  the  message  for  tradi&#8208;
              tional pgp.



       pgp_autoinline
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style inline (tra&#8208;
              ditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under  certain  circum&#8208;
              stances.   This  can  be  overridden  by use of the pgp menu, when
              inline is not required.

              Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages which
              consist  of  more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can be configured
              to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline  (traditional)
              would not work.

              Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.

              Also  note that using the old-style PGP message format is strongly
              deprecated.  (PGP only)



       pgp_check_exit
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, mutt will check the exit code of the PGP  subprocess  when
              signing  or  encrypting.  A non-zero exit code means that the sub&#8208;
              process failed.  (PGP only)



       pgp_clearsign_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This format is used to create an old-style &#8220;clearsigned&#8221; PGP  mes&#8208;
              sage.  Note that the use of this format is strongly deprecated.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_decode_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This format strings specifies a command which is  used  to  decode
              application/pgp attachments.

              The  PGP  command  formats  have  their  own set of printf(3)-like
              sequences:
              %p     Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to  an
                     empty  string  otherwise.  Note: This may be used with a %?
                     construct.
              %f     Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
              %s     Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
                                of a multipart/signed attachment when  verifying
                     it.
              %a     The value of $pgp_sign_as.
              %r     One or more key IDs.

              For  examples  on  how  to configure these formats for the various
              versions of PGP which are floating around, see  the  pgp  and  gpg
              sample  configuration files in the samples/ subdirectory which has
              been installed on your system alongside the  documentation.   (PGP
              only)



       pgp_decrypt_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to decrypt a PGP encrypted message.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_encrypt_only_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to encrypt a body part without signing it.

              This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command  command  for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_encrypt_sign_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to both sign and encrypt a body part.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_entry_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u&#8221;

              This variable allows you to customize the PGP key  selection  menu
              to  your  personal taste. This string is similar to $index_format,
              but has its own set of printf(3)-like sequences:
              %n     number
              %k     key id
              %u     user id
              %a     algorithm
              %l     key length
              %f     flags
              %c     capabilities
              %t     trust/validity of the key-uid association
              %[&lt;s&gt;] date of the key where &lt;s&gt; is an strftime(3) expression

              (PGP only)



       pgp_export_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to export a public key from  the  user&apos;s  key
              ring.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_getkeys_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is invoked whenever mutt will need public key  infor&#8208;
              mation.   Of the sequences supported by $pgp_decode_command, %r is
              the only printf(3)-like sequence  used  with  this  format.   (PGP
              only)



       pgp_good_sign
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              If  you  assign  a  text to this variable, then a PGP signature is
              only considered verified if the  output  from  $pgp_verify_command
              contains  the  text.  Use  this variable if the exit code from the
              command is 0 even for bad signatures.  (PGP only)



       pgp_ignore_subkeys
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes
&#12;              Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore  OpenPGP  subkeys.
              Instead, the principal key will inherit the subkeys&apos; capabilities.
              Unset this if you want to play interesting  key  selection  games.
              (PGP only)



       pgp_import_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  command  is  used  to  import  a key from a message into the
              user&apos;s public key ring.

              This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command  command  for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_list_pubring_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  command is used to list the public key ring&apos;s contents.  The
              output format must be analogous to the one used by


              gpg --list-keys --with-colons.



              This format is also generated by the pgpring utility  which  comes
              with mutt.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_list_secring_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to list the secret key ring&apos;s contents.   The
              output format must be analogous to the one used by:


              gpg --list-keys --with-colons.



              This  format  is also generated by the pgpring utility which comes
              with mutt.

              This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command  command  for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_long_ids
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, use 64 bit PGP key IDs, if unset use the normal 32 bit key
              IDs.  (PGP only)



       pgp_mime_auto
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              This option controls whether Mutt will prompt  you  for  automati&#8208;
              cally  sending  a  (signed/encrypted)  message using PGP/MIME when
              inline (traditional) fails (for any reason).

              Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is  strongly
              deprecated.  (PGP only)



       pgp_replyinline
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting  this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to create
              an inline (traditional) message when replying to a  message  which
              is  PGP encrypted/signed inline.  This can be overridden by use of
              the pgp menu, when inline is not required.  This option  does  not
              automatically  detect  if  the  (replied-to)  message  is  inline;
              instead it relies on Mutt internals for previously checked/flagged
              messages.

              Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages which
              consist of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt can  be  configured
              to  ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline (traditional)
              would not work.

              Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.

              Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is  strongly
              deprecated.  (PGP only)



       pgp_retainable_sigs
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of nested mul&#8208;
              tipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body parts.

              This is useful for applications like encrypted and signed  mailing
              lists,  where  the outer layer (multipart/encrypted) can be easily
              removed, while the inner multipart/signed part is retained.   (PGP
              only)



       pgp_show_unusable
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, mutt will display non-usable keys on the PGP key selection
              menu.  This includes keys which have been revoked,  have  expired,
              or have been marked as &#8220;disabled&#8221; by the user.  (PGP only)



       pgp_sign_as
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              If  you  have  more  than  one key pair, this option allows you to
              specify which of your private keys to use.  It is recommended that
              you  use  the  keyid  form  to specify your key (e.g. 0x00112233).
              (PGP only)



       pgp_sign_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to create the detached PGP  signature  for  a
              multipart/signed PGP/MIME body part.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_sort_keys
              Type: sort order
              Default: address

              Specifies how the entries in the pgp menu are sorted. The  follow&#8208;
              ing are legal values:
              address
                     sort alphabetically by user id
              keyid  sort alphabetically by key id
              date   sort by key creation date
              trust  sort by the trust of the key

              If  you  prefer  reverse order of the above values, prefix it with
              &#8220;reverse-&#8221;.  (PGP only)
&#12;
       pgp_strict_enc
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as
              quoted-printable.   Please  note  that unsetting this variable may
              lead to problems  with  non-verifyable  PGP  signatures,  so  only
              change this if you know what you are doing.  (PGP only)



       pgp_timeout
              Type: number
              Default: 300

              The  number of seconds after which a cached passphrase will expire
              if not used.  (PGP only)



       pgp_use_gpg_agent
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, mutt will use  a  possibly-running  gpg-agent(1)  process.
              (PGP only)



       pgp_verify_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to verify PGP signatures.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pgp_verify_key_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to verify key information from the key selec&#8208;
              tion menu.

              This  is  a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
              possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (PGP only)



       pipe_decode
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used in connection with the &lt;pipe-message&gt; command.   When  unset,
              Mutt  will  pipe the messages without any preprocessing. When set,
              Mutt will weed headers and will attempt  to  decode  the  messages
              first.



       pipe_sep
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;\n&#8221;

              The separator to add between messages when piping a list of tagged
              messages to an external Unix command.



       pipe_split
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used in connection  with  the  &lt;pipe-message&gt;  function  following
              &lt;tag-prefix&gt;.   If  this  variable is unset, when piping a list of
              tagged messages Mutt will concatenate the messages and  will  pipe
              them  all concatenated.  When set, Mutt will pipe the messages one
              by one.  In both cases the  messages  are  piped  in  the  current
              sorted order, and the $pipe_sep separator is added after each mes&#8208;
              sage.



       pop_auth_try_all
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, Mutt will try all available authentication methods.   When
              unset, Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
              the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
              authentication fails, Mutt will not connect to the POP server.



       pop_authenticators
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
              attempt to use to log in to an  POP  server,  in  the  order  mutt
              should try them.  Authentication methods are either &#8220;user&#8221;, &#8220;apop&#8221;
              or any SASL mechanism, e.g. &#8220;digest-md5&#8221;, &#8220;gssapi&#8221; or  &#8220;cram-md5&#8221;.
              This  option  is  case-insensitive.  If  this option is unset (the
              default) mutt will  try  all  available  methods,  in  order  from
              most-secure to least-secure.

              Example:


              set pop_authenticators=&#8221;digest-md5:apop:user&#8221;





       pop_checkinterval
              Type: number
              Default: 60

              This  variable  configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look
              for new mail in the currently selected mailbox  if  it  is  a  POP
              mailbox.



       pop_delete
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-no

              If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded messages from the
              POP server when using the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.  When unset, Mutt
              will download messages but also leave them on the POP server.



       pop_host
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              The  name  of  your POP server for the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.  You
              can also specify an alternative port, username and password, i.e.:


              [pop[s]://][username[:password]@]popserver[:port]



              where &#8220;[...]&#8221; denotes an optional part.



       pop_last
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If this variable is set, mutt will try to use the &#8220;LAST&#8221; POP  com&#8208;
              mand  for retrieving only unread messages from the POP server when
              using the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.



       pop_pass
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, Mutt  will
              prompt you for your password when you open a POP mailbox.

              Warning:  you should only use this option when you are on a fairly
              secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even if
              you are the only one who can read the file.



       pop_reconnect
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  or  not  Mutt  will try to reconnect to the POP
              server if the connection is lost.



       pop_user
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Your login name on the POP server.

              This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.



       post_indent_string
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Similar to the $attribution variable, Mutt will append this string
              after the inclusion of a message which is being replied to.



       postpone
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls whether or not messages are saved in the $postponed mail&#8208;
              box when you elect not to send immediately.

              Also see the $recall variable.



       postponed
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/postponed&#8221;

              Mutt allows you to indefinitely &#8220;postpone sending a message&#8221; which
              you  are  editing.   When  you  choose to postpone a message, Mutt
              saves it in the mailbox specified by this variable.

              Also see the $postpone variable.



       preconnect
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails to  establish
              a  connection  to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
              connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the command returns  a   nonzero
              status, mutt gives up opening the server. Example:


              set preconnect=&#8221;ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net \
              sleep 20 &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null&#8221;



              Mailbox  &#8220;foo&#8221;  on  &#8220;mailhost.net&#8221;  can now be reached as &#8220;{local&#8208;
              host:1234}foo&#8221;.

              Note: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to  the
              remote machine without having to enter a password.
&#12;       print
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-no

              Controls  whether or not Mutt really prints messages.  This is set
              to &#8220;ask-no&#8221; by default, because some people accidentally  hit  &#8220;p&#8221;
              often.



       print_command
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;lpr&#8221;

              This  specifies the command pipe that should be used to print mes&#8208;
              sages.



       print_decode
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Used in connection with  the  &lt;print-message&gt;  command.   If  this
              option  is  set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
              external command specified by $print_command.  If this  option  is
              unset,  no processing will be applied to the message when printing
              it.  The latter setting may  be  useful  if  you  are  using  some
              advanced  printer  filter  which is able to properly format e-mail
              messages for printing.



       print_split
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used in connection with  the  &lt;print-message&gt;  command.   If  this
              option is set, the command specified by $print_command is executed
              once for each message which is to be printed.  If this  option  is
              unset,  the  command  specified by $print_command is executed only
              once, and all the messages are concatenated, with a form  feed  as
              the message separator.

              Those  who  use  the enscript(1) program&apos;s mail-printing mode will
              most likely want to set this option.



       prompt_after
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If you use an external $pager, setting this  variable  will  cause
              Mutt  to prompt you for a command when the pager exits rather than
              returning to the index menu.  If unset, Mutt will  return  to  the
              index menu when the external pager exits.



       query_command
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  specifies the command Mutt will use to make external address
              queries.  The string may contain a &#8220;%s&#8221;, which will be substituted
              with the query string the user types.  Mutt will add quotes around
              the string substituted for &#8220;%s&#8221; automatically according  to  shell
              quoting rules, so you should avoid adding your own.  If no &#8220;%s&#8221; is
              found in the string, Mutt will append the user&apos;s query to the  end
              of the string.  See &#8220;query&#8221; for more information.



       query_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;%4c %t %-25.25a %-25.25n %?e?(%e)?&#8221;

              This  variable  describes the format of the &#8220;query&#8221; menu. The fol&#8208;
              lowing printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
              %a     destination address
              %c     current entry number
              %e     extra information *
              %n     destination name
              %t     &#8220;*&#8221; if current entry is tagged, a space otherwise
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with &#8220;X&#8221;
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with &#8220;X&#8221;
              %*X    soft-fill with character &#8220;X&#8221; as pad
&#12;              For an explanation of &#8220;soft-fill&#8221;, see the $index_format  documen&#8208;
              tation.

              *  =  can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the $status_format
              documentation.



       quit
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether &#8220;quit&#8221;  and  &#8220;exit&#8221;  actually  quit
              from  mutt.   If this option is set, they do quit, if it is unset,
              they have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes  or  ask-no,  you
              are prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.



       quote_regexp
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;^([ \t]*[|&gt;:}#])+&#8221;

              A  regular  expression  used  in  the  internal pager to determine
              quoted sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text  may
              be  filtered  out  using  the  &lt;toggle-quoted&gt; command, or colored
              according to the &#8220;color quoted&#8221; family of directives.

              Higher levels  of  quoting  may  be  colored  differently  (&#8220;color
              quoted1&#8221;,  &#8220;color quoted2&#8221;, etc.). The quoting level is determined
              by removing the last character from the matched  text  and  recur&#8208;
              sively reapplying the regular expression until it fails to produce
              a match.

              Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys regular  expres&#8208;
              sion.



       read_inc
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              If  set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message
              it is currently on when  reading  a  mailbox  or  when  performing
              search  actions  such  as search and limit. The message is printed
              after this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if  set
              to  25,  Mutt  will  print a message when it is at message 25, and
              then again when it gets to message 50).  This variable is meant to
              indicate  progress when reading or searching large mailboxes which
              may take some time.  When set to 0, only  a  single  message  will
              appear before the reading the mailbox.

              Also  see the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
              &#8220;tuning&#8221; section of the manual for performance considerations.



       read_only
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.



       realname
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable specifies what &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;personal&#8221; name  should  be
              used when sending messages.

              By  default,  this is the GECOS field from /etc/passwd.  Note that
              this variable will not be used when the user has set a  real  name
              in the $from variable.



       recall
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether or not Mutt recalls postponed messages when com&#8208;
              posing a new message.

              Setting this variable to is not generally  useful,  and  thus  not
              recommended.
&#12;              Also see $postponed variable.



       record
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/sent&#8221;

              This  specifies  the file into which your outgoing messages should
              be appended.  (This is meant as the primary method  for  saving  a
              copy  of  your  messages,  but another way to do this is using the
              &#8220;my_hdr&#8221; command to create a &#8220;Bcc:&#8221; field with your email  address
              in it.)

              The  value  of  $record  is  overridden  by  the  $force_name  and
              $save_name variables, and the &#8220;fcc-hook&#8221; command.



       reply_regexp
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;^(re([\[0-9\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*&#8221;

              A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when thread&#8208;
              ing  and  replying.  The  default value corresponds to the English
              &#8221;Re:&#8221; and the German &#8221;Aw:&#8221;.



       reply_self
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt  will
              assume  that  you  want to reply to the recipients of that message
              rather than to yourself.

              Also see the &#8220;alternates&#8221; command.



       reply_to
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If set, when replying to a message,  Mutt  will  use  the  address
              listed  in the Reply-to: header as the recipient of the reply.  If
              unset, it will use the address in the From: header field  instead.
              This  option  is  useful  for reading a mailing list that sets the
              Reply-To: header field to the list address and you want to send  a
              private message to the author of a message.



       resolve
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  set,  the  cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
              (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies  the
              current message is executed.



       reverse_alias
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the &#8220;per&#8208;
              sonal&#8221; name from your aliases in the index menu  if  it  finds  an
              alias that matches the message&apos;s sender.  For example, if you have
              the following alias:


              alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)



              and then you receive mail which contains the following header:


              From: abd30425@somewhere.net



              It would be displayed in the index menu as &#8220;Joe User&#8221;  instead  of
              &#8220;abd30425@somewhere.net.&#8221;  This is useful when the person&apos;s e-mail
              address is not human friendly.
&#12;

       reverse_name
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              It may sometimes  arrive  that  you  receive  mail  to  a  certain
              machine,  move  the messages to another machine, and reply to some
              the messages from there.  If this variable  is  set,  the  default
              From:  line of the reply messages is built using the address where
              you received the messages you are  replying  to  if  that  address
              matches  your  &#8220;alternates&#8221;.   If  the  variable  is unset, or the
              address that would be used doesn&apos;t match  your  &#8220;alternates&#8221;,  the
              From: line will use your address on the current machine.

              Also see the &#8220;alternates&#8221; command.



       reverse_realname
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  variable  fine-tunes  the behavior of the $reverse_name fea&#8208;
              ture.  When it is set, mutt will use  the  address  from  incoming
              messages  as-is,  possibly including eventual real names.  When it
              is unset, mutt will override any such real names with the  setting
              of the $realname variable.



       rfc2047_parameters
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable is set, Mutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME
              parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt  suggests  you
              to save attachments to files named like:


              =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=



              When  this  variable  is  set  interactively,  the change won&apos;t be
              active until you change folders.

              Note that this use of RFC2047&apos;s encoding is explicitly  prohibited
              by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the wild.

              Also  note  that  setting  this parameter will not have the effect
              that mutt generates this kind of  encoding.   Instead,  mutt  will
              unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.



       save_address
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  mutt will take the sender&apos;s full address when choosing a
              default folder for saving a mail. If $save_name or $force_name  is
              set too, the selection of the Fcc folder will be changed as well.



       save_empty
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  unset,  mailboxes  which  contain  no saved messages will be
              removed when closed (the exception is $spoolfile  which  is  never
              removed).  If set, mailboxes are never removed.

              Note:  This  only  applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not
              delete MH and Maildir directories.



       save_history
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable controls the size  of  the  history  (per  category)
              saved in the $history_file file.



       save_name
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
              When set, a check is made to see if a  mailbox  specified  by  the
              recipient  address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox
              in the $folder directory with the username part of  the  recipient
              address).   If  the  mailbox  exists, the outgoing message will be
              saved to that mailbox, otherwise  the  message  is  saved  to  the
              $record mailbox.

              Also see the $force_name variable.



       score
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  this  variable is unset, scoring is turned off.  This can be
              useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
              $score_threshold_delete variable and related are used.



       score_threshold_delete
              Type: number
              Default: -1

              Messages  which  have been assigned a score equal to or lower than
              the value of this variable are automatically marked  for  deletion
              by  mutt.   Since  mutt scores are always greater than or equal to
              zero, the default setting of this variable will never mark a  mes&#8208;
              sage for deletion.



       score_threshold_flag
              Type: number
              Default: 9999

              Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to
              this variable&apos;s value are automatically marked &#8221;flagged&#8221;.



       score_threshold_read
              Type: number
              Default: -1

              Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or  lower  than
              the  value  of  this  variable are automatically marked as read by
              mutt.  Since mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero,
              the  default  setting  of  this variable will never mark a message
              read.



       search_context
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              For the pager, this variable specifies the number of  lines  shown
              before   search  results.  By  default,  search  results  will  be
              top-aligned.



       send_charset
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8&#8221;

              A colon-delimited list of character sets  for  outgoing  messages.
              Mutt  will  use the first character set into which the text can be
              converted exactly.  If  your  $charset  is  not  &#8220;iso-8859-1&#8221;  and
              recipients  may not understand &#8220;UTF-8&#8221;, it is advisable to include
              in the list an appropriate  widely  used  standard  character  set
              (such  as  &#8220;iso-8859-2&#8221;, &#8220;koi8-r&#8221; or &#8220;iso-2022-jp&#8221;) either instead
              of or after &#8220;iso-8859-1&#8221;.

              In case the text cannot be converted into one  of  these  exactly,
              mutt uses $charset as a fallback.



       sendmail
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi&#8221;

              Specifies  the  program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by
              Mutt.  Mutt expects that the specified  program  interprets  addi&#8208;
              tional arguments as recipient addresses.
&#12;

       sendmail_wait
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Specifies  the number of seconds to wait for the $sendmail process
              to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.

              Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
              &gt;0     number of seconds to wait for  sendmail  to  finish  before
                     continuing
              0      wait forever for sendmail to finish
              &lt;0     always put sendmail in the background without waiting

              Note  that  if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the
              child process will be put in a temporary file.  If there  is  some
              error, you will be informed as to where to find the output.



       shell
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Command  to  use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user&apos;s
              login shell from /etc/passwd is used.



       sig_dashes
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, a line containing &#8220;-- &#8221; (note the trailing space) will  be
              inserted  before your $signature.  It is strongly recommended that
              you not unset this variable unless your  signature  contains  just
              your  name.  The reason for this is because many software packages
              use &#8220;-- \n&#8221; to detect your signature.  For example, Mutt  has  the
              ability  to  highlight  the  signature in a different color in the
              built-in pager.



       sig_on_top
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, the signature will be included before any quoted  or  for&#8208;
              warded  text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this
              variable unless you really know what you are doing, and  are  pre&#8208;
              pared to take some heat from netiquette guardians.



       signature
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;~/.signature&#8221;

              Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
              outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (&#8220;|&#8221;), it is
              assumed  that filename is a shell command and input should be read
              from its standard output.



       simple_search
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;~f %s | ~s %s&#8221;

              Specifies how Mutt should expand  a  simple  search  into  a  real
              search  pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any
              of the &#8220;~&#8221; pattern operators.  See &#8220;patterns&#8221; for more information
              on search patterns.

              For example, if you simply type &#8220;joe&#8221; at a search or limit prompt,
              Mutt will automatically expand it to the value specified  by  this
              variable  by  replacing  &#8220;%s&#8221;  with  the supplied string.  For the
              default value, &#8220;joe&#8221; would be expanded to: &#8220;~f joe | ~s joe&#8221;.



       sleep_time
              Type: number
              Default: 1

              Specifies time, in seconds,  to  pause  while  displaying  certain
              informational  messages,  while  moving  from folder to folder and
              after expunging messages from the current folder.  The default  is
              to pause one second, so a value of zero for this option suppresses
              the pause.



       smart_wrap
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in  the
              internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.
              If unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen  edge.  Also  see
              the $markers variable.



       smileys
              Type: regular expression
              Default: &#8220;(&gt;From )|(:[-^]?[][)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP])&#8221;

              The  pager uses this variable to catch some common false positives
              of $quote_regexp, most notably smileys and  not  consider  a  line
              quoted  text  if  it also matches $smileys. This mostly happens at
              the beginning of a line.



       pgp_mime_signature_filename
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;signature.asc&#8221;

              This option sets the filename used for signature parts in PGP/MIME
              signed messages.



       pgp_mime_signature_description
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;Digital signature&#8221;

              This  option sets the Content-Description used for signature parts
              in PGP/MIME signed messages.



       smime_ask_cert_label
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter  a  label
              for  a certificate about to be added to the database or not. It is
              set by default.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_ca_location
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable contains the name of either a directory, or  a  file
              which contains trusted certificates for use with OpenSSL.  (S/MIME
              only)

              Note: On Debian systems, this defaults to the first existing  file
              in     the     following     list:    ~/.smime/ca-certificates.crt
              ~/.smime/ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.



       smime_certificates
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, mutt has
              to  handle  storage  and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very
              basic right now, and keys and certificates are stored in two  dif&#8208;
              ferent  directories,  both  named as the hash-value retrieved from
              OpenSSL. There is an index  file  which  contains  mailbox-address
              keyid  pairs, and which can be manually edited. This option points
              to the location of the certificates.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_decrypt_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This format string specifies a command which is  used  to  decrypt
              application/x-pkcs7-mime attachments.

              The  OpenSSL  command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like
              sequences similar to PGP&apos;s:
              %f     Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
              %s     Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
                                of a multipart/signed attachment when  verifying
                     it.
              %k     The key-pair specified with $smime_default_key
              %c     One or more certificate IDs.
              %a     The algorithm used for encryption.
              %C     CA location:  Depending on whether $smime_ca_location
                                points to a directory or file, this expands to
                                &#8220;-CApath    $smime_ca_location&#8221;    or   &#8220;-CAfile
                     $smime_ca_location&#8221;.

              For examples on how to configure these formats, see  the  smime.rc
              in the samples/ subdirectory which has been installed on your sys&#8208;
              tem alongside the documentation.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_decrypt_use_default_key
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set (default) this tells  mutt  to  use  the  default  key  for
              decryption. Otherwise, if managing multiple certificate-key-pairs,
              mutt will try to use the mailbox-address to determine the  key  to
              use.  It  will  ask  you  to  supply  a key, if it can&apos;t find one.
              (S/MIME only)



       smime_default_key
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This is the default key-pair to use for signing. This must be  set
              to the keyid (the hash-value that OpenSSL generates) to work prop&#8208;
              erly (S/MIME only)



       smime_encrypt_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to create encrypted S/MIME messages.

              This is a format string, see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_encrypt_with
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This sets the algorithm that should be used for encryption.  Valid
              choices are &#8220;des&#8221;,  &#8220;des3&#8221;,  &#8220;rc2-40&#8221;,  &#8220;rc2-64&#8221;,  &#8220;rc2-128&#8221;.   If
              unset, &#8220;3des&#8221; (TripleDES) is used.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_get_cert_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  command  is  used  to extract X509 certificates from a PKCS7
              structure.

              This is a format string, see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_get_cert_email_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This  command  is  used  to  extract the mail address(es) used for
              storing X509 certificates, and for verification purposes (to check
              whether the certificate was issued for the sender&apos;s mailbox).

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_get_signer_cert_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to extract only the signers X509  certificate
              from  a  S/MIME signature, so that the certificate&apos;s owner may get
              compared to the email&apos;s &#8220;From:&#8221; field.

              This is a format string, see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_import_cert_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to import a certificate via smime_keys.

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_is_default
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              The  default  behavior  of   mutt   is   to   use   PGP   on   all
              auto-sign/encryption  operations.  To  override and to use OpenSSL
              instead this must be set.   However,  this  has  no  effect  while
              replying,  since  mutt will automatically select the same applica&#8208;
              tion that was used to sign/encrypt the  original  message.   (Note
              that    this    variable    can   be   overridden   by   unsetting
              $crypt_autosmime.)  (S/MIME only)



       smime_keys
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, mutt has
              to  handle  storage and retrieval of keys/certs by itself. This is
              very basic right now, and stores keys and certificates in two dif&#8208;
              ferent  directories,  both  named as the hash-value retrieved from
              OpenSSL. There is an index  file  which  contains  mailbox-address
              keyid  pair,  and which can be manually edited. This option points
              to the location of the private keys.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_pk7out_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to extract PKCS7 structures of S/MIME  signa&#8208;
              tures, in order to extract the public X509 certificate(s).

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_sign_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to created S/MIME signatures of  type  multi&#8208;
              part/signed, which can be read by all mail clients.

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_sign_opaque_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to created S/MIME signatures of type applica&#8208;
              tion/x-pkcs7-signature,  which can only be handled by mail clients
              supporting the S/MIME extension.

              This is a format string, see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_timeout
              Type: number
              Default: 300

              The  number of seconds after which a cached passphrase will expire
              if not used.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_verify_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures  of  type  multi&#8208;
              part/signed.

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smime_verify_opaque_command
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures of type  applica&#8208;
              tion/x-pkcs7-mime.

              This  is  a  format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command command
              for possible printf(3)-like sequences.  (S/MIME only)



       smtp_authenticators
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt  may
              attempt  to  use  to  log  in to an SMTP server, in the order mutt
              should try them.  Authentication methods are any  SASL  mechanism,
              e.g.   &#8220;digest-md5&#8221;,  &#8220;gssapi&#8221;  or  &#8220;cram-md5&#8221;.   This  option  is
              case-insensitive. If it is &#8220;unset&#8221; (the default) mutt will try all
              available methods, in order from most-secure to least-secure.

              Example:


              set smtp_authenticators=&#8221;digest-md5:cram-md5&#8221;



              Note:  On  Debian  systems,  this variable defaults to the example
              mentioned. This file is managed by the &#8220;ca-certificates&#8221; package.



       smtp_pass
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Specifies the password for your SMTP account.  If unset, Mutt will
              prompt  you  for  your password when you first send mail via SMTP.
              See $smtp_url to configure mutt to send mail via SMTP.

              Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a  fairly
              secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even if
              you are the only one who can read the file.



       smtp_url
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Defines the SMTP smarthost where sent messages should relayed  for
              delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:


              smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]



              where  &#8220;[...]&#8221;  denotes  an  optional part.  Setting this variable
              overrides the value of the $sendmail variable.



       sort
              Type: sort order
              Default: date

              Specifies how to sort messages in the &#8220;index&#8221; menu.  Valid  values
              are:
              &#8208; date or date-sent
              &#8208; date-received
              &#8208; from
              &#8208; mailbox-order (unsorted)
              &#8208; score
              &#8208; size
              &#8208; spam
              &#8208; subject
              &#8208; threads
              &#8208; to

              You  may  optionally  use the &#8220;reverse-&#8221; prefix to specify reverse
              sorting order (example: &#8220;set sort=reverse-date-sent&#8221;).

              Note: On  Debian  systems,  this  option  is  set  by  default  to
              &#8220;threads&#8221; in /etc/Muttrc.



       sort_alias
              Type: sort order
              Default: alias

              Specifies  how  the  entries  in the &#8220;alias&#8221; menu are sorted.  The
              following are legal values:
              &#8208; address (sort alphabetically by email address)
              &#8208; alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
              &#8208; unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)


       sort_aux
              Type: sort order
              Default: date

              When sorting by threads, this variable controls  how  threads  are
              sorted  in  relation to other threads, and how the branches of the
              thread trees are sorted.  This can be set to any value that  $sort
              can,   except   &#8220;threads&#8221;  (in  that  case,  mutt  will  just  use
              &#8220;date-sent&#8221;).  You can also specify the &#8220;last-&#8221; prefix in addition
              to  the &#8220;reverse-&#8221; prefix, but &#8220;last-&#8221; must come after &#8220;reverse-&#8221;.
              The &#8220;last-&#8221; prefix causes messages to be sorted against  its  sib&#8208;
              lings  by  which  has  the  last  descendant,  using  the  rest of
              $sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance,


              set sort_aux=last-date-received



              would mean that if a new message is received  in  a  thread,  that
              thread  becomes  the last one displayed (or the first, if you have
              &#8220;set sort=reverse-threads&#8221;.)

              Note: For reversed $sort order $sort_aux is reversed again  (which
              is  not  the right thing to do, but kept to not break any existing
              configuration setting).



       sort_browser
              Type: sort order
              Default: alpha

              Specifies how to sort entries in the file  browser.   By  default,
              the entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
              &#8208; alpha (alphabetically)
              &#8208; date
              &#8208; size
              &#8208; unsorted

              You  may  optionally  use the &#8220;reverse-&#8221; prefix to specify reverse
              sorting order (example: &#8220;set sort_browser=reverse-date&#8221;).



       sort_re
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  variable  is  only  useful  when  sorting  by  threads  with
              $strict_threads  unset.   In  that  case, it changes the heuristic
              mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With $sort_re set,  mutt
              will only attach a message as the child of another message by sub&#8208;
              ject if the subject of the child message starts with  a  substring
              matching  the setting of $reply_regexp.  With $sort_re unset, mutt
              will attach the message whether or not this is the case,  as  long
              as the non-$reply_regexp parts of both messages are identical.



       spam_separator
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;,&#8221;

              This variable controls what happens when multiple spam headers are
              matched: if unset, each successive header will overwrite any  pre&#8208;
              vious  matches  value  for the spam label. If set, each successive
              match will append to the previous, using this variable&apos;s value  as
              a separator.



       spoolfile
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              If  your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot
              find it, you can specify its location with  this  variable.   Mutt
              will  initially  set this variable to the value of the environment
              variable $MAIL or $MAILDIR if either is defined.



       ssl_ca_certificates_file
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.
              Any  server  certificate  that is signed with one of these CA cer&#8208;
              tificates is also automatically accepted.

              Example:


              set ssl_ca_certificates_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt





       ssl_client_cert
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              The file containing a client certificate and its  associated  pri&#8208;
              vate key.



       ssl_force_tls
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If this variable is set, Mutt will require that all connections to
              remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it will attempt to  nego&#8208;
              tiate  TLS  even  if the server does not advertise the capability,
              since it would otherwise have to abort the connection anyway. This
              option supersedes $ssl_starttls.



       ssl_min_dh_prime_bits
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This  variable  specifies  the  minimum  acceptable prime size (in
              bits) for use in any Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  A  value  of  0
              will use the default from the GNUTLS library.



       ssl_starttls
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If set (the default), mutt will attempt to use STARTTLS on servers
              advertising the capability. When unset, mutt will not  attempt  to
              use STARTTLS regardless of the server&apos;s capabilities.



       ssl_use_sslv3
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv3 in the SSL
              authentication process.



       ssl_use_tlsv1
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable specifies whether to attempt to use TLSv1 in the SSL
              authentication process.



       ssl_verify_dates
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a server
              certificate that is either not yet valid or already  expired.  You
              should  only  unset  this  for  particular  known hosts, using the
              &lt;account-hook&gt; function.



       ssl_verify_host
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes
&#12;              If set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept a  server
              certificate  whose  host name does not match the host used in your
              folder URL. You should only unset this for particular known hosts,
              using the &lt;account-hook&gt; function.



       status_chars
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;-*%A&#8221;

              Controls the characters used by the &#8220;%r&#8221; indicator in $status_for&#8208;
              mat. The first character is used when the  mailbox  is  unchanged.
              The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and it needs
              to be resynchronized. The third is  used  if  the  mailbox  is  in
              read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
              that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
              with  the  &lt;toggle-write&gt; operation, bound by default to &#8220;%&#8221;). The
              fourth is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened
              in  attach-  message mode (Certain operations like composing a new
              mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).



       status_format
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%&gt;-(%P)---&#8221;

              Controls the format of the status line displayed  in  the  &#8220;index&#8221;
              menu.   This  string  is similar to $index_format, but has its own
              set of printf(3)-like sequences:
              %b     number of mailboxes with new mail *
              %d     number of deleted messages *
              %f     the full pathname of the current mailbox
              %F     number of flagged messages *
              %h     local hostname
              %l     size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *
              %L     size (in bytes) of the messages shown  (i.e.,  which  match
                     the current limit) *
              %m     the number of messages in the mailbox *
              %M     the number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current
                     limit) *
              %n     number of new messages in the mailbox *
              %o     number of old unread messages *
              %p     number of postponed messages *
              %P     percentage of the way through the index
              %r     modified/read-only/won&apos;t-write/attach-message    indicator,
                     according to $status_chars
              %s     current sorting mode ($sort)
              %S     current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
              %t     number of tagged messages *
              %u     number of unread messages *
              %v     Mutt version string
              %V     currently active limit pattern, if any *
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with &#8220;X&#8221;
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with &#8220;X&#8221;
              %*X    soft-fill with character &#8220;X&#8221; as pad

              For  an explanation of &#8220;soft-fill&#8221;, see the $index_format documen&#8208;
              tation.

              * = can be optionally printed if nonzero

              Some of the above sequences can be  used  to  optionally  print  a
              string  if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want
              to see the number of flagged  messages  if  such  messages  exist,
              since  zero is not particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a
              string based upon one of the above sequences, the  following  con&#8208;
              struct is used:

              %?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?

              where  sequence_char  is  a  character  from  the table above, and
              optional_string  is  the  string  you  would   like   printed   if
              sequence_char  is  nonzero.   optional_string  may  contain  other
              sequences as well as normal text, but you may  not  nest  optional
              strings.

              Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number
              of new messages in a mailbox:

              %?n?%n new messages.?

              You can also switch between two strings using the  following  con&#8208;
              struct:

              %?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?

              If  the  value  of  sequence_char  is  non-zero, if_string will be
              expanded, otherwise else_string will be expanded.

              You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be low&#8208;
              ercase  by  prefixing  the  sequence  character with an underscore
              (&#8220;_&#8221;) sign.  For example, if you want to display the  local  host&#8208;
              name in lowercase, you would use: &#8220;%_h&#8221;.

              If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (&#8220;:&#8221;) character,
              mutt will replace any dots in the expansion by  underscores.  This
              might  be helpful with IMAP folders that don&apos;t like dots in folder
              names.



       status_on_top
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable causes the &#8220;status bar&#8221; to be  displayed  on
              the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom. If $help
              is set, too it&apos;ll be placed at the bottom.



       strict_threads
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, threading will only make  use  of  the  &#8220;In-Reply-To&#8221;  and
              &#8220;References:&#8221;  fields  when  you  $sort  by  message  threads.  By
              default, messages with the same subject are  grouped  together  in
              &#8220;pseudo  threads.&#8221;. This may not always be desirable, such as in a
              personal mailbox where you might have several  unrelated  messages
              with  the  subjects like &#8220;hi&#8221; which will get grouped together. See
              also $sort_re for a less drastic way of controlling this behavior.



       suspend
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When unset, mutt won&apos;t stop when the user presses  the  terminal&apos;s
              susp  key,  usually &#8220;^Z&#8221;. This is useful if you run mutt inside an
              xterm using a command like &#8220;xterm -e mutt&#8221;.



       text_flowed
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt will generate &#8220;format=flowed&#8221; bodies with a content
              type  of  &#8220;text/plain;  format=flowed&#8221;.   This format is easier to
              handle for some mailing software, and generally  just  looks  like
              ordinary  text.   To  actually make use of this format&apos;s features,
              you&apos;ll need support in your editor.

              Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.



       thorough_search
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in section &#8220;pat&#8208;
              terns&#8221;.   If  set, the headers and body/attachments of messages to
              be searched are decoded before searching. If unset,  messages  are
              searched as they appear in the folder.

              Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should set
              this value because decoding also  includes  MIME  parsing/decoding
              and  possible  character  set  conversions.  Otherwise  mutt  will
              attempt to match against the raw  message  received  (for  example
              quoted-printable  encoded  or with encoded headers) which may lead
              to incorrect search results.



       thread_received
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent to
              thread messages by subject.



       tilde
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of
              the screen with a tilde (&#8220;~&#8221;).



       time_inc
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Along with $read_inc, $write_inc, and $net_inc, this variable con&#8208;
              trols  the frequency with which progress updates are displayed. It
              suppresses updates less than $time_inc  milliseconds  apart.  This
              can  improve  throughput  on  systems with slow terminals, or when
              running mutt on a remote system.

              Also see the &#8220;tuning&#8221; section of the manual for  performance  con&#8208;
              siderations.



       timeout
              Type: number
              Default: 600

              When  Mutt  is waiting for user input either idling in menus or in
              an interactive prompt, Mutt would block until  input  is  present.
              Depending  on  the  context, this would prevent certain operations
              from working, like checking for new mail or keeping an  IMAP  con&#8208;
              nection alive.

              This  variable  controls  how  many seconds Mutt will at most wait
              until it aborts waiting for input, performs these  operations  and
              continues to wait for input.

              A value of zero or less will cause Mutt to never time out.



       tmpdir
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its tem&#8208;
              porary files needed for displaying  and  composing  messages.   If
              this  variable  is  not  set,  the environment variable $TMPDIR is
              used.  If $TMPDIR is not set then &#8220;/tmp&#8221; is used.



       to_chars
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220; +TCFL&#8221;

              Controls the character used to indicate  mail  addressed  to  you.
              The first character is the one used when the mail is not addressed
              to your address.  The second is used when you are the only recipi&#8208;
              ent of the message.  The third is when your address appears in the
              &#8220;To:&#8221; header field, but you are not the only recipient of the mes&#8208;
              sage.  The fourth character is used when your address is specified
              in the &#8220;Cc:&#8221; header field, but you are  not  the  only  recipient.
              The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent by you.
              The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail was sent to  a
              mailing-list you subscribe to.



       trash
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              If set, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where
              the mails marked for deletion will  be  moved,  instead  of  being
              irremediably purged.

              NOTE:  When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really
              deleted, so that you have a way to clean the trash.



       tunnel
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a  command
              instead  of  a  raw  socket. You may be able to use this to set up
              preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server.  Exam&#8208;
              ple:


              set tunnel=&#8221;ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd&#8221;



              Note:  For  this example to work you must be able to log in to the
              remote machine without having to enter a password.

              When set, Mutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.  Please
              see  &#8220;account-hook&#8221;  in the manual for how to use different tunnel
              commands per connection.



       uncollapse_jump
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,  when
              the current thread is uncollapsed.



       use_8bitmime
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Warning:  do  not set this variable unless you are using a version
              of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such  as  sendmail
              8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.

              When set, Mutt will invoke $sendmail with the -B8BITMIME flag when
              sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.



       use_domain
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without  the
              &#8220;@host&#8221;  portion)  with  the  value  of  $hostname.   If unset, no
              addresses will be qualified.



       use_envelope_from
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, mutt will set the envelope sender of  the  message.   If
              $envelope_from_address  is  set,  it  will  be  used as the sender
              address. If unset, mutt will attempt to derive the sender from the
              &#8220;From:&#8221; header.

              Note that this information is passed to sendmail command using the
              -f command line switch. Therefore setting this option is not  use&#8208;
              ful  if  the $sendmail variable already contains -f or if the exe&#8208;
              cutable pointed to by $sendmail doesn&apos;t support the -f switch.



       use_from
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will generate the &#8220;From:&#8221; header field when sending
              messages.   If  unset,  no  &#8220;From:&#8221; header field will be generated
              unless the user explicitly sets one using the &#8220;my_hdr&#8221; command.



       use_idn
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will show you international domain  names  decoded.
              Note:  You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is unset.  This
              variable only affects decoding.



       use_ipv6
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it  tries  to
              contact.   If  this  option is unset, Mutt will restrict itself to
              IPv4 addresses.  Normally, the default should work.



       user_agent
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will add a &#8220;User-Agent:&#8221; header  to  outgoing  mes&#8208;
              sages,  indicating  which  version  of mutt was used for composing
              them.



       visual
              Type: path
              Default: &#8220;&#8221;

              Specifies the visual editor to invoke when  the  &#8220;~v&#8221;  command  is
              given in the built-in editor.



       wait_key
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after an exter&#8208;
              nal command has been invoked by these  functions:  &lt;shell-escape&gt;,
              &lt;pipe-message&gt;,  &lt;pipe-entry&gt;,  &lt;print-message&gt;, and &lt;print-entry&gt;
              commands.

              It is also used when viewing attachments  with  &#8220;auto_view&#8221;,  pro&#8208;
              vided  that  the  corresponding  mailcap entry has a needsterminal
              flag, and the external program is interactive.

              When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When  unset,  Mutt  will
              wait  for  a  key only if the external command returned a non-zero
              status.



       weed
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, mutt will  weed  headers  when  displaying,  forwarding,
              printing, or replying to messages.



       wrap
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              When set to a positive value, mutt will wrap text at $wrap charac&#8208;
              ters.  When set to a negative value, mutt will wrap text  so  that
              there are $wrap characters of empty space on the right side of the
              terminal. Setting it to zero  makes  mutt  wrap  at  the  terminal
              width.



       wrap_headers
              Type: number
              Default: 78

              This option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping
              an outgoing message&apos;s headers. Allowed values are between  78  and
              998 inclusive.

              Note: This option usually shouldn&apos;t be changed. RFC5233 recommends
              a line length of 78 (the default), so please only change this set&#8208;
              ting when you know what you&apos;re doing.



       wrap_search
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether searches wrap around the end.

              When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) item. When
              unset, incremental searches will not wrap.



       wrapmargin
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              (DEPRECATED) Equivalent to setting $wrap with a negative value.



       write_bcc
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether mutt writes out the Bcc header when  saving  mes&#8208;
              sages  to FCC. Bcc headers will never be written to a message when
              sending it. Note: this behavior is Debian specific.



       write_inc
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every $write_inc
              messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a single message
              will be displayed before writing a mailbox.

              Also see the $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables  and  the
              &#8220;tuning&#8221; section of the manual for performance considerations.



       xterm_icon
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;M%?n?AIL&amp;ail?&#8221;
&#12;              Controls the format of the icon title, as long as xterm_set_titles
              is enabled. This string is identical in formatting to the one used
              by &#8220;$status_format&#8221;.



       xterm_set_titles
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  whether  mutt sets the xterm title bar and icon name (as
              long as you are in an appropriate terminal).



       xterm_title
              Type: string
              Default: &#8220;Mutt with %?m?%m messages&amp;no messages?%?n? [%n NEW]?&#8221;

              Controls the format of the title bar of the  xterm  provided  that
              xterm_set_titles has been set. This string is identical in format&#8208;
              ting to the one used by &#8220;$status_format&#8221;.
