NAME
       mx-create-image-cache &#8212; program to make a cache of a directory


SYNOPSIS
       mx-create-image-cache

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mx-create-image-cache command.

       This  manual  page  was  written  for the Debian distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       mx-create-image-cache is a prgram to make a cache for a  directory  which
       contains  images.  It will create a cached image inside /var/cache/mx for
       all the images inside that directory and its sub-directories.
