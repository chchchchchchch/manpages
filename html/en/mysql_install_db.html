MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()                                            MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()



NAME
       mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data directory

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_install_db [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_install_db initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the
       system tables that it contains, if they do not exist.  mysql_install_db
       is a shell script and is available only on Unix platforms. (As of MySQL
       5.6, mysql_install_db is a Perl script and can be used on any system with
       Perl installed.)

       To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following syntax:

           shell&gt; mysql_install_db [options]

       Because the MySQL server, mysqld, must access the data directory when it
       runs later, you should either run mysql_install_db from the same system
       account that will be used for running mysqld, or run it as root and
       specify the --user option to indicate the user name that mysqld will run
       as. It might be necessary to specify other options such as --basedir or
       --datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the correct locations for the
       installation directory or data directory. For example:

           shell&gt; scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \
                    --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \
                    --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data


           Note
           If you have set a custom TMPDIR environment variable when performing
           the installation, and the specified directory is not accessible,
           mysql_install_db may fail. If so, unset TMPDIR or set TMPDIR to point
           to the system temporary directory (usually /tmp).

       mysql_install_db supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] group of an option file.
       (Options that are common to mysqld can also be specified in the [mysqld]
       group.) Other options are passed to mysqld. For information about option
       files used by MySQL programs, see Section 4.2.6, &#8220;Using Option Files&#8221;.

       &#183;   --help

           Display a help message and exit.

       &#183;   --basedir=path

           The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       &#183;   --builddir=path

           For use with --srcdir and out-of-source builds. Set this to the
           location of the directory where the built files reside.

       &#183;   --cross-bootstrap

           For internal use. This option is used for building system tables on
           one host intended for another.

       &#183;   --datadir=path
&#12;           The path to the MySQL data directory.

       &#183;   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

           Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
           before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
           relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
           rather than a full path name.

       &#183;   --defaults-file=file_name

           Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
           relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
           rather than a full path name.

       &#183;   --force

           Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work. Grant table
           entries normally created using host names will use IP addresses
           instead.

       &#183;   --ldata=path

           A synonym for --datadir.

       &#183;   --no-defaults

           Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading
           unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be used to
           prevent them from being read.

       &#183;   --rpm

           For internal use. This option is used during the MySQL installation
           process for install operations performed using RPM packages.

       &#183;   --skip-name-resolve

           Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant table
           entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.

       &#183;   --srcdir=path

           For internal use. This option specifies the directory under which
           mysql_install_db looks for support files such as the error message
           file and the file for populating the help tables.

       &#183;   --user=user_name

           The system (login) user name to use for running mysqld. Files and
           directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user. You must be
           the system root user to use this option. By default, mysqld runs
           using your current login name and files and directories that it
           creates will be owned by you.

       &#183;   --verbose

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       &#183;   --windows

           For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
           distributions.
