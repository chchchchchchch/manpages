MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)              MySQL Database System             MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)



NAME
       mysql_upgrade - check and upgrade MySQL tables

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_upgrade [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_upgrade examines all tables in all databases for incompatibilities
       with the current version of MySQL Server.  mysql_upgrade also upgrades
       the system tables so that you can take advantage of new privileges or
       capabilities that might have been added.

       If mysql_upgrade finds that a table has a possible incompatibility, it
       performs a table check and, if problems are found, attempts a table
       repair. If the table cannot be repaired, see Section 2.11.4, &#8220;Rebuilding
       or Repairing Tables or Indexes&#8221; for manual table repair strategies.

       You should execute mysql_upgrade each time you upgrade MySQL.

       If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the
       server and client RPMs.  mysql_upgrade is included in the server RPM but
       requires the client RPM because the latter includes mysqlcheck. (See
       Section 2.5.1, &#8220;Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages&#8221;.)

           Note
           On Windows Server 2008, Vista, and newer, you must run mysql_upgrade
           with administrator privileges. You can do this by running a Command
           Prompt as Administrator and running the command. Failure to do so may
           result in the upgrade failing to execute correctly.

           Caution
           You should always back up your current MySQL installation before
           performing an upgrade. See Section 7.2, &#8220;Database Backup Methods&#8221;.

           Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before
           you upgrade your MySQL installation and run mysql_upgrade. See
           Section 2.11.1, &#8220;Upgrading MySQL&#8221;, for instructions on determining
           whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how
           to handle them.

       To use mysql_upgrade, make sure that the server is running. Then invoke
       it like this:

           shell&gt; mysql_upgrade [options]

       After running mysql_upgrade, stop the server and restart it so that any
       changes made to the system tables take effect.

       If you have multiple MySQL server instances running, invoke mysql_upgrade
       with connection parameters appropriate for connecting to the desired
       server. For example, with servers running on the local host on parts 3306
       through 3308, upgrade each of them by connecting to the appropriate port:

           shell&gt; mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3306 [other_options]
           shell&gt; mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3307 [other_options]
           shell&gt; mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3308 [other_options]

       For local host connections on Unix, the --protocol=tcp option forces a
       connection using TCP/IP rather than the Unix socket file.

       mysql_upgrade executes the following commands to check and repair tables
       and to upgrade the system tables:

           mysqlcheck --no-defaults --all-databases
            --fix-db-names --fix-table-names
           mysqlcheck --no-defaults --check-upgrade --all-databases
            --auto-repair
           mysql &lt; fix_priv_tables

       Notes about the preceding commands:

       &#183;   mysql_upgrade also adds --write-binlog or --skip-write-binlog to the
           mysqlcheck commands, depending on whether the --write-binlog option
           was specified on the mysql_upgrade command.

       &#183;   Because mysql_upgrade invokes mysqlcheck with the --all-databases
           option, it processes all tables in all databases, which might take a
           long time to complete. Each table is locked and therefore unavailable
           to other sessions while it is being processed. Check and repair
           operations can be time-consuming, particularly for large tables.

       &#183;   For details about what checks the --check-upgrade option entails, see
           the description of the FOR UPGRADE option of the CHECK TABLE
           statement (see Section 13.7.2.2, &#8220;CHECK TABLE Syntax&#8221;).

       &#183;   fix_priv_tables represents a script generated internally by
           mysql_upgrade that contains SQL statements to upgrade the tables in
           the mysql database.

       All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL version
       number. This ensures that next time you run mysql_upgrade with the same
       version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need to check or
       repair the table again.

       mysql_upgrade also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
       mysql_upgrade_info in the data directory. This is used to quickly check
       whether all tables have been checked for this release so that
       table-checking can be skipped. To ignore this file and perform the check
       regardless, use the --force option.

       mysql_upgrade does not upgrade the contents of the help tables. For
       upgrade instructions, see Section 5.1.10, &#8220;Server-Side Help&#8221;.

       mysql_upgrade supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysql_upgrade] and [client] groups of an
       option file. Unrecognized options are passed to mysqlcheck. For
       information about option files, see Section 4.2.6, &#8220;Using Option Files&#8221;.

       &#183;   --help

           Display a short help message and exit.

       &#183;   --basedir=dir_name

           The path to the MySQL installation directory. This option is accepted
           for backward compatibility but ignored. It is removed in MySQL 5.7.

       &#183;   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 10.5,
           &#8220;Character Set Configuration&#8221;.

       &#183;   --compress

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       &#183;   --datadir=dir_name

           The path to the data directory. This option is accepted for backward
           compatibility but ignored. It is removed in MySQL 5.7.

       &#183;   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           d:t:o,file_name. The default is d:t:O,/tmp/mysql_upgrade.trace.

       &#183;   --debug-check

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       &#183;   --debug-info, -T

           Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when
           the program exits.

       &#183;   --default-auth=plugin

           A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use. See
           Section 6.3.6, &#8220;Pluggable Authentication&#8221;.

           This option was added in MySQL 5.5.10.

       &#183;   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 10.5,
           &#8220;Character Set Configuration&#8221;.

       &#183;   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

           Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
           before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. Before MySQL 5.5.8,
           file_name must be the full path name to the file. As of MySQL 5.5.8,
           the name is interpreted relative to the current directory if given as
           a relative path name.

       &#183;   --defaults-file=file_name

           Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. Before MySQL 5.5.8,
           file_name must be the full path name to the file. As of MySQL 5.5.8,
           the name is interpreted relative to the current directory if given as
           a relative path name.

       &#183;   --defaults-group-suffix=str

           Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the usual
           names and a suffix of str. For example, mysql_upgrade normally reads
           the [client] and [mysql_upgrade] groups. If the
           --defaults-group-suffix=_other option is given, mysql_upgrade also
           reads the [client_other] and [mysql_upgrade_other] groups.

       &#183;   --force

           Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info file and force execution even if
           mysql_upgrade has already been executed for the current version of
           MySQL.

       &#183;   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       &#183;   --no-defaults

           Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading
           unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be used to
           prevent them from being read.

       &#183;   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the password value following the
           --password or -p option on the command line, mysql_upgrade prompts
           for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, &#8220;End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security&#8221;. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on
           the command line.

       &#183;   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       &#183;   --plugin-dir=path

           The directory in which to look for plugins. It may be necessary to
           specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
           an authentication plugin but mysql_upgrade does not find it. See
           Section 6.3.6, &#8220;Pluggable Authentication&#8221;.

           This option was added in MySQL 5.5.10.

       &#183;   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       &#183;   --print-defaults

           Print the program name and all options that it gets from option
           files.

       &#183;   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
           permissible values, see Section 4.2.2, &#8220;Connecting to the MySQL
           Server&#8221;.

       &#183;   --shared-memory-base-name=name

           On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made using
           shared memory to a local server. The default value is MYSQL. The
           shared-memory name is case sensitive.

           The server must be started with the --shared-memory option to enable
           shared-memory connections.

       &#183;   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       &#183;   --ssl*

           Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
           server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
           certificates. See Section 6.3.9.4, &#8220;SSL Command Options&#8221;.

       &#183;   --tmpdir=dir_name, -t path

           The path name of the directory to use for creating temporary files.

       &#183;   --upgrade-system-tables, -s

           Upgrade only the system tables, do not upgrade data.

       &#183;   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The default
           user name is root.

       &#183;   --verbose

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       &#183;   --version-check, -k

           Check the version of the server to which mysql_upgrade is connecting
           to verify that it is the same as the version for which mysql_upgrade
           was built. If not, mysql_upgrade exits. This option is enabled by
           default; to disable the check, use --skip-version-check. This option
           was added in MySQL 5.5.32.

       &#183;   --write-binlog

           Cause binary logging to be enabled while mysql_upgrade runs. This is
           the default behavior; to disable binary logging during the upgrade,
           use the inverse of this option (that is, start the program with
           --skip-write-binlog).
