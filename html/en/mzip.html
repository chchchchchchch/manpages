Name
       mzip - change protection mode and eject disk on Zip/Jaz drive



Note of warning
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end  of
       this man page for details.

Description
       The  mzip  command  is used to issue ZIP disk specific commands on Linux,
       Solaris or HP-UX. Its syntax is:

       mzip [-epqrwx]


       Mzip allows the following command line options:

       e      Ejects the disk.

       f      Force eject even if the disk is mounted (must be given in addition
              to -e).

       r      Write protect the disk.

       w      Remove write protection.

       p      Password write protect.

       x      Password protect

       u      Temporarily  unprotect  the  disk  until  it is ejected.  The disk
              becomes writable, and reverts back to its old state when ejected.

       q      Queries the status

       To remove the password, set it to one of the password-less  modes  -r  or
       -w: mzip will then ask you for the password, and unlock the disk.  If you
       have forgotten the password, you can get rid of it by  low-level  format&#8208;
       ting the disk (using your SCSI adapter&apos;s BIOS setup).

       The  ZipTools disk shipped with the drive is also password protected.  On
       MS-DOS or on a Mac, this password is automatically removed once the  Zip&#8208;
       Tools  have  been  installed.   From various articles posted to Usenet, I
       learned that the password for the tools disk is APlaceForYourStuff.  Mzip
       knows about this password, and tries it first, before prompting you for a
       password.  Thus mzip -w z: unlocks the tools disk.   The  tools  disk  is
       formatted  in a special way so as to be usable both in a PC and in a Mac.
       On a PC, the Mac file  system  appears  as  a  hidden  file  named  `par&#8208;
       tishn.mac&apos;.  You may erase it to reclaim the 50 Megs of space taken up by
       the Mac file system.

Bugs
       This command is a big kludge.   A  proper  implementation  would  take  a
       rework of significant parts of mtools, but unfortunately I don&apos;t have the
       time for this right now. The main downside of this implementation is that
       it  is  inefficient  on  some  architectures (several successive calls to
       mtools, which defeats mtools&apos; caching).

&#12;Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&apos;s texinfo docu&#8208;
       mentation.  However,  this process is only approximative, and some items,
       such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla&#8208;
       tion  process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
       the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information  has  been  translated
       into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions  how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the follow&#8208;
              ing commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found  at  `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/man&#8208;
       ual/mtools.html&apos;

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs&apos; info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo  doc  looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
       the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the  quot&#8208;
       ing conventions used in info.
