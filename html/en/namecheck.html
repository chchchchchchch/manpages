NAMECHECK(1)                                                        NAMECHECK(1)



NAME
       namecheck - Check project names are not already taken.

ABOUT
       This is a simple tool to automate the testing of project names at the
       most common Open Source / Free Software hosting environments.

       Each new project requires a name, and those names are ideally unique.  To
       come up with names is hard, and testing to ensure they&apos;re not already in
       use is time-consuming - unless you have a tool such as this one.

CUSTOMIZATION
       The script, as-is, contains a list of sites, and patterns, to test
       against.

       If those patterns aren&apos;t sufficient then you may create your own
       additions and add them to the script.  If you wish to have your own
       version of the patterns you may save them into the file ~/.namecheckrc
