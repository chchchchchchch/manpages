DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       This  package  is  internal  and of no interest to users. It provides the
       commands of the name service facility which are shared by the client  and
       server  implemented  by  the  packages nameserv::server and nameserv (the
       client).

       This service is built in top of and for the package comm.  It has nothing
       to  do  with  the Internet&apos;s Domain Name System. If the reader is looking
       for a package dealing with that please  see  Tcllib&apos;s  packages  dns  and
       resolv.

API
       The package exports a single command, as specified below:

       ::nameserv::common::port
              The result returned by the command is the id of the default TCP/IP
              port a nameservice server will  listen  on,  and  a  name  service
              client will try to connect to.
