DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       This  package provides an implementation of the serviver side of the name
       service facility queried by the client provided by the package  nameserv.
       All  information  required by the server will be held in memory. There is
       no persistent state.

       This service is built in top of and for the package comm.  It has nothing
       to  do  with  the Internet&apos;s Domain Name System. If the reader is looking
       for a package dealing with that please  see  Tcllib&apos;s  packages  dns  and
       resolv.

       This server supports the Core protocol feature, and since version 0.3 the
       Search/Continuous feature as well.

API
       The package exports five commands, as specified below:

       ::nameserv::server::start
              This command starts the server and causes it to listen on the con&#8208;
              figured  port.  From  now  on clients are able to connect and make
              requests. The result of the command is the empty string.

              Note that any incoming requests will only be handled if the appli&#8208;
              cation  the  server is part of does enter an event loop after this
              command has been run.

       ::nameserv::server::stop
              Invoking this command stops the server and releases  all  informa&#8208;
              tion  it  had. Existing connections are shut down, and no new con&#8208;
              nections will be accepted any longer. The result of the command is
              the empty string.

       ::nameserv::server::active?
              This  command  returns a boolean value indicating the state of the
              server. The result will be true if the server is active, i.e.  has
              been started, and false otherwise.

       ::nameserv::server::cget -option
              This command returns the currently configured value for the speci&#8208;
              fied -option. The list of supported options and their meaning  can
              be found in section OPTIONS.

       ::nameserv::server::configure
              In  this  form  the  command returns a dictionary of all supported
              options, and their current values. The list of  supported  options
              and their meaning can be found in section OPTIONS.

       ::nameserv::server::configure -option
              In this form the command is an alias for &quot;::nameserv::server::cget
              -option]&quot;.  The list of supported options and their meaning can be
              found in section OPTIONS.

       ::nameserv::server::configure -option value...
              In  this  form the command is used to configure one or more of the
              supported options. At least one option has to  be  specified,  and
              each  option  is followed by its new value.  The list of supported
              options and their meaning can be found in section OPTIONS.

              This form can be used only if the server is not active,  i.e.  has
              not  been  started  yet,  or has been stopped. While the server is
              active it cannot be reconfigured.

OPTIONS
       The options supported by the server are for the specification of the  TCP
       port  to  listen  on, and whether to accept non-local connections or not.
       They are:

       -localonly bool
              This option specifies whether to  accept  only  local  connections
              (-localonly  1)  or remote connections as well (-localonly 0). The
              default is to accept only local connections.

       -port number
              This option specifies the port the name  service  will  listen  on
              after  it has been started. It has to be a positive integer number
              (&gt; 0) not greater than 65536 (unsigned short). The initial default
              is  the  number  returned  by the command ::nameserv::server::com&#8208;
              mon::port, as provided by the package ::nameserv::server::common.

HISTORY
       0.3    Extended the server with the ability to perform  asynchronous  and
              continuous searches.

       0.2    Changed name of -local switch to -localonly.

       0.1    Initial implementation of the server.
