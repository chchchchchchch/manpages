NANORC(5)                                                              NANORC(5)



NAME
       nanorc - GNU nano&apos;s rcfile

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents GNU nano&apos;s rcfile.

       nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico, the
       default editor included in the non-free Pine package.  Rather  than  just
       copying  Pico&apos;s look and feel, nano also implements some missing (or dis&#8208;
       abled by default) features in Pico, such as &quot;search and replace&quot; and  &quot;go
       to line and column number&quot;.

       The nanorc file contains the default settings for nano.  It should not be
       in DOS or Mac format.  During startup, nano will first read  its  system-
       wide  settings  from  SYSCONFDIR/nanorc,  and then user-specific settings
       from ~/.nanorc.


OPTIONS
       The configuration file accepts a series of set and unset commands,  which
       can  be  used to configure nano on startup without using the command line
       options.  Additionally, the syntax, color, and icolor keywords  are  used
       to  define  syntax  highlighting rules for different text patterns.  nano
       will read one command per line.

       Options in nanorc files take precedence over nano&apos;s defaults, and command
       line  options  override  nanorc  settings.   Also,  options  are unset by
       default, except for those that take arguments.

       Quotes inside string parameters don&apos;t  have  to  be  escaped  with  back&#8208;
       slashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as its end.
       For example, for the brackets option, &quot;&quot;&apos;)&gt;]}&quot; will match &quot;, &apos;, ), &gt;,  ],
       and }.

       The supported commands and arguments are:


       set/unset allow_insecure_backup
          When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its permis&#8208;
          sions can&apos;t be (re)set due to special OS considerations.   You  should
          NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

       set/unset autoindent
          Use auto-indentation.

       set/unset backup
          Create backup files in filename~.

       set backupdir directory
          Set  the directory where nano puts unique backup files if file backups
          are enabled.

       set/unset backwards
          Do backwards searches by default.

       set/unset boldtext
          Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

       set brackets string
          Set the characters treated as closing brackets when  justifying  para&#8208;
          graphs.   They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing punctua&#8208;
          tion, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end sentences.  The
          default value is &quot;&quot;&apos;)&gt;]}&quot;.

       set/unset casesensitive
          Do case sensitive searches by default.

       set/unset const
          Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.

       set/unset cut
          Use cut to end of line by default.

       set fill n
          Wrap  lines  at  column number n.  If n is 0 or less, the maximum line
          length will be the screen width less n columns.  The default value  is
          -8.

       set/unset historylog
          Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.

       set matchbrackets string
          Set  the  opening  and  closing  brackets that can be found by bracket
          searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set  must
          come  before  the latter set, and both must be in the same order.  The
          default value is &quot;(&lt;[{)&gt;]}&quot;.

       set/unset morespace
          Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

       set/unset mouse
          Enable mouse support, if available for  your  system.   When  enabled,
          mouse  clicks  can  be  used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
          double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work  in  the  X
          Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.

       set/unset multibuffer
          Allow inserting files into their own buffers.

       set/unset noconvert
          Don&apos;t convert files from DOS/Mac format.

       set/unset nofollow
          Don&apos;t follow symlinks when writing files.

       set/unset nohelp
          Don&apos;t display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.

       set/unset nonewlines
          Don&apos;t add newlines to the ends of files.

       set/unset nowrap
          Don&apos;t wrap text at all.

       set operatingdir directory
          nano will only read and write files inside directory and its subdirec&#8208;
          tories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so files  are
          inserted  from  this  diractory.   By default, the operating directory
          feature is turned off.

       set/unset preserve
          Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

       set punct string
          Set the characters treated  as  closing  punctuation  when  justifying
          paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing punc&#8208;
          tuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can  end  sentences.
          The default value is &quot;!.?&quot;.

       set/unset quiet
          nano  will  not  report  errors  in the nanorc file and ask them to be
          acknowledged by pressing enter at startup.  If this is used it  should
          be placed at the top of the file to be fully effective.

       set/unset quickblank
          Do  quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after
          1 keystroke instead of 25.

       set quotestr string
          The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.  This
          is an extended regular expression if your system supports them, other&#8208;
          wise a literal string.  The default value is  &quot;^([ \t]*[#:&gt;\|}])+&quot;  if
          you have extended regular expression support, or &quot;&gt; &quot; otherwise.  Note
          that &apos;\t&apos; stands for a literal Tab character.

       set/unset rebinddelete
          Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete
          work  properly.   You should only need to use this option if Backspace
          acts like Delete on your system.

       set/unset rebindkeypad
          Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.  You
          should  only  need  to use this option if they don&apos;t, as mouse support
          won&apos;t work properly with this option enabled.

       set/unset regexp
          Do extended regular expression searches by default.

       set/unset smarthome
          Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but  at  the
          very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will
          jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the  cursor
          is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the
          line.

       set/unset smooth
          Use smooth scrolling by default.

       set/unset softwrap
          Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lones.

       set speller spellprog
          Use spelling checker spellprog instead  of  the  built-in  one,  which
          calls spell.

       set/unset suspend
          Allow nano to be suspended.

       set tabsize n
          Use  a  tab size of n columns.  The value of n must be greater than 0.
          The default value is 8.

       set/unset tabstospaces
          Convert typed tabs to spaces.

       set/unset tempfile
          Save automatically on exit, don&apos;t prompt.

       set/unset undo
          Enable experimental generic-purpose undo code.

       set/unset view
          Disallow file modification.
&#12;       set/unset softwrap
          Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lones.

       set whitespace string
          Set the two characters used to display the first  characters  of  tabs
          and spaces.  They must be single-column characters.

       set/unset wordbounds
          Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation charac&#8208;
          ters as parts of words.

       syntax str [&quot;fileregex&quot; ... ]
          Defines a syntax named str which can be activated via the  -Y/--syntax
          command line option, or will be automatically activated if the current
          filename matches the extended regular expression fileregex.  All  fol&#8208;
          lowing  color  and  icolor statements will apply to syntax until a new
          syntax is defined.

          The none syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is  the
          same as not having a syntax at all.  The default syntax is special: it
          takes no fileregex, and applies to files that don&apos;t  match  any  other
          syntax&apos;s fileregex.

       color fgcolor,bgcolor regex ...
          For the currently defined syntax, display all expressions matching the
          extended regular expression regex with foreground  color  fgcolor  and
          background  color  bgcolor,  at  least one of which must be specified.
          Legal colors for foreground and background color  are:  white,  black,
          red,  blue,  green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.  You may use the prefix
          &quot;bright&quot; to force a stronger color highlight for the  foreground.   If
          your  terminal  supports  transparency, not specifying a bgcolor tells
          nano to attempt to use a transparent background.

       icolor fgcolor,bgcolor regex ...
          Same as above, except that the expression matching  is  case  insensi&#8208;
          tive.

       color fgcolor,bgcolor start=&quot;sr&quot; end=&quot;er&quot;
          Display  expressions  which start with the extended regular expression
          sr and end with the extended regular  expression  er  with  foreground
          color fgcolor and background color bgcolor, at least one of which must
          be specified.  This allows syntax highlighting to span multiple lines.
          Note  that all subsequent instances of sr after an initial sr is found
          will be highlighted until the first instance of er.

       icolor fgcolor,bgcolor start=&quot;sr&quot; end=&quot;er&quot;
          Same as above, except that the expression matching  is  case  insensi&#8208;
          tive.

       include syntaxfile
          Read in self-contained color syntaxes from syntaxfile.  Note that syn&#8208;
          taxfile can only contain syntax, color, and icolor commands.

KEY BINDINGS
       Key bindings may be reassigned via the following commands:

       bind key function menu
