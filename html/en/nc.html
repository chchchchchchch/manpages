NAME
       nc - TCP/IP swiss army knife

SYNOPSIS
       nc [-options] hostname port[s] [ports] ...
       nc -l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]

DESCRIPTION
       netcat  is  a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across net&#8208;
       work connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reli&#8208;
       able  &quot;back-end&quot; tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other
       programs and scripts.  At the same time, it  is  a  feature-rich  network
       debugging  and  exploration  tool, since it can create almost any kind of
       connection you would need and has several interesting built-in  capabili&#8208;
       ties.   Netcat,  or &quot;nc&quot; as the actual program is named, should have been
       supplied long ago as another one  of  those  cryptic  but  standard  Unix
       tools.

       In  the  simplest  usage,  &quot;nc host port&quot; creates a TCP connection to the
       given port on the given target host.  Your standard input is then sent to
       the  host,  and anything that comes back across the connection is sent to
       your standard output.  This continues  indefinitely,  until  the  network
       side  of the connection shuts down.  Note that this behavior is different
       from most other applications which shut everything down and exit after an
       end-of-file on the standard input.

       Netcat  can  also  function as a server, by listening for inbound connec&#8208;
       tions on arbitrary ports and then doing the  same  reading  and  writing.
       With minor limitations, netcat doesn&apos;t really care if it runs in &quot;client&quot;
       or &quot;server&quot; mode -- it still shovels data  back  and  forth  until  there
       isn&apos;t  any more left. In either mode, shutdown can be forced after a con&#8208;
       figurable time of inactivity on the network side.

       And it can do this via UDP too, so netcat is possibly  the  &quot;udp  telnet-
       like&quot;  application  you  always wanted for testing your UDP-mode servers.
       UDP, as the &quot;U&quot; implies, gives less reliable data transmission  than  TCP
       connections  and  some  systems may have trouble sending large amounts of
       data that way, but it&apos;s still a useful capability to have.

       You may be asking &quot;why not  just  use  telnet  to  connect  to  arbitrary
       ports?&quot; Valid question, and here are some reasons.  Telnet has the &quot;stan&#8208;
       dard input EOF&quot; problem, so one must introduce calculated delays in driv&#8208;
       ing  scripts  to allow network output to finish.  This is the main reason
       netcat stays running until the *network* side closes.  Telnet  also  will
       not transfer arbitrary binary data, because certain characters are inter&#8208;
       preted as telnet options and are thus removed from the data stream.  Tel&#8208;
       net  also emits some of its diagnostic messages to standard output, where
       netcat keeps such things religiously separated from its *output* and will
       never  modify any of the real data in transit unless you *really* want it
       to.  And of course telnet is incapable of listening for  inbound  connec&#8208;
       tions,  or  using  UDP instead.  Netcat doesn&apos;t have any of these limita&#8208;
       tions, is much smaller and faster than telnet, and has many other  advan&#8208;
       tages.

OPTIONS
       -c string    specify  shell commands to exec after connect (use with cau&#8208;
                    tion).  The string is passed to /bin/sh  -c  for  execution.
                    See  the -e option if you don&apos;t have a working /bin/sh (Note
                    that POSIX-conformant system must have one).

       -e filename  specify filename to exec after connect (use  with  caution).
                    See the -c option for enhanced functionality.

       -g gateway   source-routing hop point[s], up to 8

       -G num       source-routing pointer: 4, 8, 12, ...

       -h           display help

       -i secs      delay interval for lines sent, ports scanned

       -l           listen mode, for inbound connects

       -n           numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS

       -o file      hex dump of traffic

       -p port      local port number (port numbers can be individual or ranges:
                    lo-hi [inclusive])

       -q seconds   after EOF on stdin, wait the specified number of seconds and
                    then quit. If seconds is negative, wait forever.

       -b           allow UDP broadcasts

       -r           randomize local and remote ports

       -s addr      local source address

       -t           enable telnet negotiation

       -u           UDP mode

       -v           verbose [use twice to be more verbose]

       -w secs      timeout for connects and final net reads

       -z           zero-I/O mode [used for scanning]

       -T type      set  TOS  flag  (type may be one of &quot;Minimize-Delay&quot;, &quot;Maxi&#8208;
                    mize-Throughput&quot;,  &quot;Maximize-Reliability&quot;,   or   &quot;Minimize-
                    Cost&quot;.)

COPYRIGHT
       Netcat  is  entirely  my  own creation, although plenty of other code was
       used as examples.  It is freely given away to the Internet  community  in
       the  hope  that  it  will  be  useful, with no restrictions except giving
       credit where it is due.  No GPLs, Berkeley copyrights or any of that non&#8208;
       sense.   The author assumes NO responsibility for how anyone uses it.  If
       netcat makes you rich somehow and you&apos;re  feeling  generous,  mail  me  a
       check.   If  you  are affiliated in any way with Microsoft Network, get a
       life.  Always ski in control.  Comments, questions, and patches  to  hob&#8208;
       bit@avian.org.

NOTES
       Some port names in /etc/services contain hyphens -- netcat currently will
       not correctly parse those unless you escape the hyphens with  backslashes
       (e.g. &quot;netcat localhost &apos;ftp\-data&apos;&quot;).

BUGS
       Efforts  have  been  made  to have netcat &quot;do the right thing&quot; in all its
       various modes.  If you believe that it is doing  the  wrong  thing  under
       whatever  circumstances,  please  notify  me and tell me how you think it
       should behave.  If netcat is not able to do some task you think up, minor
       tweaks  to the code will probably fix that.  It provides a basic and eas&#8208;
       ily-modified template for writing other network applications, and I  cer&#8208;
       tainly  encourage people to make custom mods and send in any improvements
       they make to it. Continued feedback from the Internet community is always
       welcome!
