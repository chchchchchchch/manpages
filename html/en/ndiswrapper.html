NDISWRAPPER(8)                                                    NDISWRAPPER(8)



NAME
       ndiswrapper  -  Linux  kernel  module and user space tool to load and run
       Windows XP drivers for wireless cards

SYNOPSIS
       ndiswrapper

DESCRIPTION
       ndiswrapper is two parts: user space tool that is used to install Windows
       XP  drivers  and  kernel  module to load the Windows XP drivers. Both are
       called ndiswrapper.


ndiswrapper - tool
       The user space tool (/usr/sbin/ndiswrapper) is used whenever a  new  Win&#8208;
       dows  XP  driver  is  to  be  installed. This program takes the following
       options:

       OPTIONS

       -i &lt;inf file&gt;
              installs new Windows XP driver, where &lt;inf file&gt; is full  path  to
              INF file for that driver.

       -l     lists the currently installed drivers.

       -e &lt;driver&gt;
              removes an installed Windows XP driver named &lt;driver&gt;.

       -m     writes  an  alias  for wlan0 (default wireless device) into module
              configuration file so that ndiswrapper  kernel  module  is  loaded
              automatically when this interface is used.


ndiswrapper - kernel module
       The  kernel  module loads the installed Windows drivers and executes them
       so that the wireless cards can be used in Linux.  The  module  takes  the
       following options:

       OPTIONS

       if_name=&lt;basename&gt;
              The  default  basename  for  the  interface is wlan%d, so that the
              wireless cards will be configured as  wlan0,  wlan1,  ...  (%d  is
              replaced  with  lowest  available  number).  You may use any other
              basename or fixed name, such as eth%d, ndis2 etc.

       proc_uid=&lt;uid&gt;
              The module creates files  in  /proc/net/ndiswrapper  that  provide
              some  useful information. These files are created so that they can
              be read only by root by default.  If  some  other  user  needs  to
              access  these  files without having to login as root, then replace
              &lt;uid&gt; with the user ID of that user.

       proc_gid=&lt;gid&gt;
              The module creates files  in  /proc/net/ndiswrapper  that  provide
              some  useful information. These files are created so that they can
              be read only by people in root group by  default.  If  users  from
              other  groups  need to access these files, then replace &lt;gid&gt; with
              the group ID of those users.

              ndiswrapper kernel module uses loadndisdriver user space  tool  to
              load  all  the  Windows drivers. This tool is not to be used under
              normal circumstances.  Only when  ndiswrapper  module  is  already
              loaded  and  a  new Windows XP driver is installed (by ndiswrapper
              user space tool) and you want  the  kernel  module  to  load  that
              driver  without  having  to unload the module that you need to use
              it.
