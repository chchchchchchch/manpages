RINT(3)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    RINT(3)



NAME
       nearbyint,  nearbyintf, nearbyintl, rint, rintf, rintl - round to nearest
       integer

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double nearbyint(double x);
       float nearbyintf(float x);
       long double nearbyintl(long double x);

       double rint(double x);
       float rintf(float x);
       long double rintl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The  nearbyint()  functions  round  their argument to an integer value in
       floating-point format, using the current  rounding  direction  (see  fes&#8208;
       etround(3)) and without raising the inexact exception.

       The  rint()  functions  do the same, but will raise the inexact exception
       (FE_INEXACT, checkable via fetestexcept(3)) when the  result  differs  in
       value from the argument.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the rounded integer value.

       If x is integral, +0, -0, NaN, or infinite, x itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.  POSIX.1-2001 documents a range error for overflows, but
       see NOTES.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 contain text about overflow (which might set errno
       to  ERANGE,  or raise an FE_OVERFLOW exception).  In practice, the result
       cannot overflow on any current machine, so this error-handling  stuff  is
       just  nonsense.  (More precisely, overflow can happen only when the maxi&#8208;
       mum value of the exponent is smaller than the number  of  mantissa  bits.
       For  the  IEEE-754  standard 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers the
       maximum value of the exponent is 128 (respectively, 1024), and the number
       of mantissa bits is 24 (respectively, 53).)

       If  you  want to store the rounded value in an integer type, you probably
       want to use one of the functions described in lrint(3) instead.
