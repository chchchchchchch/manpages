DESCRIPTION
       dot  draws  directed graphs.  It works well on DAGs and other graphs that
       can be drawn as hierarchies.  It reads attributed graph files and  writes
       drawings.   By default, the output format dot is the input file with lay&#8208;
       out coordinates appended.

       neato draws undirected graphs using ``spring&apos;&apos;  models  (see  Kamada  and
       Kawai,  Information  Processing  Letters  31:1, April 1989).  Input files
       must be formatted in the dot attributed graph language.  By default,  the
       output of neato is the input graph with layout coordinates appended.

       twopi  draws  graphs  using  a  radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on
       Graph Drawing GD&apos;97, September, 1997).  Basically, one node is chosen  as
       the  center  and  put at the origin.  The remaining nodes are placed on a
       sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin,  each  a  fixed
       radial  distance from the previous circle.  All nodes distance 1 from the
       center are placed on the first circle; all nodes distance 1 from  a  node
       on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so forth.

       circo  draws  graphs  using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD &apos;99
       and ALENEX &apos;99, and Kaufmann and Wiese, GD  &apos;02.)   The  tool  identifies
       biconnected  components and draws the nodes of the component on a circle.
       The block&#8208;cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive  radial  algo&#8208;
       rithm.  Edge  crossings  within a circle are minimized by placing as many
       edges on the circle&apos;s perimeter as possible.  In particular, if the  com&#8208;
       ponent is outerplanar, the component will have a planar layout.

       If  a  node  belongs  to multiple non&#8208;trivial biconnected components, the
       layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this is the  first  non&#8208;
       trivial component found in the search from the root component.

       fdp  draws  undirected  graphs  using  a ``spring&apos;&apos; model. It relies on a
       force&#8208;directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman  and  Reingold  (cf.
       Software&#8208;Practice &amp; Experience 21(11), 1991, pp. 1129&#8208;1164).

       sfdp  also  draws  undirected graphs using the ``spring&apos;&apos; model described
       above, but it uses a multi-scale approach to  produce  layouts  of  large
       graphs in a reasonably short time.

OUTPUT FORMATS
       Dot  uses  an extensible plugin mechanism for its output renderers, so to
       see what output formats your installation of dot  supports  you  can  use
       ``dot  -Txxx&apos;&apos;  (where  xxx  is an unlikely format) and check the warning
       message.  Also, The plugin mechanism supports multiple implementations of
       the  output  formats.  To see what variants are available, use, for exam&#8208;
       ple: ``dot -Tpng:&apos;&apos; and to force a particular variant, use, for  example:
       ``dot -Tpng:gd&apos;&apos;

       Traditionally,  dot  supports  the  following:  -Tps  (PostScript), -Tsvg
       -Tsvgz  (Structured  Vector  Graphics),  -Tfig  (XFIG  graphics),   -Tmif
       (FrameMaker  graphics),  -Thpgl  (HP  pen  plotters), and -Tpcl (Laserjet
       printers), -Tpng -Tgif (bitmap graphics), -Tdia  (GTK+  based  diagrams),
       -Timap (imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge that has a
       non&#8208;null &quot;href&quot; attribute.), -Tcmapx (client&#8208;side  imagemap  for  use  in
       html  and  xhtml).  Additional less common or more special&#8208;purpose output
       formats  can  be   found   at   http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/out&#8208;
       put.html.)

       Alternative  plugins  providing  support for a given output format can be
       found from the error message resulting from appending a &apos;:&apos; to  the  for&#8208;
       mat. e.g. -Tpng: The first plugin listed is always the default.

       The  -P switch can be used to produce a graph of all output variants sup&#8208;
       ported by plugins in the local installation of graphviz.

GRAPH FILE LANGUAGE
       Here is a synopsis of the graph file language,  traditionally  using  the
       extension .dot, for graphs:

       [strict] (graph|digraph) name { statement&#8208;list }
       Is  the  top  level graph. If the graph is strict then multiple edges are
       not allowed between the same pairs of nodes.  If it is a directed  graph,
       indicated  by  digraph,  then  the edgeop must be &quot;-&gt;&quot;. If it is an undi&#8208;
       rected graph then the edgeop must be &quot;--&quot;.  Statements may be:

       name=val;
       node [name=val];
       edge [name=val];
       Set default graph, node, or edge attribute name to  val.   Any  subgraph,
       node, or edge appearing after this inherits the new default attributes.

       n0 [name0=val0,name1=val1,...];
       Creates  node  n0  (if it does not already exist) and sets its attributes
       according to the optional list.

       n0 edgeop n1 edgeop ... edgeop nn [name0=val0,name1=val1,...];
       Creates edges between nodes n0, n1, ..., nn  and  sets  their  attributes
       according to the optional list.  Creates nodes as necessary.

       [subgraph name] { statement&#8208;list }
       Creates a subgraph.  Subgraphs may be used in place of n0, ..., nn in the
       above statements to create edges.  [subgraph name] is optional; if  miss&#8208;
       ing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name.

       Comments may be /*C&#8208;like*/ or //C++&#8208;like.


       Attribute names and values are ordinary (C&#8208;style) strings.  The following
       sections describe attributes that control graph layout.


GRAPH ATTRIBUTES
       size=&quot;x,y&quot; sets bounding box of drawing in inches.

       page=&quot;x,y&quot; sets the PostScript pagination unit.

       ratio=f sets the aspect ratio to f which may be a floating point  number,
       or one of the keywords fill, compress, or auto.

       layout=engine indicates the preferred layout engine (&quot;dot&quot;, &quot;neato&quot;, fdp&quot;
       etc) overriding the default from the basename of the command  or  the  -K
       commandline option.

       margin=f sets the page margin (included in the page size).

       nodesep=f sets the minimum separation between nodes.

       ranksep=f sets the minimum separation between ranks.

       ordering=out  constrains  order  of  out&#8208;edges in a subgraph according to
       their file sequence.

       rankdir=LR|RL|BT requests a left&#8208;to&#8208;right, right&#8208;to&#8208;left,  or  bottom&#8208;to&#8208;
       top, drawing.

       pagedir=[TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of pagination.

       rank=same (or min or max) in a subgraph constrains the rank assignment of
       its nodes.   If a subgraph&apos;s name has the prefix cluster, its  nodes  are
       drawn in a distinct rectangle of the layout.  Clusters may be nested.

       rotate=90  sets landscape mode.  (orientation=land is backward compatible
       but obsolete.)

       center=n a non&#8208;zero value centers the drawing on the page.

       nslimit=f or mclimit=f adjusts the bound on the number of network simplex
       or mincross iterations by the given ratio.  For example, mclimit=2.0 runs
       twice as long.

       layers=&quot;id:id:id:id&quot; is a sequence of layer identifiers for overlay  dia&#8208;
       grams.   The  PostScript array variable layercolorseq sets the assignment
       of colors to layers. The least index is 1 and  each  element  must  be  a
       3&#8208;element array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.

       color=colorvalue sets foreground color (bgcolor for background).

       href=&quot;url&quot;  the default url for image map files; in PostScript files, the
       base URL for all relative URLs, as recognized by  Acrobat  Distiller  3.0
       and up.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       stylesheet=&quot;file.css&quot;  includes  a reference to a stylesheet in -Tsvg and
       -Tsvgz outputs.  Ignored by other formats.

       splines. If set to true, edges are drawn as splines.  If set to polyline,
       edges  are  drawn  as  polylines.   If  set  to ortho, edges are drawn as
       orthogonal polylines.  In all of these cases, the nodes may not  overlap.
       If  splines=false or splines=line, edges are drawn as line segments.  The
       default is true for dot, and false for all other layouts.


       (neato&#8208;specific attributes)
       start=val.  Requests random initial placement and seeds the random number
       generator.   If  val is not an integer, the process ID or current time is
       used as the seed.

       epsilon=n.  Sets the cutoff for the solver.  The default is 0.1.


       (twopi&#8208;specific attributes)
       root=ctr. This specifies the node to be used as the center of the layout.
       If not specified, twopi will randomly pick one of the nodes that are fur&#8208;
       thest from a leaf node, where a leaf node is a node of degree  1.  If  no
       leaf nodes exists, an arbitrary node is picked as center.

       ranksep=val. Specifies the radial distance in inches between the sequence
       of rings. The default is 0.75.

       overlap=mode. This specifies what twopi should do if any  nodes  overlap.
       If mode is &quot;false&quot;, the program uses Voronoi diagrams to adjust the nodes
       to eliminate overlaps. If mode is &quot;scale&quot;, the layout is uniformly scaled
       up,  preserving  node  sizes,  until  nodes no longer overlap. The latter
       technique removes overlaps while preserving symmetry and structure, while
       the  former  removes overlaps more compactly but destroys symmetries.  If
       mode is &quot;true&quot; (the default), no repositioning is done.


       (circo&#8208;specific attributes)
       root=nodename. Specifies the name of a node occurring in the root  block.
       If  the  graph  is  disconnected,  the root node attribute can be used to
       specify additional root blocks.

       mindist=value. Sets the minimum separation  between  all  nodes.  If  not
       specified then circo uses a default value of 1.0.


       (fdp&#8208;specific attributes)
       K=val. Sets the default ideal node separation in the layout.

       maxiter=val.  Sets  the  maximum  number of iterations used to layout the
       graph.

       start=val. Adjusts the random initial placement of nodes with  no  speci&#8208;
       fied  position.   If val is is an integer, it is used as the seed for the
       random number generator.  If val is not an integer, a random  system&#8208;gen&#8208;
       erated  integer,  such  as the process ID or current time, is used as the
       seed.

NODE ATTRIBUTES
       height=d or width=d sets minimum height or width.  Adding  fixedsize=true
       forces these to be the actual size (text labels are ignored).

       shape=record polygon epsf builtin_polygon
       builtin_polygon is one of: plaintext ellipse oval circle egg triangle box
       diamond trapezium parallelogram house hexagon octagon note tab box3d com&#8208;
       ponent.   (Polygons  are  defined  or  modified  by  the  following  node
       attributes: regular,  peripheries,  sides,  orientation,  distortion  and
       skew.)   epsf  uses the node&apos;s shapefile attribute as the path name of an
       external EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node shape.

       label=text where text may include escaped newlines \n, \l, or \r for cen&#8208;
       ter,  left,  and  right  justified  lines.  The string &apos;\N&apos; value will be
       replaced by the node name.  The string &apos;\G&apos; value will be replaced by the
       graph name.  Record labels may contain recursive box lists delimited by {
       | }.  Port identifiers in labels are set off by angle brackets &lt;  &gt;.   In
       the graph file, use colon (such as, node0:port28).

       fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.

       fontname=name sets the label font family name.

       color=colorvalue  sets  the  outline color, and the default fill color if
       style=filled and fillcolor is not specified.

       fillcolor=colorvalue sets the fill color when style=filled.  If not spec&#8208;
       ified,  the  fillcolor  when  style=filled defaults to be the same as the
       outline color.

       fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.

       A colorvalue may be &quot;h,s,v&quot; (hue, saturation, brightness) floating  point
       numbers  between  0  and  1, or an X11 color name such as white black red
       green blue yellow magenta cyan or burlywood, or a &quot;#rrggbb&quot; (red,  green,
       blue, 2 hex characters each) value.

       style=filled solid dashed dotted bold invis or any Postscript code.

       layer=id  or  id:id  or  &quot;all&quot;  sets the node&apos;s active layers.  The empty
       string means no layers (invisible).

       The following attributes apply only to polygon shape nodes:

       regular=n if n is non&#8208;zero then the polygon is made regular, i.e. symmet&#8208;
       ric  about  the  x  and y axis, otherwise the polygon takes on the aspect
       ratio of the label.  builtin_polygons that are not  already  regular  are
       made  regular by this attribute.  builtin_polygons that are already regu&#8208;
       lar are not affected (i.e.  they cannot be made asymmetric).

       peripheries=n sets the number of periphery lines drawn around  the  poly&#8208;
       gon.    This   value   supersedes   the  number  of  periphery  lines  of
       builtin_polygons.

       sides=n sets the number of sides  to  the  polygon.  n&lt;3  results  in  an
       ellipse.  This attribute is ignored by builtin_polygons.

       orientation=f sets the orientation of the first apex of the polygon coun&#8208;
       terclockwise from the vertical, in degrees.  f may be  a  floating  point
       number.   The  orientation  of  labels is not affected by this attribute.
       This attribute is added to the initial orientation of builtin_polygons.

       distortion=f sets the amount of broadening of the top  and  narrowing  of
       the  bottom of the polygon (relative to its orientation).  Floating point
       values between -1 and +1 are suggested.  This  attribute  is  ignored  by
       builtin_polygons.

       skew=f  sets  the  amount  of right&#8208;displacement of the top and left&#8208;dis&#8208;
       placement of the bottom of the polygon  (relative  to  its  orientation).
       Floating point values between -1 and +1 are suggested.  This attribute is
       ignored by builtin_polygons.

       href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node  in  imagemap,  PostScript  and  SVG
       files.   The  substrings &apos;\N&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner
       as for the node label attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is sub&#8208;
       stituted with the node label string.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       target=&quot;target&quot;  is  a  target  string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and SVG,
       effective when nodes have a URL.  The target string is used to  determine
       which  window  of  the  browser  is  used  for  the  URL.   Setting it to
       &quot;_graphviz&quot; will open a new window if it doesn&apos;t already exist, or  reuse
       it  if it does.  If the target string is empty, the default, then no tar&#8208;
       get attribute is included in the output.  The substrings  &apos;\N&apos;  and  &apos;\G&apos;
       are  substituted  in  the  same  manner  as for the node label attribute.
       Additionally the substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the  node  label
       string.

       tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot;  is a tooltip string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and SVG,
       effective when nodes have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to  be  the
       same as the label string, but this attribute permits nodes without labels
       to still have tooltips thus permitting  denser  graphs.   The  substrings
       &apos;\N&apos;  and  &apos;\G&apos;  are substituted in the same manner as for the node label
       attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the  node
       label string.


       (circo&#8208;specific attributes)
       root=true/false.  This specifies that the block containing the given node
       be treated as the root of the spanning tree in the layout.


       (fdp&#8208;specific attributes)
       pin=val. If val is &quot;true&quot;, the node will remain at its initial position.


EDGE ATTRIBUTES
       minlen=n where n is an integer factor that applies  to  the  edge  length
       (ranks for normal edges, or minimum node separation for flat edges).

       weight=n  where n is the integer cost of the edge.  Values greater than 1
       tend to shorten the edge.  Weight 0 flat edges are ignored  for  ordering
       nodes.

       label=text where text may include escaped newlines \n, \l, or \r for cen&#8208;
       tered, left, or right justified lines.  If the substring &apos;\T&apos; is found in
       a label it will be replaced by the tail_node name.  If the substring &apos;\H&apos;
       is found in a label it will be replaced by the head_node  name.   If  the
       substring  &apos;\E&apos;  value  is  found  in  a  label  it  will be replaced by:
       tail_node_name-&gt;head_node_name If the substring &apos;\G&apos; is found in a  label
       it    will    be    replaced    by    the    graph    name.     or    by:
       tail_node_name--head_node_name for undirected graphs.

       fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.

       fontname=name sets the label font family name.

       fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.

       style=solid dashed dotted bold invis

       color=colorvalue sets the line color for edges.

       color=colorvaluelist a &apos;:&apos; separated list of colorvalue creates  parallel
       edges, one edge for each color.

       dir=forward back both none controls arrow direction.

       tailclip,headclip=false disables endpoint shape clipping.

       href=&quot;url&quot;  sets  the  url  for  the node in imagemap, PostScript and SVG
       files.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted  in  the
       same  manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring
       &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for  client&#8208;side  imagemaps  and  SVG,
       effective  when  edges  have  a  URL.  If the target string is empty, the
       default, then no target attribute is included in the  output.   The  sub&#8208;
       strings  &apos;\T&apos;,  &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner as
       for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substi&#8208;
       tuted with the edge label string.

       tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for client&#8208;side imagemaps effective
       when edges have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the
       edge  label string.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substi&#8208;
       tuted in the same manner as for the edge label  attribute.   Additionally
       the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       arrowhead,arrowtail=none,  normal,  inv, dot, odot, invdot, invodot, tee,
       empty, invempty, open, halfopen, diamond, odiamond, box, obox, crow.

       arrowsize                                   (norm_length=10,norm_width=5,
       inv_length=6,inv_width=7,dot_radius=2)

       headlabel,taillabel=string  for  port  labels.  labelfontcolor,labelfont&#8208;
       name,labelfontsize for head and tail labels.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;,  &apos;\H&apos;,
       &apos;\E&apos;  and  &apos;\G&apos;  are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
       attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the  edge
       label string.

       headhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the head port in imagemap, PostScript and
       SVG files.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are  substituted  in
       the  same  manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the sub&#8208;
       string &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       headURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;headURL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;headhref&quot;.)

       headtarget=&quot;headtarget&quot; is a target string for client&#8208;side imagemaps  and
       SVG, effective when edge heads have a URL.  The headtarget string is used
       to determine which window of the browser is used for  the  URL.   If  the
       headtarget  string is empty, the default, then headtarget defaults to the
       same value as target for the edge.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;,  &apos;\E&apos;  and
       &apos;\G&apos;  are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.
       Additionally the substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the  edge  label
       string.

       headtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot;  is  a  tooltip  string  for  client&#8208;side imagemaps
       effective when head ports have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to  be
       the  same  as  the headlabel string.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, and &apos;\E&apos;
       are substituted in the same manner  as  for  the  edge  label  attribute.
       Additionally  the  substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the edge label
       string.

       tailhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the tail port in imagemap, PostScript and
       SVG  files.   The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in
       the same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally  the  sub&#8208;
       string &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       tailURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;tailURL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;tailhref&quot;.)

       tailtarget=&quot;tailtarget&quot;  is a target string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and
       SVG, effective when edge tails have a URL.  The tailtarget string is used
       to  determine  which  window  of the browser is used for the URL.  If the
       tailtarget string is empty, the default, then tailtarget defaults to  the
       same  value  as target for the edge.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and
       &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label  attribute.
       Additionally  the  substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the edge label
       string.

       tailtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is  a  tooltip  string  for  client&#8208;side  imagemaps
       effective  when tail ports have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be
       the same as the taillabel string.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;,  &apos;\H&apos;,  &apos;\E&apos;  and
       &apos;\G&apos;  are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.
       Additionally the substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the  edge  label
       string.

       labeldistance  and  port_label_distance set distance; also labelangle (in
       degrees CCW)

       decorate draws line from edge to label.

       samehead,sametail aim edges having the same value to the same port, using
       the average landing point.

       constraint=false causes an edge to be ignored for rank assignment.

       layer=id  or  id:id  or  &quot;all&quot;  sets the edge&apos;s active layers.  The empty
       string means no layers (invisible).


       (neato&#8208;specific attributes)
       w=f sets the weight (spring constant) of an edge to  the  given  floating
       point  value.  The default is 1.0; greater values make the edge tend more
       toward its optimal length.

       len=f sets the optimal length of an edge.  The default is 1.0.
&#12;       (fdp&#8208;specific attributes)
       weight=f sets the weight of an edge to the given  floating  point  value.
       The  default  is  1.0;  greater values make the edge tend more toward its
       optimal length.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -G sets a default graph attribute.
       -N sets a default node attribute.
       -E sets a default  edge  attribute.   Example:  -Gsize=&quot;7,8&quot;  -Nshape=box
       -Efontsize=8

       -lfile  loads custom PostScript library files.  Usually these define cus&#8208;
       tom shapes or styles.  If -l is given by itself, the standard library  is
       omitted.

       -Tlang sets the output language as described above.


       -n[1|2]  (no&#8208;op) If set, neato assumes nodes have already been positioned
       and all nodes have a pos attribute giving the positions.   It  then  per&#8208;
       forms  an  optional  adjustment to remove node&#8208;node overlap, depending on
       the value of the overlap attribute, computes the edge layouts,  depending
       on  the value of the splines attribute, and emits the graph in the appro&#8208;
       priate format.  If num is supplied, the following actions occur:
           num = 1
       Equivalent to -n.
           num &gt; 1
       Use node positions as specified, with no adjustment to  remove  node&#8208;node
       overlaps,  and  use  any  edge  layouts  already  specified  by  the  pos
       attribute.  neato computes an edge layout for any edge that does not have
       a  pos  attribute.   As  usual,  edge  layout  is  guided  by the splines
       attribute.

       -Klayout override the default layout engine implied by the command name.

       -O automatically generate output filenames based on  the  input  filename
       and the -T format.

       -P generate a graph of the currently available plugins.

       -v (verbose) prints various information useful for debugging.

       -V (version) prints version information and exits.

       -? prints the usage and exits.

EXAMPLES
       digraph test123 {
               a -&gt; b -&gt; c;
               a -&gt; {x y};
               b [shape=box];
               c [label=&quot;hello\nworld&quot;,color=blue,fontsize=24,
                    fontname=&quot;Palatino-Italic&quot;,fontcolor=red,style=filled];
               a -&gt; z [label=&quot;hi&quot;, weight=100];
               x -&gt; z [label=&quot;multi-line\nlabel&quot;];
               edge [style=dashed,color=red];
               b -&gt; x;
               {rank=same; b x}
       }

       graph test123 {
               a -- b -- c;
               a -- {x y};
               x -- c [w=10.0];
               x -- y [w=5.0,len=3];
       }

CAVEATS
       Edge splines can overlap unintentionally.
&#12;       Flat  edge  labels  are  slightly  broken.   Intercluster edge labels are
       totally broken.

       Because unconstrained optimization is employed, node boxes  can  possibly
       overlap  or touch unrelated edges.  All existing spring embedders seem to
       have this limitation.

       Apparently reasonable attempts to pin nodes or adjust  edge  lengths  and
       weights can cause instability.
