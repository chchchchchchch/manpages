DESCRIPTION
       neomagic  is  an  Xorg driver for the Neomagic graphics chipsets found in
       many laptop computers.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       neomagic supports the following chipsets:

       MagicGraph 128    (NM2070)

       MagicGraph 128V   (NM2090)

       MagicGraph 128ZV  (NM2093)

       MagicGraph 128ZV+ (NM2097)

       MagicGraph 128XD  (NM2160)

       MagicGraph 256AV  (NM2200)

       MagicGraph 256AV+ (NM2230)

       MagicGraph 256ZX  (NM2360)

       MagicGraph 256XL+ (NM2380)

       The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24 for all chipsets  except  the
       NM2070  which  does  not  support  depth  24.  All depths are accelerated
       except for depth 24 which is only accelerated on NM2200 and newer models.
       All  visuals are supported in depth 8.  TrueColor and DirectColor visuals
       are supported in the other depths.


CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable  or  enable  software cursor.  Default: software cursor is
              disable and a hardware cursor is used.

       Option &quot;PCIBurst&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable PCI burst modes.  Default: enabled.

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot;
              Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.   This  mode  is
              unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              off.

       Option &quot;OverlayMem&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Reserve the given amount of memory (in bytes) for the XVideo over&#8208;
              lay.   On boards with limited memory, display of large XVideo buf&#8208;
              fers might fail due to insufficient available memory.  Using  this
              option  solves  the  problem at the expense of reducing the memory
              available for other operations.  For full-resolution DVDs,  829440
              bytes (720x576x2) are necessary.

       Note
       On  some  laptops using the 2160 chipset (MagicGraph 128XD) the following
       options are needed to avoid a lock-up of the graphic engine:
           Option &quot;XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect&quot;
           Option &quot;XaaNoScanlineCPUToScreenColorExpandFill&quot;
