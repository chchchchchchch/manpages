NEQN(1)                                                                  NEQN(1)



NAME
       neqn - format equations for ascii output

SYNOPSIS
       neqn [eqn options]

DESCRIPTION
       The neqn program is actually just a shell script which invokes the eqn(1)
       command with the ascii output device.

       Note that eqn does not support  low-resolution,  typewriter-like  devices
       (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

SEE ALSO
       eqn(1)
