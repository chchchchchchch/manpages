NET(8)                     System Administration tools                    NET(8)



NAME
       net - Tool for administration of Samba and remote CIFS servers.

SYNOPSIS
       net {&lt;ads|rap|rpc&gt;} [-h] [-w workgroup] [-W myworkgroup] [-U user]
        [-I ip-address] [-p port] [-n myname] [-s conffile] [-S server] [-l]
        [-P] [-d debuglevel] [-V] [--request-timeout seconds]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The Samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility
       available for windows and DOS. The first argument should be used to
       specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command. ADS is used
       for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can
       be used for NT4 and Windows 2000. If this argument is omitted, net will
       try to determine it automatically. Not all commands are available on all
       protocols.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       -k|--kerberos
           Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory
           environment.

       -w target-workgroup
           Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify either this
           option or the IP address or the name of a server.

       -W workgroup
           Sets client workgroup or domain

       -U user
           User name to use

       -I ip-address
           IP address of target server to use. You have to specify either this
           option or a target workgroup or a target server.

       -p port
           Port on the target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445).
           Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.

       -n|--netbiosname &lt;primary NetBIOS name&gt;
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses
           for itself. This is identical to setting the smb.conf.5.html#
           parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a command line setting will
           take precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
           server. The information in this file includes server-specific
           information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
           descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
           smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       -S server
           Name of target server. You should specify either this option or a
           target workgroup or a target IP address.

       -l
           When listing data, give more information on each item.

       -P
           Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the
           local server.

       --request-timeout 30
           Let client requests timeout after 30 seconds the default is 10
           seconds.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter
           is not specified is 0.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
           designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
           data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           smb.conf.5.html# parameter in the smb.conf file.

COMMANDS
   CHANGESECRETPW
       This command allows the Samba machine account password to be set from an
       external application to a machine account password that has already been
       stored in Active Directory. DO NOT USE this command unless you know
       exactly what you are doing. The use of this command requires that the
       force flag (-f) be used also. There will be NO command prompt. Whatever
       information is piped into stdin, either by typing at the command line or
       otherwise, will be stored as the literal machine password. Do NOT use
       this without care and attention as it will overwrite a legitimate machine
       password without warning. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

   TIME
       The NET TIME command allows you to view the time on a remote server or
       synchronise the time on the local server with the time on the remote
       server.

   TIME
       Without any options, the NET TIME command displays the time on the remote
       server.

   TIME SYSTEM
       Displays the time on the remote server in a format ready for /bin/date.

   TIME SET
       Tries to set the date and time of the local server to that on the remote
       server using /bin/date.

   TIME ZONE
       Displays the timezone in hours from GMT on the remote computer.

   [RPC|ADS] JOIN [TYPE] [-U username[%password]] [createupn=UPN]
       [createcomputer=OU] [options]
       Join a domain. If the account already exists on the server, and [TYPE] is
       MEMBER, the machine will attempt to join automatically. (Assuming that
       the machine has been created in server manager) Otherwise, a password
       will be prompted for, and a new account may be created.

       [TYPE] may be PDC, BDC or MEMBER to specify the type of server joining
       the domain.

       [UPN] (ADS only) set the principalname attribute during the join. The
       default format is host/netbiosname@REALM.

       [OU] (ADS only) Precreate the computer account in a specific OU. The OU
       string reads from top to bottom without RDNs, and is delimited by a &#180;/&#180;.
       Please note that &#180;\&#180; is used for escape by both the shell and ldap, so it
       may need to be doubled or quadrupled to pass through, and it is not used
       as a delimiter.

   [RPC] OLDJOIN [options]
       Join a domain. Use the OLDJOIN option to join the domain using the old
       style of domain joining - you need to create a trust account in server
       manager first.

   RPC TRUSTDOM
   RPC TRUSTDOM ADD DOMAIN
       Add a interdomain trust account for DOMAIN. This is in fact a Samba
       account named DOMAIN$ with the account flag &#180;I&#180; (interdomain trust
       account). This is required for incoming trusts to work. It makes Samba be
       a trusted domain of the foreign (trusting) domain. Users of the Samba
       domain will be made available in the foreign domain. If the command is
       used against localhost it has the same effect as smbpasswd -a -i DOMAIN.
       Please note that both commands expect a appropriate UNIX account.

   RPC TRUSTDOM DEL DOMAIN
       Remove interdomain trust account for DOMAIN. If it is used against
       localhost it has the same effect as smbpasswd -x DOMAIN$.

   RPC TRUSTDOM ESTABLISH DOMAIN
       Establish a trust relationship to a trusted domain. Interdomain account
       must already be created on the remote PDC. This is required for outgoing
       trusts to work. It makes Samba be a trusting domain of a foreign
       (trusted) domain. Users of the foreign domain will be made available in
       our domain. You&#180;ll need winbind and a working idmap config to make them
       appear in your system.

   RPC TRUSTDOM REVOKE DOMAIN
       Abandon relationship to trusted domain

   RPC TRUSTDOM LIST
       List all interdomain trust relationships.

   RPC TRUSTDOM LIST
       List all interdomain trust relationships.

   RPC TRUST
   RPC TRUST CREATE

       Properly populates the ldap tree with the basic accounts (Administrator)
       and groups (Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) on the ldap tree.

   IDMAP DUMP &lt;local tdb file name&gt;
       Dumps the mappings contained in the local tdb file specified. This
       command is useful to dump only the mappings produced by the idmap_tdb
       backend.

   IDMAP RESTORE [input file]
       Restore the mappings from the specified file or stdin.

   IDMAP SECRET &lt;DOMAIN&gt; &lt;secret&gt;
       Store a secret for the specified domain, used primarily for domains that

       number&quot; or a uid: &quot;UID number&quot;. Use -f to delete an invalid partial
       mapping &lt;ID&gt; -&gt; xx

       Use &quot;smbcontrol all idmap ...&quot; to notify running smbd instances. See the
       smbcontrol(1) manpage for details.

   IDMAP CHECK [-v] [-r] [-a] [-T] [-f] [-l] [--db=&lt;DB&gt;]
       Check and repair the IDMAP database. If no option is given a read only
       check of the database is done. Among others an interactive or automatic
       repair mode may be chosen with one of the following options:

       -r|--repair
           Interactive repair mode, ask a lot of questions.

       -a|--auto
           Noninteractive repair mode, use default answers.

       -v|--verbose
           Produce more output.

       -f|--force
           Try to apply changes, even if they do not apply cleanly.

       -T|--test
           Dry run, show what changes would be made but don&#180;t touch anything.

       -l|--lock
           Lock the database while doing the check.

       --db &lt;DB&gt;
           Check the specified database.

       It reports about the finding of the following errors:

       Missing reverse mapping:
           A record with mapping A-&gt;B where there is no B-&gt;A. Default action in
           repair mode is to &quot;fix&quot; this by adding the reverse mapping.

       Invalid mapping:
           A record with mapping A-&gt;B where B-&gt;C. Default action is to &quot;delete&quot;
           this record.

       Missing or invalid HWM:
           A high water mark is not at least equal to the largest ID in the
           database. Default action is to &quot;fix&quot; this by setting it to the
           largest ID found +1.

       Invalid record:
           Something we failed to parse. Default action is to &quot;edit&quot; it in
           interactive and &quot;delete&quot; it in automatic mode.

   USERSHARE
       Starting with version 3.0.23, a Samba server now supports the ability for
       non-root users to add user-defined shares to be exported using the &quot;net
       usershare&quot; commands.

       Members of the UNIX group &quot;sambashare&quot; can create user-defined shares on
       demand using the commands below.

       The usershare commands are:
           net usershare add sharename path [comment [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]] -
           to add or change a user defined share.
           net usershare delete sharename - to delete a user defined share.
           net usershare info [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to print info
           about a user defined share.
           net usershare list [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to list user
           defined shares.

   USERSHARE ADD sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]
       Add or replace a new user defined share, with name &quot;sharename&quot;.

       &quot;path&quot; specifies the absolute pathname on the system to be exported.
       Restrictions may be put on this, see the global smb.conf parameters:
       &quot;usershare owner only&quot;, &quot;usershare prefix allow list&quot;, and &quot;usershare
       prefix deny list&quot;.

       The optional &quot;comment&quot; parameter is the comment that will appear on the
       share when browsed to by a client.

       The optional &quot;acl&quot; field specifies which users have read and write access
       to the entire share. Note that guest connections are not allowed unless
       the smb.conf parameter &quot;usershare allow guests&quot; has been set. The
       definition of a user defined share acl is: &quot;user:permission&quot;, where user
       is a valid username on the system and permission can be &quot;F&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, or &quot;D&quot;.
       &quot;F&quot; stands for &quot;full permissions&quot;, ie. read and write permissions. &quot;D&quot;
       stands for &quot;deny&quot; for a user, ie. prevent this user from accessing this
       share. &quot;R&quot; stands for &quot;read only&quot;, ie. only allow read access to this
       share (no creation of new files or directories or writing to files).

       The default if no &quot;acl&quot; is given is &quot;Everyone:R&quot;, which means any
       authenticated user has read-only access.

       The optional &quot;guest_ok&quot; has the same effect as the parameter of the same
       name in smb.conf, in that it allows guest access to this user defined
       share. This parameter is only allowed if the global parameter &quot;usershare
       allow guests&quot; has been set to true in the smb.conf.


       There is no separate command to modify an existing user defined share,
       just use the &quot;net usershare add [sharename]&quot; command using the same
       sharename as the one you wish to modify and specify the new options you
       wish. The Samba smbd daemon notices user defined share modifications at
       connect time so will see the change immediately, there is no need to
       restart smbd on adding, deleting or changing a user defined share.

   USERSHARE DELETE sharename
       Deletes the user defined share by name. The Samba smbd daemon immediately
       notices this change, although it will not disconnect any users currently
       connected to the deleted share.

   USERSHARE INFO [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename]
       Get info on user defined shares owned by the current user matching the
       given pattern, or all users.

       net usershare info on its own dumps out info on the user defined shares
       that were created by the current user, or restricts them to share names
       that match the given wildcard pattern (&#180;*&#180; matches one or more
       characters, &#180;?&#180; matches only one character). If the &#180;-l&#180; or &#180;--long&#180;
       option is also given, it prints out info on user defined shares created
       by other users.

       The information given about a share looks like: [foobar]
       path=/home/jeremy comment=testme usershare_acl=Everyone:F guest_ok=n And
       is a list of the current settings of the user defined share that can be
       modified by the &quot;net usershare add&quot; command.

   USERSHARE LIST [-l|--long] wildcard sharename
       List all the user defined shares owned by the current user matching the
       given pattern, or all users.

       net usershare list on its own list out the names of the user defined
       shares that were created by the current user, or restricts the list to
       share names that match the given wildcard pattern (&#180;*&#180; matches one or
       more characters, &#180;?&#180; matches only one character). If the &#180;-l&#180; or &#180;--long&#180;
       option is also given, it includes the names of user defined shares
       created by other users.

   CONF
       Starting with version 3.2.0, a Samba server can be configured by data
       stored in registry. This configuration data can be edited with the new
       &quot;net conf&quot; commands.

       The deployment of this configuration data can be activated in two levels
       from the smb.conf file: Share definitions from registry are activated by
       setting registry shares to &#8220;yes&#8221; in the [global] section and global
       configuration options are activated by setting include = registry in the
       [global] section for a mixed configuration or by setting config backend =
       registry in the [global] section for a registry-only configuration. See
       the smb.conf(5) manpage for details.

       The conf commands are:
           net conf list - Dump the complete configuration in smb.conf like
           format.
           net conf import - Import configuration from file in smb.conf format.
           net conf listshares - List the registry shares.
           net conf drop - Delete the complete configuration from registry.
           net conf showshare - Show the definition of a registry share.
           net conf addshare - Create a new registry share.
           net conf delshare - Delete a registry share.
           net conf setparm - Store a parameter.
           net conf getparm - Retrieve the value of a parameter.
           net conf delparm - Delete a parameter.
           net conf getincludes - Show the includes of a share definition.
           net conf setincludes - Set includes for a share.
           net conf delincludes - Delete includes from a share definition.

   CONF LIST
       Print the configuration data stored in the registry in a smb.conf-like
       format to standard output.

   CONF IMPORT [--test|-T] filename [section]
       This command imports configuration from a file in smb.conf format. If a
       section encountered in the input file is present in registry, its
       contents is replaced. Sections of registry configuration that have no
       counterpart in the input file are not affected. If you want to delete
       these, you will have to use the &quot;net conf drop&quot; or &quot;net conf delshare&quot;
       commands. Optionally, a section may be specified to restrict the effect
       of the import command to that specific section. A test mode is enabled by
       specifying the parameter &quot;-T&quot; on the commandline. In test mode, no
       changes are made to the registry, and the resulting configuration is
       printed to standard output instead.

   CONF LISTSHARES
       List the names of the shares defined in registry.

   CONF DROP
       Delete the complete configuration data from registry.

   CONF SHOWSHARE sharename
       Show the definition of the share or section specified. It is valid to
       specify &quot;global&quot; as sharename to retrieve the global configuration
       options from registry.

   CONF ADDSHARE sharename path [writeable={y|N} [guest_ok={y|N} [comment]]]
       Create a new share definition in registry. The sharename and path have to
       be given. The share name may not be &quot;global&quot;. Optionally, values for the
       very common options &quot;writeable&quot;, &quot;guest ok&quot; and a &quot;comment&quot; may be
       specified. The same result may be obtained by a sequence of &quot;net conf
       setparm&quot; commands.

   CONF DELSHARE sharename
       Delete a share definition from registry.

   CONF SETPARM section parameter value
       Store a parameter in registry. The section may be global or a sharename.
       The section is created if it does not exist yet.

   CONF GETPARM section parameter
       Show a parameter stored in registry.

   CONF DELPARM section parameter
       Delete a parameter stored in registry.

   CONF GETINCLUDES section
       Get the list of includes for the provided section (global or share).

       Note that due to the nature of the registry database and the nature of
       include directives, the includes need special treatment: Parameters are
       stored in registry by the parameter name as valuename, so there is only
       ever one instance of a parameter per share. Also, a specific order like
       in a text file is not guaranteed. For all real parameters, this is
       perfectly ok, but the include directive is rather a meta parameter, for
       which, in the smb.conf text file, the place where it is specified between
       the other parameters is very important. This can not be achieved by the
       simple registry smbconf data model, so there is one ordered list of
       includes per share, and this list is evaluated after all the parameters
       of the share.

       Further note that currently, only files can be included from registry
       configuration. In the future, there will be the ability to include
       configuration data from other registry keys.

   CONF SETINCLUDES section [filename]+
       Set the list of includes for the provided section (global or share) to
       the given list of one or more filenames. The filenames may contain the
       usual smb.conf macros like %I.

   CONF DELINCLUDES section
       Delete the list of includes from the provided section (global or share).

       manpage for details.

   DOM
       Starting with version 3.2.0 Samba has support for remote join and unjoin
       APIs, both client and server-side. Windows supports remote join
       capabilities since Windows 2000.

       In order for Samba to be joined or unjoined remotely an account must be
       used that is either member of the Domain Admins group, a member of the
       local Administrators group or a user that is granted the
       SeMachineAccountPrivilege privilege.

       The client side support for remote join is implemented in the net dom
       commands which are:
           net dom join - Join a remote computer into a domain.
           net dom unjoin - Unjoin a remote computer from a domain.
           net dom renamecomputer - Renames a remote computer joined to a
           domain.

   DOM JOIN  domain=DOMAIN ou=OU account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Joins a computer into a domain. This command supports the following
       additional parameters:

       &#183;   DOMAIN can be a NetBIOS domain name (also known as short domain name)
           or a DNS domain name for Active Directory Domains. As in Windows, it
           is also possible to control which Domain Controller to use. This can
           be achieved by appending the DC name using the \ separator character.
           Example: MYDOM\MYDC. The DOMAIN parameter cannot be NULL.

       &#183;   OU can be set to a RFC 1779 LDAP DN, like
           ou=mymachines,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com in order to create the
           machine account in a non-default LDAP container. This optional
           parameter is only supported when joining Active Directory Domains.

       &#183;   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to join the
           machine to the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient
           privileges to join machines.

       &#183;   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with
           ACCOUNT.

       &#183;   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote
           machine after successful join to the domain.


       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and
       authenticate to the remote machine that you want to join. These
       additional parameters include: -S computer and -U user.

       Example: net dom join -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret domain=MYDOM
       account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local
       administrator using password secret, and join the computer into a domain
       called MYDOM using the MYDOM domain administrator account and password
       topsecret. After successful join, the computer would reboot.

   DOM UNJOIN account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Unjoins a computer from a domain. This command supports the following
       additional parameters:

       &#183;   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to unjoin the
           machine from the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient
           privileges to unjoin machines.

       &#183;   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with
           ACCOUNT.

       &#183;   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote
           machine after successful unjoin from the domain.


       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and
       authenticate to the remote machine that you want to unjoin. These
       additional parameters include: -S computer and -U user.

       Example: net dom unjoin -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret
       account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local
       administrator using password secret, and unjoin the computer from the
       domain using the MYDOM domain administrator account and password
       topsecret. After successful unjoin, the computer would reboot.

   DOM RENAMECOMPUTER newname=NEWNAME account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Renames a computer that is joined to a domain. This command supports the
       following additional parameters:

       &#183;   NEWNAME defines the new name of the machine in the domain.

       &#183;   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to rename the
           machine in the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient
           privileges to rename machines.

       &#183;   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with
           ACCOUNT.

       &#183;   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote
           machine after successful rename in the domain.


       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and
       authenticate to the remote machine that you want to rename in the domain.
       These additional parameters include: -S computer and -U user.

       Example: net dom renamecomputer -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret
       newname=XPNEW account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local
       administrator using password secret, and rename the joined computer to
       XPNEW using the MYDOM domain administrator account and password
       topsecret. After successful rename, the computer would reboot.

   G_LOCK
       Manage global locks.

   G_LOCK DO lockname timeout command
       Execute a shell command under a global lock. This might be useful to
       define the order in which several shell commands will be executed. The
       locking information is stored in a file called g_lock.tdb. In setups with
       CTDB running, the locking information will be available on all cluster
       nodes.

       &#183;   LOCKNAME defines the name of the global lock.

       &#183;   TIMEOUT defines the timeout.

       &#183;   COMMAND defines the shell command to execute.

   G_LOCK LOCKS
       Print a list of all currently existing locknames.

   G_LOCK DUMP lockname
       Dump the locking table of a certain global lock.

   HELP [COMMAND]
       Gives usage information for the specified command.
