NETHOGS(8)                                                            NETHOGS(8)



NAME
       nethogs - Net top tool grouping bandwidth per process

SYNOPSIS
       nethogs [-d] [-h] [-p] [-t] [-V] [device(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       NetHogs  is  a small &apos;net top&apos; tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down
       per protocol or per subnet, like most such tools do, it groups  bandwidth
       by  process  - and does not rely on a special kernel module to be loaded.
       So if there&apos;s suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up  NetHogs
       and  immediately  see which PID is causing this, and if it&apos;s some kind of
       spinning process, kill it.


   Options
       -d     delay for refresh rate.

       -h     display available commands usage.

       -p     sniff in promiscious mode (not recommended).

       -t     tracemode.

       -V     prints Version info.

       device(s) to monitor. By default eth0 is being used.


INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       m      cycle between display modes (kb/s, kb, b, mb)

       r      sort by &apos;received&apos;

       s      sort by &apos;sent&apos;

       q      quit
