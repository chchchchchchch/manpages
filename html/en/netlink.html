NETLINK(7)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 NETLINK(7)



NAME
       netlink - communication between kernel and user space (AF_NETLINK)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;asm/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
       #include &lt;linux/netlink.h&gt;

       netlink_socket = socket(AF_NETLINK, socket_type, netlink_family);

DESCRIPTION
       Netlink  is  used  to  transfer information between kernel and user-space
       processes.  It consists of a standard sockets-based  interface  for  user
       space  processes  and  an  internal  kernel  API for kernel modules.  The
       internal kernel interface is not documented in this manual  page.   There
       is also an obsolete netlink interface via netlink character devices; this
       interface is not documented here and is only provided for  backward  com&#8208;
       patibility.

       Netlink is a datagram-oriented service.  Both SOCK_RAW and SOCK_DGRAM are
       valid values for socket_type.  However, the  netlink  protocol  does  not
       distinguish between datagram and raw sockets.

       netlink_family  selects the kernel module or netlink group to communicate
       with.  The currently assigned netlink families are:

       NETLINK_ROUTE
              Receives routing and link updates and may be used  to  modify  the
              routing  tables  (both  IPv4 and IPv6), IP addresses, link parame&#8208;
              ters, neighbor setups, queueing disciplines, traffic  classes  and
              packet classifiers (see rtnetlink(7)).

       NETLINK_W1
              Messages from 1-wire subsystem.

       NETLINK_USERSOCK
              Reserved for user-mode socket protocols.

       NETLINK_FIREWALL
              Transport  IPv4  packets  from  netfilter  to user space.  Used by
              ip_queue kernel module.

       NETLINK_INET_DIAG
              INET socket monitoring.

       NETLINK_NFLOG
              Netfilter/iptables ULOG.

       NETLINK_XFRM
              IPsec.

       NETLINK_SELINUX
              SELinux event notifications.

       NETLINK_ISCSI
              Open-iSCSI.

       NETLINK_AUDIT
              Auditing.

       NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP
              Access to FIB lookup from user space.
&#12;       NETLINK_CONNECTOR
              Kernel connector.  See Documentation/connector/* in the Linux ker&#8208;
              nel source tree for further information.

       NETLINK_NETFILTER
              Netfilter subsystem.

       NETLINK_IP6_FW
              Transport  IPv6  packets  from  netfilter  to user space.  Used by
              ip6_queue kernel module.

       NETLINK_DNRTMSG
              DECnet routing messages.

       NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT
              Kernel messages to user space.

       NETLINK_GENERIC
              Generic netlink family for simplified netlink usage.

       Netlink messages consist of a byte stream with one or  multiple  nlmsghdr
       headers  and associated payload.  The byte stream should only be accessed
       with the standard NLMSG_* macros.  See netlink(3)  for  further  informa&#8208;
       tion.

       In  multipart messages (multiple nlmsghdr headers with associated payload
       in one byte  stream)  the  first  and  all  following  headers  have  the
       NLM_F_MULTI  flag  set,  except  for  the  last header which has the type
       NLMSG_DONE.

       After each nlmsghdr the payload follows.

           struct nlmsghdr {
               __u32 nlmsg_len;    /* Length of message including header. */
               __u16 nlmsg_type;   /* Type of message content. */
               __u16 nlmsg_flags;  /* Additional flags. */
               __u32 nlmsg_seq;    /* Sequence number. */
               __u32 nlmsg_pid;    /* Sender port ID. */
           };

       nlmsg_type can be one of the standard message types:  NLMSG_NOOP  message
       is  to  be  ignored, NLMSG_ERROR message signals an error and the payload
       contains an nlmsgerr structure, NLMSG_DONE message terminates a multipart
       message.

           struct nlmsgerr {
               int error;        /* Negative errno or 0 for acknowledgements */
               struct nlmsghdr msg;  /* Message header that caused the error */
           };

       A  netlink family usually specifies more message types, see the appropri&#8208;
       ate manual pages for that, for example, rtnetlink(7) for NETLINK_ROUTE.

       tab(:); l s lB l.  Standard flag bits in nlmsg_flags _ NLM_F_REQUEST:Must
       be  set on all request messages.  NLM_F_MULTI:T{ The message is part of a
       multipart message terminated by NLMSG_DONE.  T} NLM_F_ACK:Request for  an
       acknowledgment on success.  NLM_F_ECHO:Echo this request.


       tab(:); l s lB l.  Additional flag bits for GET requests _
       NLM_F_ROOT:Return the complete table instead of a single entry.
       NLM_F_MATCH:T{ Return all entries matching criteria passed in message
       content.  Not implemented yet.  T} NLM_F_ATOMIC:Return an atomic snapshot
       of the table.  NLM_F_DUMP:T{ Convenience macro; equivalent to
       (NLM_F_ROOT|NLM_F_MATCH).  T}

       Note that NLM_F_ATOMIC requires the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability or an effec&#8208;
       tive UID of 0.


       tab(:); l s lB l.  Additional flag bits for NEW requests _
       NLM_F_REPLACE:Replace existing matching object.  NLM_F_EXCL:Don&apos;t replace
       if the object already exists.  NLM_F_CREATE:Create object if it doesn&apos;t
       already exist.  NLM_F_APPEND:Add to the end of the object list.

       nlmsg_seq and nlmsg_pid are used to track messages.  nlmsg_pid shows  the
       origin  of the message.  Note that there isn&apos;t a 1:1 relationship between
       nlmsg_pid and the PID of the process if the  message  originated  from  a
       netlink socket.  See the ADDRESS FORMATS section for further information.

       Both nlmsg_seq and nlmsg_pid are opaque to netlink core.

       Netlink  is not a reliable protocol.  It tries its best to deliver a mes&#8208;
       sage to its destination(s), but may drop messages when  an  out-of-memory
       condition  or  other  error occurs.  For reliable transfer the sender can
       request an acknowledgement from the receiver  by  setting  the  NLM_F_ACK
       flag.   An  acknowledgment  is an NLMSG_ERROR packet with the error field
       set to 0.  The application must generate  acknowledgements  for  received
       messages  itself.   The  kernel  tries to send an NLMSG_ERROR message for
       every failed packet.  A user process should follow this convention too.

       However, reliable transmissions from kernel to user are impossible in any
       case.   The  kernel  can&apos;t send a netlink message if the socket buffer is
       full: the message will be dropped  and  the  kernel  and  the  user-space
       process  will  no longer have the same view of kernel state.  It is up to
       the application to detect  when  this  happens  (via  the  ENOBUFS  error
       returned by recvmsg(2)) and resynchronize.

   Address Formats
       The  sockaddr_nl structure describes a netlink client in user space or in
       the kernel.  A sockaddr_nl can be either unicast (only sent to one  peer)
       or sent to netlink multicast groups (nl_groups not equal 0).

           struct sockaddr_nl {
               sa_family_t     nl_family;  /* AF_NETLINK */
               unsigned short  nl_pad;     /* Zero. */
               pid_t           nl_pid;     /* Port ID. */
               __u32           nl_groups;  /* Multicast groups mask. */
           };

       nl_pid  is  the  unicast address of netlink socket.  It&apos;s always 0 if the
       destination is in the kernel.  For a user-space process, nl_pid  is  usu&#8208;
       ally  the  PID  of  the  process owning the destination socket.  However,
       nl_pid identifies a netlink socket, not a process.   If  a  process  owns
       several  netlink sockets, then nl_pid can only be equal to the process ID
       for at most one socket.  There are two ways to assign nl_pid to a netlink
       socket.   If  the application sets nl_pid before calling bind(2), then it
       is up to the application to make sure that  nl_pid  is  unique.   If  the
       application  sets  it  to  0, the kernel takes care of assigning it.  The
       kernel assigns the process ID to the first  netlink  socket  the  process
       opens  and  assigns  a  unique  nl_pid  to  every netlink socket that the
       process subsequently creates.

       nl_groups is a bit mask with every bit representing a netlink group  num&#8208;
       ber.  Each netlink family has a set of 32 multicast groups.  When bind(2)
       is called on the socket, the nl_groups field in the sockaddr_nl should be
       set  to  a  bit  mask  of  the  groups which it wishes to listen to.  The
       default value for this field is zero which means that no multicasts  will
       be  received.   A  socket  may multicast messages to any of the multicast
       groups by setting nl_groups to a bit mask of the groups it wishes to send
       to when it calls sendmsg(2) or does a connect(2).  Only processes with an
       effective UID of 0 or the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability may send or listen  to
       a  netlink multicast group.  Any replies to a message received for a mul&#8208;
       ticast group should be sent back to the sending  PID  and  the  multicast
       group.   Some  Linux kernel subsystems may additionally allow other users
       to send and/or receive messages.   As  at  Linux  3.0,  the  NETLINK_KOB&#8208;
       JECT_UEVENT,  NETLINK_GENERIC,  NETLINK_ROUTE, and NETLINK_SELINUX groups
       allow other users to receive messages.  No groups allow  other  users  to
       send messages.

VERSIONS
       The socket interface to netlink is a new feature of Linux 2.2.

       Linux  2.0  supported  a  more  primitive  device-based netlink interface
       (which is still available as  a  compatibility  option).   This  obsolete
       interface is not described here.

       NETLINK_SELINUX appeared in Linux 2.6.4.

       NETLINK_AUDIT appeared in Linux 2.6.6.

       NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT appeared in Linux 2.6.10.

       NETLINK_W1 and NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP appeared in Linux 2.6.13.

       NETLINK_INET_DIAG,  NETLINK_CONNECTOR  and  NETLINK_NETFILTER appeared in
       Linux 2.6.14.

       NETLINK_GENERIC and NETLINK_ISCSI appeared in Linux 2.6.15.

NOTES
       It is often better to use netlink via libnetlink or libnl  than  via  the
       low-level kernel interface.

BUGS
       This manual page is not complete.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  example creates a NETLINK_ROUTE netlink socket which will
       listen  to  the  RTMGRP_LINK  (network  interface   create/delete/up/down
       events)  and RTMGRP_IPV4_IFADDR (IPv4 addresses add/delete events) multi&#8208;
       cast groups.

           struct sockaddr_nl sa;

           memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
           sa.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
           sa.nl_groups = RTMGRP_LINK | RTMGRP_IPV4_IFADDR;

           fd = socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_ROUTE);
           bind(fd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;sa, sizeof(sa));

       The next example demonstrates how to send a netlink message to the kernel
       (pid  0).   Note that application must take care of message sequence num&#8208;
       bers in order to reliably track acknowledgements.

           struct nlmsghdr *nh;    /* The nlmsghdr with payload to send. */
           struct sockaddr_nl sa;
           struct iovec iov = { nh, nh-&gt;nlmsg_len };
           struct msghdr msg;

           msg = { &amp;sa, sizeof(sa), &amp;iov, 1, NULL, 0, 0 };
           memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
           sa.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
           nh-&gt;nlmsg_pid = 0;
           nh-&gt;nlmsg_seq = ++sequence_number;
           /* Request an ack from kernel by setting NLM_F_ACK. */
           nh-&gt;nlmsg_flags |= NLM_F_ACK;

           sendmsg(fd, &amp;msg, 0);
&#12;       And the last example is about reading netlink message.

           int len;
           char buf[4096];
           struct iovec iov = { buf, sizeof(buf) };
           struct sockaddr_nl sa;
           struct msghdr msg;
           struct nlmsghdr *nh;

           msg = { &amp;sa, sizeof(sa), &amp;iov, 1, NULL, 0, 0 };
           len = recvmsg(fd, &amp;msg, 0);

           for (nh = (struct nlmsghdr *) buf; NLMSG_OK (nh, len);
                nh = NLMSG_NEXT (nh, len)) {
               /* The end of multipart message. */
               if (nh-&gt;nlmsg_type == NLMSG_DONE)
                   return;

               if (nh-&gt;nlmsg_type == NLMSG_ERROR)
                   /* Do some error handling. */
               ...

               /* Continue with parsing payload. */
               ...
           }
