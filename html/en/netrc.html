NETRC(5)                    BSD File Formats Manual                   NETRC(5)

NAME
     netrc &#8212; user configuration for ftp

SYNOPSIS
     ~/.netrc

DESCRIPTION
     This file contains configuration and autologin information for the File
     Transfer Protocol client ftp(1).

     The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the
     auto-login process.  It resides in the user&apos;s home directory.  The follow&#8208;
     ing tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or new-
     lines:

     machine name
               Identify a remote machine name.  The auto-login process searches
               the .netrc file for a machine token that matches the remote
               machine specified on the ftp command line or as an open command
               argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc tokens are
               processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or another
               machine or a default token is encountered.

     default   This is the same as machine name except that default matches any
               name.  There can be only one default token, and it must be after
               all machine tokens.  This is normally used as:

                     default login anonymous password user@site

               thereby giving the user automatic anonymous ftp login to machines
               not specified in .netrc.  This can be overridden by using the -n
               flag to disable auto-login.

     login name
               Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is present,
               the auto-login process will initiate a login using the specified
               name.

     password string
               Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
               process will supply the specified string if the remote server
               requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
               this token is present in the .netrc file for any user other than
               anonymous, ftp will abort the auto-login process if the .netrc is
               readable by anyone besides the user.

     account string
               Supply an additional account password.  If this token is present,
               the auto-login process will supply the specified string if the
               remote server requires an additional account password, or the
               auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it does not.

     macdef name
               Define a macro.  This token functions like the ftp macdef command
               functions.  A macro is defined with the specified name; its con&#8208;
               tents begin with the next .netrc line and continue until a null
               line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.  If a
               macro named init is defined, it is automatically executed as the
               last step in the auto-login process.
