FTW(3)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     FTW(3)



NAME
       ftw, nftw - file tree walk

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;

       int ftw(const char *dirpath,
               int (*fn) (const char *fpath, const struct stat *sb,
                          int typeflag),
               int nopenfd);

       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500   /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;

       int nftw(const char *dirpath,
               int (*fn) (const char *fpath, const struct stat *sb,
                          int typeflag, struct FTW *ftwbuf),
               int nopenfd, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       ftw()  walks  through the directory tree that is located under the direc&#8208;
       tory dirpath, and calls fn()  once  for  each  entry  in  the  tree.   By
       default, directories are handled before the files and subdirectories they
       contain (preorder traversal).

       To avoid using up all of the calling process&apos;s file descriptors,  nopenfd
       specifies  the  maximum  number  of directories that ftw() will hold open
       simultaneously.  When the search depth exceeds this,  ftw()  will  become
       slower because directories have to be closed and reopened.  ftw() uses at
       most one file descriptor for each level in the directory tree.

       For each entry found in the tree, ftw() calls fn() with three  arguments:
       fpath,  sb,  and  typeflag.   fpath  is the pathname of the entry, and is
       expressed either as a pathname relative to the calling process&apos;s  current
       working  directory  at  the  time  of  the  call to ftw(), if dirpath was
       expressed as a relative pathname, or as an absolute pathname, if  dirpath
       was  expressed  as  an  absolute  pathname.   sb is a pointer to the stat
       structure returned by a call to stat(2) for fpath.  typeflag is an  inte&#8208;
       ger that has one of the following values:

       FTW_F  fpath is a regular file.

       FTW_D  fpath is a directory.

       FTW_DNR
              fpath is a directory which can&apos;t be read.

       FTW_NS The stat(2) call failed on fpath, which is not a symbolic link.

              If  fpath  is  a  symbolic  link  and stat(2) failed, POSIX.1-2001
              states that it is undefined whether FTW_NS or FTW_SL  (see  below)
              is passed in typeflag.

       To  stop  the  tree  walk,  fn() returns a nonzero value; this value will
       become the return value of ftw().  As long as fn() returns 0, ftw()  will
       continue  either until it has traversed the entire tree, in which case it
       will return zero, or until it encounters an error (such  as  a  malloc(3)
       failure), in which case it will return -1.

       Because ftw() uses dynamic data structures, the only safe way to exit out
       of a tree walk is to return a nonzero value from fn().  To allow a signal
       to terminate the walk without causing a memory leak, have the handler set
       a global flag that is checked by fn().  Don&apos;t use longjmp(3)  unless  the
       program is going to terminate.

   nftw()
       The  function  nftw()  is the same as ftw(), except that it has one addi&#8208;
       tional argument, flags, and calls fn() with one more argument, ftwbuf.

       This flags argument is formed by ORing zero  or  more  of  the  following
       flags:

       FTW_ACTIONRETVAL (since glibc 2.3.3)
              If this glibc-specific flag is set, then nftw() handles the return
              value from fn() differently.  fn() should return one of  the  fol&#8208;
              lowing values:

              FTW_CONTINUE
                     Instructs nftw() to continue normally.

              FTW_SKIP_SIBLINGS
                     If  fn()  returns  this value, then siblings of the current
                     entry will be skipped, and processing continues in the par&#8208;
                     ent.

              FTW_SKIP_SUBTREE
                     If  fn() is called with an entry that is a directory (type&#8208;
                     flag is FTW_D), this  return  value  will  prevent  objects
                     within  that  directory  from  being passed as arguments to
                     fn().  nftw() continues processing with the next sibling of
                     the directory.

              FTW_STOP
                     Causes  nftw()  to return immediately with the return value
                     FTW_STOP.

              Other return values could be associated with new  actions  in  the
              future;  fn()  should  not  return  values other than those listed
              above.

              The feature test macro _GNU_SOURCE must be defined (before includ&#8208;
              ing  any  header  files)  in  order  to  obtain  the definition of
              FTW_ACTIONRETVAL from &lt;ftw.h&gt;.

       FTW_CHDIR
              If set, do a chdir(2) to each directory before handling  its  con&#8208;
              tents.  This is useful if the program needs to perform some action
              in the directory in which fpath resides.

       FTW_DEPTH
              If set, do a post-order traversal, that  is,  call  fn()  for  the
              directory  itself after handling the contents of the directory and
              its subdirectories.  (By default, each directory is handled before
              its contents.)

       FTW_MOUNT
              If set, stay within the same file system (i.e., do not cross mount
              points).

       FTW_PHYS
              If set, do not follow symbolic links.  (This is  what  you  want.)
              If  not  set, symbolic links are followed, but no file is reported
              twice.

              If FTW_PHYS is not set, but FTW_DEPTH is set,  then  the  function
              fn() is never called for a directory that would be a descendant of
              itself.
&#12;       For each entry in the directory tree, nftw() calls fn() with  four  argu&#8208;
       ments.   fpath  and sb are as for ftw().  typeflag may receive any of the
       same values as with ftw(), or any of the following values:

       FTW_DP fpath is a directory, and FTW_DEPTH was specified in  flags.   All
              of the files and subdirectories within fpath have been processed.

       FTW_SL fpath is a symbolic link, and FTW_PHYS was set in flags.

       FTW_SLN
              fpath  is  a  symbolic link pointing to a nonexistent file.  (This
              occurs only if FTW_PHYS is not set.)

       The fourth argument that nftw() supplies when calling fn() is a structure
       of type FTW:

           struct FTW {
               int base;
               int level;
           };

       base  is  the  offset  of  the filename (i.e., basename component) in the
       pathname given in fpath.  level is the depth of fpath  in  the  directory
       tree, relative to the root of the tree (dirpath, which has depth 0).

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return 0 on success, and -1 if an error occurs.

       If  fn()  returns nonzero, then the tree walk is terminated and the value
       returned by fn() is returned as the result of ftw() or nftw().

       If nftw() is called with the FTW_ACTIONRETVAL flag, then the only nonzero
       value that should be used by fn() to terminate the tree walk is FTW_STOP,
       and that value is returned as the result of nftw().

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, SUSv1.  POSIX.1-2008 marks ftw() as obsolete.

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2001 note that the results are unspecified if fn  does  not  pre&#8208;
       serve the current working directory.

       The  function  nftw() and the use of FTW_SL with ftw() were introduced in
       SUSv1.

       On some systems ftw() will never use  FTW_SL,  on  other  systems  FTW_SL
       occurs only for symbolic links that do not point to an existing file, and
       again on other systems ftw() will use FTW_SL for each symbolic link.  For
       predictable control, use nftw().

       Under  Linux,  libc4  and  libc5  and  glibc 2.0.6 will use FTW_F for all
       objects (files, symbolic links, FIFOs, etc.)  that can be stat&apos;ed but are
       not a directory.

       The function nftw() is available since glibc 2.1.

       FTW_ACTIONRETVAL is glibc-specific.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  program traverses the directory tree under the path named
       in its first command-line argument, or under the current directory if  no
       argument  is  supplied.  It displays various information about each file.
       The second command-line argument can be used to specify  characters  that
       control the value assigned to the flags argument when calling nftw().

       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500

       #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

       static int
       display_info(const char *fpath, const struct stat *sb,
                    int tflag, struct FTW *ftwbuf)
       {
           printf(&quot;%-3s %2d %7jd   %-40s %d %s\n&quot;,
               (tflag == FTW_D) ?   &quot;d&quot;   : (tflag == FTW_DNR) ? &quot;dnr&quot; :

               (tflag == FTW_NS) ?  &quot;ns&quot;  : (tflag == FTW_SL) ?  &quot;sl&quot; :

               ftwbuf-&gt;level, (intmax_t) sb-&gt;st_size,
               fpath, ftwbuf-&gt;base, fpath + ftwbuf-&gt;base);
           return 0;           /* To tell nftw() to continue */
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int flags = 0;

           if (argc &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; strchr(argv[2], &apos;d&apos;) != NULL)
               flags |= FTW_DEPTH;
           if (argc &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; strchr(argv[2], &apos;p&apos;) != NULL)
               flags |= FTW_PHYS;

           if (nftw((argc &lt; 2) ? &quot;.&quot; : argv[1], display_info, 20, flags)
                   == -1) {
               perror(&quot;nftw&quot;);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
