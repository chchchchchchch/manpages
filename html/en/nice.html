NICE(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    NICE(2)



NAME
       nice - change process priority

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int nice(int inc);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       nice(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       nice()  adds  inc  to  the nice value for the calling process.  (A higher
       nice value means a low priority.)  Only the superuser may specify a nega&#8208;
       tive  increment,  or  priority  increase.   The  range for nice values is
       described in getpriority(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the new nice value is returned (but  see  NOTES  below).   On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The  calling process attempted to increase its priority by supply&#8208;
              ing a negative inc but has insufficient privileges.   Under  Linux
              the  CAP_SYS_NICE capability is required.  (But see the discussion
              of the RLIMIT_NICE resource limit in setrlimit(2).)

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  However, the Linux and (g)libc (earlier than
       glibc  2.2.4)  return value is nonstandard, see below.  SVr4 documents an
       additional EINVAL error code.

NOTES
       SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that nice() should  return  the  new  nice
       value.   However,  the Linux syscall and the nice() library function pro&#8208;
       vided in older versions of (g)libc (earlier than glibc 2.2.4) return 0 on
       success.  The new nice value can be found using getpriority(2).

       Since glibc 2.2.4, nice() is implemented as a library function that calls
       getpriority(2) to obtain the new nice value to be returned to the caller.
       With  this  implementation, a successful call can legitimately return -1.
       To reliably detect an error, set errno to 0 before the  call,  and  check
       its value when nice() returns -1.
