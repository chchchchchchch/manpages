DESCRIPTION
       Hostname  is used to display the system&apos;s DNS name, and to display or set
       its hostname or NIS domain name.


   GET NAME
       When called without any  arguments,  the  program  displays  the  current
       names:

       hostname  will  print  the name of the system as returned by the gethost&#8208;
       name(2) function.

       domainname will print the NIS domainname of the system.  domainname  uses
       the gethostname(2) function, while ypdomainname and nisdomainname use the
       yp_get_default_domain(3).

       dnsdomainname will print the domain part of  the  FQDN  (Fully  Qualified
       Domain  Name).  The complete FQDN of the system is returned with hostname
       --fqdn (but see the warnings in section THE FQDN below).


   SET NAME
       When called with one argument or with the --file option, the commands set
       the  host  name  or  the  NIS/YP domain name.  hostname uses the sethost&#8208;
       name(2) function, while all of the  three  domainname,  ypdomainname  and
       nisdomainname  use  setdomainname(2).   Note, that this is effective only
       until the next reboot.  Edit /etc/hostname for permanent change.

       Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

       It is not possible to set the FQDN or the DNS domain name with the dnsdo&#8208;
       mainname command (see THE FQDN below).

       The  host name is usually set once at system startup in /etc/init.d/host&#8208;
       name.sh (normally by reading the contents of a file  which  contains  the
       host name, e.g.  /etc/hostname).


   THE FQDN
       You  can&apos;t  change  the  FQDN (as returned by hostname --fqdn) or the DNS
       domain name (as returned by dnsdomainname) with this command. The FQDN of
       the system is the name that the resolver(3) returns for the host name.

       Technically:  The  FQDN  is  the name getaddrinfo(3) returns for the host
       name returned by gethostname(2).  The DNS domain name is the  part  after
       the first dot.

       Therefore it depends on the configuration (usually in /etc/host.conf) how
       you can change it. Usually (if the hosts file is  parsed  before  DNS  or
       NIS) you can change it in /etc/hosts.

       If  a  machine  has multiple network interfaces/addresses or is used in a
       mobile environment, then it may either have multiple  FQDNs/domain  names
       or  none at all. Therefore avoid using hostname --fqdn, hostname --domain
       and dnsdomainname.  hostname --ip-address is subject to the same  limita&#8208;
       tions so it should be avoided as well.


OPTIONS
       -a, --alias
              Display  the alias name of the host (if used). This option is dep&#8208;
              recated and should not be used anymore.

       -A, --all-fqdns
              Displays all FQDNs of the machine. This option enumerates all con&#8208;
              figured  network  addresses  on all configured network interfaces,
              and translates them to DNS domain names. Addresses that cannot  be
              translated  (i.e.  because they do not have an appropriate reverse
              DNS entry) are skipped. Note that different addresses may  resolve
              to  the  same  name,  therefore  the  output may contain duplicate
              entries. Do not make any assumptions about the order of  the  out&#8208;
              put.

       -b, --boot
              Always  set a hostname; this allows the file specified by -F to be
              non-existant or empty, in which case the default  hostname  local&#8208;
              host will be used if none is yet set.

       -d, --domain
              Display the name of the DNS domain.  Don&apos;t use the command domain&#8208;
              name to get the DNS domain name  because  it  will  show  the  NIS
              domain  name  and  not  the  DNS  domain  name.  Use dnsdomainname
              instead. See the warnings in section THE  FQDN  above,  and  avoid
              using this option.

       -f, --fqdn, --long
              Display the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). A FQDN consists of
              a short host name and the DNS domain name. Unless  you  are  using
              bind  or  NIS for host lookups you can change the FQDN and the DNS
              domain name (which is part of the FQDN) in  the  /etc/hosts  file.
              See  the  warnings in section THE FQDN above, and avoid using this
              option; use hostname --all-fqdns instead.

       -F, --file filename
              Read the host name from the specified file. Comments (lines start&#8208;
              ing with a `#&apos;) are ignored.

       -i, --ip-address
              Display  the  network address(es) of the host name. Note that this
              works only if the host name can  be  resolved.  Avoid  using  this
              option; use hostname --all-ip-addresses instead.

       -I, --all-ip-addresses
              Display  all network addresses of the host. This option enumerates
              all configured addresses on all network interfaces.  The  loopback
              interface  and  IPv6 link-local addresses are omitted. Contrary to
              option -i, this option does not depend on name resolution. Do  not
              make any assumptions about the order of the output.

       -s, --short
              Display  the  short  host  name.  This is the host name cut at the
              first dot.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose and tell what&apos;s going on.

       -V, --version
              Print version information on standard  output  and  exit  success&#8208;
              fully.

       -y, --yp, --nis
              Display  the  NIS  domain name. If a parameter is given (or --file
              name ) then root can also set a new NIS domain.

       -h, --help
              Print a usage message and exit.

NOTES
       The address families hostname tries when looking up the FQDN, aliases and
       network addresses of the host are determined by the configuration of your
       resolver.  For instance,  on  GNU  Libc  systems,  the  resolver  can  be
       instructed  to  try  IPv6  lookups  first  by  using  the inet6 option in
       /etc/resolv.conf.

FILES
       /etc/hosts

       /etc/hostname Historically this file was supposed  to  only  contain  the
       hostname  and not the full canonical FQDN. Nowadays most software is able
       to cope with a full FQDN here.
