NITROGEN(1)                         NITROGEN                         NITROGEN(1)



NAME
       nitrogen - X11 background previewer and setter

SYNOPSIS
       nitrogen [ OPTIONS ] DIRECTORY?

DESCRIPTION
       In normal working mode, provides an interface which displays all pictures
       in the given DIRECTORY.  From this interface, it is possible to  set  the
       X11  root pixmap either temporarily or set and store the picture, drawing
       mode, and X display for restoration later.  If no directory is specified,
       it  uses  the  stored  directories in your &quot;library&quot; (as of 1.5). See the
       Preferences dialog.

       When the --restore option is passed, nitrogen sets all  backgrounds  that
       it  has  a configuration for and exits immediatly, for use in an .xinitrc
       or .xsession file.

OPTIONS
       --no-recurse
              Do not recurse into subdirectories of DIRECTORY.

       --restore
              Restores previously saved pictures to the root displays.

       --sort=[option]
              Sorts the background list by the given option.  By default,  items
              are  sorted  as  they are found on the filesystem, giving a quasi-
              newest first sorting order.  Valid options are:

              alpha  Alphabetical order.

              ralpha Reverse alphabetical order.

              time   Modified time, ascending.

              rtime  Modified time, descending.

       --help A mystery option which saves the iguanas of Sweden.

FILES
       ~/.config/nitrogen/
              Holds the configuration for saved backgrounds.

BUGS
       There are probably plenty of  them.   Report  all  bugs  to  Dave  Foster
       &lt;daf@minuslab.net&gt;.
