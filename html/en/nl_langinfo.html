NL_LANGINFO(3)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             NL_LANGINFO(3)



NAME
       nl_langinfo - query language and locale information

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;

       char *nl_langinfo(nl_item item);

DESCRIPTION
       The  nl_langinfo()  function  provides  access to locale information in a
       more flexible way than localeconv(3)  does.   Individual  and  additional
       elements  of the locale categories can be queried.  setlocale(3) needs to
       be executed with proper arguments before.

       Examples for the locale elements that can be specified in item using  the
       constants defined in &lt;langinfo.h&gt; are:

       CODESET (LC_CTYPE)
              Return  a  string  with the name of the character encoding used in
              the  selected  locale,   such   as   &quot;UTF-8&quot;,   &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;,   or
              &quot;ANSI_X3.4-1968&quot;  (better  known  as  US-ASCII).  This is the same
              string that you get with &quot;locale charmap&quot;.  For a list of  charac&#8208;
              ter encoding names, try &quot;locale -m&quot;, cf. locale(1).

       D_T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return  a  string  that  can  be used as a format string for strf&#8208;
              time(3) to represent time and date in a locale-specific way.

       D_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as  a  format  string  for  strf&#8208;
              time(3) to represent a date in a locale-specific way.

       T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return  a  string  that  can  be used as a format string for strf&#8208;
              time(3) to represent a time in a locale-specific way.

       DAY_{1&#8211;7} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th day of the week.  [Warning:  this  follows
              the US convention DAY_1 = Sunday, not the international convention
              (ISO 8601) that Monday is the first day of the week.]

       ABDAY_{1&#8211;7} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th day of the week.

       MON_{1&#8211;12} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th month.

       ABMON_{1&#8211;12} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th month.

       RADIXCHAR (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return radix character (decimal dot, decimal comma, etc.).

       THOUSEP (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return separator character for thousands (groups of three digits).

       YESEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return a regular expression that can be  used  with  the  regex(3)
              function to recognize a positive response to a yes/no question.

       NOEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return  a  regular  expression  that can be used with the regex(3)
              function to recognize a negative response to a yes/no question.

       CRNCYSTR (LC_MONETARY)
              Return the currency symbol, preceded by &quot;-&quot; if the  symbol  should
              appear before the value, &quot;+&quot; if the symbol should appear after the
              value, or &quot;.&quot; if the symbol should replace the radix character.

       The above list covers just some examples of items that can be  requested.
       For a more detailed list, consult The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

RETURN VALUE
       If  no locale has been selected by setlocale(3) for the appropriate cate&#8208;
       gory, nl_langinfo() returns a pointer to the corresponding string in  the
       &quot;C&quot; locale.

       If item is not valid, a pointer to an empty string is returned.

       This pointer may point to static data that may be overwritten on the next
       call to nl_langinfo() or setlocale(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.

EXAMPLE
       The following program sets the character type  locale  according  to  the
       environment and queries the terminal character set.

       #include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;
       #include &lt;locale.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           setlocale(LC_CTYPE,&quot;&quot;);
           printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,nl_langinfo(CODESET));
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
