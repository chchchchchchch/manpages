DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       The application described by this document, nns, is a simple command line
       client for the nano name service facility provided by the Tcllib packages
       nameserv,  and  nameserv::server.   Beyond that the application&apos;s sources
       also serve as an example of how to use the client package  nameserv.  All
       abilities  of a client are covered, from configuration to registration of
       names to searching.

       This name service facility has nothing to do with the  Internet&apos;s  Domain
       Name System, otherwise known as DNS. If the reader is looking for a pack&#8208;
       age dealing with that please see either of the packages dns  and  resolv,
       both found in Tcllib too.

   USE CASES
       nns was written with the following two main use cases in mind.

       [1]    Registration of a name/data pair in the name service.

       [2]    Searching the name service for entries matching a glob pattern.

       Beyond  the above we also want to be able to identify the client, and get
       information about the name service.

   COMMAND LINE
       nns bind ?-host host? ?-port port? name data
              This form registers the name/data pair in the specified name  ser&#8208;
              vice. In this form the command will not exit to keep the registra&#8208;
              tion alive. The user has to kill it explicitly, either by  sending
              a  signal,  or  through the job-control facilities of the shell in
              use. It will especially survive the loss of the connection to  the
              name  service  and reestablish the name/data pair when the connec&#8208;
              tion is restored.

              The options to specify the name service will be  explained  later,
              in section OPTIONS.

       nns search ?-host host? ?-port port? ?-continuous? ?pattern?
              This form searches the specified name service for entries matching
              the glob-pattern and prints them to stdout, with each entry on its
              own  line.  If  no pattern is specified it defaults to *, matching
              everything.

              The options to specify the name service will be  explained  later,
              in section OPTIONS.

              If  the  option  -continuous is specified the client will not exit
              after performing the search, but start to continuously monitor the
              service  for changes to the set of matching entries, appropriately
              updating the display as changes arrive. In that form it will espe&#8208;
              cially also survive the loss of the connection to the name service
              and reestablish the search when the connection is restored.

       nns ident ?-host host? ?-port port?
              This form asks the specified name service for the version and fea&#8208;
              tures  of  the  name  service  protocol it supports and prints the
              results to stdout.

              The options to specify the name service will be  explained  later,
              in section OPTIONS.

       nns who
              This form prints name, version, and protocol version of the appli&#8208;
              cation to stdout.

   OPTIONS
       This section describes all the options  available  to  the  user  of  the
       application

       -host name|ipaddress
              If this option is not specified it defaults to localhost. It spec&#8208;
              ifies the name or ip-address of the host the name service to  talk
              to is running on.

       -port number
              If this option is not specified it defaults to 38573. It specifies
              the TCP port the name service to  talk  to  is  listening  on  for
              requests.
