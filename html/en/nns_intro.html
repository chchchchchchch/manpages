NAME
       nns_intro - Name service facility, introduction

DESCRIPTION
       nns  (short  for  nano  nameservice)  is a facility built for the package
       comm, adding a simple name service to it.  It is also  built  on  top  of
       comm, using it for the exchange of messages between the client and server
       parts.

       This name service facility has nothing to do with the  Internet&apos;s  Domain
       Name System, otherwise known as DNS. If the reader is looking for a pack&#8208;
       age dealing with that please see either of the packages dns  and  resolv,
       both found in Tcllib too.

       Tcllib  provides 2 applications and 4 packages which are working together
       and provide access to the facility at different levels.

APPLICATIONS
       The application nnsd provides a simple name server which can  be  run  by
       anybody anywhere on their system, as they see fit.  It is also an example
       on the use of the server-side package nameserv::server.

       Complementing this server is the nns client application.  A possible, but
       no  very  sensible use would be to enter name/port bindings into a server
       from a shell script. Not sensible, as shell scripts normally do not  pro&#8208;
       vide a comm-based service.

       The  only  case  for  this  to make some sense would be in a shell script
       wrapped around a Tcl script FOO which is using comm, to register the lis&#8208;
       tening  port used by FOO.  However even there it would much more sensible
       to extend FOO to use the nameservice directly. And in regard  on  how  to
       that  nns  can  be used as both example and template.  Beyond that it may
       also be useful to perform nameservice queries from shell scripts.

       The third application, nnslog is a stripped down form of the  nns  client
       application. It is reduced to perform a continuous search for all changes
       and logs all received events to stdout.

       Both clients use the nameserv::auto package to  automatically  hande  the
       loss and restoration of the connection to the server.

PACKAGES
       The  two  main  packages  implementing the service are nameserv and name&#8208;
       serv::server, i.e. client and server. The latter has not much of an  API,
       just enough to start, stop, and configure it. See the application nnsd on
       how to use it.

       The basic client, in package nameserv, provides the main API  to  manipu&#8208;
       late and query the service. An example of its use is the application nns.

       The  second client package, nameserv::auto is API compatible to the basic
       client, but provides the additional functionality that it will  automati&#8208;
       cally  restore data like bound names when the connection to the name ser&#8208;
       vice was lost and then reestablished. I.e. it automatically  detects  the
       loss of the server and re-enters the data when the server comes back.

       The  package nameserv::common is of no interest to users. It is an inter&#8208;
       nal package containing code and definitions common to the packages  name&#8208;
       serv and nameserv::server.
&#12;       All  packages use the uevent package for the reporting of special circum&#8208;
       stances via events, and reserve the uevent-tag nameserv for their  exclu&#8208;
       sive use. All their events will be posted to that tag.

INTERNALS
       The  document Name service facility, client/server protocol specifies the
       protocol used by the packages nameserv and nameserv::server  to  talk  to
       each  other.  It  is  of  no  interest to users of either the packages or
       applications.

       Developers wishing to modify and/or extend  or  to  just  understand  the
       internals  of  the  nameservice  facility however are strongly advised to
       read it.

       ideas  for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documenta&#8208;
