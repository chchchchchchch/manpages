NAME
       nnsd - Name service facility, Commandline Server Application

SYNOPSIS
       nnsd ?-localonly flag? ?-port port?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       The application described by this document, nns, is a simple command line
       server for the nano name service facility provided by the Tcllib packages
       nameserv,  and  nameserv::server.   Beyond that the application&apos;s sources
       also serve as  an  example  of  how  to  use  the  server  package  name&#8208;
       serv::server.

       This  name  service facility has nothing to do with the Internet&apos;s Domain
       Name System, otherwise known as DNS. If the reader is looking for a pack&#8208;
       age  dealing  with that please see either of the packages dns and resolv,
       both found in Tcllib too.

   USE CASES
       nnsd was written with the following main use case in mind.

       [1]    Run a nano name service on some host.

   COMMAND LINE
       nnsd ?-localonly flag? ?-port port?
              The command configures a server  per  the  specified  options  and
              starts  it. The command will not exit on its, as it keeps the name
              service database wholly in memory. The user has to kill it explic&#8208;
              itly,  eithre  by  sending  a a signal, or through the job-control
              facilities of the shell in use.

              The options to configure the name service are explained in section
              OPTIONS.

   OPTIONS
       This  section  describes  all  the  options  available to the user of the
       application

       -localonly bool
              If this option is not specified it defaults to true, i.e.   accep&#8208;
              tance  of  only  local  connections. The server will accept remote
              connections, i.e. connections from other hosts,  if  and  only  if
              this option is configured to false.

       -port number
              If this option is not specified it defaults to 38573. It specifies
              the TCP port the server has to listen on for requests.
