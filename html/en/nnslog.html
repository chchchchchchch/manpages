NAME
       nnslog - Name service facility, Commandline Logging Client Application

SYNOPSIS
       nnslog ?-host host? ?-port port?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       The  application  described by this document, nnslog, is a simple command
       line client for the nano name service facility  provided  by  the  Tcllib
       packages nameserv, and nameserv::server.

       It  essentially implements &quot;nns search -continuous *&quot;, but uses a differ&#8208;
       ent output formatting. Instead of continuously showing the  current  con&#8208;
       tents  of  the  server  in  the  terminal  it  simply  logs  all received
       add/remove events to stdout.

       This name service facility has nothing to do with the  Internet&apos;s  Domain
       Name System, otherwise known as DNS. If the reader is looking for a pack&#8208;
       age dealing with that please see either of the packages dns  and  resolv,
       both found in Tcllib too.

   USE CASES
       nnslog was written with the following main use case in mind.

       [1]    Monitoring  the name service for all changes and logging them in a
              text terminal.

   COMMAND LINE
       nnslog ?-host host? ?-port port?
              The command connects to the specified  name  service,  sets  up  a
              search for all changes and then prints all received events to std&#8208;
              out, with each events on its own line. The command will  not  exit
              until  it is explicitly terminated by the user. It will especially
              survive the loss  of  the  connection  to  the  name  service  and
              reestablish the search and log when the connection is restored.

              The  options  to specify the name service will be explained later,
              in section OPTIONS.

   OPTIONS
       This section describes all the options  available  to  the  user  of  the
       application

       -host name|ipaddress
              If this option is not specified it defaults to localhost. It spec&#8208;
              ifies the name or ip-address of the host the name service to  talk
              to is running on.

       -port number
              If this option is not specified it defaults to 38573. It specifies
              the TCP port the name service to  talk  to  is  listening  on  for
              requests.
