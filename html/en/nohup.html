NAME
       nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty

SYNOPSIS
       nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
       nohup OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If standard input is a terminal, redirect it from /dev/null.  If standard
       output  is  a  terminal,  append  output  to  `nohup.out&apos;  if   possible,
       `$HOME/nohup.out&apos;  otherwise.   If standard error is a terminal, redirect
       it to standard output.  To save output to  FILE,  use  `nohup  COMMAND  &gt;
       FILE&apos;.

       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually super&#8208;
       sedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell&apos;s  documen&#8208;
       tation for details about the options it supports.
