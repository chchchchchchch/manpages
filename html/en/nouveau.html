DESCRIPTION
       nouveau is an Xorg driver for NVIDIA video cards.  The driver supports 2D
       acceleration and provides support for the following  framebuffer  depths:
       (15,) 16  and 24.  TrueColor visuals are supported for these depths.


SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The nouveau driver supports PCI, PCI-Express and AGP video cards based on
       the following NVIDIA chips:

       RIVA TNT              NV4

       RIVA TNT2             NV5

       GeForce 256, QUADRO   NV10

       GeForce2, QUADRO2     NV11 &amp; NV15

       GeForce3, QUADRO DCC  NV20

       nForce, nForce2       NV1A, NV1F

       GeForce4, QUADRO4     NV17, NV18, NV25, NV28

       GeForce FX, QUADRO FX NV30, NV31, NV34, NV35, NV36, NV37, NV38

       GeForce 6XXX          NV40, NV41, NV43, NV44, NV45, C51

       GeForce 7XXX          G70, G71, G72, G73


CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The  driver  auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory
       present for all chips.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: on.

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer  layer.   Default:
              off.

       Option &quot;WrappedFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or disable wfb, only affects nv50+. Useful for some legacy
              configurations  where  high  rendering   latency   is   perceived.
              Default: wfb is disabled.

       Option &quot;GLXVBlank&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Synchronize GLX clients to VBlank. Useful where tearing is a prob&#8208;
              lem, harmful if the GPU isn&apos;t fast enough to keep up with the mon&#8208;
              itor refresh rate. Default: off.

       Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particu&#8208;
              lar driver instance.  If you use this option  you  most  use  this
              option for all instances of the driver.
              For  example: Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;LVDS,VGA-0&quot; will assign xrandr
              outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.

       Option &quot;PageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable DRI2 page flipping. Default: on.

       Option &quot;SwapLimit&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Set maximum allowed number of pending OpenGL  double-buffer  swaps
              for a drawable before a client is blocked.
              A  value of 1 corresponds to double-buffering. A value of 2 corre&#8208;
              sponds to triple-buffering. Higher values may allow higher framer&#8208;
              ate,  but  also  increase  lag for interactive applications, e.g.,
              games. Nouveau currently reliably supports a maximum value of 2 on
              XOrg  1.12+. A maximum setting of 2 on older x-servers is allowed,
              but it will break conformance  with  the  OpenML  OML_sync_control
              specification  and  will  cause failure of software that relies on
              correct presentation timing behaviour as defined in that  specifi&#8208;
              cation.
              Default: 2 for XOrg 1.12+, 1 for older servers.
