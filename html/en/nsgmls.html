NSGMLS(1)                                                              NSGMLS(1)



NAME
       nsgmls - a validating SGML parser

       An  System Conforming to
       International Standard ISO 8879 &#8212;
       Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       nsgmls  [  -BCdeglprsuv ] [ -alinktype ] [ -b(bctf|encoding) ] [ -Ddirec&#8208;
       tory ] [ -Emax_errors ] [ -ffile ] [  -iname  ]  [  -msysid  ]  [  -oout&#8208;
       put_option ] [ -tfile ] [ -wwarning_type ] [ sysid...  ]

WARNING
       This  manual page may be out of date.  Consult the HTML documentation for
       the most up-to-date information concerning this program.   You  can  find
       the HTML document in: /usr/share/doc/sp/nsgmls.htm

DESCRIPTION
       Nsgmls parses and validates the  document whose document entity is speci&#8208;
       fied by the system identifiers sysid...  and prints on the standard  out&#8208;
       put  a  simple  text  representation of its Element Structure Information
       Set.  (This is the information set which a structure-controlled  conform&#8208;
       ing   application  should  act  upon.)  The form of system identifiers is
       described in detail below; a system identifier that does not start with &lt;
       and does not look like an absolute URL will be treated as a filename.  If
       more than one system identifier  is  specified,  then  the  corresponding
       entities will be concatenated to form the document entity.  Thus the doc&#8208;
       ument entity may be spread amongst several files; for example,  the  SGML
       declaration, prolog and document instance set could each be in a separate
       file.  If no system identifiers are specified, then nsgmls will read  the
       document  entity  from the standard input.  A command line system identi&#8208;
       fier of - can be used to refer to the standard  input.   (Normally  in  a
       system identifier, &lt;osfd&gt;0 is used to refer to standard input.)

       The following options are available:

       -alinktype
              Make  link type linktype active.  Not all ESIS information is out&#8208;
              put in this case: the active LPDs  are  not  explicitly  reported,
              although each link attribute is qualified with its link type name;
              there is no information about result elements; when there are mul&#8208;
              tiple  link rules applicable to the current element, nsgmls always
              chooses the first.

       -b(bctf|encoding)
              This determines the encoding used for output. If in fixed  charac&#8208;
              ter  set  mode  it  specifies  the name of an encoding; if not, it
              specifies the name of a BCTF.  See the description  below  of  the
              bctf storage manager attribute for more information.

       -B     Batch mode. Parse each sysid... specified on the command line sep&#8208;
              arately, rather than concatenating them.  This  is  useful  mainly
              with -s.
              If  -tfilename is also specified, then the specified filename will
              be prefixed to the sysid to make the filename for the RAST  result
              for each sysid.

       -C     The  filename...   arguments specify catalog files rather than the
              document entity.  The document entity is specified  by  the  first
              DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.

       -Ddirectory
              Search  directory for files specified in system identifiers.  Mul&#8208;
              tiple -D options are allowed.  See the description of  the  osfile
              storage manager for more information about file searching.

       -e     Describe  open  entities in error messages.  Error messages always
              include the position of the most recently opened external entity.

       -E max_errors
              Nsgmls will exit after max_errors  errors.  If  max_errors  is  0,
              there is no limit on the number of errors. The default is 200.

       -ffile Redirect  errors  to file.  This is useful mainly with shells that
              do not support redirection of stderr.

       -g     Show the GIs of open elements in error messages.

       -iname Pretend that

                     &lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;INCLUDE&quot;&gt;

              occurs at the start of the document type declaration subset in the
              document  entity.   Since  repeated  definitions  of an entity are
              ignored, this definition will take precedence over any other defi&#8208;
              nitions of this entity in the document type declaration.  Multiple
              -i options are allowed.  If the  declaration replaces the reserved
              name  INCLUDE  then  the new reserved name will be the replacement
              text of the entity.  Typically the document type declaration  will
              contain

                     &lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;IGNORE&quot;&gt;

              and  will  use  %name;  in  the  status keyword specification of a
              marked section declaration.  In this case the effect of the option
              will be to cause the marked section not to be ignored.

       -msysid
              Map  public  identifiers  and  entity  names to system identifiers
              using the catalog entry file whose  system  identifier  is  sysid.
              Multiple -m options are allowed.  If there is a catalog entry file
              called catalog in the same place as the document entity,  it  will
              be searched for immediately after those specified by -m.

       -ooutput_option
              Output additional information accordig to output_option:

              entity Output  definitions  of  all  general entities not just for
                     data or subdoc entities that are referenced or named in  an
                     ENTITY or ENTITIES attribute.

              id     Distinguish attributes whose declared value is ID.

              line   Output  L commands giving the current line number and file&#8208;
                     name.

              included
                     Output an i command for included subelements.

              Multiple -o options are allowed.

       -p     Parse only the prolog.  Nsgmls will exit after parsing  the  docu&#8208;
              ment type declaration.  Implies -s.

       -s     Suppress output.  Error messages will still be printed.

       -tfile Output  to  file  the RAST result as defined by ISO/IEC 13673:1995
              (actually this isn&apos;t quite an IS yet; this implements the Interme&#8208;
              diate  Editor&apos;s  Draft  of  1994/08/29,  with changes to implement
              ISO/IEC JTC1/SC18/WG8 N1777).  The normal output is not produced.

       -v     Print the version number.
&#12;       -wtype Control warnings and errors.  Multiple  -w  options  are  allowed.
              The following values of type enable warnings:

              mixed  Warn  about  mixed content models that do not allow #pcdata
                     anywhere.

              sgmldecl
                     Warn about various dubious constructions in the SGML decla&#8208;
                     ration.

              should Warn  about  various  recommendations made in ISO 8879 that
                     the document does not comply  with.   (Recommendations  are
                     expressed  with  ``should&apos;&apos;,  as distinct from requirements
                     which are usually expressed with ``shall&apos;&apos;.)

              default
                     Warn about defaulted references.

              duplicate
                     Warn about duplicate entity declarations.

              undefined
                     Warn about undefined elements: elements used in the DTD but
                     not defined.

              unclosed
                     Warn about unclosed start and end-tags.

              empty  Warn about empty start and end-tags.

              net    Warn about net-enabling start-tags and null end-tags.

              min-tag
                     Warn  about  minimized  start  and end-tags.  Equivalent to
                     combination of unclosed, empty and net warnings.

              unused-map
                     Warn about unused  short  reference  maps:  maps  that  are
                     declared  with  a  short  reference mapping declaration but
                     never used in a short reference use declaration in the DTD.

              unused-param
                     Warn about parameter entities that are defined but not used
                     in a DTD.

              all    Warn  about  conditions  that should usually be avoided (in
                     the opinion of the author).  Equivalent to: mixed,  should,
                     default,  undefined,  sgmldecl,  unused-map,  unused-param,
                     empty and unclosed.

              A warning can be disabled by using its  name  prefixed  with  no-.
              Thus  -wall -wno-duplicate  will  enable all warnings except those
              about duplicate entity declarations.

              The following values for warning_type disable errors:

              no-idref
                     Do not give an error for an ID  reference  value  which  no
                     element  has  as  its  ID.   The  effect will be as if each
                     attribute declared  as  an  ID  reference  value  had  been
                     declared as a name.

              no-significant
                     Do not give an error when a character that is not a signif&#8208;
                     icant character in the reference concrete syntax occurs  in
                     a  literal  in the SGML declaration.  This may be useful in
                     conjunction with certain buggy test suites.

       The following options are also supported for backwards compatibility with
       sgmls:

       -d     Same as -wduplicate.

       -l     Same as -oline.

       -r     Same as -wdefault.

       -u     Same as -wundef.

   System identifiers
       A  system identifier can either be a formal system identifier or a simple
       system identifier.  A system identifier that is a formal  system  identi&#8208;
       fier consists of a sequence of one or more storage object specifications.
       The objects specified by the storage object specifications  are  concate&#8208;
       nated  to form the entity.  A storage object specification consists of an
       SGML start-tag in the reference concrete  syntax  followed  by  character
       data  content.   The generic identifier of the start-tag is the name of a
       storage manager.  The content is a storage object identifier which  iden&#8208;
       tifies  the  storage object in a manner dependent on the storage manager.
       The start-tag can also specify attributes giving  additional  information
       about the storage object.  Numeric character references are recognized in
       storage object identifiers and attribute value literals in the start-tag.
       Record ends are ignored in the storage object identifier as with SGML.  A
       system identifier will be interpreted as a formal system identifier if it
       starts  with a &lt; followed by a storage manager name, followed by either &gt;
       or white-space; otherwise it will be interpreted as a simple system iden&#8208;
       tifier.   A storage object identifier extends until the end of the system
       identifier or until the first occurrence of &lt; followed by a storage  man&#8208;
       ager name, followed by either &gt; or white-space.

       The following storage managers are available:

       osfile The  storage  object identifier is a filename.  If the filename is
              relative it is resolved using a base filename.  Normally the  base
              filename is the name of the file in which the storage object iden&#8208;
              tifier was specified, but this  can  be  changed  using  the  base
              attribute.   The filename will be searched for first in the direc&#8208;
              tory of the base filename.  If it is not found there, then it will
              be searched for in directories specified with the -D option in the
              order in which they were specified on the command line,  and  then
              in  the  list of directories specified by the environment variable
              SGML_SEARCH_PATH.  The list is separated by colons under Unix  and
              by semi-colons under MSDOS.

       osfd   The  storage  object  identifier  is  an integer specifying a file
              descriptor.  Thus a system identifier of &lt;osfd&gt;0 will refer to the
              standard input.

       url    The  storage  object identifier is a URL.  Only the http scheme is
              currently supported and not on all systems.

       neutral
              The storage manager is the storage manager of  storage  object  in
              which  the system identifier was specified (the underlying storage
              manager).  However if the underlying storage manager does not sup&#8208;
              port  named storage objects (ie it is osfd), then the storage man&#8208;
              ager will be osfile.  The storage object identifier is treated  as
              a relative, hierarchical name separated by slashes (/) and will be
              transformed as appropriate for the underlying storage manager.

       The following attributes are supported:

       records
              This describes how records are delimited in the storage object:

              cr     Records are terminated by a carriage return.

              lf     Records are terminated by a line feed.
&#12;              crlf   Records are terminated by a carriage return followed  by  a
                     line feed.

              find   Records  are  terminated  by whichever of cr, lf or crlf is
                     first encountered in the storage object.

              asis   No recognition of records is performed.

              The default is find  except  for  NDATA  entities  for  which  the
              default is asis.

              When records are recognized in a storage object, a record start is
              inserted at the beginning of each record, and a record end at  the
              end  of  each record.  If there is a partial record (a record that
              doesn&apos;t end with the record terminator) at the end of the  entity,
              then  a  record start will be inserted before it but no record end
              will be inserted after it.

              The attribute name and = can be omitted for this attribute.

       zapeof This specifies whether a Control-Z character that  occurs  as  the
              final  byte in the storage object should be stripped.  The follow&#8208;
              ing values are allowed:

              zapeof A final Control-Z should be stripped.

              nozapeof
                     A final Control-Z should not be stripped.

              The default is zapeof except for NDATA entities, entities declared
              in  storage  objects with zapeof=nozapeof and storage objects with
              records=asis.

              The attribute name and = can be omitted for this attribute.

       bctf   The  bctf  (bit  combination  transformation   format)   attribute
              describes  how  the  bit  combinations  of  the storage object are
              transformed into the sequence of bytes that are contained  in  the
              object  identified by the storage object identifier.  This inverse
              of this transformation is performed when the entity manager  reads
              the storage object.  It has one of the following values:

              identity
                     Each bit combination is represented by a single byte.

              fixed-2
                     Each  bit  combination  is  represented by exactly 2 bytes,
                     with the more significant byte first.

              utf-8  Each bit combination is represented by a variable number of
                     bytes  according  to UCS Transformation Format 8 defined in
                     Annex P to be added by the first proposed drafted amendment
                     (PDAM 1) to ISO/IEC
                      10646-1:1993.

              euc-jp Each  bit  combination  is treated as a pair of bytes, most
                     significant byte first,  encoding  a  character  using  the
                     Extended_UNIX_Code_Fixed_Width_for_Japanese        Internet
                     charset,  and  is  transformed  into  the  variable  length
                     sequence  of  octets that would encode that character using
                     the Extended_UNIX_Code_Packed_Format_for_Japanese  Internet
                     charset.

              sjis   Each  bit  combination  is treated as a pair of bytes, most
                     significant byte first,  encoding  a  character  using  the
                     Extended_UNIX_Code_Fixed_Width_for_Japanese        Internet
                     charset,  and  is  transformed  into  the  variable  length
                     sequence  of  bytes  that would encode that character using
                     the Shift_JIS Internet charset.
&#12;              unicode
                     Each bit combination is represented by 2 bytes.  The  bytes
                     representing the entire storage object may be preceded by a
                     pair of bytes representing the byte  order  mark  character
                     (0xFEFF).   The bytes representing each bit combination are
                     in the system byte order, unless the byte order mark  char&#8208;
                     acter  is  present,  in  which  case the order of its bytes
                     determines the byte order.   When  the  storage  object  is
                     read, any byte order mark character is discarded.

              is8859-N
                     N  can be any single digit other than 0.  Each bit combina&#8208;
                     tion is interpreted as the number of a character in ISO/IEC
                     10646  and  is  represented  by  the single byte that would
                     encode that character in ISO 8859-N.  These values are  not
                     supported with the -b option.

              Values  other than identity are supported only with the multi-byte
              version of nsgmls.

       tracking
              This specifies whether line boundaries should be tracked for  this
              object:  a  value  of track specifies that they should; a value of
              notrack specifies that they should  not.   The  default  value  is
              track.   Keeping track of where line boundaries occur in a storage
              object requires approximately one byte of storage per line and  it
              may be desirable to disable this for very large storage objects.

              The attribute name and = can be omitted for this attribute.

       base   When the storage object identifier specified in the content of the
              storage object specification is relative, this specifies the  base
              storage  object  identifier  relative to which that storage object
              identifier should be  resolved.   When  not  specified  a  storage
              object identifier is interpreted relative to the storage object in
              which it is specified, provided that this  has  the  same  storage
              manager.   This  applies  both  to system identifiers specified in
              SGML documents and to system identifiers specified in the  catalog
              entry files.

       smcrd  The value is a single character that will be recognized in storage
              object identifiers (both in the content of storage object specifi&#8208;
              cations  and in the value of base attributes) as a storage manager
              character reference delimiter when followed by a digit.  A storage
              manager character reference is like an SGML numeric character ref&#8208;
              erence except that the number is interpreted as a character number
              in  the  inherent character set of the storage manager rather than
              the document character set.  The default is for no character to be
              recognized  as  a  storage  manager character reference delimiter.
              Numeric character references cannot be used to prevent recognition
              of storage manager character reference delimiters.

       fold   This  applies  only  to the neutral storage manager.  It specifies
              whether the storage object identifier should be folded to the cus&#8208;
              tomary  case  of  the underlying storage manager if storage object
              identifiers for the underlying storage manager are case sensitive.
              The following values are allowed:

              fold   The storage object identifier will be folded.

              nofold The storage object identifier will not be folded.

              The  default value is fold.  The attribute name and = can be omit&#8208;
              ted for this attribute.

              For example, on Unix filenames are case-sensitive and the  custom&#8208;
              ary case is lower-case.  So if the underlying storage manager were
              osfile and the system was a  Unix  system,  then  &lt;neutral&gt;FOO.SGM
              would be equivalent to &lt;osfile&gt;foo.sgm.
&#12;       A  simple system identifier is interpreted as a storage object identifier
       with a storage manager that depends on where the  system  identifier  was
       specified:  if it was specified in a storage object whose storage manager
       was url or if the system identifier looks like an absolute URL in a  sup&#8208;
       ported  scheme,  the  storage  manager will be url; otherwise the storage
       manager will be osfile.  The storage manager attributes are defaulted  as
       for  a  formal  system  identifier.  Numeric character references are not
       recognized in simple system identifiers.

   System identifier generation
       The entity manager generates an effective  system  identifier  for  every
       external  entity  using catalog entry files in the format defined by SGML
       Open Technical Resolution 9401:1994.  The entity  manager  will  give  an
       error  if  it is unable to generate an effective system identifier for an
       external entity.  Normally if  the  external  identifier  for  an  entity
       includes a system identifier then the entity manager will use that as the
       effective system identifier for the entity; this behaviour can be changed
       using OVERRIDE or SYSTEM entries in a catalog entry file.

       A catalog entry file contains a sequence of entries in one of the follow&#8208;
       ing forms:

       PUBLIC pubid sysid
              This specifies that sysid should be used as the  effective  system
              identifier  if  the public identifier is pubid.  Sysid is a system
              identifier as defined in ISO 8879 and pubid is a public identifier
              as defined in ISO 8879.

       ENTITY name sysid
              This  specifies  that sysid should be used as the effective system
              identifier if the entity is a general entity whose name is name.

       ENTITY %name sysid
              This specifies that sysid should be used as the  effective  system
              identifier if the entity is a parameter entity whose name is name.
              Note that there is no space between the % and the name.

       DOCTYPE name sysid
              This specifies that sysid should be used as the  effective  system
              identifier  if the entity is an entity declared in a document type
              declaration whose document type name is name.

       LINKTYPE name sysid
              This specifies that sysid should be used as the  effective  system
              identifier if the entity is an entity declared in a link type dec&#8208;
              laration whose link type name is name.

       NOTATION name sysid
              This specifies that sysid should be used as the  effective  system
              identifier  for  a notation whose name is name.  This is an exten&#8208;
              sion to the SGML Open format.  This is relevant only with  the  -n
              option.

       OVERRIDE YES|NO
              This  sets  the  overriding mode for entries up to the next occur&#8208;
              rence of OVERRIDE or the end of the catalog entry  file.   At  the
              beginning  of a catalog entry file the overriding mode will be NO.
              A PUBLIC, ENTITY, DOCTYPE, LINKTYPE  or  NOTATION  entry  with  an
              overriding  mode  of  YES will be used whether or not the external
              identifier has an explicit system identifier; those with an  over&#8208;
              riding  mode  of  NO will be ignored if external identifier has an
              explicit system identifier.  This is an extension to the SGML Open
              format.

       SYSTEM sysid1 sysid2
              This  specifies that sysid2 should be used as the effective system
              identifier if the system  identifier  specified  in  the  external
              identifier was sysid1.  This is an extension to the SGML Open for&#8208;
              mat.
&#12;       SGMLDECL sysid
              This specifies that if the document does not contain an SGML  dec&#8208;
              laration, the SGML declaration in sysid should be implied.

       DOCUMENT sysid
              This  specifies  that the document entity is sysid.  This entry is
              used only with the -C option.

       CATALOG sysid
              This specifies that sysid is the system  identifier  of  an  addi&#8208;
              tional  catalog  entry  file  to be read after this one.  Multiple
              CATALOG entries are allowed and will be read in order.  This is an
              extension to the SGML Open format.

       The delimiters can be omitted from the sysid provided it does not contain
       any white space.  Comments are allowed between parameters delimited by --
       as in SGML.

       The  environment  variable  SGML_CATALOG_FILES contains a list of catalog
       entry files.  The list is separated by colons under  Unix  and  by  semi-
       colons under MSDOS.  These will be searched after any catalog entry files
       specified using the -m option, and after the catalog  entry  file  called
       catalog  in  the  same place as the document entity.  If this environment
       variable is not set, then a system dependent list of catalog entry  files
       will  be  used.   In fact catalog entry files are not restricted to being
       files: the name of a catalog entry file is interpreted as a system  iden&#8208;
       tifier.

       A  match in one catalog entry file will take precedence over any match in
       a later catalog entry file.  A match in a catalog entry file for a SYSTEM
       entry  will  take  precedence over a match in the same file for a PUBLIC,
       ENTITY, DOCTYPE, LINKTYPE or NOTATION entry.  A match in a catalog  entry
       file  for  a  PUBLIC  entry will take precedence over a match in the same
       file for an ENTITY, DOCTYPE, LINKTYPE or NOTATION entry.

       A  character  in  a  base character set is described either by giving its
       number in a universal character set, or by specifying a minimum  literal.
       The constraints on the choice of universal character set are that charac&#8208;
       ters that are significant in the SGML reference concrete syntax  must  be
       in  the universal character set and must have the same number in the uni&#8208;
       versal character set as in ISO 646 and that each character in the charac&#8208;
       ter set must be represented by exactly one number; that character numbers
       in the range 0 to 31 and 127 to 159 are control characters (for the  pur&#8208;
       pose  of  enforcing SHUNCHAR CONTROLS).  It is recommended that ISO 10646
       (Unicode) be used as the universal character set, except in  environments
       where  the  normal  document character sets are large character set which
       cannot be compactly described in terms of ISO 10646.  The public  identi&#8208;
       fier  of  a  base  character  set  can  be associated with an entity that
       describes it by using a PUBLIC entry in  the  catalog  entry  file.   The
       entity  must  be a fragment of an SGML declaration consisting of the por&#8208;
       tion of a character set description, following the DESCSET keyword,  that
       is, it must be a sequence of character descriptions, where each character
       description specifies a described character number, the number of charac&#8208;
       ters and either a character number in the universal character set, a min&#8208;
       imum literal or the keyword UNUSED.  Character numbers in  the  universal
       character set can be as big as 99999999.

       In addition nsgmls has built in knowledge of a few character sets.  These
       are identified using the designating sequence in the  public  identifier.
       The following designating sequences are recognized:

       tab(&amp;);  c  c c c c c c c c ^ c c c c ^ l n n n l.  Designating&amp;ISO&amp;Mini&#8208;
       mum&amp;Number&amp;Description  Escape&amp;Registration&amp;Character&amp;of&amp;   Sequence&amp;Num&#8208;
       ber&amp;Number&amp;Characters&amp;  _ ESC 2/5 4/0&amp;-&amp;0&amp;128&amp;full set of ISO 646 IRV ESC
       2/8 4/0&amp;2&amp;0&amp;128&amp;G0 set of ISO 646 IRV ESC 2/8 4/2&amp;6&amp;0&amp;128&amp;G0 set of ASCII
       ESC 2/1 4/0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;32&amp;C0 set of ISO 646

       The  graphic  character  sets  do  not strictly include C0 and C1 control
       character sets.  For convenience, nsgmls augments the  graphic  character
       sets with the appropriate control character sets.

       It  is not necessary for every character set used in the SGML declaration
       to be known to nsgmls provided that characters in the document  character
       set that are significant both in the reference concrete syntax and in the
       described concrete syntax are described using known base  character  sets
       and that characters that are significant in the described concrete syntax
       are described using the same base character sets or the same minimum lit&#8208;
       erals  in both the document character set description and the syntax ref&#8208;
       erence character set description.

       The public identifier for a public concrete syntax can be associated with
       an  entity that describes using a PUBLIC entry in the catalog entry file.
       The entity must be a fragment of an SGML declaration consisting of a con&#8208;
       crete syntax description starting with the SHUNCHAR keyword as in an SGML
       declaration.  The entity can also make use of the following extensions:

              An added function can be expressed as a parameter literal  instead
              of a name.

              The  replacement for a reference reserved name can be expressed as
              a parameter literal instead of a name.

              The LCNMSTRT, UCNMSTRT, LCNMCHAR and UCNMCHAR keywords may each be
              followed by more than one parameter literal.  A sequence of param&#8208;
              eter literals has the same meaning as a single  parameter  literal
              whose  content  is the concatenation of the content of each of the
              literals in the sequence.  This extension is useful because of the
              restriction  on the length of a parameter literal in the SGML dec&#8208;
              laration to 240 characters.

              The total number of characters specified for UCNMCHAR or  UCNMSTRT
              may  exceed  the total number of characters specified for LCNMCHAR
              or LCNMSTRT respectively.  Each character in UCNMCHAR or  UCNMSTRT
              which does not have a corresponding character in the same position
              in LCNMCHAR or LCNMSTRT is simply assigned to UCNMCHAR or UCNMSTRT
              without making it the upper-case form of any character.

              A parameter following any of LCNMSTRT, UCNMSTRT, LCNMCHAR and UCN&#8208;
              MCHAR keywords may be followed by the name token ...  and  another
              parameter literal.  This has the same meaning as the two parameter
              literals with a parameter literal in between containing  in  order
              each character whose number is greater than the number of the last
              character in the first parameter literal and less than the  number
              of the first character in the second parameter literal.  A parame&#8208;
              ter literal must contain at least one character for each  ...   to
              which it is adjacent.

              A  number may be used as a parameter following the LCNMSTRT, UCNM&#8208;
              STRT, LCNMCHAR and UCNMCHAR keywords or  as  a  delimiter  in  the
              DELIM  section  with  the same meaning as a parameter literal con&#8208;
              taining just a numeric character reference with that number.

              The parameters following the LCNMSTRT, UCNMSTRT, LCNMCHAR and UCN&#8208;
              MCHAR keywords may be omitted.  This has the same meaning as spec&#8208;
              ifying an empty parameter literal.

              Within the specification of  the  short  reference  delimiters,  a
              parameter literal containing exactly one character may be followed
              by the name token ...  and another  parameter  literal  containing
              exactly one character.  This has the same meaning as a sequence of
              parameter literals one for each character number that  is  greater
              than  or equal to the number of the character in the first parame&#8208;
              ter literal and less than or equal to the number of the  character
              in the second parameter literal.

       The public identifier for a public capacity set can be associated with an
       entity that describes using a PUBLIC entry in  the  catalog  entry  file.
       The  entity  must  be  a  fragment of an SGML declaration consisting of a
       sequence of capacity names and numbers.

   Output format
       The output is a series of lines.  Lines can be  arbitrarily  long.   Each
       line  consists of an initial command character and one or more arguments.
       Arguments are separated by a single space, but when  a  command  takes  a
       fixed number of arguments the last argument can contain spaces.  There is
       no space between the command character and the first argument.  Arguments
       can contain the following escape sequences.

       \\     A \.

       \n     A record end character.

       \|     Internal SDATA entities are bracketed by these.

       \nnn   The character whose code is nnn octal.

       A  record start character will be represented by \012.  Most applications
       will need to ignore \012 and translate \n into newline.

       \#n;   The character whose number is n in decimal.  n can have any number
              of digits.  This is used for characters that are not representable
              by the encoding translation used for output (as specified  by  the
              NSGML_CODE  environment  variable).  This will only occur with the
              multibyte version of nsgmls.
&#12;       The possible command characters and arguments are as follows:

       (gi    The start of an element  whose  generic  identifier  is  gi.   Any
              attributes  for  this element will have been specified with A com&#8208;
              mands.

       )gi    The end of an element whose generic identifier is gi.

       -data  Data.

       &amp;name  A reference to an external data entity name; name will  have  been
              defined using an E command.

       ?pi    A processing instruction with data pi.

       Aname val
              The  next  element  to  start has an attribute name with value val
              which takes one of the following forms:

              IMPLIED
                     The value of the attribute is implied.

              CDATA data
                     The  attribute  is  character  data.   This  is  used   for
                     attributes whose declared value is CDATA.

              NOTATION nname
                     The  attribute  is  a  notation  name; nname will have been
                     defined using a N command.  This  is  used  for  attributes
                     whose declared value is NOTATION.

              ENTITY name...
                     The  attribute  is  a  list  of general entity names.  Each
                     entity name will have been defined using an I, E or S  com&#8208;
                     mand.   This is used for attributes whose declared value is
                     ENTITY or ENTITIES.

              TOKEN token...
                     The attribute is a  list  of  tokens.   This  is  used  for
                     attributes whose declared value is anything else.

              ID token
                     The  attribute is an ID value.  This will be output only if
                     the -oid option is specified.  Otherwise TOKEN will be used
                     for ID values.

       Dename name val
              This is the same as the A command, except that it specifies a data
              attribute for an external entity named ename.  Any D commands will
              come  after  the  E  command that defines the entity to which they
              apply, but before any &amp; or A commands that reference the entity.

       atype name val
              The next element to start has a  link  attribute  with  link  type
              type,  name name, and value val, which takes the same form as with
              the A command.

       Nnname nname.  Define a notation.  This command will be preceded by  a  p
              command if the notation was declared with a public identifier, and
              by a s command if the notation was declared with a system  identi&#8208;
              fier.   If  the -n option was specified, this command will also be
              preceded by an f command giving the system identifier generated by
              the  entity  manager  (unless  it  was unable to generate one).  A
              notation will only be defined if it is to be referenced  in  an  E
              command  or in an A command for an attribute with a declared value
              of NOTATION.

       Eename typ nname
              Define an external data entity named ename with type  typ  (CDATA,
              NDATA  or  SDATA) and notation not.  This command will be preceded
              by an f command giving the  system  identifier  generated  by  the
              entity manager (unless it was unable to generate one), by a p com&#8208;
              mand if a public identifier was declared for the entity, and by  a
              s command if a system identifier was declared for the entity.  not
              will have been defined using a N command.  Data attributes may  be
              specified for the entity using D commands.  If the -oentity option
              is not specified, an external data entity will only be defined  if
              it  is  to  be referenced in a &amp; command or in an A command for an
              attribute whose declared value is ENTITY or ENTITIES.

       Iename typ text
              Define an internal data entity  named  ename  with  type  typ  and
              entity text text.  The typ will be CDATA or SDATA unless the -oen&#8208;
              tity option was specified, in which case it can also be PI or TEXT
              (for  an   text entity).  If the -oentity option is not specified,
              an internal data entity will only be defined if it  is  referenced
              in an A command for an attribute whose declared value is ENTITY or
              ENTITIES.

       Sename Define a subdocument entity named ename.   This  command  will  be
              preceded by an f command giving the system identifier generated by
              the entity manager (unless it was unable to generate one), by a  p
              command if a public identifier was declared for the entity, and by
              a s command if a system identifier was declared  for  the  entity.
              If the -oentity option is not specified, a subdocument entity will
              only be defined if it is referenced in a { command or in an A com&#8208;
              mand for an attribute whose declared value is ENTITY or ENTITIES.

       Tename Define  an  external  SGML  text entity named ename.  This command
              will be preceded by an f command giving the system identifier gen&#8208;
              erated  by  the  entity  manager (unless it was unable to generate
              one), by a p command if a public identifier was declared  for  the
              entity, and by a s command if a system identifier was declared for
              the entity.  This command will be  output  only  if  the  -oentity
              option is specified.

       ssysid This  command  applies to the next E, S, T or N command and speci&#8208;
              fies the associated system identifier.

       ppubid This command applies to the next E, S, T or N command  and  speci&#8208;
              fies the associated public identifier.

       fsysid This  command applies to the next E, S, T or, if the -n option was
              specified, N command and specifies the system identifier generated
              by  the  entity manager from the specified external identifier and
              other information about the entity or notation.

       {ename The start of the  subdocument entity ename; ename will  have  been
              defined using a S command.

       }ename The end of the  subdocument entity ename.

       Llineno file
       Llineno
              Set  the current line number and filename.  The file argument will
              be omitted if only the line number has changed.  This will be out&#8208;
              put only if the -l option has been given.

       #text  An  APPINFO  parameter  of text was specified in the  declaration.
              This is not strictly part of the ESIS, but a  structure-controlled
              application  is permitted to act on it.  No # command will be out&#8208;
              put if APPINFO NONE was specified.  A # command will occur at most
              once, and may be preceded only by a single L command.

       C      This  command  indicates that the document was a conforming  docu&#8208;
              ment.  If this command is output, it will be the last command.  An
              document  is  not conforming if it references a subdocument entity
              that is not conforming.

ENVIRONMENT
       SP_BCTF
              If this is set to one of identity, utf-8, euc-jp  and  sjis,  then
              that BCTF will be used as the default BCTF for everything (includ&#8208;
              ing file input, file output, message output, filenames and command
              line arguments).
