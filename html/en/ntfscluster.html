NTFSCLUSTER(8)                                                    NTFSCLUSTER(8)



NAME
       ntfscluster - identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume.

SYNOPSIS
       ntfscluster [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfscluster has three modes of operation: info, sector and cluster.

   Info
       The  default  mode,  info  is currently not implemented.  It will display
       general information about the NTFS volume when it is working.

   Sector
       The sector mode will display a list of files that have data in the speci&#8208;
       fied range of sectors.

   Cluster
       The cluster mode will display a list of files that have data in the spec&#8208;
       ified range of clusters.  When the cluster size is one sector, this  will
       be equivalent to the sector mode of operation.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a summary of all the options that ntfscluster accepts.  Nearly
       all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded  by  -
       and  the  long  name  is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that
       don&apos;t take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.   -fv
       is  equivalent  to  -f  -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any
       unique prefix of their name.

       -c, --cluster RANGE
              Any files whose data is in this range of  clusters  will  be  dis&#8208;
              played.

       -F, --filename NAME
              Show information about this file.

       -f, --force
              This  will  override  some  sensible defaults, such as not working
              with a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -I, --inode NUM
              Show information about this inode.

       -i, --info
              This option is not yet implemented.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount of output to a minimum.  Naturally,  it  doesn&apos;t
              make sense to combine this option with

       -s, --sector RANGE
              Any  files  whose  data  is  in this range of sectors will be dis&#8208;
              played.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfscluster prints.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license for ntfscluster.
&#12;EXAMPLES
       Get some information about the volume /dev/hda1.

              ntfscluster /dev/hda1

       Look for files in the first 500 clusters of /dev/hda1.

              ntfscluster -c 0-500 /dev/hda1


BUGS
       The info mode isn&apos;t implemented yet.  ntfscluster is quite  limited,  but
       it  has no known bugs.  If you find a bug please send an email describing
       the problem to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net
