NTFSFIX(8)                                                            NTFSFIX(8)



NAME
       ntfsfix - fix common errors and force Windows to check NTFS

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsfix [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsfix  is  a  utility that fixes some common NTFS problems.  ntfsfix is
       NOT a Linux version of chkdsk.  It only  repairs  some  fundamental  NTFS
       inconsistencies,  resets the NTFS journal file and schedules an NTFS con&#8208;
       sistency check for the first boot into Windows.

       You may run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was damaged by Win&#8208;
       dows or some other way and it cannot be mounted.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a summary of all the options that ntfsfix accepts.  Nearly all
       options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by  -  and
       the  long  name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don&apos;t
       take an argument, can be combined into a single  command,  e.g.   -fv  is
       equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique
       prefix of their name.

       -b, --clear-bad-sectors
              Clear the list of bad sectors. This is useful after cloning an old
              disk with bad sectors to a new disk.

       -d, --clear-dirty
              Clear  the  volume  dirty  flag  if  the  volume  can be fixed and
              mounted.  If the option is not present or  the  volume  cannot  be
              fixed,  the  dirty volume flag is set to request a volume checking
              at next mount.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -n, --do-nothing
              Do not write anything, just show what would have been done.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license
