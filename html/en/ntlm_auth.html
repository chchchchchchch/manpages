NTLM_AUTH(1)                      User Commands                     NTLM_AUTH(1)



NAME
       ntlm_auth - tool to allow external access to Winbind&#180;s NTLM
       authentication function

SYNOPSIS
       ntlm_auth [-d debuglevel] [-l logdir] [-s &lt;smb config file&gt;]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       ntlm_auth is a helper utility that authenticates users using NT/LM
       authentication. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated successfully
       and 1 if access was denied. ntlm_auth uses winbind to access the user and
       authentication data for a domain. This utility is only intended to be
       used by other programs (currently Squid and mod_ntlm_winbind)

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
       The winbindd(8) daemon must be operational for many of these commands to
       function.

       Some of these commands also require access to the directory
       winbindd_privileged in /var/run/samba. This should be done either by
       running this command as root or providing group access to the
       winbindd_privileged directory. For security reasons, this directory
       should not be world-accessable.

OPTIONS
       --helper-protocol=PROTO
           Operate as a stdio-based helper. Valid helper protocols are:

           squid-2.4-basic
               Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.4&#180;s basic (plaintext)
               authentication.

           squid-2.5-basic
               Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.5&#180;s basic (plaintext)
               authentication.

           squid-2.5-ntlmssp
               Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.5&#180;s NTLMSSP
               authentication.

               Requires access to the directory winbindd_privileged in
               /var/run/samba. The protocol used is described here:
               http://devel.squid-cache.org/ntlm/squid_helper_protocol.html.
               This protocol has been extended to allow the NTLMSSP Negotiate
               packet to be included as an argument to the YR command. (Thus
               avoiding loss of information in the protocol exchange).

           ntlmssp-client-1
               Client-side helper for use with arbitrary external programs that
               may wish to use Samba&#180;s NTLMSSP authentication knowledge.

               This helper is a client, and as such may be run by any user. The
               protocol used is effectively the reverse of the previous
               protocol. A YR command (without any arguments) starts the
               authentication exchange.

           gss-spnego
               Server-side helper that implements GSS-SPNEGO. This uses a
               protocol that is almost the same as squid-2.5-ntlmssp, but has
               some subtle differences that are undocumented outside the source
               at this stage.

               Requires access to the directory winbindd_privileged in
               /var/run/samba.

           gss-spnego-client
               Client-side helper that implements GSS-SPNEGO. This also uses a
               protocol similar to the above helpers, but is currently
               undocumented.

           ntlm-server-1
               Server-side helper protocol, intended for use by a RADIUS server
               or the &#180;winbind&#180; plugin for pppd, for the provision of MSCHAP and
               MSCHAPv2 authentication.

               This protocol consists of lines in the form: Parameter: value and
               Parameter:: Base64-encode value. The presence of a single period
               .  indicates that one side has finished supplying data to the
               other. (Which in turn could cause the helper to authenticate the
               user).

               Currently implemented parameters from the external program to the
               helper are:

               Username
                   The username, expected to be in Samba&#180;s unix charset.

               NT-Domain
                   The user&#180;s domain, expected to be in Samba&#180;s unix charset.

               Full-Username
                   The fully qualified username, expected to be in Samba&#180;s unix
                   charset and qualified with the winbind separator.

               LANMAN-Challenge
                   The 8 byte LANMAN Challenge value, generated randomly by the
                   server, or (in cases such as MSCHAPv2) generated in some way
                   by both the server and the client.

               LANMAN-Response
                   The 24 byte LANMAN Response value, calculated from the user&#180;s
                   password and the supplied LANMAN Challenge. Typically, this
                   is provided over the network by a client wishing to
                   authenticate.

               NT-Response
                   The &gt;= 24 byte NT Response calculated from the user&#180;s
                   password and the supplied LANMAN Challenge. Typically, this
                   is provided over the network by a client wishing to
                   authenticate.

               Password
                   The user&#180;s password. This would be provided by a network
                   client, if the helper is being used in a legacy situation
                   that exposes plaintext passwords in this way.

               Request-User-Session-Key
                   Upon successful authenticaiton, return the user session key
                   associated with the login.

               Request-LanMan-Session-Key
                   Upon successful authenticaiton, return the LANMAN session key
                   associated with the login.

                   Warning
                   Implementers should take care to base64 encode           any
                   data (such as usernames/passwords) that may contain malicous
                   user data, such as           a newline.  They may also need
                   to decode strings from           the helper, which likewise
                   may have been base64 encoded..sp .5v

       --username=USERNAME
           Specify username of user to authenticate

       --domain=DOMAIN
           Specify domain of user to authenticate

       --workstation=WORKSTATION
           Specify the workstation the user authenticated from

       --challenge=STRING
           NTLM challenge (in HEXADECIMAL)

       --lm-response=RESPONSE
           LM Response to the challenge (in HEXADECIMAL)

       --nt-response=RESPONSE
           NT or NTLMv2 Response to the challenge (in HEXADECIMAL)

       --password=PASSWORD
           User&#180;s plaintext password

           If not specified on the command line, this is prompted for when
           required.

           For the NTLMSSP based server roles, this parameter specifies the
           expected password, allowing testing without winbindd operational.

       --request-lm-key
           Retrieve LM session key

       --request-nt-key
           Request NT key

       --diagnostics
           Perform Diagnostics on the authentication chain. Uses the password
           from --password or prompts for one.

       --require-membership-of={SID|Name}
           Require that a user be a member of specified group (either name or
           SID) for authentication to succeed.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter
           is not specified is 0.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
           designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
           data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           smb.conf.5.html# parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
           server. The information in this file includes server-specific
           information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
           descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
           smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot;
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file
           is never removed by the client.

       -h|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

EXAMPLE SETUP
       To setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5, with both basic and NTLMSSP
       authentication, the following should be placed in the squid.conf file.

           auth_param ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp
           auth_param basic program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic
           auth_param basic children 5
           auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
           auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours

           Note
           This example assumes that ntlm_auth has been installed into your
           path, and that the group permissions on winbindd_privileged are as
           described above.

       To setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5 with group limitation in addition
       to the above example, the following should be added to the squid.conf
       file.

           auth_param ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --require-membership-of=&#180;WORKGROUP\Domain Users&#180;
           auth_param basic program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic --require-membership-of=&#180;WORKGROUP\Domain Users&#180;

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If you&#180;re experiencing problems with authenticating Internet Explorer
       running under MS Windows 9X or Millennium Edition against ntlm_auth&#180;s
       NTLMSSP authentication helper (--helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp), then
       please read the Microsoft Knowledge Base article #239869 and follow
       instructions described there.
