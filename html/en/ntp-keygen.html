NTP-KEYGEN(8)                                                      NTP-KEYGEN(8)



NAME
       ntp-keygen - generate public and private keys

SYNOPSIS
       ntp-keygen [ -deGgHIMnPT ] [ -c [RSA-MD2 | RSA-MD5 | RSA-SHA | RSA-SHA1 |
       RSA-MDC2 | RSA-RIPEMD160 | DSA-SHA | DSA-SHA1 ] ] [ -i name ] [ -p  pass&#8208;
       word ] [ -S [ RSA | DSA ] ] [ -s name ] [ -v nkeys ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4 authen&#8208;
       tication and identification schemes. It generates MD5 key files  used  in
       symmetric  key cryptography. In addition, if the OpenSSL software library
       has been installed, it generates keys,  certificate  and  identity  files
       used  in public key cryptography. These files are used for cookie encryp&#8208;
       tion, digital signature and challenge/response identification  algorithms
       compatible with the Internet standard security infrastructure.
