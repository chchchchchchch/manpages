NTPQ(8)                                                                  NTPQ(8)



NAME
       ntp-wait - wait for NTP server to synchronize

SYNOPSIS
       ntp-wait [ -f ] [ -n tries ] [ -s sleep ] [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       ntp-wait  waits  until  the  locally running ntpd is in state 4 (synchro&#8208;
       nized).  This could be useful at boot time, to delay  the  boot  sequence
       until after &quot;ntpd -g&quot; has set the time.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force hard failure if state is unknown.

       -n tries
              Number of tries before giving up (default 1000 = 10min+)

       -s sleep
              Seconds to sleep between tries (default 6s = 10/min)

       -v     Be verbose.
