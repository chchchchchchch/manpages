NTP.CONF(5)       The Network Time Protocol (NTP) Distribution       NTP.CONF(5)



NAME
       ntp.conf - NTP server configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ntp.conf

DESCRIPTION
       Ordinarily, ntpd reads the ntp.conf configuration file at startup time in
       order to determine the synchronization sources and operating  modes.   It
       is  also  possible  to specify a working, although limited, configuration
       entirely on the command line, obviating  the  need  for  a  configuration
       file.   This may be particularly useful when the local host is to be con&#8208;
       figured as a broadcast/multicast client, with all peers being  determined
       by listening to broadcasts at run time.

       Usually,  the  configuration file is installed in the /etc directory, but
       could be installed elsewhere (see the -c conffile command  line  option).
       The  file  format is similar to other Unix configuration files - comments
       begin with a # character and extend to the end of the line;  blank  lines
       are ignored.

       Configuration  commands  consist of an initial keyword followed by a list
       of arguments, some of which may be  optional,  separated  by  whitespace.
       Commands  may not be continued over multiple lines. Arguments may be host
       names, host addresses written in  numeric,  dotted-quad  form,  integers,
       floating  point  numbers  (when  specifying  times  in  seconds) and text
       strings.  Optional arguments are  delimited  by  [  ]  in  the  following
       descriptions,  while alternatives are separated by |.  The notation [ ...
       ] means an optional, indefinite repetition of the last item before the  [
       ... ].

       Following is a description of the configuration commands in NTPv4.  There
       are two classes of commands, configuration  commands  that  configure  an
       association  with a remote server, peer or reference clock, and auxiliary
       commands  that  specify  environmental  variables  that  control  various
       related operations.

   Configuration Commands
       The  various modes are determined by the command keyword and the required
       IP address.  Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote server or peer
       (IPv4  class A, B and C), (b) the broadcast address of a local interface,
       (m) a multicast address (IPv4 class D), or (r) a reference clock  address
       (127.127.x.x).   The  options  that  can  be used with these commands are
       listed below.

       If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is detected,
       support  for  the  IPv6  address  family  is generated in addition to the
       default support of the IPv4 address family.  IPv6 addresses can be  iden&#8208;
       tified  by  the  presence  of  colons  &quot;:&quot;  in  the  address field.  IPv6
       addresses can be used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used,
       with  the  exception of reference clock addresses, which are always IPv4.
       Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier  pre&#8208;
       ceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a
       -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

       There are  three  types  of  associations:  persistent,  preemptable  and
       ephemeral.  Persistent associations are mobilized by a configuration com&#8208;
       mand and never demobilized.  Preemptable associations, which are  new  to
       NTPv4, are mobilized by a configuration command which includes the prempt
       flag and are demobilized by timeout or error.  Ephemeral associations are
       mobilized  upon arrival of designated messages and demobilized by timeout
       or error.

       server address [options ...]

       peer address [options ...]

       broadcast address [options ...]

       manycastclient address [options ...]
              These four commands specify the time server name or address to  be
              used  and the mode in which to operate.  The address can be either
              a DNS name or a IP address in  dotted-quad  notation.   Additional
              information  on  association behavior can be found in the Associa&#8208;
              tion Management page.

              server For type s and r addresses (only),  this  command  normally
                     mobilizes  a  persistent  client  mode association with the
                     specified remote server or local reference  clock.  If  the
                     preempt  flag  is  specified,  a preemptable association is
                     mobilized instead. In client mode the client clock can syn&#8208;
                     chronize to the remote server or local reference clock, but
                     the remote server can never be synchronized to  the  client
                     clock.  This  command  should  NOT  be used for type b or m
                     addresses.

              peer   For type s addresses (only), this command mobilizes a  per&#8208;
                     sistent  symmetric-active  mode association with the speci&#8208;
                     fied remote peer. In this mode the local clock can be  syn&#8208;
                     chronized to the remote peer or the remote peer can be syn&#8208;
                     chronized to the local clock. This is useful in  a  network
                     of  servers  where, depending on various failure scenarios,
                     either the local or remote peer may be the better source of
                     time.  This  command  should NOT be used for type b, m or r
                     addresses.

              broadcast
                     For type b and m addresses (only), this command mobilizes a
                     persistent  broadcast  mode  association. Multiple commands
                     can be used to specify multiple local broadcast  interfaces
                     (subnets) and/or multiple multicast groups. Note that local
                     broadcast messages go only to the interface associated with
                     the  subnet  specified,  but  multicast  messages go to all
                     interfaces.

                     In broadcast mode the local server sends periodic broadcast
                     messages  to  a client population at the address specified,
                     which is usually the broadcast  address  on  (one  of)  the
                     local  network(s)  or  a multicast address assigned to NTP.
                     The IANA has assigned  the  multicast  group  address  IPv4
                     224.0.1.1  and  IPv6  ff05::101 (site local) exclusively to
                     NTP, but other nonconflicting addresses can be used to con&#8208;
                     tain  the  messages within administrative boundaries. Ordi&#8208;
                     narily, this specification applies only to the local server
                     operating as a sender; for operation as a broadcast client,
                     see the broadcastclient or multicastclient commands below.

              manycastclient
                     For type m addresses (only), this command mobilizes a  pre&#8208;
                     emptable manycast client mode association for the multicast
                     group address specified. In this mode  a  specific  address
                     must  be  supplied  which  matches  the address used on the
                     manycastserver command for the designated manycast servers.
                     The  NTP  multicast  address 224.0.1.1 assigned by the IANA
                     should NOT be used, unless  specific  means  are  taken  to
                     avoid  spraying large areas of the Internet with these mes&#8208;
                     sages and causing a possibly massive implosion  of  replies
                     at the sender.

                     The  manycastclient  command  specifies that the host is to
                     operate in client mode with the  remote  servers  that  are
                     discovered  as  the result of broadcast/multicast messages.
                     The client  broadcasts  a  request  message  to  the  group
                     address  associated with the specified address and specifi&#8208;
                     cally enabled servers respond to these messages. The client
                     selects  the  servers providing the best time and continues
                     as with the server command. The remaining servers are  dis&#8208;
                     carded as if never heard.

   Command Options
       autokey
              All  packets  sent  to and received from the server or peer are to
              include authentication fields encrypted using the  autokey  scheme
              described  in  the  Authentication  Options  page.  This option is
              valid with all commands.

       burst  When the server is  reachable,  send  a  burst  of  eight  packets
              instead  of  the  usual  one.  The packet spacing is normally 2 s;
              however, the spacing between the first and second packets  can  be
              changed  with the calldelay command to allow additional time for a
              modem or ISDN call to complete.  This option is  valid  with  only
              the  server  command and is a recommended option with this command
              when the maxpoll option is 11 or greater.

       iburst When the server is unreachable, send  a  burst  of  eight  packets
              instead  of  the  usual  one.  The packet spacing is normally 2 s;
              however, the spacing between the first and second packets  can  be
              changed  with the calldelay command to allow additional time for a
              modem or ISDN call to complete.  This option is  valid  with  only
              the server command and is a recommended option with this command.

       key key
              All  packets  sent  to and received from the server or peer are to
              include authentication fields encrypted using  the  specified  key
              identifier with values from 1 to 65534, inclusive.  The default is
              to include no encryption field.  This option  is  valid  with  all
              commands.

       minpoll minpoll, maxpoll maxpoll
              These  options  specify the minimum and maximum poll intervals for
              NTP messages, in seconds as a power  of  two.   The  maximum  poll
              interval  defaults  to  10  (1,024 s), but can be increased by the
              maxpoll option to an upper limit of 17 (36.4 h).  The minimum poll
              interval defaults to 6 (64 s), but can be decreased by the minpoll
              option to a lower limit of 4 (16 s).  These option are valid  only
              with the server and peer commands.

       mode option
              Pass  the  option  to a reference clock driver, where option is an
              integer in the range from 0 to  255,  inclusive.  This  option  is
              valid only with type r addresses.

       noselect
              Marks  the  server  as  unused,  except for display purposes.  The
              server is discarded by the selection algorithm.   This  option  is
              valid only with the server and peer commands.

       preempt
              Specifies  the  association as preemptable rather than the default
              persistent.  This option is valied only with the server command.

       prefer Marks the server as preferred.  All other things being equal, this
              host  will  be chosen for synchronization among a set of correctly
              operating hosts.  See the Mitigation Rules and the prefer  Keyword
              page  for further information.  This option is valid only with the
              server and peer commands.

       true   Force the association to assume truechimer status; that is, always
              survive  the selection and clustering algorithms.  This option can
              be used with any association, but is  most  useful  for  reference
              clocks  with  large jitter on the serial port and precision pulse-
              per-second (PPS) signals.  Caution: this option defeats the  algo&#8208;
              rithms  designed  to  cast  out  falsetickers  and can allow these
              sources to set the system clock.  This option is valid  only  with
              the server and peer commands.

       ttl ttl
              This option is used only with broadcast server and manycast client
              modes.  It specifies the time-to-live  ttl  to  use  on  broadcast
              server  and multicast server and the maximum ttl for the expanding
              ring search with manycast client packets.  Selection of the proper
              value,  which  defaults  to  127,  is something of a black art and
              should be coordinated with the network administrator.

       version version
              Specifies the version number to be used for outgoing NTP  packets.
              Versions  1-4  are  the choices, with version 4 the default.  This
              option is valid only with the server, peer and broadcast commands.

       xleave Operate in interleaved mode (symmetric and broadcast modes  only).
              (see NTP Interleaved Modes)

   Auxiliary Commands
       broadcastclient [novolley]
              This command enables reception of broadcast server messages to any
              local interface (type b) address.  Ordinarily,  upon  receiving  a
              message for the first time, the broadcast client measures the nom&#8208;
              inal server propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange
              with the server, after which it continues in listen-only mode.  If
              the novolley keyword is present, the exchange is not used and  the
              value  specified  in the broadcastdelay command is used or, if the
              broadcastdelay command is not used,  the  default  4.0  ms.   Note
              that, in order to avoid accidental or malicious disruption in this
              mode, both the server and client should  operate  using  symmetric
              key  or  public key authentication as described in the Authentica&#8208;
              tion Options page.  Note that the novolley keyword is incompatible
              with public key authentication.

       manycastserver address [...]
              This  command enables reception of manycast client messages to the
              multicast group address(es) (type  m)  specified.   At  least  one
              address is required.  The NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1 assigned
              by the IANA should NOT be used, unless specific means are taken to
              limit the span of the reply and avoid a possibly massive implosion
              at the original sender.  Note that, in order to  avoid  accidental
              or  malicious  disruption in this mode, both the server and client
              should operate using symmetric key or public key authentication as
              described in the Authentication Options page.

       multicastclient address [...]
              This command enables reception of multicast server messages to the
              multicast group address(es) (type m) specified.  Upon receiving  a
              message for the first time, the multicast client measures the nom&#8208;
              inal server propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange
              with  the  server, then enters the broadcast client mode, in which
              it synchronizes to succeeding multicast messages.  Note  that,  in
              order  to  avoid  accidental or malicious disruption in this mode,
              both the server and client should operate using symmetric  key  or
              public  key  authentication  as  described  in  the Authentication
              Options page.

   Authentication Commands
       autokey [logsec]
              Specifies the interval between regenerations of  the  session  key
              list used with the autokey feature.  Note that the size of the key
              list for each association depends on this interval and the current
              poll  interval.   The  default  value  is  12 (4096 s or about 1.1
              hours).  For poll intervals above the specified interval,  a  ses&#8208;
              sion  key  list  with a single entry will be regenerated for every
              message sent.

       revoke [logsec]
              Specifies the interval between recomputations of the private value
              used with the autokey feature, which ordinarily requires an expen&#8208;
              sive public- key computation.  The default value is 12  (65,536  s
              or about 18 hours).  For poll intervals above the specified inter&#8208;
              val, a new private value will  be  recomputed  for  every  message
              sent.

   Miscellaneous Options
       driftfile driftfile
              This command specifies the name of the file use to record the fre&#8208;
              quency offset of the local clock oscillator.  If the file  exists,
              it is read at startup in order to set the initial frequency offset
              and then updated once per hour with the current  frequency  offset
              computed  by  the daemon.  If the file does not exist or this com&#8208;
              mand is not given, the initial frequency offset is assumed  to  be
              zero.   In  this case, it may take some hours for the frequency to
              stabilize and the residual timing errors to subside.

              The file format consists of a  single  line  containing  a  single
              floating point number, which records the frequency offset measured
              in parts-per-million (PPM).  The file is updated by first  writing
              the  current  drift  value into a temporary file and then renaming
              this file to replace the old version.  This implies that ntpd must
              have  write permission for the directory the drift file is located
              in, and that file system links, symbolic or otherwise,  should  be
              avoided.

       enable  [auth  |  bclient  |  calibrate  | kernel | monitor | ntp | pps |
       stats]

       disable [auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | monitor  |  ntp  |  pps  |
       stats]
              Provides a way to enable or disable various server options.  Flags
              not mentioned are unaffected.  Note that all of these flags can be
              controlled remotely using the ntpdc utility program.

              auth   Enables  the  server to synchronize with unconfigured peers
                     only if the peer has  been  correctly  authenticated  using
                     either public key or private key cryptography.  The default
                     for this flag is enable.

              bclient
                     Enables the server to listen for a message from a broadcast
                     or multicast server, as in the multicastclient command with
                     default address.  The default for this flag is disable.

              calibrate
                     Enables the calibrate feature for  reference  clocks.   The
                     default for this flag is disable.

              kernel Enables  the  kernel  time  discipline,  if available.  The
                     default for this flag is enable if  support  is  available,
                     otherwise disable.
&#12;              monitor
                     Enables the monitoring facility.  See the ntpdc program and
                     the monlist command or further  information.   The  default
                     for this flag is enable.

              ntp    Enables  time  and  frequency  discipline.  In effect, this
                     switch opens and closes the feedback loop, which is  useful
                     for testing.  The default for this flag is enable.

              pps    Enables  the  pulse-per-second  (PPS) signal when frequency
                     and time is disciplined by the precision time kernel  modi&#8208;

       includefile includefile
              This  command  allows  additional  configuration  commands  to  be
              included from a separate file.  Include files may be nested  to  a
              depth  of five; upon reaching the end of any include file, command
              processing resumes  in  the  previous  configuration  file.   This
              option  is  useful for sites that run ntpd on multiple hosts, with
              (mostly) common options (e.g., a restriction list).

       interface [listen | ignore | drop] [all | ipv4 | ipv6 | wildcard | name |
       address[/prefixlen]]
              This  command  controls  which  network  addresses ntpd opens, and
              whether input is dropped without processing. The  first  parameter
              determines the action for addresses which match the second parame&#8208;
              ter. That parameter specifies a class of addresses, or a  specific
              interface  name,  or  an  address.  In the address case, prefixlen
              determines how many bits must match for this rule to apply. ignore
              prevents  opening matching addresses, drop causes ntpd to open the
              address and drop all received packets without examination.  Multi&#8208;
              ple  interface commands can be used. The last rule which matches a
              particular address determines the action for  it.  interface  com&#8208;
              mands  are  disabled if any -I, --interface, -L, or --novirtualips
              command-line options are used. If none of those options  are  used
              and  no interface actions are specified in the configuration file,
              all available network addresses are opened. The nic command is  an
              alias for interface.

NOTES
       Note  that  this  manual page shows only the most important configuration
       commands.  The full documentation (see below) contains more details.

BUGS
       The syntax checking is not picky; some  combinations  of  ridiculous  and
       even hilarious options and modes may not be detected.
