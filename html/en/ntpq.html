NTPQ(1)                                                                  NTPQ(1)



NAME
       ntpq - standard NTP query program

SYNOPSIS
       ntpq [-inp] [-c command] [host] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  ntpq  utility  program is used to monitor NTP daemon ntpd operations
       and determine performance. It uses the standard NTP mode 6  control  mes&#8208;
       sage  formats  defined  in Appendix B of the NTPv3 specification RFC1305.
       The same formats are used in NTPv4, although some of the  variables  have
       changed and new ones added. The description on this page is for the NTPv4
       variables.

       The program can be run either in interactive  mode  or  controlled  using
       command  line  arguments.  Requests to read and write arbitrary variables
       can be assembled, with raw and pretty-printed output options being avail&#8208;
       able. The ntpq can also obtain and print a list of peers in a common for&#8208;
       mat by sending multiple queries to the server.

       If one or more request options is included on the command line when  ntpq
       is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers running
       on each of the hosts given as command line arguments, or on localhost  by
       default.  If no request options are given, ntpq will attempt to read com&#8208;
       mands from the standard input and execute these on the NTP server running
       on  the  first host given on the command line, again defaulting to local&#8208;
       host when no other host is specified. ntpq will prompt  for  commands  if
       the standard input is a terminal device.

       ntpq  uses  NTP  mode  6  packets to communicate with the NTP server, and
       hence can be used to query any compatible server  on  the  network  which
       permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this communication will
       be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of  net&#8208;
       work  topology.  ntpq  makes one attempt to retransmit requests, and will
       time requests out if the remote host is not heard from within a  suitable
       timeout time.

       Note  that in contexts where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier pre&#8208;
       ceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a
       -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

OPTIONS
       Command  line  options are described following. Specifying a command line
       option other than -i or -n will cause the specified query (queries) to be
       sent  to  the indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise, ntpq will attempt
       to read interactive format commands from the standard input.

       -4     Force DNS resolution of following host names on the  command  line
              to the IPv4 namespace.

       -6     Force  DNS  resolution of following host names on the command line
              to the IPv6 namespace.

       -c     The following argument is interpreted  as  an  interactive  format
              command and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the
              specified host(s). Multiple -c options may be given.

       -i     Force ntpq to operate in interactive mode. Prompts will be written
              to the standard output and commands read from the standard input.

       -n     Output  all  host  addresses  in dotted-quad numeric format rather
              than converting to the canonical host names.

       -p     Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
              of  their  state. This is equivalent to the peers interactive com&#8208;
              mand.
