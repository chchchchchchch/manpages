NAME
       obmenu - a menu editor for openbox

SYNTAX
       obmenu

DESCRIPTION
       Obmenu is a menu editor designed for openbox.

       It&#180;s  easy  to  use, allowing to get the most out of the powerful Openbox
       menu system, while hiding the xml layout from the user.  It also provides
       a  bunch  of  dynamic  menus  (pipe  menus),  such  as  Gnome  menus or a
       quick-navigator.

       You can also use the obxml module to easily write pipe menus of your  own
       in Python.

       Most   updated  info  about  obmenu  can  be  found  on  its  home  page:
