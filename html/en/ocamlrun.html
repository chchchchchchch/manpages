OCAMLRUN(1)                                                          OCAMLRUN(1)



NAME
       ocamlrun - The Objective Caml bytecode interpreter


SYNOPSIS
       ocamlrun [ options ] filename argument ...


DESCRIPTION
       The  ocamlrun(1)  command executes bytecode files produced by the linking
       phase of the ocamlc(1) command.

       The first non-option argument is taken to be the name of  the  file  con&#8208;
       taining the executable bytecode. (That file is searched in the executable
       path as well as in the current directory.) The  remaining  arguments  are
       passed to the Objective Caml program, in the string array Sys.argv.  Ele&#8208;
       ment 0 of this array is the name of the bytecode  executable  file;  ele&#8208;
       ments 1 to n are the remaining arguments.

       In  most  cases,  the bytecode executable files produced by the ocamlc(1)
       command are self-executable, and manage to launch the ocamlrun(1) command
       on themselves automatically.


OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are recognized by ocamlrun(1).

       -b     When  the  program  aborts  due  to an uncaught exception, print a
              detailed &quot;back trace&quot; of the execution, showing where  the  excep&#8208;
              tion  was raised and which function calls were outstanding at this
              point.  The back trace is printed only if the bytecode  executable
              contains  debugging information, i.e. was compiled and linked with
              the -g option to ocamlc(1) set.  This option is equivalent to set&#8208;
              ting  the  b  flag  in the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable (see
              below).

       -I dir Search the directory  dir  for  dynamically-loaded  libraries,  in
              addition  to  the standard search path.  -p Print the names of the
              primitives known to this version of ocamlrun(1) and exit.

       -v     Direct the memory manager to print verbose  messages  on  standard
              error.   This  is  equivalent to setting v=63 in the OCAMLRUNPARAM
              environment variable (see below).

       -version
              Print version string and exit.

       -vnum  Print short version number and exit.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variable are also consulted:

       CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
              Additional directories to search for dynamically-loaded libraries.

       OCAMLLIB
              The directory containing the Objective Caml standard library.  (If
              OCAMLLIB is not set, CAMLLIB will be used instead.) Used to locate
              the ld.conf configuration file for dynamic loading.  If  not  set,
              default  to  the library directory specified when compiling Objec&#8208;
              tive Caml.

       OCAMLRUNPARAM
              Set the runtime system options and garbage collection  parameters.
              (If  OCAMLRUNPARAM is not set, CAMLRUNPARAM will be used instead.)
              This variable must be a sequence of parameter  specifications.   A
              parameter specification is an option letter followed by an = sign,
              a decimal number (or a hexadecimal number prefixed by 0x), and  an
              optional  multiplier.  There are nine options, six of which corre&#8208;
              spond to the fields of the control record documented in The Objec&#8208;
              tive Caml user&apos;s manual, chapter &quot;Standard Library&quot;, section &quot;Gc&quot;.

       b      Trigger  the printing of a stack backtrace when an uncaught excep&#8208;
              tion aborts the program.  This option takes no argument.

       p      Turn on debugging support for ocamlyacc-generated  parsers.   When
              this  option  is  on,  the  pushdown  automaton  that executes the
              parsers prints a trace of its actions.  This option takes no argu&#8208;
              ment.

       a (allocation_policy)
              The policy used for allocating in the OCaml heap.  Possible values
              are 0 for the next-fit policy, and 1  for  the  first-fit  policy.
              Next-fit  is somewhat faster, but first-fit is better for avoiding
              fragmentation and the associated heap compactions.

       s (minor_heap_size)
              The size of the minor heap (in words).

       i (major_heap_increment)
              The default size increment for the major heap (in words).

       o (space_overhead)
              The major GC speed setting.

       O (max_overhead)
              The heap compaction trigger setting.

       l (stack_limit)
              The limit (in words) of the stack size.

       h      The initial size of the major heap (in words).

       v (verbose)
              What GC messages to print to stderr.  This  is  a  sum  of  values
              selected from the following:

              0x001 Start of major GC cycle.

              0x002 Minor collection and major GC slice.

              0x004 Growing and shrinking of the heap.

              0x008 Resizing of stacks and memory manager tables.

              0x010 Heap compaction.

              0x020 Change of GC parameters.

              0x040 Computation of major GC slice size.

              0x080 Calling of finalisation functions.

              0x100  Startup  messages  (loading  the  bytecode executable file,
              resolving shared libraries).

              The multiplier is k, M or G, for multiplication by 2^10, 2^20, and
              2^30  respectively.   For example, on a 32-bit machine under bash,
              the command export OCAMLRUNPARAM=&apos;s=256k,v=1&apos; tells  a  subsequent
              ocamlrun  to  set its initial minor heap size to 1 megabyte and to
              print a message at the start of each major GC cycle.

       CAMLRUNPARAM
              If OCAMLRUNPARAM is not found in the  environment,  then  CAMLRUN&#8208;
              PARAM  will  be  used instead.  If CAMLRUNPARAM is not found, then
              the default values will be used.

       PATH   List of directories searched to find the bytecode executable file.
