NAME
       odbcinst - command line tool for batch ODBC configuration

SYNOPSIS
       odbcinst action object options

       action is one of

              -i     install a driver or data source

              -u     uninstall a driver or data source

              -q     query a list of drivers or data sources present on the sys&#8208;
                     tem

              --version
                     shows the version number of the program

       object is one of

              -d     an ODBC driver in /etc/odbcinst.ini

              -s     an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) in an odbc.ini file.

       options are zero or more of

              -f template file
                     Used with -i, this option specifies a  template  file  con&#8208;
                     taining the driver or DSN to be installed.

              -r     Read the template from standard input.

              -n Driver/Data Source Name
                     Used with -u to specify a driver or DSN to remove.

              -v     Contrary  to standard practice, this turns off verbose out&#8208;
                     put; there is no output, even for errors.

              -l     The specified Data  Source  object  is  a  System  DSN,  in
                     /etc/odbc.ini.

              -h     The specified Data Source object is a User DSN, in the cur&#8208;
                     rent user&apos;s $HOME/.odbc.ini.  This is the default with -s.

DESCRIPTION
       odbcinst updates the configuration files  that  control  ODBC  access  to
       database   servers   on   the   current   host.   It  also  maintains  in
       /etc/odbcinst.ini a count of the number of  references  to  a  particular
       driver,  which can be used to determine whether it should be removed from
       the file (only when the reference count drops to 0).

   Installing
       Drivers and DSNs are installed using the -i option.

       If the object to be installed is a driver (-d), the specified  driver  is
       added to /etc/odbcinst.ini or its reference count is incremented if it is
       already there.

       If the object is a data source (-s), the data source is added  either  to
       /etc/odbc.ini  (if  -l is used) or to $HOME/.odbc.ini (the default, which
       can also be specified with -h).
&#12;   Uninstalling
       Uninstalling a driver is done with the command odbcinst -u -d -n   driver
       name.   Uninstalling  a  DSN  is done with the command odbcinst -u -s -n
       data source name.  Uninstalling causes the reference count on the  object
       to  be  decremented.   If  nothing  else has requested this driver or DSN
       (i.e., the reference count drops to zero), it is removed from the  config
       file.

       The  options -l and -h are used with -s to specify which odbc.ini file to
       configure.

   Queries
       The command odbcinst -q -d returns a  list  of  all  drivers  present  in
       /etc/odbcinst.ini.  The command odbcinst -q -s returns a list of all sys&#8208;
       tem and user DSNs available.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success

       non-zero
              Failure

TEMPLATE FILES
       A typical driver template looks like this:
               [MySQL]
               Description     = MySQL driver
               Driver          = /usr/lib/odbc/libmyodbc.so
               Setup           = /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcmyS.so

       A DSN template looks like this:
               [Sample DSN]
               Description         = Test MySQL connection
               Driver              = MySQL
               Trace               = Yes
               TraceFile           = /tmp/odbc.log
               Database            = junk
               Server              = localhost
               Port                = 3306
               Socket              =

       The Description and Driver fields should be present in all DSN configura&#8208;
       tions.   Other  options  are  driver-specific; consult your ODBC driver&apos;s
       documentation for a list of allowed options, or see ODBCConfig(1)  for  a
       graphical  tool  that can be used to interactively set up a DSN or driver
       the first time.

FILES
       /etc/odbcinst.ini, /etc/odbc.ini, $HOME/.odbc.ini
