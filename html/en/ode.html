ODE(1)                       GNU Plotting Utilities                       ODE(1)



NAME
       ode - numerical solution of ordinary differential equations

SYNOPSIS
       ode [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       ode  is  a  tool that solves, by numerical integration, the initial value
       problem for a specified system of first-order ordinary differential equa&#8208;
       tions.   Three  distinct  numerical  integration  schemes  are available:
       Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg  (the  default),  Adams-Moulton,  and  Euler.    The
       Adams-Moulton  and  Runge-Kutta  schemes are available with adaptive step
       size.

       The operation of ode is specified by a program, written in its input lan&#8208;
       guage.   The  program is simply a list of expressions for the derivatives
       of the variables to be integrated, together with some control statements.
       Some examples are given in the EXAMPLES section.

       ode  reads the program from the specified file, or from standard input if
       no file name is given.  If reading from standard  input,  ode  will  stop
       reading and exit when it sees a single period on a line by itself.

       At  each  time step, the values of variables specified in the program are
       written to standard output.  So a table of values will be produced,  with
       each  column  showing the evolution of a variable.  If there are only two
       columns, the output can be piped to graph(1) or a similar  plotting  pro&#8208;
       gram.

OPTIONS
   Input Options
       -f file
       --input-file file
              Read  input  from  file  before reading from standard input.  This
              option makes it possible to work interactively,  after  reading  a
              program  fragment  that  defines  the system of differential equa&#8208;
              tions.

   Output Options
       -p prec
       --precision prec
              When printing numerical results, use prec significant digits  (the
              default  is 6).  If this option is given, the print format will be
              scientific notation.

       -t
       --title
              Print a title line at the head of the output, naming the variables
              in each column.  If this option is given, the print format will be
              scientific notation.

   Integration Scheme Options
       The following options specify the numerical integration scheme.  Only one
       of  the  three basic options -R, -A, -E may be specified.  The default is
       -R (Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg).

       -R [stepsize]
       --runge-kutta [stepsize]
              Use a fifth-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm, with an adaptive
              stepsize unless a constant stepsize is specified.  When a constant
              stepsize is specified and no error analysis is requested,  then  a
              classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme is used.

       -A [stepsize]
       --adams-moulton [stepsize]
              Use  a fourth-order Adams-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme, with
              an adaptive stepsize unless  a  constant  stepsize,  stepsize,  is
              specified.  The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm is used to get past
              `bad&apos; points (if any).

       -E [stepsize]
       --euler [stepsize]
              Use a `quick and dirty&apos; Euler scheme, with  a  constant  stepsize.
              The default value of stepsize is 0.1.  Not recommended for serious
              applications.

              The error bound options -r and -e (see below) may not be  used  if
              -E is specified.

       -h hmin [hmax]
       --step-size-bound hmin [hmax]
              Use a lower bound hmin on the stepsize.  The numerical scheme will
              not let the stepsize go below hmin.  The default is to  allow  the
              stepsize to shrink to the machine limit, i.e., the minimum nonzero
              double-precision floating point number.

              The optional argument hmax, if included, specifies a maximum value
              for  the  stepsize.  It is useful in preventing the numerical rou&#8208;
              tine from skipping quickly over an interesting region.

   Error Bound Options
       -r rmax [rmin]
       --relative-error-bound rmax [rmin]
              The -r option sets an upper  bound  on  the  relative  single-step
              error.   If  the -r option is used, the relative single-step error
              in any dependent variable will never exceed rmax (the default  for
              which is 10^-9).  If this should occur, the solution will be aban&#8208;
              doned and an error message will be printed.  If  the  stepsize  is
              not constant, the stepsize will be decreased `adaptively&apos;, so that
              the upper bound on the single-step error is not  violated.   Thus,
              choosing a smaller upper bound on the single-step error will cause
              smaller stepsizes to be chosen.  A lower bound rmin may optionally
              be  specified,  to  suggest  when the stepsize should be increased
              (the default for rmin is rmax/1000).

       -e emax [emin]
       --absolute-error-bound emax [emin]
              Similar to -r, but bounds the absolute rather  than  the  relative
              single-step error.

       -s
       --suppress-error-bound
              Suppress  the  ceiling  on single-step error, allowing ode to con&#8208;
              tinue even if this ceiling is exceeded.  This may result in  large
              numerical errors.

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --version
              Print  the  version number of ode and the plotting utilities pack&#8208;
              age, and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Mostly self-explanatory.  The biggest exception is `syntax error&apos;,  mean&#8208;
       ing  there  is  a  grammatical error.  Language error messages are of the
       form
&#12;              ode: nnn: message...

       where `nnn&apos; is the number of the input line containing the error.  If the
       -f  option  is  used,  the  phrase  &quot;(file)&quot; follows the `nnn&apos; for errors
       encountered inside the file.  Subsequently, when ode begins  reading  the
       standard input, line numbers start over from 1.

       No  effort  is  made to recover successfully from syntactic errors in the
       input.  However, there is a meager effort to resynchronize so  more  than
       one error can be found in one scan.

       Run-time errors elicit a message describing the problem, and the solution
       is abandoned.

EXAMPLES
       The program

              y&apos; = y
              y = 1
              print t, y
              step 0, 1

       solves an initial value problem whose solution is y=e^t.  When  ode  runs
       this  program,  it  will write two columns of numbers to standard output.
       Each line will show the value of the  independent  variable  t,  and  the
       variable y, as t is stepped from 0 to 1.

       A more sophisticated example would be

              sine&apos; = cosine
              cosine&apos; = -sine
              sine = 0
              cosine = 1
              print t, sine
              step 0, 2*PI

       This  program solves an initial value problem for a system of two differ&#8208;
       ential equations.  The initial value problem turns out to define the sine
       and cosine functions.  The program steps the system over a full period.

AUTHORS
       ode  was  written  by  Nicholas B. Tufillaro (nbt@reed.edu), and slightly
       enhanced by Robert S. Maier (rsm@math.arizona.edu) to merge it  into  the
       GNU plotting utilities.
