OFFSETOF(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                OFFSETOF(3)



NAME
       offsetof - offset of a structure member

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

       size_t offsetof(type, member);

DESCRIPTION
       The  macro  offsetof()  returns  the  offset of the field member from the
       start of the structure type.

       This macro is useful because the sizes  of  the  fields  that  compose  a
       structure  can vary across implementations, and compilers may insert dif&#8208;
       ferent numbers of padding bytes between fields.   Consequently,  an  ele&#8208;
       ment&apos;s  offset  is  not  necessarily given by the sum of the sizes of the
       previous elements.

       A compiler error will result if member is not aligned to a byte  boundary
       (i.e., it is a bit field).

RETURN VALUE
       offsetof()  returns the offset of the given member within the given type,
       in units of bytes.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.

EXAMPLE
       On a Linux/i386 system, when compiled using the default  gcc(1)  options,
       the program below produces the following output:

           $ ./a.out
           offsets: i=0; c=4; d=8 a=16
           sizeof(struct s)=16

   Program source

       #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int
       main(void)
       {
           struct s {
               int i;
               char c;
               double d;
               char a[];
           };

           /* Output is compiler dependent */

           printf(&quot;offsets: i=%ld; c=%ld; d=%ld a=%ld\n&quot;,
                   (long) offsetof(struct s, i),
                   (long) offsetof(struct s, c),
                   (long) offsetof(struct s, d),
                   (long) offsetof(struct s, a));
           printf(&quot;sizeof(struct s)=%ld\n&quot;, (long) sizeof(struct s));

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
