ogg123(1)                         Vorbis Tools                         ogg123(1)



NAME
       ogg123 - plays Ogg Vorbis files


SYNOPSIS
       ogg123  [  -vqrzZVh  ]  [ -k seconds ] [ -x nth ] [ -y ntimes ] [ -b buf&#8208;
       fer_size ] [ -d driver [ -o option:value ] [ -f filename ] ] file ...   |
       directory ...  | URL ...


DESCRIPTION
       ogg123 reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and decodes them to the devices spec&#8208;
       ified on the command line.  By default, ogg123  writes  to  the  standard
       sound device, but output can be sent to any number of devices.  Files can
       be read from the file system, or URLs can be streamed  via  HTTP.   If  a
       directory  is given, all of the files in it or its subdirectories will be
       played.


OPTIONS
       --audio-buffer n
              Use an output audio buffer of approximately &apos;n&apos; kilobytes.

       -@ playlist, --list playlist
              Play all of the files named in the file &apos;playlist&apos;.  The  playlist
              should  have one filename, directory name, or URL per line.  Blank
              lines are permitted.  Directories will be treated in the same  way
              as on the command line.

       -b n, --buffer n
              Use  an  input  buffer  of approximately &apos;n&apos; kilobytes.  HTTP-only
              option.

       -p n, --prebuffer n
              Prebuffer &apos;n&apos; percent of the input buffer.  Playback  won&apos;t  begin
              until this prebuffer is complete.  HTTP-only option.

       -d device, --device device
              Specify output device.  See DEVICES section for a list of devices.
              Any number of devices may be specified.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Specify output file for file devices.  The filename &quot;-&quot; writes  to
              standard  out.   If the file already exists, ogg123 will overwrite
              it.

       -h, --help
              Show command help.

       -k n, --skip n
              Skip the first &apos;n&apos; seconds.  &apos;n&apos; may also be in minutes:seconds or
              hours:minutes:seconds form.

       -K n, --end n
              Stops  playing  &apos;n&apos; seconds from the start of the stream.  &apos;n&apos; may
              also have the same format as used in the --skip option.

       -o option[:value], --device-option option[:value]
              Sets the option option to value for  the  preceding  device.   See
              DEVICES for a list of valid options for each device.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.
&#12;       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity.

       -x n, --nth
              Play  every  &apos;n&apos;th decoded block.  Has the effect of playing audio
              at &apos;n&apos; times faster than normal speed.

       -y n, --ntimes
              Repeat every played block &apos;n&apos; times.  Has the  effect  of  playing
              audio  &apos;n&apos;  times  slower  than  normal speed.  May be with -x for
              interesting fractional speeds.

       -r, --repeat
              Repeat playlist indefinitely.

       -z, --shuffle
              Play files in pseudo-random order.

       -Z, --random
              Play files in pseudo-random order forever.


DEVICES
       ogg123 supports a variety of audio output devices  through  libao.   Only
       those devices supported by the target platform will be available.  The -f
       option may only be used with devices that write to files.

       Options supported by all devices:

              debug  Turn on debugging output [if any] for a chosen driver.

              matrix:value
                     Force a  specific  output  channel  ordering  for  a  given
                     device.   value is a comma seperated list of AO style chan&#8208;
                     nel names, eg, L,R,C,LFE,BL,BR,SL,SR.

              verbose
                     Turn on verbose output for a chosen driver. the  -v  option
                     will also set the driver verbose option.

              quiet  Force  chosen  driver to be completely silent.  Even errors
                     will not produce any output. -q will also  set  the  driver
                     quiet option.


       aixs   AIX live output driver. Options:

              dev:value
                     Set AIX output device to value


       alsa   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture live output driver. Options:

              buffer_time:value
                     Override  the  default  hardware  buffer size (in millisec&#8208;
                     onds).

              dev:value
                     ALSA device label to use. Examples include &quot;hw:0&quot;  for  the
                     first soundcard and &quot;hw:1&quot; for the second.  The alsa driver
                     normally chooses one of &quot;surround71&quot;,  &quot;surround51&quot;,  &quot;sur&#8208;
                     round40&quot;  or &quot;default&quot; automatically depending on number of
                     output    channels.     For    more    information,     see
                     http://alsa.opensrc.org/ALSA+device+labels
&#12;              period_time:value
                     Override  the  default  hardware  period size (in microsec&#8208;
                     onds).

              period_time:value
                     Override the default hardware  period  size  (in  microsec&#8208;
                     onds).

              use_mmap:value
                     value  is  set to &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to override the compiled-in
                     default to use or not use mmap device access.  In the past,
                     some  buggy alsa drivers have behaved better when not using
                     mmap access at the penalty of slightly higher CPU usage.


       arts   aRts Sound Daemon live output driver. Options:

              multi:value
                     value is set to &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to  allow  opening  the  aRts
                     playback device for multiply concurrent playback.  Although
                     the driver works properly in multi mode,  it  is  known  to
                     occasionally  crash the aRts server itself.  Default behav&#8208;
                     ior is &quot;no&quot;.


       au     Sun audio file output.  Writes the audio  samples  in  AU  format.
              The  AU  format supports writing to unseekable files like standard
              out.  In such circumstances, the AU header will specify the sample
              format, but not the length of the recording.


       esd    Enlightened Sound Daemon live output. Options:

              host:value
                     value  specifies  the  hostname where esd is running.  This
                     can  include  a  port  number  after   a   colon,   as   in
                     &quot;whizbang.com:555&quot;.  (Default = localhost)


       irix   IRIX live output audio driver.


       macosx MacOS  X &apos;AUHAL&apos; live output driver.  This driver supports MacOS X
              10.5 and later (10.4 and earlier  uses  an  earlier,  incompatable
              interface). Options:

              buffer_time:value
                     Set  the  hardware  buffer  size to the equivalent of value
                     milliseconds.


       nas    Network Audio Server live output driver. Options:

              buf_size:value
                     Set size of audio buffer on server in bytes.

              host:value
                     Set location of NAS server; See nas(1) for format.


       null   Null driver.  All audio data is discarded.  (Note: Audio  data  is
              not written to /dev/null !)  You could use this driver to test raw
              decoding speed without output overhead.


       oss    Open Sound System driver for Linux and FreeBSD, versions 2, 3  and
              4. Options:
&#12;              dsp:value
                     DSP device for soundcard.  Defaults to /dev/dsp.


       pulse  Pulseaudio live audio sound driver. Options:

              server:value
                     Specifies   location  of  remote  or  alternate  Pulseaudio
                     server.

              sink:value
                     Specifies a non-default Pulseaudio sink for audio stream.


       raw    Raw file output.  Writes raw audio samples to a file. Options:

              byteorder:value
                     Chooses big endian (&quot;big&quot;), little  endian  (&quot;little&quot;),  or
                     native (&quot;native&quot;) byte order.  Default is native order.


       roar   Roar Audio Daemon live output driver. Options:

              host:value
                     Specifies location of remote Roar server to use.


       sndio  OpenBSD SNDIO live output driver. Options:

              dev:value

              dev:value
                     Audio device for soundcard.  Defaults to /dev/audio.



       wav    WAV file output.  Writes the sound data to  disk  in  uncompressed
              form.   If multiple files are played, all of them will be concate&#8208;
              nated into the same WAV file.  WAV  files  cannot  be  written  to
              unseekable  files,  such  as  standard  out.   Use  the  AU format
              instead.

              id:value
                     Selects audio device to use for playback by device id (card
                     number).


EXAMPLES
       The ogg123 command line is fairly flexible, perhaps confusingly so.  Here
       are some sample command lines and an explanation of what they do.

       Play on the default soundcard:
              ogg123 test.ogg

       Play all of the files in the directory ~/music and its subdirectories.
              ogg123 ~/music

       Play a file using the OSS driver:
              ogg123 -d oss test.ogg

       Pass the &quot;dsp&quot; option to the OSS driver:
              ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp

       Use the ESD driver
              ogg123 -d esd test.ogg

       Use the WAV driver with the output file, &quot;test.wav&quot;:
              ogg123 -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg

       Listen to a file while you write it to a WAV file:
              ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg

       Note that options apply to the device declared to the left:
              ogg123  -d  oss  -o  dsp:/dev/mydsp  -d  raw -f test2.raw -o byte&#8208;
              order:big test.ogg

       Stress test your harddrive:
              ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f 1.wav -d wav -f 2.wav -d wav -f  3.wav  -d
              wav -f 4.wav -d wav -f 5.wav test.ogg

       Create an echo effect with esd and a slow computer:
              ogg123 -d esd -d esd test.ogg

INTERRUPT
       You  can abort ogg123 at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.  If you are playing
       multiple files, this will stop the current file  and  begin  playing  the
       next  one.   If you want to abort playing immediately instead of skipping
       to the next file, press Ctrl-C within the first second of the playback of
       a new file.

       Note that the result of pressing Ctrl-C might not be audible immediately,
       due to audio data buffering in the audio device.  This  delay  is  system
       dependent, but it is usually not more than one or two seconds.


FILES
       /etc/libao.conf
              Can  be  used  to set the default output device for all libao pro&#8208;
              grams.


       ~/.libao
              Per-user config file to override the  system  wide  output  device
              settings.

BUGS
       Piped  WAV  files  may cause strange behavior in other programs.  This is
       because WAV files store the data length in the header.  However, the out&#8208;
       put  driver does not know the length when it writes the header, and there
       is no value that means &quot;length unknown&quot;.  Use the raw or au output driver
       if you need to use ogg123 in a pipe.
