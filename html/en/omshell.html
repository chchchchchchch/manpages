NAME
       omshell - OMAPI Command Shell

SYNOPSIS
       omshell

DESCRIPTION
       The  OMAPI Command Shell, omshell, provides an interactive way to connect
       to, query, and possibly change, the ISC DHCP Server&apos;s  state  via  OMAPI,
       the  Object  Management API.  By using OMAPI and omshell, you do not have
       to stop, make changes, and then restart the DHCP server, but can make the
       changes  while the server is running.   Omshell provides a way of access&#8208;
       ing OMAPI.

       OMAPI is simply a communications mechanism that allows you to  manipulate
       objects.    In  order  to  actually use omshell, you must understand what
       objects are available and how  to  use  them.   Documentation  for  OMAPI
       objects  can  be  found in the documentation for the server that provides
       them - for example, in the dhcpd(1) manual page and the dhclient(1)  man&#8208;
       ual page.

CONTRIBUTIONS
       This  software  is  free  software.  At various times its development has
       been underwritten by various organizations, including the ISC  and  Vixie
       Enterprises.   The  development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
       Nominum, Inc.

       At this point development is being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and hosted by
       the ISC, but the future of this project depends on you.  If you have fea&#8208;
       tures you want, please consider implementing them.

LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS
       Throughout this document,  there  are  references  to  local  and  remote
       objects.  Local objects are ones created in omshell with the new command.
       Remote objects are ones on the server: leases, hosts, and groups that the
       DHCP  server  knows  about.   Local  and  remote  objects  are associated
       together to enable viewing and modification of object attributes.   Also,
       new remote objects can be created to match local objects.

OPENING A CONNECTION
       omshell is started from the command line.  Once omshell is started, there
       are several commands that can be issued:

       server address
            where address is the IP address of the DHCP server  to  connect  to.
            If  this  is  not specified, the default server is 127.0.0.1 (local&#8208;
            host).

       port number
            where number is the port that OMAPI listens on.  By default, this is
            7911.

       key name secret
            This  specifies the TSIG key to use to authenticate the OMAPI trans&#8208;
            actions.  name is the name of a key defined in dhcpd.conf  with  the
            omapi-key  statement.   The  secret is the secret key generated from
            dnssec-keygen or another key generation program.

       connect
            This starts the OMAPI connection to the server as specified  by  the
            server statement.
&#12;CREATING LOCAL OBJECTS
       Any  object  defined  in  OMAPI can be created, queried, and/or modified.
       The  object  types  available  to  OMAPI  are  defined  in  dhcpd(8)  and
       dhclient(8).   When  using  omshell,  objects  are first defined locally,
       manipulated as desired, and then associated with an object on the server.
       Only  one object can be manipulated at a time.  To create a local object,
       use

       new object-type
            object-type is one of group, host, or lease.

       At this point, you now have an object that you  can  set  properties  on.
       For  example,  if a new lease object was created with new lease, any of a
       lease&apos;s attributes can be set as follows:

       set attribute-name = value
            Attribute names are defined in  dhcpd(8)  and  dhclient(8).   Values
            should  be  quoted  if  they  are  strings.  So, to set a lease&apos;s IP
            address, you would do the following:
             set ip-address = 192.168.4.50

ASSOCIATING LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS
       At this point, you can query the server for information about this lease,
       by

       open

       Now,  the  local  lease  object you created and set the IP address for is
       associated with the corresponding lease object on the DHCP  server.   All
       of  the lease attributes from the DHCP server are now also the attributes
       on the local object, and will be shown in omshell.

VIEWING A REMOTE OBJECT
       To query a lease of address 192.168.4.50, and find  out  its  attributes,
       after connecting to the server, take the following steps:

       new lease

       This creates a new local lease object.

       set ip-address = 192.168.4.50

       This sets the local object&apos;s IP address to be 192.168.4.50

       open

       Now,  if a lease with that IP address exists, you will see all the infor&#8208;
       mation the DHCP server has about that particular lease.   Any  data  that
       isn&apos;t  readily printable text will show up in colon-separated hexadecimal
       values.  In this example, output back from  the  server  for  the  entire
       transaction might look like this:

       &gt; new &quot;lease&quot;
       obj: lease
       &gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.50
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       &gt; open
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = &quot;wendelina&quot;
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00

       As you can see here, the IP address is represented in hexadecimal, as are
       the starting and ending times of the lease.

MODIFYING A REMOTE OBJECT
       Attributes of remote objects are updated by  using  the  set  command  as
       before,  and  then  issuing  an update command.  The set command sets the
       attributes on the current local object, and  the  update  command  pushes
       those changes out to the server.

       Continuing  with  the previous example, if a set client-hostname = &quot;some&#8208;
       thing-else&quot; was issued, followed by an update command, the  output  would
       look about like this:

       &gt; set client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00
       &gt; update
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00

NEW REMOTE OBJECTS
       New  remote objects are created much in the same way that existing server
       objects  are  modified.   Create  a  local  object  using  new,  set  the
       attributes  as  you&apos;d  wish them to be, and then create the remote object
       with the same properties by using

       create

       Now a new object exists on the DHCP server which matches  the  properties
       that  you  gave  your  local object.  Objects created via OMAPI are saved
       into the dhcpd.leases file.

       For example, if a new host with the IP address of 192.168.4.40  needs  to
       be created it would be done as follows:
&#12;       &gt; new host
       obj: host
       &gt; set name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       &gt; set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       &gt; set hardware-type = 1
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 1
       &gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.40
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 1
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       &gt; create
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       &gt;

       Your dhcpd.leases file would then have an entry like this in it:

       host some-host {
         dynamic;
         hardware ethernet 00:80:c7:84:b1:94;
         fixed-address 192.168.4.40;
       }

       The  dynamic;  line  is  to denote that this host entry did not come from
       dhcpd.conf, but was created dynamically via OMAPI.

RESETTING ATTRIBUTES
       If you want to remove an attribute from an object, you can do  this  with
       the  unset  command.   Once you have unset an attribute, you must use the
       update command to update the remote object.  So, if the host  &quot;some-host&quot;
       from  the previous example will not have a static IP address anymore, the
       commands in omshell would look like this:

       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       &gt; unset ip-address
       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = &lt;null&gt;
       &gt;

REFRESHING OBJECTS
       A local object may be refreshed with the current remote object properties
       using the refresh command.  This is useful for object that change period&#8208;
       ically, like leases, to see if they have been updated.  This  isn&apos;t  par&#8208;
       ticularly useful for hosts.

DELETING OBJECTS
       Any  remote  object  that  can be created can also be destroyed.  This is
       done by creating a new local object, setting attributes, associating  the
       local  and  remote  object using open, and then using the remove command.
       If the host &quot;some-host&quot; from before was created in error, this  could  be
       corrected as follows:

       obj: host
       name = &quot;some-host&quot;
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       &gt; remove
       obj: &lt;null&gt;
       &gt;

HELP
       The help command will print out all of the commands available in omshell,
       with some syntax pointers.
