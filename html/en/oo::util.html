DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a convenience command for the easy specification of
       instance methods as callback commands, like timers, file events, Tk bind&#8208;
       ings, etc.

COMMANDS
       mymethod method ?arg...?
              This  command  is  available  within  instance methods. It takes a
              method name and, possibly, arguments for the method and returns  a
              command  prefix which, when executed, will invoke the named method
              of the object we are in, with the provided arguments, and any oth&#8208;
              ers supplied at the time of actual invokation.

              Note:  The  command  is  equivalent to and named after the command
              provided by the OO package snit for the same purpose.
