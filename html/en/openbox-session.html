OPENBOX(1)                                                            OPENBOX(1)



NAME
       openbox-session &#8212; Runs an Openbox session without any session manager.


DESCRIPTION
       openbox-session  runs  an  openbox  session  without any session manager.
       Without a session manager, you will not be able to save your  state  from
       one log in to the next.

       openbox-session does not take any command line arguments.

       On  log  in,  openbox-session will run the ~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh
       script if it exists, and will run the system-wide  script  /etc/xdg/open&#8208;
       box/autostart.sh  otherwise. You may place anything you want to run auto&#8208;
       matically in those files, for example:


              xsetroot -solid grey &amp;
              gnome-settings-daemon &amp;

       Make sure that each line is followed by a &quot;&amp;&quot; or  else  the  script  will
       stop  there  and  further  commands will not be executed. You can use the
       /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart.sh file as an example for creating your own.
