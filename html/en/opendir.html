OPENDIR(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 OPENDIR(3)



NAME
       opendir, fdopendir - open a directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

       DIR *opendir(const char *name);
       DIR *fdopendir(int fd);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fdopendir():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  opendir()  function  opens  a  directory stream corresponding to the
       directory name, and returns a  pointer  to  the  directory  stream.   The
       stream is positioned at the first entry in the directory.

       The  fdopendir()  function  is  like  opendir(),  but returns a directory
       stream for the directory referred to by  the  open  file  descriptor  fd.
       After  a  successful  call  to  fdopendir(), fd is used internally by the
       implementation, and should not otherwise be used by the application.

RETURN VALUE
       The opendir() and fdopendir() functions return a pointer to the directory
       stream.  On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES Permission denied.

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor opened for reading.

       EMFILE Too many file descriptors in use by process.

       ENFILE Too many files are currently open in the system.

       ENOENT Directory does not exist, or name is an empty string.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to complete the operation.

       ENOTDIR
              name is not a directory.

VERSIONS
       fdopendir() is available in glibc since version 2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       opendir()  is  present  on  SVr4,  4.3BSD, and specified in POSIX.1-2001.
       fdopendir() is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The underlying file descriptor of the directory stream  can  be  obtained
       using dirfd(3).

       The  opendir() function sets the close-on-exec flag for the file descrip&#8208;
       tor underlying the DIR *.  The fdopendir() function leaves the setting of
       the   close-on-exec   flag   unchanged   for  the  file  descriptor,  fd.
       POSIX.1-200x  leaves  it  unspecified  whether  a  successful   call   to
       fdopendir() will set the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor, fd.
