OPENJADE(1)                                                          OPENJADE(1)



NAME
       openjade - apply a DSSSL stylesheet to an SGML or XML document

SYNOPSIS
       openjade [-vCegG2s] [-b encoding] [-f error_file] [-c catalog_sysid]
                [-D dir] [-a link_type] [-A arch] [-E max_errors] [-i entity]
                [-w warning_type] [-d dsssl_spec] [-V variable[=value]]
                [-t output_type] [-o output_file] [sysid...]


DESCRIPTION
        openjade is an implementation of the ISO/IEC 10179:1996  standard  DSSSL
       language.  The DSSSL engine receives as input an SGML or XML document and
       transforms it into formats like:


       * XML representation of the flow object tree.


       * RTF format that can be rendered and printed with Microsoft&apos;s free  Word
       Viewer 97


       * TeX format


       * MIF format that can be rendered and printed with Framemaker


       *  SGML or XML format. This is used in conjunction with non-standard flow
       object classes to generate SGML, thus allowing openjade to  be  used  for
       SGML/XML transformations.


       The  system identifier of the document to be processed is specified as an
       argument to openjade. If this is omitted, standard input will be read.


       openjade determines the system identifier for the DSSSL specification  as
       follows:


       1.  If the -d option is specified, it will use the argument as the system
       identifier.


       2. Otherwise, it will look for processing instructions in the  prolog  of
       the document. Two kinds of processing instruction are recognized:


       &lt;?stylesheet href=&quot;sysid&quot; type=&quot;text/dsssl&quot;&gt;


       The  system  data  of  the  processing instruction is parsed like an SGML
       start-tag. It will be parsed using the reference concrete syntax whatever
       the actual concrete syntax of the document. The name that starts the pro&#8208;
       cessing  instruction  can  be  either   stylesheet,   xml-stylesheet   or
       xml:stylesheet.  The  processing  instruction  will be ignored unless the
       value of the type attribute is one of text/dsssl, text/x-dsssl,  applica&#8208;
       tion/dsssl,  or  application/x-dsssl.  The value of href attribute is the
       system identifier of the DSSSL specification.
&#12;
       &lt;?dsssl sysid&gt;


       The system identifier is the portion of the system data of the processing
       instruction following the initial name and any whitespace.


       Although  the processing instruction is only recognized in the prolog, it
       need not occur in the document entity. For example, it could occur  in  a
       DTD.  The system identifier will be interpreted relative to where the the
       processing instruction occurs.


       3. Otherwise, it will use the system identifier of the document with  any
       extension changed to .dsl.


       A DSSSL specification document can contain more than one style-specifica&#8208;
       tion. If the system identifier of the DSSSL specification is followed  by
       #id,  then openjade will use the style-specification whose unique identi&#8208;
       fier is id. This is allowed both with the -d option and with the process&#8208;
       ing instructions.


       The  DSSSL specification must be an SGML document conforming to the DSSSL
       architecture. For an example, see dsssl/demo.dsl.


       openjade supports the following options in addition to the normal  OpenSP
       (see onsgmls(1)) options (note that all options are case-sensitive, ie -g
       and -G are different options):


       -d dsssl_spec
              This specifies that dsssl_spec is the  system  identifier  of  the
              DSSSL specification to be used.


       -G     Debug  mode.  When an error occurs in the evaluation of an expres&#8208;
              sion, openjade will display a stack trace. Note that this disables
              tail-call optimization.


       -c filename
              The filename arguments specify catalog files rather than the docu&#8208;
              ment entity. The document entity is specified by the  first  DOCU&#8208;
              MENT entry in the catalog files.


       -s     Strict  compliance  mode.  Currently  the only effect is that jade
              doesn&apos;t use any predefined character names, sdata-entity  mappings
              or   name-characters.  This  is  useful  for  checking  that  your
              stylesheet is portable to other DSSSL implementations and that  it
              is strictly compliant to the DSSSL specifications.


       -t output_type
              output_type specifies the type of output as follows:

              fot  An XML representation of the flow object tree

              rtf  rtf-95  RTF (used for SGML/XML to RTF transformations) Micro&#8208;
              soft&apos;s Rich Text Format. rtf-95 produces output optimized for Word
              95 rather than Word 97.
&#12;              tex TeX (used for SGML/XML to TeX transformations)

              sgml  sgml-raw  SGML  (used for SGML/XML to SGML transformations).
              sgml-raw doesn&apos;t emit linebreaks in tags.

              xml xml-raw  XML  (used  for  SGML/XML  to  XML  transformations).
              xml-raw doesn&apos;t emit linebreaks in tags.

              html  HTML (used for SGML/XML to HTML transformations)

              mif MIF (used for SGML/XML to MIF transformations)


       -o output_file
              Write  output  to  output_file instead of the default. The default
              filename is the name of the last input file with its extension re&#8208;
              placed  by  the  name  of the type of output. If there is no input
              filename, then the extension is added onto jade-out.


       -V variable
              This is equivalent to doing (define variable #t) except that  this
              definition will take priority over any definition of variable in a
              style-sheet.


       -V variable=value
              This is equivalent to doing (define variable &quot;value&quot;) except  that
              this definition will take priority over any definition of variable
              in a style-sheet.


       -V (define variable value)
              This is equivalent to doing (define variable  value)  except  that
              this definition will take priority over any definition of variable
              in a style-sheet. Note that you will probably have to use some es&#8208;
              caping  mechanism  for the spaces to get the entire scheme expres&#8208;
              sion parsed as one cmdline argument.


       -wtype Control warnings and errors. Multiple -w options are allowed.  The
              following values of type enable warnings:

              xml Warn about constructs that are not allowed by XML.

              mixed  Warn  about  mixed content models that do not allow #pcdata
              anywhere.

              sgmldecl Warn about various dubious constructions in the SGML dec&#8208;
              laration.

              should  Warn  about  various recommendations made in ISO 8879 that
              the document does not comply with. (Recommendations are  expressed
              with  ``should&apos;&apos;,  as distinct from requirements which are usually
              expressed with ``shall&apos;&apos;.)

              default Warn about defaulted references.

              duplicate Warn about duplicate entity declarations.

              undefined Warn about undefined elements: elements used in the  DTD
              but not defined.

              unclosed Warn about unclosed start and end-tags.

              empty Warn about empty start and end-tags.

              net Warn about net-enabling start-tags and null end-tags.

              min-tag  Warn  about  minimized  start and end-tags. Equivalent to
              combination of unclosed, empty and net warnings.

              unused-map Warn about unused short reference maps: maps  that  are
              declared with a short reference mapping declaration but never used
              in a short reference use declaration in the DTD.

              unused-param Warn about parameter entities that  are  defined  but
              not  used  in a DTD. Unused internal parameter entities whose text
              is INCLUDE or IGNORE won&apos;t get the warning.

              notation-sysid Warn about notations for which no system identifier
              could be generated.

              all  Warn  about conditions that should usually be avoided (in the
              opinion of the author). Equivalent to: mixed, should, default, un&#8208;
              defined, sgmldecl, unused-map, unused-param, empty and unclosed.

              A  warning  can  be  disabled by using its name prefixed with no-.
              Thus -wall -wno-duplicate will enable all  warnings  except  those
              about duplicate entity declarations.

              The following values for warning_type disable errors:

              no-idref  Do  not give an error for an ID reference value which no
              element has as its ID. The effect will be as if each attribute de&#8208;
              clared as an ID reference value had been declared as a name.

              no-significant Do not give an error when a character that is not a
              significant character in the reference concrete syntax occurs in a
              literal in the SGML declaration. This may be useful in conjunction
              with certain buggy test suites.

              no-valid Do not require the document to be  type-valid.  This  has
              the  effect  of  changing the SGML declaration to specify VALIDITY
              NOASSERT and IMPLYDEF  ATTLIST  YES  ELEMENT  YES.  An  option  of
              -wvalid has the effect of changing the SGML declaration to specify
              VALIDITY TYPE and IMPLYDEF  ATTLIST  NO  ELEMENT  NO.  If  neither
              -wvalid nor -wno-valid are specified, then the VALIDITY and IMPLY&#8208;
              DEF specified in the SGML declaration will be used.


ENVIRONMENT
       OpenJade ignores the SP_CHARSET_FIXED and  SP_SYSTEM_CHARSET  environment
       variables  and  always  uses Unicode as its internal character set, as if
       SP_CHARSET_FIXED was 1 and SP_SYSTEM_CHARSET was  unset.  Thus  only  the
       SP_ENCODING  environment  variable  is relevant to OpenJade&apos;s handling of
       character sets.


OPENJADE EXTENSIONS
       The following external procedures are available.  These  external  proce&#8208;
       dures  are  defined by a prototype in the same manner as in the standard.
       To use one of these external procedures, you must make use of  the  stan&#8208;
       dard external-procedure procedure, using a public identifier of &quot;UNREGIS&#8208;
       TERED::James Clark//Procedure::name&quot; where name is the name  given  here,
       typically by including the following in the DSSSL specification:


       (define   name   (external-procedure  &quot;UNREGISTERED::James  Clark//Proce&#8208;
       dure::name&quot;))
&#12;       Note that external-procedure returns #f if  it  doesn&apos;t  know  about  the
       specified public identifier. You can use this to enable your DSSSL speci&#8208;
       fications to work gracefully with other implementations which do not sup&#8208;
       port these extensions.


       For  external procedures added by the OpenJade team, use a public identi&#8208;
       fier of the form &quot;UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::name&quot;.


       An easy way to get access to all external procedures is to use the  style
       specification   dsssl/extensions.dsl#procedures.  The  file  dsssl/exten&#8208;
       sions.dsl also contains style specifications which make  the  nonstandard
       flow  object classes and inherited characteristics supported by the back&#8208;
       ends available in a convenient way.


       Debugging


       (debug obj)


       Generates a message including the value of obj and then returns obj.


       Simple-page-sequence header/footer control


       (if-first-page sosofo1 sosofo2)


       This can be used only in the specification of the value  of  one  of  the
       header/footer characteristics of simple-page-sequence. It returns a soso&#8208;
       fo that will display as sosofo1 if the page is the first page of the sim&#8208;
       ple-page-sequence and as sosofo2 otherwise.


       (if-front-page sosofo1 sosofo2)


       This  can  be  used  only in the specification of the value of one of the
       header/footer characteristics of simple-page-sequence. It returns a soso&#8208;
       fo  that  will  display  as  sosofo1  if  the  page is a front (ie recto,
       odd-numbered) page and as sosofo2 if it is a back  (ie  verso,  even-num&#8208;
       bered) page.


       Numbering


       (all-element-number)


       (all-element-number osnl)


       This  is  the  same  as element-number except it counts elements with any
       generic identifier. If osnl is not an element returns #f,  otherwise  re&#8208;
       turns  1  plus the number of elements that started before osnl. This pro&#8208;
       vides an efficient way of creating a unique identifier for any element in
       a document.


       External entity access
&#12;
       (read-entity string)


       This returns a string containing the contents of the external entity with
       system identifier string. This should be used only for  textual  entities
       (CDATA and SDATA), and not for binary entities (NDATA).


       POSIX locale access


       (language lang country)


       This procedure returns an object of type language, if the system supports
       the specified language. lang is a string or symbol giving the two  letter
       language  code. country is a string or symbol giving the two letter coun&#8208;
       try code.


       This procedure uses POSIX locales. It is an OpenJade addition. It is  not
       supported on all operating systems.


       Extended standard procedures


       (sgml-parse sysid #!key active: parent: architecture:)


       This allows you to specify an SGML architecture with respect to which the
       document should be parsed. It is an OpenJade addition.


       (expt q k)


       This allows you to raise a quantity to an integral power. It is an  Open&#8208;
       Jade addition.


LIMITATIONS
       This section describes the limitations of the front-end (the general-pur&#8208;
       pose DSSSL engine); each backend also has its own limitations.


       openjade doesn&apos;t allow internal definitions at the  beginning  of  bodies
       and the (test =&gt; recipient) variant of cond clauses.


       openjade  supports  only  a  single, fixed grove plan which comprises the
       following modules:


       * baseabs


       * prlgabs0


       * prlgabs1


       * instabs
&#12;
       * basesds0


       * instsds0


       * subdcabs


       It doesn&apos;t implement the following parts of SDQL: HyTime support,  auxil&#8208;
       iary parsing, node regular expressions.


       Query  rules, sosofo synchronization, indirect sosofos, reference values,
       decoration areas and font properties are not supported.


       Note that only inherited characteristics that are applicable to some sup&#8208;
       ported flow object can be specified.


       Character/glyph handling


       It  only  supports a single pre-defined character repertoire. A character
       name of the form U-XXXX where XXXX are four upper-case  hexadecimal  dig&#8208;
       its,  is recognized as referring to the Unicode character with that code.
       For many characters, it is also possible to use the ISO/IEC 10646 name in
       lower-case with words separated by hyphens.


       Some  common  SDATA  entity names from the ISO entity sets are recognized
       and mapped to characters. In addition an SDATA entity name  of  the  form
       U-XXXX,  where  XXXX are four upper-case hexadecimal digits, is mapped to
       the Unicode character with that code.


       OpenJade   now    supports    the    standard-chars,    map-sdata-entity,
       add-name-chars,  add-separator-chars and char-repertoire declaration ele&#8208;
       ment forms, allowing a style-sheet to define additional character  names,
       sdata  entity mappings, name characters (i.e. characters allowed in iden&#8208;
       tifiers) and separator characters. Currently the only recognized  charac&#8208;
       ter  repertoire  is the built-in repertoire. It has the public identifier
       &quot;UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Character Repertoire::OpenJade&quot;.


       Validation


       Several things that it would be desirable to have checked aren&apos;t checked:


       * When the allowed value of an  inherited  characteristic  is  a  symbol,
       OpenJade  checks  only  that the value is a symbol that is allowed as the
       value of some characteristic; #t and #f are treated as a special kind  of
       symbol in this case.


       *  OpenJade doesn&apos;t check whether a flow object is occurring in a context
       where it is allowed.


       * OpenJade does not prevent flow objects being attached to the  principal
       port  of  a  flow  object when the flow object shouldn&apos;t have a principal
       port.


       * Most type-checking is done at run-time not compile-time.


       * OpenJade does not check for non-inherited characteristics that are  re&#8208;
       quired to be specified.


       *  It  doesn&apos;t  check that optional features that have been used were de&#8208;
       clared in the features form.


       Other limitations


       The following primitives are just stubs:


       char-script-case Always returns last argument.


       address-visited? Always returns #f.


EXAMPLES
       Given an SGML file file.sgml, use the stylesheet file.dsl and publish  as
       an rtf file.


       openjade -t rtf file.sgml


       Using a different stylesheet:


       openjade -t rtf -d docbook.dsl file.sgml


       Using the print style specification contained within the stylesheet


       openjade -t rtf -d docbook.dsl#print file.sgml


       And use the html specification within the style sheet to convert to html


       openjade -t sgml -i html -d docbook.dsl#html file.sgml
