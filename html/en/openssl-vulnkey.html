OPENSSL-VULNKEY(1)        BSD General Commands Manual       OPENSSL-VULNKEY(1)

NAME
     openssl-vulnkey &#8212; check blacklist of compromised certificates, requests and
     keys

SYNOPSIS
     openssl-vulnkey [-q] file ...
     openssl-vulnkey [-q] -b BITS -m MODULUS

DESCRIPTION
     openssl-vulnkey checks a certificate, request or key against a blacklist of
     compromised moduli.

     A substantial number of certificates, requests and keys are known to have
     been generated using a broken version of OpenSSL distributed by Debian
     which failed to seed its random number generator correctly.  x509 certifi&#8208;
     cates, certificate requests and RSA keys generated using these OpenSSL ver&#8208;
     sions should be assumed to be compromised.  This tool may be useful in
     checking for such OpenSSL x509 certificates, certificate requests and RSA
     keys.

     Certificates, requests and keys that are compromised cannot be repaired;
     replacements must be generated using openssl(8).

     If &#8220;-&#8221; is given as an argument, openssl-vulnkey will read from standard
     input.  This can be used to process certificate output from s_client(1ssl),
     for example:

           $ echo | openssl s_client -connect remote.example.org:https |
           openssl-vulnkey -

     will test the certificate used by remote.example.org for HTTPS.

     The options are as follows:

     -q      Quiet mode.  Normally, openssl-vulnkey outputs the fingerprint of
             each file scanned, with a description of its status.  This option
             suppresses that output.

     -b      Number of bits for the modulus specified.  Requires -m.

     -m      Check modulus.  Requires -b.

BLACKLIST SHA1SUM FORMAT
     The blacklist file may start with comments, on lines starting with &#8220;#&#8221;.
     After these initial comments, it must follow a strict format:

           &#183;   Each line must consist of the lower-case hexadecimal SHA1 finger&#8208;
               print of the certificate or key&apos;s modulus, and with the first 20
               characters removed (that is, the least significant 80 bits of the
               fingerprint).

     The fingerprint of the modulus may be generated using

           $ openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in file | sha1sum | cut -d &apos; &apos; -f 1
           $ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in file | sha1sum | cut -d &apos; &apos; -f 1
           $ openssl req -noout -modulus -in file | sha1sum | cut -d &apos; &apos; -f 1

     This strict format is necessary to allow the blacklist file to be checked
     quickly.
