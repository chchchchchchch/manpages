OPENVPN-VULNKEY(1)        BSD General Commands Manual       OPENVPN-VULNKEY(1)

NAME
     openvpn-vulnkey &#8212; check blacklist of compromised keys

SYNOPSIS
     openvpn-vulnkey [-q] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     openvpn-vulnkey checks a key against a blacklist of compromised keys.

     A substantial number of keys are known to have been generated using a bro&#8208;
     ken version of OpenSSL distributed by Debian which failed to seed its ran&#8208;
     dom number generator correctly.  Keys generated using these OpenSSL ver&#8208;
     sions should be assumed to be compromised.  This tool may be useful in
     checking for such OpenVPN shared static keys. See openssl-vulnkey(1) for
     details on checking SSL/TLS certificates.

     Keys that are compromised cannot be repaired; replacements must be gener&#8208;
     ated using openvpn(8).  Shared keys can be regenerated with:

           $ openvpn --genkey --secret file

     The options are as follows:

     -q      Quiet mode.  openvpn-vulnkey(1).  Normally, openvpn-vulnkey outputs
             the fingerprint of each key scanned, with a description of its sta&#8208;
             tus.  This option suppresses that output.

BLACKLIST MD5SUM FORMAT
     The blacklist file may start with comments, on lines starting with &#8220;#&#8221;.
     After these initial comments, it must follow a strict format:

           &#183;   Each line must consist of the lower-case hexadecimal MD5 key fin&#8208;
               gerprint, and with the first 12 characters removed (that is, the
               least significant 80 bits of the fingerprint).

     The key fingerprint may be generated using

           $ cat file.pem | sed &apos;/^[^0-9a-f]/d&apos; | md5sum | cut -d &apos; &apos; -f 1

     This strict format is necessary to allow the blacklist file to be checked
     quickly.
