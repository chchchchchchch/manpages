NAME
       openvpn - secure IP tunnel daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       openvpn [ options ... ]

INTRODUCTION
       OpenVPN  is  an  open  source VPN daemon by James Yonan.  Because OpenVPN
       tries to be a universal VPN tool offering a great  deal  of  flexibility,
       there  are  a lot of options on this manual page.  If you&apos;re new to Open&#8208;
       VPN, you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you  will
       see how to construct simple VPNs on the command line without even needing
       a configuration file.

       Also note that there&apos;s more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN web
       site: http://openvpn.net/

       And  if  you  would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the
       openvpn usage message which can be obtained by  running  openvpn  without
       any parameters.

DESCRIPTION
       OpenVPN  is  a  robust  and highly flexible VPN daemon.  OpenVPN supports
       SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel transport  through
       proxies or NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses and DHCP, scalability to
       hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most  major  OS  plat&#8208;
       forms.

       OpenVPN  is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its
       crypto capabilities from it.

       OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a  pre-shared  secret  key
       (Static  Key  mode)  or public key security (SSL/TLS mode) using client &amp;
       server certificates.  OpenVPN also supports  non-encrypted  TCP/UDP  tun&#8208;
       nels.

       OpenVPN is designed to work with the TUN/TAP virtual networking interface
       that exists on most platforms.

       Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but with
       a relatively lightweight footprint.

OPTIONS
       OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a
       configuration file.  Though all command line options are  preceded  by  a
       double-leading-dash  (&quot;--&quot;), this prefix can be removed when an option is
       placed in a configuration file.

       --help Show options.

       --config file
              Load additional config options from file where  each  line  corre&#8208;
              sponds  to  one  command  line  option,  but with the leading &apos;--&apos;
              removed.

              If --config file is the only option to the  openvpn  command,  the
              --config  can  be removed, and the command can be given as openvpn
              file

              Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.

              Double quotation or single quotation characters (&quot;&quot;,  &apos;&apos;)  can  be
              used  to  enclose single parameters containing whitespace, and &quot;#&quot;
              or &quot;;&quot; characters in the first column can be used to  denote  com&#8208;
              ments.

              Note  that  OpenVPN  2.0 and higher performs backslash-based shell
              escaping for characters not in single quotations, so the following
              mappings should be observed:

                  \\       Maps to a single backslash character (\).
                  \&quot;       Pass a literal doublequote character (&quot;), don&apos;t
                           interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
                  \[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don&apos;t
                           interpret it as a parameter delimiter.

              For  example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent path&#8208;
              names:

                  secret &quot;c:\\OpenVPN\\secret.key&quot;

              For examples of configuration files, see  http://openvpn.net/exam&#8208;
              ples.html

              Here is an example configuration file:

                  #
                  # Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
                  # using a pre-shared static key.
                  #
                  # &apos;#&apos; or &apos;;&apos; may be used to delimit comments.

                  # Use a dynamic tun device.
                  dev tun

                  # Our remote peer
                  remote mypeer.mydomain

                  # 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
                  # 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint
                  ifconfig 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2

                  # Our pre-shared static key
                  secret static.key

   Tunnel Options:
       --mode m
              Set  OpenVPN  major  mode.   By default, OpenVPN runs in point-to-
              point mode (&quot;p2p&quot;).  OpenVPN 2.0 introduces a new mode  (&quot;server&quot;)
              which implements a multi-client server capability.

       --local host
              Local  host  name  or  IP address for bind.  If specified, OpenVPN
              will bind to this address only.  If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind
              to all interfaces.

       --remote host [port] [proto]
              Remote  host name or IP address.  On the client, multiple --remote
              options may be specified for redundancy, each referring to a  dif&#8208;
              ferent  OpenVPN  server.  Specifying multiple --remote options for
              this purpose is a special case of the more general connection-pro&#8208;
              file feature.  See the &lt;connection&gt; documentation below.

              The OpenVPN client will try to connect to a server at host:port in
              the order specified by the list of --remote options.

              proto indicates the protocol  to  use  when  connecting  with  the
              remote, and may be &quot;tcp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;.

              The client will move on to the next host in the list, in the event
              of connection failure.  Note that at any given time,  the  OpenVPN
              client will at most be connected to one server.

              Note  that  since  UDP  is  connectionless,  connection failure is
              defined by the --ping and --ping-restart options.

              Note the following corner case:   If  you  use  multiple  --remote
              options,  AND  you are dropping root privileges on the client with
              --user and/or --group, AND the client is running a non-Windows OS,
              if  the  client  needs  to  switch to a different server, and that
              server pushes back different TUN/TAP or route settings, the client
              may  lack the necessary privileges to close and reopen the TUN/TAP
              interface.  This could cause the  client  to  exit  with  a  fatal
              error.

              If  --remote  is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from
              any IP address, but will not act on those packets unless they pass
              all  authentication tests.  This requirement for authentication is
              binding on all potential peers, even those from known and  suppos&#8208;
              edly  trusted  IP  addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP
              address on a UDP packet).

              When used in TCP mode, --remote will act as  a  filter,  rejecting
              connections from any host which does not match host.

              If host is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses, one
              will be randomly chosen, providing a sort of basic  load-balancing
              and failover capability.

       --remote-random-hostname
              Add  a random string (6 characters) to first DNS label of hostname
              to prevent DNS caching.  For example, &quot;foo.bar.gov&quot; would be modi&#8208;
              fied to &quot;&lt;random-chars&gt;.foo.bar.gov&quot;.

       &lt;connection&gt;
              Define  a  client  connection profile.  Client connection profiles
              are groups of OpenVPN options that describe how to  connect  to  a
              given  OpenVPN  server.   Client connection profiles are specified
              within an OpenVPN configuration file, and each profile  is  brack&#8208;
              eted by &lt;connection&gt; and &lt;/connection&gt;.

              An  OpenVPN  client  will try each connection profile sequentially
              until it achieves a successful connection.

              --remote-random can be used to initially &quot;scramble&quot; the connection
              list.

              Here is an example of connection profile usage:

                  client
                  dev tun

                  &lt;connection&gt;
                  remote 198.19.34.56 1194 udp
                  &lt;/connection&gt;

                  &lt;connection&gt;
                  remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
                  &lt;/connection&gt;

                  &lt;connection&gt;
                  remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
                  http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
                  http-proxy-retry
                  &lt;/connection&gt;

                  &lt;connection&gt;
                  remote 198.19.36.99 443 tcp
                  http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
                  http-proxy-retry
                  &lt;/connection&gt;

                  persist-key
                  persist-tun
                  pkcs12 client.p12
                  ns-cert-type server
                  verb 3

              First  we  try  to  connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using
              UDP.  If that fails, we then try to  connect  to  198.19.34.56:443
              using  TCP.   If  that  also fails, then try connecting through an
              HTTP proxy at  192.168.0.8:8080  to  198.19.34.56:443  using  TCP.
              Finally,  try  to  connect  through  the same proxy to a server at
              198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.

              The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a &lt;connection&gt;
              block:

              bind,  connect-retry,  connect-retry-max,  connect-timeout, float,
              http-proxy, http-proxy-option, http-proxy-retry,  http-proxy-time&#8208;
              out,  local,  lport,  nobind,  port,  proto, remote, rport, socks-
              proxy, and socks-proxy-retry.

              A defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to  apply  to
              all  &lt;connection&gt; profiles.  If any of the above options (with the
              exception of remote ) appear outside of a &lt;connection&gt; block,  but
              in a configuration file which has one or more &lt;connection&gt; blocks,
              the option setting will be used  as  a  default  for  &lt;connection&gt;
              blocks which follow it in the configuration file.

              For  example,  suppose the nobind option were placed in the sample
              configuration file above, near the top of  the  file,  before  the
              first  &lt;connection&gt;  block.  The effect would be as if nobind were
              declared in all &lt;connection&gt; blocks below it.

       --proto-force p
              When iterating through connection profiles, only consider profiles
              using protocol p (&apos;tcp&apos;|&apos;udp&apos;).

       --remote-random
              When  multiple --remote address/ports are specified, or if connec&#8208;
              tion profiles are being used, initially randomize the order of the
              list as a kind of basic load-balancing measure.

       --proto p
              Use  protocol p for communicating with remote host.  p can be udp,
              tcp-client, or tcp-server.

              The default protocol is udp when --proto is not specified.

              For UDP operation, --proto udp should be specified on both peers.

              For TCP operation, one peer must use --proto  tcp-server  and  the
              other must use --proto tcp-client.  A peer started with tcp-server
              will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection.  A peer started
              with  tcp-client  will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will
              sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable via  the  --connect-retry  option)
              and  try  again  infinite  or  up to N retries (adjustable via the
              --connect-retry-max option).  Both TCP client and server will sim&#8208;
              ulate  a  SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connec&#8208;
              tion.

              OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but  TCP  capa&#8208;
              bility  is  provided  for situations where UDP cannot be used.  In
              comparison with UDP, TCP will usually be somewhat  less  efficient
              and less robust when used over unreliable or congested networks.

              This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:

              http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html

              There  are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advanta&#8208;
              geous from a security and robustness perspective, such as  tunnel&#8208;
              ing non-IP or application-level UDP protocols, or tunneling proto&#8208;
              cols which don&apos;t possess a built-in reliability layer.

       --connect-retry n
              For --proto tcp-client, take n as the number of  seconds  to  wait
              between connection retries (default=5).

       --connect-timeout n
              For  --proto  tcp-client,  set  connection  timeout  to  n seconds
              (default=10).

       --connect-retry-max n
              For --proto tcp-client, take n as the number of retries of connec&#8208;
              tion attempt (default=infinite).

       --auto-proxy
              Try  to  sense  HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings automatically.  If no
              settings are present, a direct connection will be  attempted.   If
              both  HTTP and SOCKS settings are present, HTTP will be preferred.
              If the HTTP proxy server requires a password, it will  be  queried
              from  stdin  or  the  management  interface.  If the underlying OS
              doesn&apos;t support an API for returning proxy settings, a direct con&#8208;
              nection  will  be attempted.  Currently, only Windows clients sup&#8208;
              port this option via the  InternetQueryOption  API.   This  option
              exists in OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.

       --show-proxy-settings
              Show  sensed HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Currently, only Windows
              clients support this option.

       --http-proxy server port [authfile|&apos;auto&apos;|&apos;auto-nct&apos;] [auth-method]
              Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy at address server and
              port  port.  If HTTP Proxy-Authenticate is required, authfile is a
              file containing a username and password on 2 lines, or &quot;stdin&quot;  to
              prompt from console.

              auth-method should be one of &quot;none&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, or &quot;ntlm&quot;.

              HTTP  Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the
              auto or auto-nct flags (below).

              The auto flag causes OpenVPN to automatically determine the  auth-
              method  and  query  stdin  or  the  management interface for user&#8208;
              name/password credentials, if required.  This flag exists on Open&#8208;
              VPN 2.1 or higher.

              The  auto-nct flag (no clear-text auth) instructs OpenVPN to auto&#8208;
              matically determine the authentication method, but to reject  weak
              authentication protocols such as HTTP Basic Authentication.

       --http-proxy-retry
              Retry  indefinitely  on HTTP proxy errors.  If an HTTP proxy error
              occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.

       --http-proxy-timeout n
              Set proxy timeout to n seconds, default=5.

       --http-proxy-option type [parm]
              Set extended HTTP proxy options.  Repeat to set multiple options.

              VERSION  version  --  Set   HTTP   version   number   to   version
              (default=1.0).

              AGENT user-agent -- Set HTTP &quot;User-Agent&quot; string to user-agent.

       --socks-proxy server [port]
              Connect  to  remote  host through a Socks5 proxy at address server
              and port port (default=1080).

       --socks-proxy-retry
              Retry indefinitely on Socks proxy errors.  If a Socks proxy  error
              occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.

       --resolv-retry n
              If  hostname  resolve fails for --remote, retry resolve for n sec&#8208;
              onds before failing.

              Set n to &quot;infinite&quot; to retry indefinitely.

              By default, --resolv-retry infinite is enabled.  You  can  disable
              by setting n=0.

       --float
              Allow  remote  peer  to  change its IP address and/or port number,
              such as due to DHCP (this is the default if --remote is not used).
              --float  when specified with --remote allows an OpenVPN session to
              initially connect to a peer at a known address, however if packets
              arrive  from  a new address and pass all authentication tests, the
              new address will take control of the session.  This is useful when
              you are connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address such as
              a dial-in user or DHCP client.

              Essentially, --float tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets
              from  any address, not only the address which was specified in the
              --remote option.

       --ipchange cmd
              Execute shell command cmd when our remote ip-address is  initially
              authenticated or changes.

              Execute as:

              cmd ip_address port_number

              Don&apos;t  use  --ipchange in --mode server mode.  Use a --client-con&#8208;
              nect script instead.

              See the &quot;Environmental Variables&quot;  section  below  for  additional
              parameters passed as environmental variables.

              Note  that  cmd can be a shell command with multiple arguments, in
              which case all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended to cmd
              to build a command line which will be passed to the script.

              If  you  are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the
              IP addresses of either peer could change without notice,  you  can
              use this script, for example, to edit the /etc/hosts file with the
              current address of the peer.  The script will be  run  every  time
              the remote peer changes its IP address.

              Similarly if our IP address changes due to DHCP, we should config&#8208;
              ure our IP address change script (see man page for dhcpcd(8) )  to
              deliver  a SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN.  OpenVPN will then
              reestablish a connection with its most recently authenticated peer
              on its new IP address.

       --port port
              TCP/UDP  port  number  for  both  local  and  remote.  The current
              default of 1194 represents the official IANA port  number  assign&#8208;
              ment for OpenVPN and has been used since version 2.0-beta17.  Pre&#8208;
              vious versions used port 5000 as the default.

       --lport port
              TCP/UDP port number for bind.

       --rport port
              TCP/UDP port number for remote.

       --bind Bind to local address and port. This is the default unless any  of
              --proto tcp-client , --http-proxy or --socks-proxy are used.

       --nobind
              Do not bind to local address and port.  The IP stack will allocate
              a dynamic port for returning packets.   Since  the  value  of  the
              dynamic  port could not be known in advance by a peer, this option
              is only suitable for peers which will be initiating connections by
              using the --remote option.

       --dev tunX | tapX | null
              TUN/TAP  virtual  network  device ( X can be omitted for a dynamic
              device.)

              See examples section below for an example  on  setting  up  a  TUN
              device.

              You  must use either tun devices on both ends of the connection or
              tap devices on both ends.  You cannot mix them, as they  represent
              different underlying network layers.

              tun  devices  encapsulate  IPv4  or  IPv6  (OSI Layer 3) while tap
              devices encapsulate Ethernet 802.3 (OSI Layer 2).

       --dev-type device-type
              Which device type are we using?  device-type should  be  tun  (OSI
              Layer  3)  or  tap  (OSI  Layer  2).   Use this option only if the
              TUN/TAP device used with --dev does not begin with tun or tap.

       --topology mode
              Configure virtual addressing topology when running  in  --dev  tun
              mode.   This  directive  has  no  meaning in --dev tap mode, which
              always uses a subnet topology.

              If you  set  this  directive  on  the  server,  the  --server  and
              --server-bridge  directives  will  automatically  push your chosen
              topology setting to clients as well.  This directive can  also  be
              manually pushed to clients.  Like the --dev directive, this direc&#8208;
              tive must always be compatible between client and server.

              mode can be one of:

              net30 -- Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 sub&#8208;
              net  per  client.  This is designed to allow point-to-point seman&#8208;
              tics when some or all of the connecting clients might  be  Windows
              systems.  This is the default on OpenVPN 2.0.
&#12;              p2p  -- Use a point-to-point topology where the remote endpoint of
              the client&apos;s tun interface always points to the local endpoint  of
              the  server&apos;s  tun  interface.   This  mode  allocates a single IP
              address per connecting client.  Only use when none of the connect&#8208;
              ing clients are Windows systems.  This mode is functionally equiv&#8208;
              alent to the --ifconfig-pool-linear directive which  is  available
              in OpenVPN 2.0 and is now deprecated.

              subnet  --  Use  a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by
              configuring the tun interface with a local IP address  and  subnet
              mask,  similar  to  the  topology  used  in --dev tap and ethernet
              bridging mode.  This mode allocates a single IP address  per  con&#8208;
              necting  client and works on Windows as well.  Only available when
              server and clients are OpenVPN 2.1 or  higher,  or  OpenVPN  2.0.x
              which  has  been  manually  patched  with the --topology directive
              code.  When used on Windows, requires version 8.2 or higher of the
              TAP-Win32 driver.  When used on *nix, requires that the tun driver
              supports an ifconfig(8) command which sets a subnet instead  of  a
              remote endpoint IP address.

              This option exists in OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.

       --tun-ipv6
              Build  a  tun  link capable of forwarding IPv6 traffic.  Should be
              used in conjunction with --dev tun or --dev tunX.  A warning  will
              be  displayed if no specific IPv6 TUN support for your OS has been
              compiled into OpenVPN.

              See below for further IPv6-related configuration options.

       --dev-node node
              Explicitly set the device node  rather  than  using  /dev/net/tun,
              /dev/tun,  /dev/tap,  etc.   If  OpenVPN cannot figure out whether
              node is a TUN or TAP device based on the  name,  you  should  also
              specify --dev-type tun or --dev-type tap.

              On  Windows  systems,  select the TAP-Win32 adapter which is named
              node in the Network Connections Control Panel or the raw  GUID  of
              the  adapter enclosed by braces.  The --show-adapters option under
              Windows can also be used  to  enumerate  all  available  TAP-Win32
              adapters  and will show both the network connections control panel
              name and the GUID for each TAP-Win32 adapter.

       --lladdr address
              Specify the link layer address, more commonly  known  as  the  MAC
              address.  Only applied to TAP devices.

       --iproute cmd
              Set  alternate command to execute instead of default iproute2 com&#8208;
              mand.  May be used in order to  execute  OpenVPN  in  unprivileged
              environment.

       --ifconfig l rn
              Set  TUN/TAP adapter parameters.  l is the IP address of the local
              VPN endpoint.  For TUN devices, rn is the IP address of the remote
              VPN  endpoint.  For TAP devices, rn is the subnet mask of the vir&#8208;
              tual ethernet segment which is being created or connected to.

              For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual point-to-point  IP  con&#8208;
              nections,  the proper usage of --ifconfig is to use two private IP
              addresses which are not a member of any existing subnet  which  is
              in use.  The IP addresses may be consecutive and should have their
              order reversed on the remote peer.  After the VPN is  established,
              by pinging rn, you will be pinging across the VPN.

              For  TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual eth&#8208;
              ernet segments, --ifconfig is used to set an IP address and subnet
              mask  just  as a physical ethernet adapter would be similarly con&#8208;
              figured.  If you are attempting to connect to  a  remote  ethernet
              bridge,  the  IP  address and subnet should be set to values which
              would be valid on the the bridged ethernet segment (note also that
              DHCP can be used for the same purpose).

              This  option, while primarily a proxy for the ifconfig(8) command,
              is designed to simplify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by  providing
              a  standard interface to the different ifconfig implementations on
              different platforms.

              --ifconfig parameters which are IP addresses can also be specified
              as a DNS or /etc/hosts file resolvable name.

              For  TAP  devices, --ifconfig should not be used if the TAP inter&#8208;
              face will be getting an IP address lease from a DHCP server.

       --ifconfig-noexec
              Don&apos;t  actually  execute  ifconfig/netsh  commands,  instead  pass
              --ifconfig parameters to scripts using environmental variables.

       --ifconfig-nowarn
              Don&apos;t  output an options consistency check warning if the --ifcon&#8208;
              fig option on this side of the connection doesn&apos;t match the remote
              side.  This is useful when you want to retain the overall benefits
              of the options consistency check (also see  --disable-occ  option)
              while only disabling the ifconfig component of the check.

              For example, if you have a configuration where the local host uses
              --ifconfig but the remote host does not, use --ifconfig-nowarn  on
              the local host.

              This  option  will  also  silence warnings about potential address
              conflicts which occasionally annoy more experienced users by trig&#8208;
              gering &quot;false positive&quot; warnings.

       --route network/IP [netmask] [gateway] [metric]
              Add  route to routing table after connection is established.  Mul&#8208;
              tiple routes can be specified.  Routes will be automatically  torn
              down in reverse order prior to TUN/TAP device close.

              This  option  is  intended as a convenience proxy for the route(8)
              shell command, while at the same time providing portable semantics
              across OpenVPN&apos;s platform space.

              netmask default -- 255.255.255.255

              gateway default -- taken from --route-gateway or the second param&#8208;
              eter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified.

              metric default -- taken from --route-metric otherwise 0.

              The default can be specified by leaving an option blank or setting
              it to &quot;nil&quot;.

              The  network and gateway parameters can also be specified as a DNS
              or /etc/hosts file resolvable name, or as  one  of  three  special
              keywords:

              vpn_gateway  --  The  remote  VPN endpoint address (derived either
              from --route-gateway or the second parameter  to  --ifconfig  when
              --dev tun is specified).

              net_gateway  -- The pre-existing IP default gateway, read from the
              routing table (not supported on all OSes).

              remote_host -- The --remote address if OpenVPN  is  being  run  in
              client mode, and is undefined in server mode.

       --max-routes n
              Allow  a  maximum  number  of  n  --route options to be specified,
              either in the local configuration file, or pulled from an  OpenVPN
              server.  By default, n=100.

       --route-gateway gw|&apos;dhcp&apos;
              Specify a default gateway gw for use with --route.

              If dhcp is specified as the parameter, the gateway address will be
              extracted from a DHCP negotiation  with  the  OpenVPN  server-side
              LAN.

       --route-metric m
              Specify a default metric m for use with --route.

       --route-delay [n] [w]
              Delay n seconds (default=0) after connection establishment, before
              adding routes. If n is 0, routes will be  added  immediately  upon
              connection  establishment.   If  --route-delay  is omitted, routes
              will be added immediately  after  TUN/TAP  device  open  and  --up
              script execution, before any --user or --group privilege downgrade
              (or --chroot execution.)

              This option is designed to be useful in scenarios  where  DHCP  is
              used  to  set tap adapter addresses.  The delay will give the DHCP
              handshake time to complete before routes are added.

              On Windows, --route-delay tries to be more intelligent by  waiting
              w  seconds  (w=30 by default) for the TAP-Win32 adapter to come up
              before adding routes.

       --route-up cmd
              Execute shell command cmd  after  routes  are  added,  subject  to
              --route-delay.

              See  the  &quot;Environmental  Variables&quot;  section below for additional
              parameters passed as environmental variables.

              Note that cmd can be a shell command with multiple arguments.

       --route-noexec
              Don&apos;t add or remove routes automatically.  Instead pass routes  to
              --route-up script using environmental variables.

       --route-nopull
              When used with --client or --pull, accept options pushed by server
              EXCEPT for routes.

              When used on the client, this option effectively bars  the  server
              from  adding  routes  to  the client&apos;s routing table, however note
              that this option still allows the server to set the TCP/IP proper&#8208;
              ties of the client&apos;s TUN/TAP interface.

       --allow-pull-fqdn
              Allow client to pull DNS names from server (rather than being lim&#8208;
              ited to IP address) for --ifconfig, --route, and --route-gateway.

       --redirect-gateway flags...
              (Experimental) Automatically execute routing commands to cause all
              outgoing IP traffic to be redirected over the VPN.

              This option performs three steps:

              (1)  Create a static route for the --remote address which forwards
              to the pre-existing default gateway.  This is  done  so  that  (3)
              will not create a routing loop.

              (2) Delete the default gateway route.

              (3)  Set  the  new  default gateway to be the VPN endpoint address
              (derived either from --route-gateway or the  second  parameter  to
              --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified).

              When  the tunnel is torn down, all of the above steps are reversed
              so that the original default route is restored.

              Option flags:

              local -- Add the local flag if both OpenVPN servers  are  directly
              connected  via  a common subnet, such as with wireless.  The local
              flag will cause step 1 above to be omitted.

              def1 -- Use this flag to override the  default  gateway  by  using
              0.0.0.0/1  and  128.0.0.0/1  rather  than 0.0.0.0/0.  This has the
              benefit of overriding but not  wiping  out  the  original  default
              gateway.

              bypass-dhcp  --  Add  a  direct route to the DHCP server (if it is
              non-local)  which  bypasses  the  tunnel  (Available  on   Windows
              clients, may not be available on non-Windows clients).

              bypass-dns -- Add a direct route to the DNS server(s) (if they are
              non-local)  which  bypasses  the  tunnel  (Available  on   Windows
              clients, may not be available on non-Windows clients).

              Using the def1 flag is highly recommended.

       --redirect-private [flags]
              Like  --redirect-gateway,  but  omit actually changing the default
              gateway.  Useful when pushing private subnets.

       --link-mtu n
              Sets an upper bound on the size of  UDP  packets  which  are  sent
              between OpenVPN peers.  It&apos;s best not to set this parameter unless
              you know what you&apos;re doing.

       --tun-mtu n
              Take the TUN device MTU to be n and derive the link  MTU  from  it
              (default=1500).   In  most  cases, you will probably want to leave
              this parameter set to its default value.

              The MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) is the maximum datagram  size
              in  bytes  that can be sent unfragmented over a particular network
              path.  OpenVPN requires that packets on the control or data  chan&#8208;
              nels be sent unfragmented.

              MTU  problems  often manifest themselves as connections which hang
              during periods of active usage.

              It&apos;s best to use the --fragment and/or --mssfix  options  to  deal
              with MTU sizing issues.

       --tun-mtu-extra n
              Assume  that  the  TUN/TAP  device might return as many as n bytes
              more than the --tun-mtu size on read.  This parameter defaults  to
              0,  which  is  sufficient  for  most TUN devices.  TAP devices may
              introduce additional overhead in excess of the  MTU  size,  and  a
              setting  of  32  is  the  default when TAP devices are used.  This
              parameter only controls internal OpenVPN buffer sizing,  so  there
              is no transmission overhead associated with using a larger value.

       --mtu-disc type
              Should  we  do  Path  MTU discovery on TCP/UDP channel?  Only sup&#8208;
              ported on OSes such as Linux that supports  the  necessary  system
              call to set.

              &apos;no&apos; -- Never send DF (Don&apos;t Fragment) frames
              &apos;maybe&apos; -- Use per-route hints
              &apos;yes&apos; -- Always DF (Don&apos;t Fragment)

       --mtu-test
              To  empirically  measure MTU on connection startup, add the --mtu-
              test option to your configuration.  OpenVPN will send ping packets
              of  various sizes to the remote peer and measure the largest pack&#8208;
              ets which were successfully received.  The --mtu-test process nor&#8208;
              mally takes about 3 minutes to complete.

       --fragment max
              Enable  internal  datagram  fragmentation so that no UDP datagrams
              are sent which are larger than max bytes.

              The max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu
              parameter,  i.e.  the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead
              has been added in, but not including the UDP header itself.

              The --fragment option only makes sense when you are using the  UDP
              protocol ( --proto udp ).

              --fragment adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.

              See  the  --mssfix option below for an important related option to
              --fragment.

              It should also be noted that this option is not meant  to  replace
              UDP  fragmentation  at  the IP stack level.  It is only meant as a
              last resort when path MTU discovery is broken.  Using this  option
              is  less efficient than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link
              and using native IP fragmentation instead.

              Having said that, there are circumstances  where  using  OpenVPN&apos;s
              internal fragmentation capability may be your only option, such as
              tunneling a UDP multicast stream which requires fragmentation.

       --mssfix max
              Announce to TCP sessions running over the tunnel that they  should
              limit their send packet sizes such that after OpenVPN has encapsu&#8208;
              lated them, the resulting UDP packet size that  OpenVPN  sends  to
              its peer will not exceed max bytes. The default value is 1450.

              The max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu
              parameter, i.e. the UDP packet size after  encapsulation  overhead
              has been added in, but not including the UDP header itself.

              The  --mssfix  option  only makes sense when you are using the UDP
              protocol for OpenVPN  peer-to-peer  communication,  i.e.   --proto
              udp.

              --mssfix and --fragment can be ideally used together, where --mss&#8208;
              fix will try to keep TCP from needing packet fragmentation in  the
              first  place,  and if big packets come through anyhow (from proto&#8208;
              cols other than TCP), --fragment will internally fragment them.

              Both --fragment and --mssfix are designed  to  work  around  cases
              where  Path  MTU  discovery  is broken on the network path between
              OpenVPN peers.

              The usual symptom of such a breakdown  is  an  OpenVPN  connection
              which successfully starts, but then stalls during active usage.

              If  --fragment  and --mssfix are used together, --mssfix will take
              its default max parameter from the --fragment max option.

              Therefore, one could lower the maximum UDP packet size to 1300  (a
              good  first  try for solving MTU-related connection problems) with
              the following options:

              --tun-mtu 1500 --fragment 1300 --mssfix

       --sndbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket send buffer size.   Currently  defaults  to
              65536 bytes.

       --rcvbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket receive buffer size.  Currently defaults to
              65536 bytes.

       --socket-flags flags...
              Apply the given flags to the OpenVPN transport socket.  Currently,
              only TCP_NODELAY is supported.

              The  TCP_NODELAY socket flag is useful in TCP mode, and causes the
              kernel to send tunnel packets immediately over the TCP  connection
              without  trying  to  group  several  smaller packets into a larger
              packet.  This can result in a considerably improvement in latency.

              This option is pushable from server to client, and should be  used
              on both client and server for maximum effect.

       --txqueuelen n
              (Linux  only)  Set  the  TX queue length on the TUN/TAP interface.
              Currently defaults to 100.

       --shaper n
              Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to n bytes per  second  on
              the  TCP/UDP  port.   If  you  want to limit the bandwidth in both
              directions, use this option on both peers.

              OpenVPN uses the following algorithm to implement traffic shaping:
              Given  a shaper rate of n bytes per second, after a datagram write
              of b bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of  (b  /
              n) seconds before queuing the next write.

              It  should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between
              the same two peers,  allowing  you  to  construct  full-speed  and
              reduced  bandwidth  tunnels at the same time, routing low-priority
              data such as off-site backups over the reduced  bandwidth  tunnel,
              and other data over the full-speed tunnel.

              Also  note  that  for  low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per
              second), you should probably use lower MTU  values  as  well  (see
              above),  otherwise  the  packet  latency  will grow so large as to
              trigger timeouts in the TLS layer and TCP connections running over
              the tunnel.

              OpenVPN allows n to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.

       --inactive n [bytes]
              Causes  OpenVPN  to  exit  after  n  seconds  of inactivity on the
              TUN/TAP device. The time length of inactivity  is  measured  since
              the last incoming or outgoing tunnel packet.  The default value is
              0 seconds, which disables this feature.

              If the optional bytes parameter is included,  exit  if  less  than
              bytes  of  combined  in/out  traffic  are  produced on the tun/tap
              device in n seconds.

              In any case, OpenVPN&apos;s  internal  ping  packets  (which  are  just
              keepalives) and TLS control packets are not considered &quot;activity&quot;,
              nor are they counted as traffic, as they are  used  internally  by
              OpenVPN and are not an indication of actual user activity.

       --ping n
              Ping  remote  over  the TCP/UDP control channel if no packets have
              been sent for at least n seconds (specify --ping on both peers  to
              cause  ping  packets  to  be sent in both directions since OpenVPN
              ping packets are not echoed like IP ping packets).  When  used  in
              one  of  OpenVPN&apos;s  secure modes (where --secret, --tls-server, or
              --tls-client is specified), the ping packet will be  cryptographi&#8208;
              cally secure.

              This option has two intended uses:

              (1) Compatibility with stateful firewalls.  The periodic ping will
              ensure that a stateful firewall  rule  which  allows  OpenVPN  UDP
              packets to pass will not time out.

              (2) To provide a basis for the remote to test the existence of its
              peer using the --ping-exit option.

       --ping-exit n
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after n seconds pass without reception of a
              ping  or  other  packet  from remote.  This option can be combined
              with --inactive, --ping, and --ping-exit to  create  a  two-tiered
              inactivity disconnect.

              For example,

              openvpn [options...] --inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60

              when  used on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60 sec&#8208;
              onds if its peer disconnects, but will exit after one hour  if  no
              actual tunnel data is exchanged.

       --ping-restart n
              Similar to --ping-exit, but trigger a SIGUSR1 restart after n sec&#8208;
              onds pass without reception of a ping or other packet from remote.

              This option is useful in cases where the remote peer has a dynamic
              IP  address and a low-TTL DNS name is used to track the IP address
              using a service such as http://dyndns.org/ + a dynamic DNS  client
              such as ddclient.

              If  the peer cannot be reached, a restart will be triggered, caus&#8208;
              ing  the  hostname  used  with  --remote  to  be  re-resolved  (if
              --resolv-retry is also specified).

              In  server  mode, --ping-restart, --inactive, or any other type of
              internally generated signal will always be applied  to  individual
              client  instance objects, never to whole server itself.  Note also
              in server mode that any internally generated  signal  which  would
              normally  cause  a  restart, will cause the deletion of the client
              instance object instead.

              In client mode, the --ping-restart parameter is set to 120 seconds
              by  default.   This  default  will  hold  until the client pulls a
              replacement value from the server, based on the  --keepalive  set&#8208;
              ting  in  the  server  configuration.   To  disable the 120 second
              default, set --ping-restart 0 on the client.

              See the signals section below for more information on SIGUSR1.

              Note that the behavior of SIGUSR1 can be modified  by  the  --per&#8208;
              sist-tun, --persist-key, --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-
              ip options.

              Also note that --ping-exit and --ping-restart are mutually  exclu&#8208;
              sive and cannot be used together.

       --keepalive n m
              A  helper  directive designed to simplify the expression of --ping
              and --ping-restart in server mode configurations.

              For example, --keepalive 10 60 expands as follows:

                   if mode server:
                     ping 10
                     ping-restart 120
                     push &quot;ping 10&quot;
                     push &quot;ping-restart 60&quot;
                   else
                     ping 10
                     ping-restart 60

       --ping-timer-rem
              Run the --ping-exit / --ping-restart  timer  only  if  we  have  a
              remote address.  Use this option if you are starting the daemon in
              listen mode (i.e. without an  explicit  --remote  peer),  and  you
              don&apos;t  want  to  start  clocking timeouts until a remote peer con&#8208;
              nects.

       --persist-tun
              Don&apos;t close and reopen  TUN/TAP  device  or  run  up/down  scripts
              across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.

              SIGUSR1  is  a  restart signal similar to SIGHUP, but which offers
              finer-grained control over reset options.

       --persist-key
              Don&apos;t re-read key files across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart.

              This option can be combined with --user nobody to  allow  restarts
              triggered by the SIGUSR1 signal.  Normally if you drop root privi&#8208;
              leges in OpenVPN, the daemon cannot be restarted since it will now
              be unable to re-read protected key files.

              This  option  solves the problem by persisting keys across SIGUSR1
              resets, so they don&apos;t need to be re-read.

       --persist-local-ip
              Preserve initially resolved  local  IP  address  and  port  number
              across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.

       --persist-remote-ip
              Preserve  most  recently  authenticated remote IP address and port
              number across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.

       --mlock
              Disable paging by calling the POSIX mlockall  function.   Requires
              that  OpenVPN  be initially run as root (though OpenVPN can subse&#8208;
              quently downgrade its UID using the --user option).

              Using this option ensures that key material and  tunnel  data  are
              never  written  to  disk  due  to virtual memory paging operations
              which occur under most modern operating systems.  It ensures  that
              even  if an attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he
              would not be able to scan the system swap file to  recover  previ&#8208;
              ously  used  ephemeral  keys,  which are used for a period of time
              governed by the --reneg options (see below), then are discarded.

              The downside of using --mlock is that it will reduce the amount of
              physical memory available to other applications.

       --up cmd
              Shell  command  to  run  after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre
              --user UID change).  The up script is useful for specifying  route
              commands which route IP traffic destined for private subnets which
              exist at the other end of the VPN connection into the tunnel.

              For --dev tun execute as:

              cmd tun_dev tun_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip  ifconfig_remote_ip
              [ init | restart ]

              For --dev tap execute as:

              cmd  tap_dev tap_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_netmask [
              init | restart ]

              See the &quot;Environmental Variables&quot;  section  below  for  additional
              parameters passed as environmental variables.

              Note  that  cmd can be a shell command with multiple arguments, in
              which case all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended to cmd
              to build a command line which will be passed to the shell.

              Typically, cmd will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.

              Normally  the  up  script  is  called  after the TUN/TAP device is
              opened.  In this context, the last command line  parameter  passed
              to  the  script  will be init.  If the --up-restart option is also
              used, the up script will  be  called  for  restarts  as  well.   A
              restart  is considered to be a partial reinitialization of OpenVPN
              where the TUN/TAP instance is preserved (the --persist-tun  option
              will  enable  such preservation).  A restart can be generated by a
              SIGUSR1 signal, a --ping-restart timeout, or  a  connection  reset
              when  the  TCP  protocol is enabled with the --proto option.  If a
              restart occurs, and --up-restart has been specified, the up script
              will be called with restart as the last parameter.

              The  following standalone example shows how the --up script can be
              called in both an initialization and restart context.  (NOTE:  for
              security  reasons, don&apos;t run the following example unless UDP port
              9999 is blocked by your firewall.   Also,  the  example  will  run
              indefinitely, so you should abort with control-c).

              openvpn  --dev  tun  --port  9999  --verb 4 --ping-restart 10 --up
              &apos;echo up&apos; --down &apos;echo down&apos; --persist-tun --up-restart

              Note that OpenVPN also provides the --ifconfig option to automati&#8208;
              cally  ifconfig  the TUN device, eliminating the need to define an
              --up script, unless you also want to configure routes in the  --up
              script.

              If  --ifconfig  is  also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig
              local and remote endpoints on the command line to the --up  script
              so that they can be used to configure routes such as:

              route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5

       --up-delay
              Delay  TUN/TAP open and possible --up script execution until after
              TCP/UDP connection establishment with peer.

              In --proto udp mode, this option  normally  requires  the  use  of
              --ping  to allow connection initiation to be sensed in the absence
              of tunnel data, since UDP is a &quot;connectionless&quot; protocol.

              On Windows, this option will delay the TAP-Win32 media state tran&#8208;
              sitioning  to &quot;connected&quot; until connection establishment, i.e. the
              receipt of the first authenticated packet from the peer.

       --down cmd
              Shell command to run after TUN/TAP device close (post  --user  UID
              change  and/or  --chroot  ).   Called with the same parameters and
              environmental variables as the --up option above.

              Note that if you reduce privileges by using --user and/or --group,
              your --down script will also run at reduced privilege.

       --down-pre
              Call --down cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close.

       --up-restart
              Enable  the  --up  and --down scripts to be called for restarts as
              well as initial program start.   This  option  is  described  more
              fully above in the --up option documentation.

       --setenv name value
              Set a custom environmental variable name=value to pass to script.

       --setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1
              Relax  config file syntax checking so that unknown directives will
              trigger a warning but not a fatal error, on the assumption that  a
              given unknown directive might be valid in future OpenVPN versions.

              This  option  should be used with caution, as there are good secu&#8208;
              rity reasons for having OpenVPN fail if it detects problems  in  a
              config  file.  Having said that, there are valid reasons for want&#8208;
              ing new software features to gracefully degrade  when  encountered
              by older software versions.

       --setenv-safe name value
              Set  a custom environmental variable OPENVPN_name=value to pass to
              script.

              This directive is designed to be pushed by the server to  clients,
              and  the prepending of &quot;OPENVPN_&quot; to the environmental variable is
              a safety precaution to prevent a LD_PRELOAD style  attack  from  a
              malicious or compromised server.

       --script-security level [method]
              This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN&apos;s usage of
              external programs  and  scripts.   Lower  level  values  are  more
              restrictive,  higher  values  are  more  permissive.  Settings for
              level:

              0 -- Strictly no calling of external programs.
              1 -- (Default) Only call built-in executables  such  as  ifconfig,
              ip, route, or netsh.
              2  --  Allow  calling  of  built-in  executables  and user-defined
              scripts.
              3 -- Allow passwords to be passed  to  scripts  via  environmental
              variables (potentially unsafe).
&#12;              The  method  parameter  indicates how OpenVPN should call external
              commands and scripts.  Settings for method:

              execve -- (default) Use execve() function on Unix family OSes  and
              CreateProcess() on Windows.
              system  --  Use  system() function (deprecated and less safe since
              the external program command line is subject to shell expansion).

              The --script-security option was introduced  in  OpenVPN  2.1_rc9.
              For  configuration  file  compatibility with previous OpenVPN ver&#8208;
              sions, use: --script-security 3 system

       --disable-occ
              Don&apos;t output a  warning  message  if  option  inconsistencies  are
              detected  between  peers.   An  example of an option inconsistency
              would be where one peer uses --dev tun while the other  peer  uses
              --dev tap.

              Use  of this option is discouraged, but is provided as a temporary
              fix in situations where a recent version of OpenVPN  must  connect
              to an old version.

       --user user
              Change  the  user ID of the OpenVPN process to user after initial&#8208;
              ization, dropping privileges in the process.  This option is  use&#8208;
              ful to protect the system in the event that some hostile party was
              able to gain control of  an  OpenVPN  session.   Though  OpenVPN&apos;s
              security  features  make this unlikely, it is provided as a second
              line of defense.

              By setting user to nobody or somebody similarly unprivileged,  the
              hostile  party  would  be limited in what damage they could cause.
              Of course once you take away privileges, you cannot return them to
              an  OpenVPN session.  This means, for example, that if you want to
              reset an OpenVPN daemon with a  SIGUSR1  signal  (for  example  in
              response  to  a DHCP reset), you should make use of one or more of
              the --persist options to ensure that OpenVPN doesn&apos;t need to  exe&#8208;
              cute  any  privileged  operations in order to restart (such as re-
              reading key files or running ifconfig on the TUN device).

       --group group
              Similar to the --user option, this option changes the group ID  of
              the OpenVPN process to group after initialization.

       --cd dir
              Change directory to dir prior to reading any files such as config&#8208;
              uration files, key files, scripts, etc.  dir should be an absolute
              path,  with  a leading &quot;/&quot;, and without any references to the cur&#8208;
              rent directory such as &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;.

              This option is useful when you are  running  OpenVPN  in  --daemon
              mode,  and  you  want  to  consolidate all of your OpenVPN control
              files in one location.

       --chroot dir
              Chroot to dir after initialization.   --chroot  essentially  rede&#8208;
              fines dir as being the top level directory tree (/).  OpenVPN will
              therefore be unable to access any files outside this  tree.   This
              can be desirable from a security standpoint.

              Since  the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization,
              most OpenVPN options that reference files will operate in  a  pre-
              chroot context.

              In  many cases, the dir parameter can point to an empty directory,
              however complications can result when scripts or restarts are exe&#8208;
              cuted after the chroot operation.

       --setcon context
              Apply  SELinux context after initialization. This essentially pro&#8208;
              vides the ability to restrict OpenVPN&apos;s rights to only network I/O
              operations,  thanks  to SELinux. This goes further than --user and
              --chroot in that those two, while being great  security  features,
              unfortunately  do  not  protect  against  privilege  escalation by
              exploitation of a vulnerable system call. You can of  course  com&#8208;
              bine  all three, but please note that since setcon requires access
              to /proc you will have to provide it inside the  chroot  directory
              (e.g. with mount --bind).

              Since  the setcon operation is delayed until after initialization,
              OpenVPN can be restricted to just  network-related  system  calls,
              whereas  by applying the context before startup (such as the Open&#8208;
              VPN one provided in the SELinux Reference Policies) you will  have
              to allow many things required only during initialization.

              Like  with  chroot,  complications  can  result  when  scripts  or
              restarts are executed after the setcon operation, which is why you
              should  really  consider using the --persist-key and --persist-tun
              options.

       --daemon [progname]
              Become a daemon after all initialization functions are  completed.
              This  option will cause all message and error output to be sent to
              the syslog file (such as /var/log/messages), except for the output
              of shell scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to /dev/null
              unless otherwise redirected.  The syslog redirection occurs  imme&#8208;
              diately  at  the point that --daemon is parsed on the command line
              even though the daemonization point occurs later.  If one  of  the
              --log options is present, it will supercede syslog redirection.

              The  optional  progname parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its
              program name to the system logger as progname.  This can be useful
              in  linking OpenVPN messages in the syslog file with specific tun&#8208;
              nels.  When unspecified, progname defaults to &quot;openvpn&quot;.

              When OpenVPN is run with the --daemon option, it will try to delay
              daemonization until the majority of initialization functions which
              are capable of generating fatal errors are complete.   This  means
              that  initialization  scripts  can  test  the return status of the
              openvpn command for a fairly reliable indication  of  whether  the
              command  has correctly initialized and entered the packet forward&#8208;
              ing event loop.

              In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initial&#8208;
              ization are non-fatal.

       --syslog [progname]
              Direct  log  output  to system logger, but do not become a daemon.
              See --daemon directive above for description of  progname  parame&#8208;
              ter.

       --passtos
              Set  the  TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload&apos;s TOS
              is.

       --inetd [wait|nowait] [progname]
              Use this option when OpenVPN  is  being  run  from  the  inetd  or
              xinetd(8) server.

              The  wait/nowait  option  must  match  what  is  specified  in the
              inetd/xinetd config file.  The nowait mode can only be  used  with
              --proto  tcp-server.  The default is wait.  The nowait mode can be
              used to instantiate the OpenVPN daemon as a  classic  TCP  server,
              where  client  connection  requests  are serviced on a single port
              number.  For additional information on this kind of configuration,
              see the OpenVPN FAQ: http://openvpn.net/faq.html#oneport

              This  option  precludes the use of --daemon, --local, or --remote.
              Note that this option causes message and error output to  be  han&#8208;
              dled  in  the same way as the --daemon option.  The optional prog&#8208;
              name parameter is also handled exactly as in --daemon.

              Also note that in wait mode, each OpenVPN tunnel requires a  sepa&#8208;
              rate  TCP/UDP  port and a separate inetd or xinetd entry.  See the
              OpenVPN 1.x HOWTO for an example on  using  OpenVPN  with  xinetd:
              http://openvpn.net/1xhowto.html

       --log file
              Output logging messages to file, including output to stdout/stderr
              which is generated by called scripts.  If file already  exists  it
              will  be  truncated.  This option takes effect immediately when it
              is parsed in the command line and will supercede syslog output  if
              --daemon  or --inetd is also specified.  This option is persistent
              over the entire course of an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be
              reset by SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, or --ping-restart.

              Note  that  on Windows, when OpenVPN is started as a service, log&#8208;
              ging occurs by default without the need to specify this option.

       --log-append file
              Append logging messages to file.  If file does not exist, it  will
              be created.  This option behaves exactly like --log except that it
              appends to rather than truncating the log file.

       --suppress-timestamps
              Avoid writing timestamps to log messages, even when they otherwise
              would  be  prepended.  In particular, this applies to log messages
              sent to stdout.

       --writepid file
              Write OpenVPN&apos;s main process ID to file.

       --nice n
              Change process priority after initialization ( n greater than 0 is
              lower priority, n less than zero is higher priority).

       --fast-io
              (Experimental)  Optimize TUN/TAP/UDP I/O writes by avoiding a call
              to poll/epoll/select prior to the write operation.  The purpose of
              such  a call would normally be to block until the device or socket
              is ready to accept the write.  Such  blocking  is  unnecessary  on
              some  platforms  which don&apos;t support write blocking on UDP sockets
              or TUN/TAP devices.  In such cases, one  can  optimize  the  event
              loop  by  avoiding the poll/epoll/select call, improving CPU effi&#8208;
              ciency by 5% to 10%.

              This option can only be used on non-Windows systems, when  --proto
              udp is specified, and when --shaper is NOT specified.

       --multihome
              Configure  a multi-homed UDP server.  This option can be used when
              OpenVPN has been configured to listen on all interfaces, and  will
              attempt  to bind client sessions to the interface on which packets
              are being received, so that outgoing packets will be sent  out  of
              the  same  interface.   Note that this option is only relevant for
              UDP servers and currently is only implemented on Linux.

              Note: clients connecting to a --multihome server should always use
              the --nobind option.

       --echo [parms...]
              Echo parms to log output.

              Designed  to be used to send messages to a controlling application
              which is receiving the OpenVPN log output.

       --remap-usr1 signal
              Control whether internally or externally generated SIGUSR1 signals
              are  remapped  to  SIGHUP  (restart  without  persisting state) or
              SIGTERM (exit).

              signal can be set to &quot;SIGHUP&quot; or &quot;SIGTERM&quot;.  By default, no remap&#8208;
              ping occurs.

       --verb n
              Set  output verbosity to n (default=1).  Each level shows all info
              from the previous levels.  Level 3 is recommended if  you  want  a
              good summary of what&apos;s happening without being swamped by output.

              0 -- No output except fatal errors.
              1 to 4 -- Normal usage range.
              5 -- Output R and W characters to the console for each packet read
              and write, uppercase is used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase  is
              used for TUN/TAP packets.
              6  to 11 -- Debug info range (see errlevel.h for additional infor&#8208;
              mation on debug levels).

       --status file [n]
              Write operational status to file every n seconds.

              Status can also be written to the syslog by sending a SIGUSR2 sig&#8208;
              nal.

       --status-version [n]
              Choose  the status file format version number.  Currently n can be
              1, 2, or 3 and defaults to 1.

       --mute n
              Log at most n consecutive messages in the same category.  This  is
              useful to limit repetitive logging of similar message types.

       --comp-lzo [mode]
              Use  fast  LZO  compression -- may add up to 1 byte per packet for
              incompressible data.  mode  may  be  &quot;yes&quot;,  &quot;no&quot;,  or  &quot;adaptive&quot;
              (default).

              In  a  server  mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn com&#8208;
              pression on or off for individual clients.

              First, make sure the client-side  config  file  enables  selective
              compression  by  having at least one --comp-lzo directive, such as
              --comp-lzo no.  This will turn off  compression  by  default,  but
              allow  a  future  directive  push  from  the server to dynamically
              change the on/off/adaptive setting.

              Next in a --client-config-dir file, specify the  compression  set&#8208;
              ting for the client, for example:

                  comp-lzo yes
                  push &quot;comp-lzo yes&quot;

              The  first  line  sets the comp-lzo setting for the server side of
              the link, the second sets the client side.
&#12;       --comp-noadapt
              When used in conjunction with --comp-lzo, this option will disable
              OpenVPN&apos;s adaptive compression algorithm.  Normally, adaptive com&#8208;
              pression is enabled with --comp-lzo.

              Adaptive compression tries to optimize the  case  where  you  have
              compression enabled, but you are sending predominantly uncompress&#8208;
              ible (or pre-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as  an  FTP
              or rsync transfer of a large, compressed file.  With adaptive com&#8208;
              pression, OpenVPN will periodically sample the compression process
              to measure its efficiency.  If the data being sent over the tunnel
              is already compressed, the compression  efficiency  will  be  very
              low,  triggering  openvpn  to  disable compression for a period of
              time until the next re-sample test.

       --management IP port [pw-file]
              Enable a TCP server on IP:port to handle daemon  management  func&#8208;
              tions.   pw-file,  if  specified,  is a password file (password on
              first line) or &quot;stdin&quot; to prompt from standard input.   The  pass&#8208;
              word provided will set the password which TCP clients will need to
              provide in order to access management functions.

              The management interface can also listen on a unix domain  socket,
              for those platforms that support it.  To use a unix domain socket,
              specify the unix socket pathname in place of IP and  set  port  to
              &apos;unix&apos;.   While  the  default  behavior is to create a unix domain
              socket that may be connected to by any process, the  --management-
              client-user  and  --management-client-group directives can be used
              to restrict access.

              The management interface provides a special  mode  where  the  TCP
              management  link  can  operate  over the tunnel itself.  To enable
              this mode, set IP = &quot;tunnel&quot;.  Tunnel mode will cause the  manage&#8208;
              ment  interface  to  listen  for a TCP connection on the local VPN
              address of the TUN/TAP interface.

              While the management port is designed for programmatic control  of
              OpenVPN  by  other  applications,  it is possible to telnet to the
              port, using a telnet client in &quot;raw&quot; mode.  Once  connected,  type
              &quot;help&quot; for a list of commands.

              For  detailed  documentation  on the management interface, see the
              management-notes.txt file in the management folder of the  OpenVPN
              source distribution.

              It is strongly recommended that IP be set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
              to restrict  accessibility  of  the  management  server  to  local
              clients.

       --management-client
              Management interface will connect as a TCP client to IP:port spec&#8208;
              ified by --management rather than listen as a TCP server.

       --management-query-passwords
              Query management channel for private key password and --auth-user-
              pass  username/password.   Only  query  the management channel for
              inputs which ordinarily would have been queried from the console.

       --management-forget-disconnect
              Make OpenVPN forget passwords when management session disconnects.

              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.
              It is always cached.

       --management-hold
              Start  OpenVPN  in a hibernating state, until a client of the man&#8208;
              agement interface explicitly starts it with the hold release  com&#8208;
              mand.

       --management-signal
              Send  SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN if management session disconnects.
              This is useful when you wish to disconnect an OpenVPN  session  on
              user logoff.

       --management-log-cache n
              Cache the most recent n lines of log file history for usage by the
              management channel.

       --management-client-auth
              Gives management interface client the responsibility to  authenti&#8208;
              cate  clients  after  their  client certificate has been verified.
              See management-notes.txt  in  OpenVPN  distribution  for  detailed
              notes.

       --management-client-pf
              Management interface clients must specify a packet filter file for
              each connecting client.  See management-notes.txt in OpenVPN  dis&#8208;
              tribution for detailed notes.

       --management-client-user u
              When  the  management  interface  is  listening  on  a unix domain
              socket, only allow connections from user u.

       --management-client-group g
              When the management  interface  is  listening  on  a  unix  domain
              socket, only allow connections from group g.

       --plugin module-pathname [init-string]
              Load  plug-in  module from the file module-pathname, passing init-
              string as an argument to the module initialization function.  Mul&#8208;
              tiple plugin modules may be loaded into one OpenVPN process.

              For  more information and examples on how to build OpenVPN plug-in
              modules, see the README file in the plugin folder of  the  OpenVPN
              source distribution.

              If  you  are using an RPM install of OpenVPN, see /usr/share/open&#8208;
              vpn/plugin.  The documentation is in doc  and  the  actual  plugin
              modules are in lib.

              Multiple  plugin  modules can be cascaded, and modules can be used
              in tandem with scripts.  The modules will be called by OpenVPN  in
              the  order  that  they are declared in the config file.  If both a
              plugin and script are configured for the same callback, the script
              will be called last.  If the return code of the module/script con&#8208;
              trols an authentication function (such as  tls-verify,  auth-user-
              pass-verify, or client-connect), then every module and script must
              return success (0) in order for the  connection  to  be  authenti&#8208;
              cated.

   Server Mode
       Starting  with  OpenVPN  2.0,  a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is sup&#8208;
       ported, and can be enabled with the  --mode  server  option.   In  server
       mode,  OpenVPN  will  listen on a single port for incoming client connec&#8208;
       tions.  All client connections will be routed through a single tun or tap
       interface.   This  mode is designed for scalability and should be able to
       support hundreds or even thousands of clients on sufficiently fast  hard&#8208;
       ware.  SSL/TLS authentication must be used in this mode.

       --server network netmask
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of Open&#8208;
              VPN&apos;s server mode.  This directive will set up an  OpenVPN  server
              which  will  allocate  addresses  to clients out of the given net&#8208;
              work/netmask.  The server itself will take the &quot;.1&quot; address of the
              given  network  for  use  as the server-side endpoint of the local
              TUN/TAP interface.

              For example, --server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 expands as follows:

                   mode server
                   tls-server
                   push &quot;topology [topology]&quot;

                   if dev tun AND (topology == net30 OR topology == p2p):
                     ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
                     if !nopool:
                       ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.4 10.8.0.251
                     route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
                     if client-to-client:
                       push &quot;route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0&quot;
                     else if topology == net30:
                       push &quot;route 10.8.0.1&quot;

                   if dev tap OR (dev tun AND topology == subnet):
                     ifconfig 10.8.0.1 255.255.255.0
                     if !nopool:
                       ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
                     push &quot;route-gateway 10.8.0.1&quot;

              Don&apos;t use --server if you are ethernet  bridging.   Use  --server-
              bridge instead.

       --server-bridge gateway netmask pool-start-IP pool-end-IP

       --server-bridge [&apos;nogw&apos;]

              A  helper  directive similar to --server which is designed to sim&#8208;
              plify the configuration  of  OpenVPN&apos;s  server  mode  in  ethernet
              bridging configurations.

              If  --server-bridge is used without any parameters, it will enable
              a DHCP-proxy mode, where connecting OpenVPN clients  will  receive
              an  IP  address for their TAP adapter from the DHCP server running
              on the OpenVPN server-side LAN.  Note that only clients that  sup&#8208;
              port  the  binding  of a DHCP client with the TAP adapter (such as
              Windows) can support this mode.  The optional nogw flag (advanced)
              indicates  that  gateway  information  should not be pushed to the
              client.

              To configure ethernet bridging,  you  must  first  use  your  OS&apos;s
              bridging  capability to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet
              NIC interface.  For example, on Linux this is done with the  brctl
              tool,  and  with  Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections
              Panel by selecting the ethernet and TAP adapters and  right-click&#8208;
              ing on &quot;Bridge Connections&quot;.

              Next you you must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge inter&#8208;
              face.  The gateway and netmask parameters to  --server-bridge  can
              be  set  to  either the IP/netmask of the bridge interface, or the
              IP/netmask of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.

              Finally, set aside a IP range in the bridged  subnet,  denoted  by
              pool-start-IP and pool-end-IP, for OpenVPN to allocate to connect&#8208;
              ing clients.

              For  example,  server-bridge  10.8.0.4  255.255.255.0   10.8.0.128
              10.8.0.254 expands as follows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server
&#12;                  ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
                  push &quot;route-gateway 10.8.0.4&quot;

              In  another  example, --server-bridge (without parameters) expands
              as follows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server

                  push &quot;route-gateway dhcp&quot;

              Or --server-bridge nogw expands as follows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server

       --push option
              Push a config file option back to the client for remote execution.
              Note  that  option  must  be  enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).  The
              client must specify --pull in its config file.  The set of options
              which  can  be pushed is limited by both feasibility and security.
              Some options such as those which would execute scripts are banned,
              since they would effectively allow a compromised server to execute
              arbitrary code on the client.  Other options such as  TLS  or  MTU
              parameters  cannot be pushed because the client needs to know them
              before the connection to the server can be initiated.

              This is a partial list of options which can currently  be  pushed:
              --route, --route-gateway, --route-delay, --redirect-gateway, --ip-
              win32, --dhcp-option,  --inactive,  --ping,  --ping-exit,  --ping-
              restart,  --setenv,  --persist-key, --persist-tun, --echo, --comp-
              lzo, --socket-flags, --sndbuf, --rcvbuf

       --push-reset
              Don&apos;t inherit the global push list for a specific client instance.
              Specify  this  option  in a client-specific context such as with a
              --client-config-dir configuration file.  This option  will  ignore
              --push options at the global config file level.

       --disable
              Disable  a  particular client (based on the common name) from con&#8208;
              necting.  Don&apos;t use this option to disable a client due to key  or
              password  compromise.   Use  a  CRL  (certificate revocation list)
              instead (see the --crl-verify option).

              This option must be associated with a  specific  client  instance,
              which  means that it must be specified either in a client instance
              config file using  --client-config-dir  or  dynamically  generated
              using a --client-connect script.

       --ifconfig-pool start-IP end-IP [netmask]
              Set  aside  a  pool of subnets to be dynamically allocated to con&#8208;
              necting clients, similar to a DHCP server.  For tun-style tunnels,
              each  client will be given a /30 subnet (for interoperability with
              Windows clients).  For  tap-style  tunnels,  individual  addresses
              will be allocated, and the optional netmask parameter will also be
              pushed to clients.


       --ifconfig-pool-persist file [seconds]
              Persist/unpersist ifconfig-pool data to file, at seconds intervals
              (default=600), as well as on program startup and shutdown.

              The  goal  of  this  option  is to provide a long-term association
              between clients (denoted by their common name) and the virtual  IP
              address  assigned  to  them from the ifconfig-pool.  Maintaining a
              long-term association is good for clients because it  allows  them
              to effectively use the --persist-tun option.

              file  is  a  comma-delimited  ASCII  file,  formatted  as &lt;Common-
              Name&gt;,&lt;IP-address&gt;.

              If seconds = 0, file will be treated as read-only.  This is useful
              if you would like to treat file as a configuration file.

              Note  that the entries in this file are treated by OpenVPN as sug&#8208;
              gestions only, based on past associations between  a  common  name
              and  IP address.  They do not guarantee that the given common name
              will always receive the given IP address.  If you want  guaranteed
              assignment, use --ifconfig-push

       --ifconfig-pool-linear
              Modifies  the --ifconfig-pool directive to allocate individual TUN
              interface addresses for clients rather than  /30  subnets.   NOTE:
              This option is incompatible with Windows clients.

              This  option is deprecated, and should be replaced with --topology
              p2p which is functionally equivalent.

       --ifconfig-push local remote-netmask
              Push virtual  IP  endpoints  for  client  tunnel,  overriding  the
              --ifconfig-pool dynamic allocation.

              The  parameters  local and remote-netmask are set according to the
              --ifconfig directive which you  want  to  execute  on  the  client
              machine  to configure the remote end of the tunnel.  Note that the
              parameters local and remote-netmask are from  the  perspective  of
              the  client, not the server.  They may be DNS names rather than IP
              addresses, in which case they will be resolved on  the  server  at
              the time of client connection.

              This  option  must  be associated with a specific client instance,
              which means that it must be specified either in a client  instance
              config  file  using  --client-config-dir  or dynamically generated
              using a --client-connect script.

              Remember also to include a --route directive in the  main  OpenVPN
              config  file which encloses local, so that the kernel will know to
              route it to the server&apos;s TUN/TAP interface.

              OpenVPN&apos;s internal client IP address selection algorithm works  as
              follows:

              1  --  Use  --client-connect  script  generated file for static IP
              (first choice).
              2 -- Use --client-config-dir file for static IP (next choice).
              3 -- Use --ifconfig-pool allocation for dynamic IP (last choice).

       --iroute network [netmask]
              Generate an internal route  to  a  specific  client.  The  netmask
              parameter, if omitted, defaults to 255.255.255.255.

              This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet from the server
              to a particular client, regardless of where the client is connect&#8208;
              ing from.  Remember that you must also add the route to the system
              routing table as well (such as by using  the  --route  directive).
              The reason why two routes are needed is that the --route directive
              routes the packet from the kernel to OpenVPN.   Once  in  OpenVPN,
              the --iroute directive routes to the specific client.

              This  option  must be specified either in a client instance config
              file using --client-config-dir or dynamically  generated  using  a
              --client-connect script.
&#12;              The  --iroute  directive  also  has  an important interaction with
              --push &quot;route ...&quot;.  --iroute essentially defines a  subnet  which
              is  owned by a particular client (we will call this client A).  If
              you would like other clients to be able to reach A&apos;s  subnet,  you
              can  use  --push  &quot;route ...&quot;  together with --client-to-client to
              effect this.  In order for all clients to see A&apos;s subnet,  OpenVPN
              must push this route to all clients EXCEPT for A, since the subnet
              is already owned by A.  OpenVPN accomplishes this by not not push&#8208;
              ing a route to a client if it matches one of the client&apos;s iroutes.

       --client-to-client
              Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients through a
              single tun or tap interface, it  is  effectively  a  router.   The
              --client-to-client  flag tells OpenVPN to internally route client-
              to-client traffic rather than pushing all client-originating traf&#8208;
              fic to the TUN/TAP interface.

              When this option is used, each client will &quot;see&quot; the other clients
              which are currently connected.  Otherwise, each client  will  only
              see  the  server.   Don&apos;t  use this option if you want to firewall
              tunnel traffic using custom, per-client rules.

       --duplicate-cn
              Allow multiple clients with the same common name  to  concurrently
              connect.  In the absence of this option, OpenVPN will disconnect a
              client instance upon connection of a new client  having  the  same
              common name.

       --client-connect script
              Run  script on client connection.  The script is passed the common
              name and IP address of the just-authenticated client  as  environ&#8208;
              mental  variables (see environmental variable section below).  The
              script is also passed the pathname of a freshly created  temporary
              file  as  $1 (i.e. the first command line argument), to be used by
              the script to pass dynamically generated  config  file  directives
              back to OpenVPN.

              If  the  script  wants  to  generate  a  dynamic config file to be
              applied on the server when the client connects, it should write it
              to the file named by $1.

              See  the --client-config-dir option below for options which can be
              legally used in a dynamically generated config file.

              Note that the return value of script is  significant.   If  script
              returns  a  non-zero  error status, it will cause the client to be
              disconnected.

       --client-disconnect
              Like --client-connect but  called  on  client  instance  shutdown.
              Will  not be called unless the --client-connect script and plugins
              (if defined) were previously called on this instance with success&#8208;
              ful (0) status returns.

              The exception to this rule is if the --client-disconnect script or
              plugins are cascaded, and at  least  one  client-connect  function
              succeeded, then ALL of the client-disconnect functions for scripts
              and plugins will be called on  client  instance  object  deletion,
              even  in  cases where some of the related client-connect functions
              returned an error status.

       --client-config-dir dir
              Specify a directory dir for custom client config files.   After  a
              connecting  client  has  been  authenticated, OpenVPN will look in
              this directory for a file having the same  name  as  the  client&apos;s
              X509  common  name.   If a matching file exists, it will be opened
              and parsed  for  client-specific  configuration  options.   If  no
              matching file is found, OpenVPN will instead try to open and parse
              a default file called &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, which may be provided but is  not
              required.  Note  that  the configuration files must be readable by
              the OpenVPN process after it has dropped it&apos;s root privileges.

              This file can specify a fixed IP address for a given client  using
              --ifconfig-push,  as  well  as  fixed  subnets owned by the client
              using --iroute.

              One of the useful properties of this  option  is  that  it  allows
              client  configuration files to be conveniently created, edited, or
              removed while the server is live, without needing to  restart  the
              server.

              The  following  options  are  legal  in a client-specific context:
              --push, --push-reset, --iroute, --ifconfig-push, and --config.

       --ccd-exclusive
              Require, as a  condition  of  authentication,  that  a  connecting
              client has a --client-config-dir file.

       --tmp-dir dir
              Specify  a directory dir for temporary files.  This directory will
              be used by openvpn processes and script to  communicate  temporary
              data  with  openvpn  main process. Note that the directory must be
              writable by the OpenVPN process after it  has  dropped  it&apos;s  root
              privileges.

              This directory will be used by in the following cases:

              * --client-connect scripts to dynamically generate client-specific
              configuration files.

              * OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY plugin hook to return  suc&#8208;
              cess/failure via auth_control_file when using deferred auth method

              * OPENVPN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_PF plugin hook to pass filtering rules via
              pf_file

       --hash-size r v
              Set the size of the real address hash table to r and  the  virtual
              address  table  to  v.   By  default, both tables are sized at 256
              buckets.

       --bcast-buffers n
              Allocate n buffers for broadcast datagrams (default=256).

       --tcp-queue-limit n
              Maximum number of output packets queued before TCP (default=64).

              When OpenVPN is tunneling data from a TUN/TAP device to  a  remote
              client  over  a  TCP  connection,  it is possible that the TUN/TAP
              device might produce data at a faster rate than the TCP connection
              can  support.   When  the  number  of output packets queued before
              sending to the TCP socket reaches this limit for  a  given  client
              connection,  OpenVPN  will start to drop outgoing packets directed
              at this client.

       --tcp-nodelay
              This macro sets the TCP_NODELAY socket flag on the server as  well
              as pushes it to connecting clients.  The TCP_NODELAY flag disables
              the Nagle algorithm on TCP sockets causing packets to be transmit&#8208;
              ted  immediately  with  low  latency,  rather than waiting a short
              period of time in order to aggregate several packets into a larger
              containing  packet.   In VPN applications over TCP, TCP_NODELAY is
              generally a good latency optimization.
&#12;              The macro expands as follows:

                   if mode server:
                     socket-flags TCP_NODELAY
                     push &quot;socket-flags TCP_NODELAY&quot;

       --max-clients n
              Limit server to a maximum of n concurrent clients.

       --max-routes-per-client n
              Allow a maximum of n internal  routes  per  client  (default=256).
              This  is  designed  to help contain DoS attacks where an authenti&#8208;
              cated client floods the server with packets appearing to come from
              many  unique  MAC addresses, forcing the server to deplete virtual
              memory as its internal routing table expands.  This directive  can
              be  used  in  a  --client-config-dir  file  or auto-generated by a
              --client-connect script to override the global value for a partic&#8208;
              ular client.

              Note that this directive affects OpenVPN&apos;s internal routing table,
              not the kernel routing table.

       --connect-freq n sec
              Allow a maximum of n new connections per sec seconds from clients.
              This  is  designed  to  contain DoS attacks which flood the server
              with connection requests using certificates which will  ultimately
              fail to authenticate.

              This  is an imperfect solution however, because in a real DoS sce&#8208;
              nario, legitimate connections might also be refused.

              For the best protection against DoS attacks in  server  mode,  use
              --proto udp and --tls-auth.

       --learn-address cmd
              Run  script  or  shell  command  cmd  to  validate  client virtual
              addresses or routes.

              cmd will be executed with 3 parameters:

              [1] operation -- &quot;add&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, or &quot;delete&quot; based on whether  or
              not the address is being added to, modified, or deleted from Open&#8208;
              VPN&apos;s internal routing table.
              [2] address -- The address being learned or unlearned.   This  can
              be an IPv4 address such as &quot;198.162.10.14&quot;, an IPv4 subnet such as
              &quot;198.162.10.0/24&quot;, or an ethernet MAC address (when --dev  tap  is
              being used) such as &quot;00:FF:01:02:03:04&quot;.
              [3]  common  name -- The common name on the certificate associated
              with the client linked to this address.  Only present for &quot;add&quot; or
              &quot;update&quot; operations, not &quot;delete&quot;.

              On &quot;add&quot; or &quot;update&quot; methods, if the script returns a failure code
              (non-zero), OpenVPN will reject the address and  will  not  modify
              its internal routing table.

              Normally,  the  cmd script will use the information provided above
              to set appropriate firewall entries on the VPN TUN/TAP  interface.
              Since  OpenVPN  provides the association between virtual IP or MAC
              address and the client&apos;s authenticated common name,  it  allows  a
              user-defined  script  to  configure  firewall access policies with
              regard to the client&apos;s high-level common name, rather than the low
              level client virtual addresses.

       --auth-user-pass-verify script method
              Require  the  client  to  provide a username/password (possibly in
              addition to a client certificate) for authentication.
&#12;              OpenVPN will execute script as a shell  command  to  validate  the
              username/password provided by the client.

              If  method  is set to &quot;via-env&quot;, OpenVPN will call script with the
              environmental variables username and password  set  to  the  user&#8208;
              name/password  strings provided by the client.  Be aware that this
              method is insecure on some platforms which make the environment of
              a process publicly visible to other unprivileged processes.

              If  method  is  set to &quot;via-file&quot;, OpenVPN will write the username
              and password to the first two lines  of  a  temporary  file.   The
              filename  will  be  passed  as an argument to script, and the file
              will be automatically deleted by OpenVPN after the script returns.
              The  location of the temporary file is controlled by the --tmp-dir
              option, and will default to the current directory if  unspecified.
              For  security,  consider  setting  --tmp-dir to a volatile storage
              medium such as  /dev/shm  (if  available)  to  prevent  the  user&#8208;
              name/password file from touching the hard drive.

              The  script  should examine the username and password, returning a
              success exit code (0) if the client&apos;s authentication request is to
              be accepted, or a failure code (1) to reject the client.

              This  directive is designed to enable a plugin-style interface for
              extending OpenVPN&apos;s authentication capabilities.

              To protect against a client passing a maliciously formed  username
              or password string, the username string must consist only of these
              characters: alphanumeric, underbar (&apos;_&apos;), dash (&apos;-&apos;),  dot  (&apos;.&apos;),
              or  at  (&apos;@&apos;).   The  password string can consist of any printable
              characters except for CR or LF.  Any illegal characters in  either
              the  username  or  password  string  will be converted to underbar
              (&apos;_&apos;).

              Care must be taken by any user-defined scripts to avoid creating a
              security  vulnerability in the way that these strings are handled.
              Never use these strings in such a way that they might  be  escaped
              or evaluated by a shell interpreter.

              For  a sample script that performs PAM authentication, see sample-
              scripts/auth-pam.pl in the OpenVPN source distribution.

       --opt-verify
              Clients that connect with options that are incompatible with those
              of the server will be disconnected.

              Options  that will be compared for compatibility include dev-type,
              link-mtu, tun-mtu, proto, tun-ipv6, ifconfig, comp-lzo,  fragment,
              keydir, cipher, auth, keysize, secret, no-replay, no-iv, tls-auth,
              key-method, tls-server, and tls-client.

              This option requires that --disable-occ NOT be used.

       --auth-user-pass-optional
              Allow connections by clients that do not specify a  username/pass&#8208;
              word.   Normally,  when  --auth-user-pass-verify  or --management-
              client-auth is specified (or an authentication plugin module), the
              OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting clients to specify a
              username and password.  This option  makes  the  submission  of  a
              username/password  by clients optional, passing the responsibility
              to the user-defined authentication module/script to accept or deny
              the  client  based  on  other factors (such as the setting of X509
              certificate fields).  When this option is used, and  a  connecting
              client  does  not  submit  a  username/password,  the user-defined
              authentication module/script will see the username and password as
              being set to empty strings (&quot;&quot;).  The authentication module/script
              MUST have logic to detect this condition and respond accordingly.

       --client-cert-not-required
              Don&apos;t require client certificate, client will  authenticate  using
              username/password  only.   Be  aware  that using this directive is
              less secure than requiring certificates from all clients.

              If you use this directive, the entire responsibility of  authenti&#8208;
              cation  will  rest on your --auth-user-pass-verify script, so keep
              in mind that bugs in your script could potentially compromise  the
              security of your VPN.

              If  you  don&apos;t use this directive, but you also specify an --auth-
              user-pass-verify script, then OpenVPN will perform double  authen&#8208;
              tication.   The  client  certificate  verification AND the --auth-
              user-pass-verify script will need to succeed in order for a client
              to be authenticated and accepted onto the VPN.

       --username-as-common-name
              For  --auth-user-pass-verify authentication, use the authenticated
              username as the common name, rather than the common name from  the
              client cert.

       --no-name-remapping
              Allow  Common  Name, X509 Subject, and username strings to include
              any printable character including  space,  but  excluding  control
              characters such as tab, newline, and carriage-return.

              By  default,  OpenVPN will remap any character other than alphanu&#8208;
              meric, underbar (&apos;_&apos;), dash (&apos;-&apos;), dot (&apos;.&apos;), and slash  (&apos;/&apos;)  to
              underbar (&apos;_&apos;).  The X509 Subject string as returned by the tls_id
              environmental variable, can additionally contain  colon  (&apos;:&apos;)  or
              equal (&apos;=&apos;).

              While  name  remapping is performed for security reasons to reduce
              the possibility of introducing string expansion security  vulnera&#8208;
              bilities  in  user-defined  authentication scripts, this option is
              provided for those cases where it  is  desirable  to  disable  the
              remapping feature.  Don&apos;t use this option unless you know what you
              are doing!

       --port-share host port
              When run in TCP server mode, share the OpenVPN port  with  another
              application, such as an HTTPS server.  If OpenVPN senses a connec&#8208;
              tion to its port which is using a non-OpenVPN  protocol,  it  will
              proxy  the  connection to the server at host:port.  Currently only
              designed to work with HTTP/HTTPS, though it would be theoretically
              possible to extend to other protocols such as ssh.

              Not implemented on Windows.

   Client Mode
       Use  client mode when connecting to an OpenVPN server which has --server,
       --server-bridge, or --mode server in it&apos;s configuration.

       --client
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of Open&#8208;
              VPN&apos;s client mode.  This directive is equivalent to:

                   pull
                   tls-client

       --pull This  option  must  be  used  on a client which is connecting to a
              multi-client server.  It  indicates  to  OpenVPN  that  it  should
              accept options pushed by the server, provided they are part of the
              legal set of pushable options (note  that  the  --pull  option  is
              implied by --client ).
&#12;              In  particular,  --pull  allows  the  server to push routes to the
              client, so you should not use --pull  or  --client  in  situations
              where you don&apos;t trust the server to have control over the client&apos;s
              routing table.

       --auth-user-pass [up]
              Authenticate with server using username/password.  up  is  a  file
              containing  username/password  on 2 lines (Note: OpenVPN will only
              read passwords from a file if it has been built with the --enable-
              password-save   configure   option,  or  on  Windows  by  defining
              ENABLE_PASSWORD_SAVE in win/settings.in).

              If up is omitted, username/password will be prompted from the con&#8208;
              sole.

              The  server  configuration must specify an --auth-user-pass-verify
              script to verify the username/password provided by the client.

       --auth-retry type
              Controls how OpenVPN responds  to  username/password  verification
              errors  such as the client-side response to an AUTH_FAILED message
              from the server or verification failure of the private  key  pass&#8208;
              word.

              Normally  used  to  prevent  auth  errors  from being fatal on the
              client side, and to permit username/password requeries in case  of
              error.

              An  AUTH_FAILED  message  is generated by the server if the client
              fails  --auth-user-pass  authentication,  or  if  the  server-side
              --client-connect  script  returns  an error status when the client
              tries to connect.

              type can be one of:

              none -- Client will exit with a fatal error (this is the default).
              nointeract -- Client will retry the connection without  requerying
              for  an  --auth-user-pass  username/password.  Use this option for
              unattended clients.
              interact -- Client will  requery  for  an  --auth-user-pass  user&#8208;
              name/password  and/or  private  key  password  before attempting a
              reconnection.

              Note that while this option cannot be pushed, it can be controlled
              from the management interface.

       --server-poll-timeout n
              when  polling  possible  remote  servers to connect to in a round-
              robin fashion, spend no more than n seconds waiting for a response
              before trying the next server.

       --explicit-exit-notify [n]
              In  UDP  client  mode  or point-to-point mode, send server/peer an
              exit notification if tunnel is restarted  or  OpenVPN  process  is
              exited.   In  client  mode, on exit/restart, this option will tell
              the server to immediately close its client instance object  rather
              than  waiting for a timeout.  The n parameter (default=1) controls
              the maximum number of attempts that the client will try to  resend
              the  exit  notification  message.   OpenVPN will not send any exit
              notifications unless this option is enabled.

   Data Channel Encryption Options:
       These options are meaningful for both Static &amp; TLS-negotiated  key  modes
       (must be compatible between peers).

       --secret file [direction]
              Enable  Static  Key  encryption  mode  (non-TLS).   Use pre-shared
              secret file which was generated with --genkey.

              The optional direction parameter enables the  use  of  4  distinct
              keys (HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so
              that each data flow direction has a  different  set  of  HMAC  and
              cipher  keys.   This has a number of desirable security properties
              including eliminating certain kinds  of  DoS  and  message  replay
              attacks.

              When  the direction parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirec&#8208;
              tionally, one for HMAC and the other for encryption/decryption.

              The direction parameter should always be complementary  on  either
              side of the connection, i.e. one side should use &quot;0&quot; and the other
              should use &quot;1&quot;, or both sides should omit it altogether.

              The direction parameter requires that file  contains  a  2048  bit
              key.   While  pre-1.5  versions  of  OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key
              files, any version of OpenVPN which supports the direction parame&#8208;
              ter,  will  also  support  2048  bit key file generation using the
              --genkey option.

              Static key encryption mode has  certain  advantages,  the  primary
              being ease of configuration.

              There  are  no  certificates or certificate authorities or compli&#8208;
              cated negotiation handshakes and protocols.  The only  requirement
              is  that  you  have  a  pre-existing secure channel with your peer
              (such as ssh ) to initially copy the key.  This requirement, along
              with the fact that your key never changes unless you manually gen&#8208;
              erate a new one, makes it somewhat less secure than TLS mode  (see
              below).  If an attacker manages to steal your key, everything that
              was ever encrypted with it is compromised.  Contrast that  to  the
              perfect forward secrecy features of TLS mode (using Diffie Hellman
              key exchange), where even if an attacker was able  to  steal  your
              private key, he would gain no information to help him decrypt past
              sessions.

              Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is  that
              it  is a handshake-free protocol without any distinguishing signa&#8208;
              ture or feature (such as a header or protocol handshake  sequence)
              that would mark the ciphertext packets as being generated by Open&#8208;
              VPN.  Anyone eavesdropping on the wire would see nothing but  ran&#8208;
              dom-looking data.

       --auth alg
              Authenticate packets with HMAC using message digest algorithm alg.
              (The default is SHA1 ).  HMAC is a commonly used message authenti&#8208;
              cation  algorithm  (MAC)  that  uses  a data string, a secure hash
              algorithm, and a key, to produce a digital signature.

              OpenVPN&apos;s usage of HMAC is to first encrypt a  packet,  then  HMAC
              the resulting ciphertext.

              In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key
              file generated by --genkey.  In TLS mode, the HMAC key is  dynami&#8208;
              cally generated and shared between peers via the TLS control chan&#8208;
              nel.  If OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC  it  will  drop
              the  packet.   HMAC  usually  adds 16 or 20 bytes per packet.  Set
              alg=none to disable authentication.

              For       more        information        on        HMAC        see
              http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html

       --cipher alg
              Encrypt packets with cipher algorithm alg.  The default is BF-CBC,
              an abbreviation for Blowfish in Cipher Block Chaining mode.  Blow&#8208;
              fish  has  the advantages of being fast, very secure, and allowing
              key sizes of up to 448 bits.  Blowfish is designed to be  used  in
              situations where keys are changed infrequently.

              For   more   information   on  blowfish,  see  http://www.counter&#8208;
              pane.com/blowfish.html

              To see other ciphers that are  available  with  OpenVPN,  use  the
              --show-ciphers option.

              OpenVPN  supports  the CBC, CFB, and OFB cipher modes, however CBC
              is recommended and CFB  and  OFB  should  be  considered  advanced
              modes.

              Set alg=none to disable encryption.

       --keysize n
              Size  of  cipher key in bits (optional).  If unspecified, defaults
              to cipher-specific default.  The --show-ciphers option (see below)
              shows  all available OpenSSL ciphers, their default key sizes, and
              whether the key size can be  changed.   Use  care  in  changing  a
              cipher&apos;s default key size.  Many ciphers have not been extensively
              cryptanalyzed with non-standard key lengths, and a larger key  may
              offer  no  real  guarantee of greater security, or may even reduce
              security.

       --prng alg [nsl]
              (Advanced) For PRNG (Pseudo-random number generator),  use  digest
              algorithm alg (default=sha1), and set nsl (default=16) to the size
              in bytes of the nonce secret length (between 16 and 64).

              Set alg=none to disable the PRNG and use  the  OpenSSL  RAND_bytes
              function instead for all of OpenVPN&apos;s pseudo-random number needs.

       --engine [engine-name]
              Enable OpenSSL hardware-based crypto engine functionality.

              If  engine-name  is  specified, use a specific crypto engine.  Use
              the --show-engines standalone option to list  the  crypto  engines
              which are supported by OpenSSL.

       --no-replay
              (Advanced)  Disable  OpenVPN&apos;s  protection against replay attacks.
              Don&apos;t use this option unless you are prepared to make  a  tradeoff
              of greater efficiency in exchange for less security.

              OpenVPN provides datagram replay protection by default.

              Replay  protection  is accomplished by tagging each outgoing data&#8208;
              gram with an identifier that is guaranteed to be  unique  for  the
              key  being  used.   The peer that receives the datagram will check
              for the uniqueness of  the  identifier.   If  the  identifier  was
              already  received  in  a  previous datagram, OpenVPN will drop the
              packet.  Replay protection is important to defeat attacks such  as
              a SYN flood attack, where the attacker listens in the wire, inter&#8208;
              cepts a TCP SYN packet (identifying it by the context in which  it
              occurs  in  relation  to other packets), then floods the receiving
              peer with copies of this packet.

              OpenVPN&apos;s replay protection is implemented in  slightly  different
              ways, depending on the key management mode you have selected.

              In  Static Key mode or when using an CFB or OFB mode cipher, Open&#8208;
              VPN uses a 64 bit unique identifier that  combines  a  time  stamp
              with an incrementing sequence number.

              When  using TLS mode for key exchange and a CBC cipher mode, Open&#8208;
              VPN uses only a 32 bit sequence number without a time stamp, since
              OpenVPN  can  guarantee the uniqueness of this value for each key.
              As in IPSec, if the sequence number is close to wrapping  back  to
              zero, OpenVPN will trigger a new key exchange.

              To  check  for  replays, OpenVPN uses the sliding window algorithm
              used by IPSec.

       --replay-window n [t]
              Use a replay protection sliding-window of size n and a time window
              of t seconds.

              By default n is 64 (the IPSec default) and t is 15 seconds.

              This  option  is  only  relevant  in  UDP  mode, i.e.  when either
              --proto udp is specified, or no --proto option is specified.

              When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility
              that  packets might be dropped or delivered out of order.  Because
              OpenVPN, like IPSec, is emulating the physical network  layer,  it
              will accept an out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such
              packets in the same order they were received to the TCP/IP  proto&#8208;
              col stack, provided they satisfy several constraints.

              (a)  The  packet  cannot be a replay (unless --no-replay is speci&#8208;
              fied, which disables replay protection altogether).

              (b) If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted  if
              the  difference  between  its  sequence  number  and  the  highest
              sequence number received so far is less than n.

              (c) If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted  if
              it  arrives  no later than t seconds after any packet containing a
              higher sequence number.

              If you are using a network link with  a  large  pipeline  (meaning
              that  the  product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want
              to use a larger value for n.  Satellite links in particular  often
              require this.

              If  you run OpenVPN at --verb 4, you will see the message &quot;Replay-
              window backtrack occurred [x]&quot; every  time  the  maximum  sequence
              number  backtrack  seen  thus  far increases.  This can be used to
              calibrate n.

              There is some controversy on the appropriate  method  of  handling
              packet reordering at the security layer.

              Namely,  to  what  extent  should  the  security layer protect the
              encapsulated protocol from attacks which masquerade as  the  kinds
              of normal packet loss and reordering that occur over IP networks?

              The  IPSec  and  OpenVPN  approach  is  to allow packet reordering
              within a certain fixed sequence number window.

              OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting  the  window  size  in
              time as well as sequence space.

              OpenVPN  also  adds  TCP  transport  as  an option (not offered by
              IPSec) in which case OpenVPN can  adopt  a  very  strict  attitude
              towards  message  deletion and reordering:  Don&apos;t allow it.  Since
              TCP guarantees reliability, any packet loss  or  reordering  event
              can be assumed to be an attack.

              In  this  sense,  it  could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is
              preferred when tunneling non-IP or UDP application protocols which
              might  be  vulnerable  to  a message deletion or reordering attack
              which falls within the normal operational parameters  of  IP  net&#8208;
              works.

              So  I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-
              IP protocol or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the  protocol
              might  be  vulnerable  to  a message deletion or reordering attack
              that falls within the normal operating parameters of what is to be
              expected  from the physical IP layer.  The problem is easily fixed
              by simply using TCP as the VPN transport layer.

       --mute-replay-warnings
              Silence the output of replay warnings, which are  a  common  false
              alarm on WiFi networks.  This option preserves the security of the
              replay protection code without the verbosity associated with warn&#8208;
              ings about duplicate packets.

       --replay-persist file
              Persist replay-protection state across sessions using file to save
              and reload the state.

              This option will strengthen  protection  against  replay  attacks,
              especially  when  you are using OpenVPN in a dynamic context (such
              as with --inetd) when OpenVPN sessions are frequently started  and
              stopped.

              This option will keep a disk copy of the current replay protection
              state (i.e. the most recent packet timestamp and  sequence  number
              received  from  the remote peer), so that if an OpenVPN session is
              stopped and restarted, it will reject any replays of packets which
              were already received by the prior session.

              This  option  only  makes  sense when replay protection is enabled
              (the default) and you are using either --secret (shared-secret key
              mode) or TLS mode with --tls-auth.

       --no-iv
              (Advanced) Disable OpenVPN&apos;s use of IV (cipher initialization vec&#8208;
              tor).  Don&apos;t use this option unless you are  prepared  to  make  a
              tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange for less security.

              OpenVPN  uses  an  IV  by default, and requires it for CFB and OFB
              cipher modes (which are totally insecure without it).  Using an IV
              is  important  for  security  when  multiple  messages  are  being
              encrypted/decrypted with the same key.

              IV is implemented differently depending on the cipher mode used.

              In CBC mode, OpenVPN uses a pseudo-random IV for each packet.

              In CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a unique sequence  number  and  time
              stamp  as  the IV.  In fact, in CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a data&#8208;
              gram space-saving optimization that uses the unique identifier for
              datagram replay protection as the IV.

       --test-crypto
              Do  a  self-test  of  OpenVPN&apos;s  crypto  options by encrypting and
              decrypting test packets using the data channel encryption  options
              specified above.  This option does not require a peer to function,
              and therefore can be specified without --dev or --remote.

              The typical usage of --test-crypto would be something like this:

              openvpn --test-crypto --secret key

              or

              openvpn --test-crypto --secret key --verb 9

              This option is very useful to  test  OpenVPN  after  it  has  been
              ported  to a new platform, or to isolate problems in the compiler,
              OpenSSL crypto library, or OpenVPN&apos;s crypto code.  Since it  is  a
              self-test mode, problems with encryption and authentication can be
              debugged independently of network and tunnel issues.

   TLS Mode Options:
       TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and
       flexibility.   TLS  mode  works by establishing control and data channels
       which are multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port.   OpenVPN  initiates  a
       TLS  session  over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher and
       HMAC keys to protect the data channel.  TLS mode uses a robust  reliabil&#8208;
       ity  layer over the UDP connection for all control channel communication,
       while the data channel, over which encrypted tunnel data passes, is  for&#8208;
       warded  without  any mediation.  The result is the best of both worlds: a
       fast data channel that forwards  over  UDP  with  only  the  overhead  of
       encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a control channel that provides
       all of the security features of TLS, including certificate-based  authen&#8208;
       tication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.

       To  use  TLS  mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local
       certificate/key pair ( --cert and --key ), signed by the root certificate
       which is specified in --ca.

       When  two  OpenVPN  peers connect, each presents its local certificate to
       the other.  Each peer will then check that its partner peer  presented  a
       certificate  which was signed by the master root certificate as specified
       in --ca.

       If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will  suc&#8208;
       ceed,  both  OpenVPN  peers will exchange temporary session keys, and the
       tunnel will begin passing data.

       The OpenVPN distribution contains a set of scripts for managing RSA  cer&#8208;
       tificates &amp; keys, located in the easy-rsa subdirectory.

       The  easy-rsa  package  is  also  rendered in web form here: http://open&#8208;
       vpn.net/easyrsa.html

       --tls-server
              Enable TLS and assume server role during TLS handshake.  Note that
              OpenVPN  is  designed as a peer-to-peer application.  The designa&#8208;
              tion of client or server is only for the  purpose  of  negotiating
              the TLS control channel.

       --tls-client
              Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake.

       --ca file
              Certificate  authority  (CA) file in .pem format, also referred to
              as the root certificate.  This file can have multiple certificates
              in .pem format, concatenated together.  You can construct your own
              certificate authority certificate and private key by using a  com&#8208;
              mand such as:

              openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt

              Then  edit your openssl.cnf file and edit the certificate variable
              to point to your new root certificate ca.crt.

              For testing purposes only, the  OpenVPN  distribution  includes  a
              sample  CA  certificate  (ca.crt).  Of course you should never use
              the test certificates and test keys distributed with OpenVPN in  a
              production  environment, since by virtue of the fact that they are
              distributed with OpenVPN, they are totally insecure.

       --capath dir
              Directory containing trusted certificates (CAs and CRLs).   Avail&#8208;
              able with OpenSSL version &gt;= 0.9.7 dev.

       --dh file
              File containing Diffie Hellman parameters in .pem format (required
              for --tls-server only). Use

              openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem 1024

              to generate your own, or use the existing dh1024.pem file included
              with  the  OpenVPN distribution.  Diffie Hellman parameters may be
              considered public.

       --cert file
              Local peer&apos;s signed certificate in .pem format -- must  be  signed
              by  a  certificate  authority  whose  certificate is in --ca file.
              Each peer in an OpenVPN link running in TLS mode should  have  its
              own  certificate and private key file.  In addition, each certifi&#8208;
              cate should have been signed by the key of a certificate authority
              whose  public  key resides in the --ca certificate authority file.
              You can easily make your own certificate authority (see above)  or
              pay money to use a commercial service such as thawte.com (in which
              case you will be helping  to  finance  the  world&apos;s  second  space
              tourist :).  To generate a certificate, you can use a command such
              as:

              openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr

              If  your  certificate  authority  private  key  lives  on  another
              machine, copy the certificate signing request (mycert.csr) to this
              other machine (this can be done over an insecure channel  such  as
              email).  Now sign the certificate with a command such as:

              openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr

              Now  copy the certificate (mycert.crt) back to the peer which ini&#8208;
              tially generated the .csr file (this can be over a public medium).
              Note  that  the  openssl ca command reads the location of the cer&#8208;
              tificate  authority  key  from  its  configuration  file  such  as
              /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf  --  note  also  that  for  certificate
              authority functions, you must set up the files index.txt  (may  be
              empty) and serial (initialize to 01 ).

       --key file
              Local  peer&apos;s  private  key  in  .pem format.  Use the private key
              which was generated when you built your  peer&apos;s  certificate  (see
              -cert file above).

       --pkcs12 file
              Specify  a  PKCS #12 file containing local private key, local cer&#8208;
              tificate, and root  CA  certificate.   This  option  can  be  used
              instead of --ca, --cert, and --key.

       --pkcs11-cert-private [0|1]...
              Set  if  access  to  certificate  object should be performed after
              login.  Every provider has its own setting.

       --pkcs11-id name
              Specify the serialized certificate id to be used. The  id  can  be
              gotten by the standalone --show-pkcs11-ids option.

       --pkcs11-id-management
              Acquire PKCS#11 id from management interface. In this case a NEED-
              STR  &apos;pkcs11-id-request&apos;  real-time  message  will  be  triggered,
              application  may use pkcs11-id-count command to retrieve available
              number of certificates, and pkcs11-id-get command to retrieve cer&#8208;
              tificate id and certificate body.

       --pkcs11-pin-cache seconds
              Specify  how  many  seconds  the PIN can be cached, the default is
              until the token is removed.

       --pkcs11-protected-authentication [0|1]...
              Use PKCS#11 protected authentication path,  useful  for  biometric
              and external keypad devices.  Every provider has its own setting.

       --pkcs11-providers provider...
              Specify a RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface
              (Cryptoki) providers to load.  This option can be used instead  of
              --cert, --key, and --pkcs12.

       --pkcs11-private-mode mode...
              Specify which method to use in order to perform private key opera&#8208;
              tions.  A different mode can be specified for each provider.  Mode
              is encoded as hex number, and can be a mask one of the following:

              0 (default) -- Try to determind automatically.
              1 -- Use sign.
              2 -- Use sign recover.
              4 -- Use decrypt.
              8 -- Use unwrap.

       --cryptoapicert select-string
              Load  the certificate and private key from the Windows Certificate
              System Store (Windows Only).

              Use this option instead of --cert and --key.

              This makes it possible to use any smart card,  supported  by  Win&#8208;
              dows,  but  also  any  kind  of  certificate, residing in the Cert
              Store, where you have access to the private key.  This option  has
              been  tested  with  a  couple  of  different smart cards (GemSAFE,
              Cryptoflex, and Swedish Post Office eID) on the client  side,  and
              also an imported PKCS12 software certificate on the server side.

              To  select  a certificate, based on a substring search in the cer&#8208;
              tificate&apos;s subject:

              cryptoapicert &quot;SUBJ:Peter Runestig&quot;

              To select a certificate, based on certificate&apos;s thumbprint:

              cryptoapicert &quot;THUMB:f6 49 24 41 01 b4 ...&quot;

              The thumbprint hex string can easily be copy-and-pasted  from  the
              Windows Certificate Store GUI.


       --key-method m
              Use  data  channel  key negotiation method m.  The key method must
              match on both sides of the connection.

              After OpenVPN negotiates a TLS session, a new set of keys for pro&#8208;
              tecting  the  tunnel  data channel is generated and exchanged over
              the TLS session.

              In method 1 (the default for OpenVPN  1.x),  both  sides  generate
              random encrypt and HMAC-send keys which are forwarded to the other
              host over the TLS channel.

              In method 2, (the default for OpenVPN 2.0) the client generates  a
              random key.  Both client and server also generate some random seed
              material.  All key source material is exchanged over the TLS chan&#8208;
              nel.  The  actual  keys  are generated using the TLS PRF function,
              taking source entropy from both client and server.   Method  2  is
              designed  to  closely  parallel the key generation process used by
              TLS 1.0.

              Note that in TLS mode, two separate levels of keying occur:

              (1) The TLS connection is initially negotiated, with both sides of
              the  connection  producing certificates and verifying the certifi&#8208;
              cate (or other authentication info provided) of  the  other  side.
              The --key-method parameter has no effect on this process.

              (2)  After  the  TLS connection is established, the tunnel session
              keys are separately negotiated over the existing secure TLS  chan&#8208;
              nel.   Here,  --key-method determines the derivation of the tunnel
              session keys.

       --tls-cipher l
              A list l of allowable TLS ciphers delimited by a colon (&quot;:&quot;).   If
              you  require  a  high  level of security, you may want to set this
              parameter manually, to prevent a version rollback attack  where  a
              man-in-the-middle  attacker  tries to force two peers to negotiate
              to the lowest level of security they both support.  Use --show-tls
              to see a list of supported TLS ciphers.

       --tls-timeout n
              Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel if no acknowledg&#8208;
              ment from remote within n seconds (default=2).  When OpenVPN sends
              a  control  packet  to  its  peer,  it  will  expect to receive an
              acknowledgement within n seconds or it will retransmit the packet,
              subject to a TCP-like exponential backoff algorithm.  This parame&#8208;
              ter only applies to control channel packets.  Data channel packets
              (which  carry  encrypted  tunnel  data)  are  never  acknowledged,
              sequenced, or retransmitted by OpenVPN because  the  higher  level
              network  protocols running on top of the tunnel such as TCP expect
              this role to be left to them.

       --reneg-bytes n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n bytes sent or received  (dis&#8208;
              abled  by  default).   OpenVPN  allows the lifetime of a key to be
              expressed as a number of bytes encrypted/decrypted,  a  number  of
              packets,  or  a  number  of  seconds.  A key renegotiation will be
              forced if any of these three criteria are met by either peer.

       --reneg-pkts n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n  packets  sent  and  received
              (disabled by default).

       --reneg-sec n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n seconds (default=3600).

              When  using  dual-factor  authentication,  note  that this default
              value may cause the end user to be challenged to reauthorize  once
              per hour.

              Also, keep in mind that this option can be used on both the client
              and server, and whichever uses the lower value will be the one  to
              trigger the renegotiation.  A common mistake is to set --reneg-sec
              to a higher value on either the client or server, while the  other
              side  of  the  connection is still using the default value of 3600
              seconds, meaning that the renegotiation will still occur once  per
              3600 seconds.  The solution is to increase --reneg-sec on both the
              client and server, or set it to 0 on one side  of  the  connection
              (to disable), and to your chosen value on the other side.

       --hand-window n
              Handshake  Window  --  the  TLS-based  key  exchange must finalize
              within n seconds of handshake initiation by any peer (default = 60
              seconds).   If  the  handshake  fails we will attempt to reset our
              connection with our peer and try again.   Even  in  the  event  of
              handshake  failure  we  will  still use our expiring key for up to
              --tran-window seconds to maintain continuity  of  transmission  of
              tunnel data.

       --tran-window n
              Transition  window -- our old key can live this many seconds after
              a new a key renegotiation begins (default = 3600  seconds).   This
              feature  allows for a graceful transition from old to new key, and
              removes the key renegotiation sequence from the critical  path  of
              tunnel data forwarding.

       --single-session
              After initially connecting to a remote peer, disallow any new con&#8208;
              nections.  Using this option means that a remote peer cannot  con&#8208;
              nect, disconnect, and then reconnect.

              If  the  daemon  is  reset  by a signal or --ping-restart, it will
              allow one new connection.

              --single-session can be used with  --ping-exit  or  --inactive  to
              create a single dynamic session that will exit when finished.

       --tls-exit
              Exit on TLS negotiation failure.

       --tls-auth file [direction]
              Add  an  additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS
              control channel to protect against DoS attacks.

              In a nutshell, --tls-auth enables a kind  of  &quot;HMAC  firewall&quot;  on
              OpenVPN&apos;s  TCP/UDP port, where TLS control channel packets bearing
              an incorrect HMAC signature can  be  dropped  immediately  without
              response.

              file (required) is a key file which can be in one of two formats:

              (1)  An OpenVPN static key file generated by --genkey (required if
              direction parameter is used).

              (2) A freeform passphrase file.  In this case the HMAC key will be
              derived  by  taking  a  secure  hash  of this file, similar to the
              md5sum(1) or sha1sum(1) commands.

              OpenVPN will first try format (1), and if the file fails to  parse
              as a static key file, format (2) will be used.

              See  the  --secret  option  for  more  information on the optional
              direction parameter.

              --tls-auth is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in  a  mode
              where  it  is  listening  for packets from any IP address, such as
              when --remote is not specified,  or  --remote  is  specified  with
              --float.

              The  rationale  for  this  feature  is as follows.  TLS requires a
              multi-packet exchange before it is able to  authenticate  a  peer.
              During  this  time  before  authentication,  OpenVPN is allocating
              resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer.  The  potential
              peer  is  also  exposing  many  parts  of  OpenVPN and the OpenSSL
              library to the packets it is  sending.   Most  successful  network
              attacks  today  seek  to  either exploit bugs in programs (such as
              buffer overflow attacks) or force a program  to  consume  so  many
              resources  that  it becomes unusable.  Of course the first line of
              defense is always to produce clean,  well-audited  code.   OpenVPN
              has  been  written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top
              priority.  But as history has shown, many of the most widely  used
              network  applications  have,  from  time to time, fallen to buffer
              overflow attacks.

              So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special  layer
              of  authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every
              packet on the control channel is authenticated by an  HMAC  signa&#8208;
              ture  and  a unique ID for replay protection.  This signature will
              also help protect against DoS (Denial  of  Service)  attacks.   An
              important  rule  of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks
              is to minimize the amount of resources a  potential,  but  as  yet
              unauthenticated, client is able to consume.

              --tls-auth  does  this by signing every TLS control channel packet
              with an HMAC signature, including packets which  are  sent  before
              the  TLS  level  has  had  a chance to authenticate the peer.  The
              result is that  packets  without  the  correct  signature  can  be
              dropped  immediately  upon reception, before they have a chance to
              consume additional system resources such as by  initiating  a  TLS
              handshake.  --tls-auth can be strengthened by adding the --replay-
              persist option which will keep OpenVPN&apos;s replay  protection  state
              in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.

              It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the
              passphrase/key file used with --tls-auth gives a peer nothing more
              than  the  power  to  initiate a TLS handshake.  It is not used to
              encrypt or authenticate any tunnel data.

       --askpass [file]
              Get certificate password from console or file before we daemonize.

              For the extremely security conscious, it is  possible  to  protect
              your private key with a password.  Of course this means that every
              time the OpenVPN daemon is started you must be there to  type  the
              password.   The  --askpass option allows you to start OpenVPN from
              the command line.  It will query you for a password before it dae&#8208;
              monizes.  To protect a private key with a password you should omit
              the -nodes option when you use the openssl command  line  tool  to
              manage certificates and private keys.

              If  file  is  specified,  read the password from the first line of
              file.  Keep in mind that storing your password in a file to a cer&#8208;
              tain  extent  invalidates  the extra security provided by using an
              encrypted key (Note: OpenVPN will only read passwords from a  file
              if  it  has  been  built with the --enable-password-save configure
              option, or on Windows by defining ENABLE_PASSWORD_SAVE in win/set&#8208;
              tings.in).

       --auth-nocache
              Don&apos;t  cache  --askpass  or --auth-user-pass username/passwords in
              virtual memory.

              If specified, this directive will  cause  OpenVPN  to  immediately
              forget username/password inputs after they are used.  As a result,
              when OpenVPN needs a username/password, it will prompt  for  input
              from  stdin, which may be multiple times during the duration of an
              OpenVPN session.

              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.
              It is always cached.

       --tls-verify cmd
              Execute shell command cmd to verify the X509 name of a pending TLS
              connection that has otherwise passed all other tests of certifica&#8208;
              tion  (except for revocation via --crl-verify directive; the revo&#8208;
              cation test occurs after the --tls-verify test).

              cmd should return 0 to allow the TLS handshake to proceed, or 1 to
              fail.

              Note  that  cmd  is a command line and as such may (if enclosed in
              quotes) contain whitespace separated arguments.  The first word of
              cmd  is  the  shell command to execute and the remaining words are
              its arguments.  When cmd is executed two arguments  are  appended,
              as follows:

              cmd certificate_depth X509_NAME_oneline

              These  arguments  are, respectively, the current certificate depth
              and the X509 common name (cn) of the peer.

              This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust  has  a  cer&#8208;
              tificate  which  was  signed  by  a certificate authority who also
              signed many other certificates, where you don&apos;t  necessarily  want
              to  trust  all  of  them, but rather be selective about which peer
              certificate you will accept.  This feature allows you to  write  a
              script  which  will test the X509 name on a certificate and decide
              whether or not it should be accepted.  For a  simple  perl  script
              which  will test the common name field on the certificate, see the
              file verify-cn in the OpenVPN distribution.

              See the &quot;Environmental Variables&quot;  section  below  for  additional
              parameters passed as environmental variables.

       --tls-export-cert directory
              Store  the  certificates  the clients uses upon connection to this
              directory. This will be done before --tls-verify is  called.   The
              certificates  will  use  a temporary name and will be deleted when
              the tls-verify script returns.  The file name used  for  the  cer&#8208;
              tificate is available via the peer_cert environment variable.

       --x509-username-field fieldname
              Field   in  x509  certificate  subject  to  be  used  as  username
              (default=CN).  Fieldname will be uppercased before matching.  When
              this  option  is  used, the --tls-remote option will match against
              the chosen fieldname instead of the CN.

       --tls-remote name
              Accept connections only from a host with X509 name or common  name
              equal  to name.  The remote host must also pass all other tests of
              verification.

              NOTE: Because tls-remote may test against a  common  name  prefix,
              only  use  this option when you are using OpenVPN with a custom CA
              certificate that is under your control.   Never  use  this  option
              when your client certificates are signed by a third party, such as
              a commercial web CA.

              Name can also be a common name prefix, for example if you  want  a
              client to only accept connections to &quot;Server-1&quot;, &quot;Server-2&quot;, etc.,
              you can simply use --tls-remote Server

              Using a common name prefix is a useful alternative to  managing  a
              CRL  (Certificate  Revocation List) on the client, since it allows
              the client to refuse all certificates except for those  associated
              with designated servers.

              --tls-remote  is  a useful replacement for the --tls-verify option
              to verify  the  remote  host,  because  --tls-remote  works  in  a
              --chroot environment too.

       --ns-cert-type client|server
              Require  that peer certificate was signed with an explicit nsCert&#8208;
              Type designation of &quot;client&quot; or &quot;server&quot;.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure  that  the
              host they connect with is a designated server.

              See  the easy-rsa/build-key-server script for an example of how to
              generate a certificate with the nsCertType field set to &quot;server&quot;.

              If the server certificate&apos;s nsCertType field is set  to  &quot;server&quot;,
              then the clients can verify this with --ns-cert-type server.

              This is an important security precaution to protect against a man-
              in-the-middle attack where an authorized client attempts  to  con&#8208;
              nect to another client by impersonating the server.  The attack is
              easily prevented by having clients verify the  server  certificate
              using any one of --ns-cert-type, --tls-remote, or --tls-verify.

       --remote-cert-ku v...
              Require  that  peer  certificate  was  signed with an explicit key
              usage.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure  that  the
              host they connect to is a designated server.

              The  key  usage  should be encoded in hex, more than one key usage
              can be specified.

       --remote-cert-eku oid
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit extended
              key usage.

              This  is  a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the
              host they connect to is a designated server.

              The extended key usage should  be  encoded  in  oid  notation,  or
              OpenSSL symbolic representation.

       --remote-cert-tls client|server
              Require  that  peer  certificate  was  signed with an explicit key
              usage and extended key usage based on RFC3280 TLS rules.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure  that  the
              host they connect to is a designated server.

              The  --remote-cert-tls  client  option  is equivalent to --remote-
              cert-ku 80 08 88 --remote-cert-eku &quot;TLS Web Client Authentication&quot;

              The key usage is digitalSignature and/or keyAgreement.

              The --remote-cert-tls server option  is  equivalent  to  --remote-
              cert-ku a0 88 --remote-cert-eku &quot;TLS Web Server Authentication&quot;

              The  key  usage is digitalSignature and ( keyEncipherment or keyA&#8208;
              greement ).

              This is an important security precaution to protect against a man-
              in-the-middle  attack  where an authorized client attempts to con&#8208;
              nect to another client by impersonating the server.  The attack is
              easily  prevented  by having clients verify the server certificate
              using any one of --remote-cert-tls, --tls-remote, or --tls-verify.

       --crl-verify crl
              Check peer certificate against the file crl in PEM format.

              A CRL (certificate revocation list) is used when a particular  key
              is compromised but when the overall PKI is still intact.

              Suppose  you had a PKI consisting of a CA, root certificate, and a
              number of client certificates.  Suppose a laptop computer contain&#8208;
              ing a client key and certificate was stolen.  By adding the stolen
              certificate to the CRL file, you could reject any connection which
              attempts  to use it, while preserving the overall integrity of the
              PKI.

              The only time when it would be necessary to rebuild the entire PKI
              from  scratch would be if the root certificate key itself was com&#8208;
              promised.

   TUN/TAP persistent tunnel config mode:
       Available with linux 2.4.7+.  These options comprise a standalone mode of
       OpenVPN which can be used to create and delete persistent tunnels.

       --mktun
              (Standalone) Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which support
              them  such  as Linux.  Normally TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the
              period of time that an application has  them  open.   This  option
              takes  advantage  of the TUN/TAP driver&apos;s ability to build persis&#8208;
              tent tunnels that live through multiple instantiations of  OpenVPN
              and die only when they are deleted or the machine is rebooted.

              One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate
              the need for separate --up and --down scripts to run the appropri&#8208;
              ate  ifconfig(8)  and  route(8)  commands.   These commands can be
              placed in the the same shell script which starts or terminates  an
              OpenVPN session.

              Another  advantage  is  that open connections through the TUN/TAP-
              based tunnel will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts.  This
              can  be  useful  to provide uninterrupted connectivity through the
              tunnel in the event of a  DHCP  reset  of  the  peer&apos;s  public  IP
              address (see the --ipchange option above).

              One  disadvantage  of  persistent  tunnels is that it is harder to
              automatically configure their MTU value (see --link-mtu and --tun-
              mtu above).

              On  some  platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persis&#8208;
              tent by default.

       --rmtun
              (Standalone) Remove a persistent tunnel.

       --dev tunX | tapX
              TUN/TAP device

       --user user
              Optional user to be owner of this tunnel.

       --group group
              Optional group to be owner of this tunnel.

   Windows-Specific Options:
       --win-sys path|&apos;env&apos;
              Set the Windows system directory pathname to use when looking  for
              system  executables  such as route.exe and netsh.exe.  By default,
              if this directive is not specified, the pathname will  be  set  to
              &quot;C:\WINDOWS&quot;

              The  special  string  &apos;env&apos;  indicates that the pathname should be
              read from the SystemRoot environmental variable.
&#12;       --ip-win32 method
              When using --ifconfig on Windows, set  the  TAP-Win32  adapter  IP
              address  and  netmask  using method.  Don&apos;t use this option unless
              you are also using --ifconfig.

              manual -- Don&apos;t set  the  IP  address  or  netmask  automatically.
              Instead  output  a message to the console telling the user to con&#8208;
              figure the adapter manually and indicating  the  IP/netmask  which
              OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.

              dynamic  [offset] [lease-time] -- Automatically set the IP address
              and netmask by replying to DHCP query messages  generated  by  the
              kernel.  This mode is probably the &quot;cleanest&quot; solution for setting
              the TCP/IP properties since it uses the well-known DHCP  protocol.
              There are, however, two prerequisites for using this mode: (1) The
              TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to &quot;Obtain
              an IP address automatically,&quot; and (2) OpenVPN needs to claim an IP
              address in the subnet for use as the virtual DHCP server  address.
              By  default  in  --dev  tap  mode,  OpenVPN will take the normally
              unused first address in the subnet.  For example, if  your  subnet
              is  192.168.4.0  netmask 255.255.255.0, then OpenVPN will take the
              IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the virtual DHCP server  address.
              In  --dev tun mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to masquer&#8208;
              ade as if it were coming from the remote endpoint.   The  optional
              offset parameter is an integer which is &gt; -256 and &lt; 256 and which
              defaults to 0.  If offset is positive, the DHCP server  will  mas&#8208;
              querade  as the IP address at network address + offset.  If offset
              is negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address  at
              broadcast address + offset.  The Windows ipconfig /all command can
              be used to show what Windows thinks the DHCP  server  address  is.
              OpenVPN  will  &quot;claim&quot;  this  address,  so make sure to use a free
              address.  Having  said  that,  different  OpenVPN  instantiations,
              including  different  ends  of  the same connection, can share the
              same virtual DHCP server address.  The lease-time  parameter  con&#8208;
              trols the lease time of the DHCP assignment given to the TAP-Win32
              adapter, and is denoted in seconds.  Normally a  very  long  lease
              time  is  preferred  because it prevents routes involving the TAP-
              Win32 adapter from being lost when the system goes to sleep.   The
              default lease time is one year.

              netsh  --  Automatically  set the IP address and netmask using the
              Windows command-line &quot;netsh&quot; command.  This method appears to work
              correctly on Windows XP but not Windows 2000.

              ipapi  --  Automatically  set the IP address and netmask using the
              Windows IP Helper API.  This approach does not have  ideal  seman&#8208;
              tics, though testing has indicated that it works okay in practice.
              If you use this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP  properties
              for  the TAP-Win32 adapter in their default state, i.e. &quot;Obtain an
              IP address automatically.&quot;

              adaptive -- (Default) Try dynamic method initially and  fail  over
              to  netsh  if the DHCP negotiation with the TAP-Win32 adapter does
              not succeed in 20 seconds.  Such failures have been known to occur
              when certain third-party firewall packages installed on the client
              machine block the DHCP negotiation used by the TAP-Win32  adapter.
              Note  that  if  the  netsh  failover occurs, the TAP-Win32 adapter
              TCP/IP properties will be reset from DHCP to static, and this will
              cause future OpenVPN startups using the adaptive mode to use netsh
              immediately, rather than trying dynamic first.  To  &quot;unstick&quot;  the
              adaptive  mode  from  using netsh, run OpenVPN at least once using
              the dynamic mode to restore the TAP-Win32 adapter  TCP/IP  proper&#8208;
              ties to a DHCP configuration.

       --route-method m
              Which method m to use for adding routes on Windows?

              adaptive  (default)  --  Try  IP helper API first.  If that fails,
              fall back to the route.exe shell command.
              ipapi -- Use IP helper API.
              exe -- Call the route.exe shell command.

       --dhcp-option type [parm]
              Set extended TAP-Win32 TCP/IP properties, must be used with  --ip-
              win32  dynamic or --ip-win32 adaptive.  This option can be used to
              set additional TCP/IP properties on the TAP-Win32 adapter, and  is
              particularly  useful for configuring an OpenVPN client to access a
              Samba server across the VPN.

              DOMAIN name -- Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix.

              DNS addr -- Set primary domain name server address.   Repeat  this
              option to set secondary DNS server addresses.

              WINS  addr -- Set primary WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP
              Name Server).  Repeat this option to  set  secondary  WINS  server
              addresses.

              NBDD  addr -- Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP
              Datagram Distribution Server) Repeat this option to set  secondary
              NBDD server addresses.

              NTP  addr  --  Set primary NTP server address (Network Time Proto&#8208;
              col).  Repeat this option to set secondary NTP server addresses.

              NBT type -- Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type.  Possible  options:
              1  =  b-node (broadcasts), 2 = p-node (point-to-point name queries
              to a WINS server), 4 = m-node (broadcast then query name  server),
              and 8 = h-node (query name server, then broadcast).

              NBS  scope-id -- Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID
              provides an extended naming service for the  NetBIOS  over  TCP/IP
              (Known  as  NBT) module. The primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID
              is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on a single network  to  only  those
              nodes  with  the same NetBIOS scope ID.  The NetBIOS scope ID is a
              character string that is appended to the NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS
              scope  ID  on  two  hosts must match, or the two hosts will not be
              able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows computers to
              use  the same computer name, as they have different scope IDs. The
              Scope ID becomes a part of  the  NetBIOS  name,  making  the  name
              unique.   (This  description  of  NetBIOS scopes courtesy of Neon&#8208;
              Surge@abyss.com)

              DISABLE-NBT -- Disable Netbios-over-TCP/IP.

              Note that if --dhcp-option is pushed via --push to  a  non-windows
              client,  the  option  will  be  saved  in the client&apos;s environment
              before  the  up  script  is   called,   under   the   name   &quot;for&#8208;
              eign_option_{n}&quot;.

       --tap-sleep n
              Cause  OpenVPN  to  sleep for n seconds immediately after the TAP-
              Win32 adapter state is set to &quot;connected&quot;.

              This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot  problems  with
              the  --ifconfig  and  --ip-win32  options, and is used to give the
              TAP-Win32 adapter time to come up before  Windows  IP  Helper  API
              operations are applied to it.

       --show-net-up
              Output  OpenVPN&apos;s  view  of  the  system routing table and network
              adapter list to the syslog or log file after the  TUN/TAP  adapter
              has been brought up and any routes have been added.

       --dhcp-renew
              Ask  Windows  to  renew  the  TAP  adapter lease on startup.  This
              option is normally unnecessary, as Windows automatically  triggers
              a  DHCP renegotiation on the TAP adapter when it comes up, however
              if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property to  &quot;Always
              Connected&quot;, you may need this flag.

       --dhcp-release
              Ask  Windows  to  release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown.  This
              option has the same caveats as --dhcp-renew above.

       --register-dns
              Run net stop dnscache, net start dnscache, ipconfig /flushdns  and
              ipconfig  /registerdns on connection initiation.  This is known to
              kick Windows into recognizing pushed DNS servers.

       --pause-exit
              Put up a &quot;press any key to continue&quot; message on the console  prior
              to OpenVPN program exit.  This option is automatically used by the
              Windows explorer when OpenVPN is run on a configuration file using
              the right-click explorer menu.

       --service exit-event [0|1]
              Should  be  used  when  OpenVPN is being automatically executed by
              another program in such a context that  no  interaction  with  the
              user  via  display or keyboard is possible.  In general, end-users
              should never need to explicitly use this option, as it is automat&#8208;
              ically  added  by the OpenVPN service wrapper when a given OpenVPN
              configuration is being run as a service.

              exit-event is the name of a Windows global event object, and Open&#8208;
              VPN  will  continuously monitor the state of this event object and
              exit when it becomes signaled.

              The second parameter indicates the initial state of exit-event and
              normally defaults to 0.

              Multiple OpenVPN processes can be simultaneously executed with the
              same exit-event parameter.  In any case, the  controlling  process
              can signal exit-event, causing all such OpenVPN processes to exit.

              When  executing  an OpenVPN process using the --service directive,
              OpenVPN will probably not have a console  window  to  output  sta&#8208;
              tus/error  messages, therefore it is useful to use --log or --log-
              append to write these messages to a file.

       --show-adapters
              (Standalone)  Show  available  TAP-Win32  adapters  which  can  be
              selected using the --dev-node option.  On non-Windows systems, the
              ifconfig(8) command provides similar functionality.

       --allow-nonadmin [TAP-adapter]
              (Standalone) Set TAP-adapter to allow access from  non-administra&#8208;
              tive accounts.  If TAP-adapter is omitted, all TAP adapters on the
              system will be configured to allow  non-admin  access.   The  non-
              admin access setting will only persist for the length of time that
              the TAP-Win32 device object and driver  remain  loaded,  and  will
              need to be re-enabled after a reboot, or if the driver is unloaded
              and reloaded.  This directive can only be used by  an  administra&#8208;
              tor.

       --show-valid-subnets
              (Standalone)  Show  valid  subnets for --dev tun emulation.  Since
              the TAP-Win32 driver exports an ethernet interface to Windows, and
              since  TUN  devices  are point-to-point in nature, it is necessary
              for the TAP-Win32 driver to impose certain constraints on TUN end&#8208;
              point address selection.

              Namely,  the point-to-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation
              must be  the  middle  two  addresses  of  a  /30  subnet  (netmask
              255.255.255.252).

       --show-net
              (Standalone)  Show  OpenVPN&apos;s view of the system routing table and
              network adapter list.
&#12;   PKCS#11 Standalone Options:
       --show-pkcs11-ids provider [cert_private]
              (Standalone) Show PKCS#11 token object list. Specify  cert_private
              as 1 if certificates are stored as private objects.

              --verb  option can be used BEFORE this option to produce debugging
              information.

   IPv6 Related Options
       The following options exist to support IPv6 tunneling in peer-to-peer and
       client-server  mode.  As of now, this is just very basic documentation of
       the  IPv6-related  options.  More   documentation   can   be   found   on
       http://www.greenie.net/ipv6/openvpn.html.

       --ifconfig-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote
              configure  IPv6  address ipv6addr/bits on the ``tun&apos;&apos; device.  The
              second parameter is used as route target for  --route-ipv6  if  no
              gateway is specified.

       --route-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [gateway] [metric]
              setup  IPv6  routing in the system to send the specified IPv6 net&#8208;
              work into OpenVPN&apos;s ``tun&apos;&apos; device

       --server-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
              convenience-function to enable a number of IPv6 related options at
              once, namely --ifconfig-ipv6, --ifconfig-ipv6-pool, --tun-ipv6 and
              --push  tun-ipv6  Is  only  accepted  if  ``--mode   server&apos;&apos;   or
              ``--server&apos;&apos; is set.

       --ifconfig-ipv6-pool ipv6addr/bits
              Specify  an  IPv6  address pool for dynamic assignment to clients.
              The pool starts at ipv6addr and increments by  +1  for  every  new
              client  (linear mode).  The /bits setting controls the size of the
              pool.

       --ifconfig-ipv6-push ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote
              for ccd/  per-client  static  IPv6  interface  configuration,  see
              --client-config-dir and --ifconfig-push for more details.

       --iroute-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
              for  ccd/ per-client static IPv6 route configuration, see --iroute
              for more details how to setup and use this, and how  --iroute  and
              --route interact.


SCRIPTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       OpenVPN  exports  a  series  of  environmental variables for use by user-
       defined scripts.

   Script Order of Execution
       --up   Executed after TCP/UDP socket bind and TUN/TAP open.

       --tls-verify
              Executed when we have a still untrusted remote peer.

       --ipchange
              Executed after connection authentication,  or  remote  IP  address
              change.

       --client-connect
              Executed  in --mode server mode immediately after client authenti&#8208;
              cation.

       --route-up
              Executed  after  connection  authentication,  either   immediately
              after,  or some number of seconds after as defined by the --route-
              delay option.

       --client-disconnect
              Executed in --mode server mode on client instance shutdown.
&#12;       --down Executed after TCP/UDP and TUN/TAP close.

       --learn-address
              Executed in --mode server mode whenever an IPv4  address/route  or
              MAC address is added to OpenVPN&apos;s internal routing table.

       --auth-user-pass-verify
              Executed in --mode server mode on new client connections, when the
              client is still untrusted.

   String Types and Remapping
       In certain  cases,  OpenVPN  will  perform  remapping  of  characters  in
       strings.   Essentially, any characters outside the set of permitted char&#8208;
       acters for each string type will be converted to underbar (&apos;_&apos;).

       Q: Why is string remapping necessary?

       A: It&apos;s an important security feature to prevent the malicious coding  of
       strings  from  untrusted  sources  to be passed as parameters to scripts,
       saved in the environment, used as a common name, translated  to  a  file&#8208;
       name, etc.

       Q: Can string remapping be disabled?

       A:  Yes,  by using the --no-name-remapping option, however this should be
       considered an advanced option.

       Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN&apos;s current string types and the permit&#8208;
       ted character class for each string:

       X509  Names:  Alphanumeric,  underbar  (&apos;_&apos;),  dash  (&apos;-&apos;), dot (&apos;.&apos;), at
       (&apos;@&apos;), colon (&apos;:&apos;),  slash  (&apos;/&apos;),  and  equal  (&apos;=&apos;).   Alphanumeric  is
       defined  as a character which will cause the C library isalnum() function
       to return true.

       Common Names: Alphanumeric, underbar (&apos;_&apos;), dash (&apos;-&apos;), dot (&apos;.&apos;), and at
       (&apos;@&apos;).

       --auth-user-pass  username:  Same  as  Common  Name,  with one exception:
       starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username is passed to the  OPENVPN_PLUG&#8208;
       IN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY  plugin  in  its raw form, without string remap&#8208;
       ping.

       --auth-user-pass password: Any &quot;printable&quot; character  except  CR  or  LF.
       Printable  is  defined  to  be a character which will cause the C library
       isprint() function to return true.

       --client-config-dir filename as derived from  common  name  or  username:
       Alphanumeric, underbar (&apos;_&apos;), dash (&apos;-&apos;), and dot (&apos;.&apos;) except for &quot;.&quot; or
       &quot;..&quot; as standalone strings.  As of 2.0.1-rc6, the at (&apos;@&apos;) character  has
       been  added  as  well  for  compatibility  with the common name character
       class.

       Environmental variable names: Alphanumeric or underbar (&apos;_&apos;).

       Environmental variable values: Any printable character.

       For all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the  legal
       character class for that string type will be remapped to underbar (&apos;_&apos;).

   Environmental Variables
       Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new
       value or a restart,

       As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set  by
       OpenVPN  are  scoped  according to the client objects they are associated
       with, so there should not be any issues with  scripts  having  access  to
       stale,   previously   set  variables  which  refer  to  different  client
       instances.

       bytes_received
              Total number of bytes received from  client  during  VPN  session.

              support it, such as --dhcp-option on a non-Windows system, will be
              recorded to this environmental variable  sequence  prior  to  --up
              script execution.

       ifconfig_broadcast
              The  broadcast  address  for the virtual ethernet segment which is
              derived from the --ifconfig option when --dev tap  is  used.   Set
              prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of

              as  the  second  parameter  to  --ifconfig when --dev tap is being
              used.  Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows
              version  of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up
              script execution.

       ifconfig_pool_local_ip
              The local virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from  an
              --ifconfig-push  directive  if  specified,  or  otherwise from the

              directive).  Only set for --dev tap tunnels.  This option  is  set
              on  the  server  prior  to  execution  of the --client-connect and
              --client-disconnect scripts.

       ifconfig_pool_remote_ip
              The remote virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an
              --ifconfig-push  directive  if  specified,  or  otherwise from the
              ifconfig pool  (controlled  by  the  --ifconfig-pool  config  file
              directive).   This  option is set on the server prior to execution
              of the --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts.

       link_mtu
              The maximum packet size (not including the IP  header)  of  tunnel

              execution.

       route_{parm}_{n}
              A set of variables which define each route to be  added,  and  are
              set prior to --up script execution.

              parm will be one of &quot;network&quot;, &quot;netmask&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot;, or &quot;metric&quot;.

              n is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.

              If  the  network  or  gateway  are  resolvable DNS names, their IP
              address translations will be recorded rather than their  names  as
              denoted on the command line or configuration file.

       peer_cert
              Temporary file name containing the client certificate upon connec&#8208;
              tion.  Useful in conjunction with --tls-verify

       script_context
              Set to &quot;init&quot; or &quot;restart&quot; prior to up/down script execution.  For
              more information, see documentation for --up.

       script_type
              Prior to execution of any script, this variable is set to the type
              of script being run.  It can be one of the  following:  up,  down,
              ipchange, route-up, tls-verify, auth-user-pass-verify, client-con&#8208;
              nect, client-disconnect, or learn-address.

       signal The reason for exit or restart.  Can be one  of  sigusr1,  sighup,
              sigterm, sigint, inactive (controlled by --inactive option), ping-
              exit (controlled by --ping-exit option), ping-restart  (controlled
              by --ping-restart option), connection-reset (triggered on TCP con&#8208;
              nection reset), error, or unknown (unknown signal).  This variable
              is set just prior to down script execution.

       time_ascii
              Client  connection  timestamp,  formatted as a human-readable time
              string.  Set prior to execution of the --client-connect script.

       time_duration
              The duration (in seconds) of the client session which is now  dis&#8208;
              connecting.   Set  prior  to  execution of the --client-disconnect
              script.

       time_unix
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a unix integer date/time
              value.  Set prior to execution of the --client-connect script.

       tls_id_{n}
              A  series  of  certificate fields from the remote peer, where n is
              the verification level.  Only set for TLS connections.  Set  prior
              to execution of --tls-verify script.

       tls_serial_{n}
              The serial number of the certificate from the remote peer, where n
              is the verification level.  Only set  for  TLS  connections.   Set
              prior  to execution of --tls-verify script. This is in the form of
              a hex string like &quot;37AB46E0&quot;, which is suitable for doing  serial-
              based  OCSP queries (with OpenSSL, you have to prepend &quot;0x&quot; to the
              string). If something goes wrong while reading the value from  the
              certificate  it will be an empty string, so your code should check
              that.  See  the  contrib/OCSP_check/OCSP_check.sh  script  for  an
              example.

       tun_mtu
              The MTU of the TUN/TAP device.  Set prior to --up or --down script
              execution.

       trusted_ip (or trusted_ip6)
              Actual IP address of connecting client  or  peer  which  has  been
              authenticated.   Set  prior  to execution of --ipchange, --client-
              connect, and --client-disconnect scripts.  If using ipv6 endpoints
              (udp6, tcp6), trusted_ip6 will be set instead.

       trusted_port
              Actual  port  number  of  connecting client or peer which has been
              authenticated.  Set prior to execution  of  --ipchange,  --client-
              connect, and --client-disconnect scripts.

       untrusted_ip (or untrusted_ip6)
              Actual  IP address of connecting client or peer which has not been
              authenticated yet.  Sometimes used to nmap the connecting host  in
              a  --tls-verify  script  to ensure it is firewalled properly.  Set
              prior to execution  of  --tls-verify  and  --auth-user-pass-verify
              scripts.  If using ipv6 endpoints (udp6, tcp6), untrusted_ip6 will
              be set instead.

       untrusted_port
              Actual port number of connecting client or peer which has not been
              authenticated  yet.   Set  prior  to execution of --tls-verify and
              --auth-user-pass-verify scripts.

       username
              The username provided  by  a  connecting  client.   Set  prior  to
              --auth-user-pass-verify  script  execution  only  when the via-env
              modifier is specified.

       X509_{n}_{subject_field}
              An X509 subject field from the remote peer certificate, where n is
              the  verification level.  Only set for TLS connections.  Set prior
              to execution of --tls-verify script.  This variable is similar  to
              tls_id_{n}  except  the  component  X509 subject fields are broken
              out, and no string remapping occurs on these field values  (except
              for  remapping  of  control  characters to &quot;_&quot;).  For example, the
              following variables would be set on the OpenVPN server  using  the
              sample  client certificate in sample-keys (client.crt).  Note that
              the verification level is 0 for the client certificate and  1  for
              the CA certificate.
&#12;                  X509_0_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                  X509_0_CN=Test-Client
                  X509_0_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                  X509_0_ST=NA
                  X509_0_C=KG
                  X509_1_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                  X509_1_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                  X509_1_L=BISHKEK
                  X509_1_ST=NA
                  X509_1_C=KG

SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Cause  OpenVPN  to  close  all  TUN/TAP  and  network connections,
              restart, re-read the  configuration  file  (if  any),  and  reopen
              TUN/TAP and network connections.

       SIGUSR1
              Like SIGHUP, except don&apos;t re-read configuration file, and possibly
              don&apos;t close and reopen TUN/TAP device, re-read key files, preserve
              local  IP  address/port,  or  preserve most recently authenticated
              remote IP  address/port  based  on  --persist-tun,  --persist-key,
              --persist-local-ip,  and  --persist-remote-ip options respectively
              (see above).

              This signal may also be internally generated by a  timeout  condi&#8208;
              tion, governed by the --ping-restart option.

              This  signal,  when combined with --persist-remote-ip, may be sent
              when the underlying parameters of  the  host&apos;s  network  interface
              change  such  as  when the host is a DHCP client and is assigned a
              new IP address.  See --ipchange above for more information.

       SIGUSR2
              Causes OpenVPN to display its current statistics  (to  the  syslog
              file if --daemon is used, or stdout otherwise).

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
              Causes OpenVPN to exit gracefully.

TUN/TAP DRIVER SETUP
       If  you  are running Linux 2.4.7 or higher, you probably have the TUN/TAP
       driver already installed.  If so, there are still a few things  you  need
       to do:

       Make device: mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

       Load driver: modprobe tun

EXAMPLES
       Prior to running these examples, you should have OpenVPN installed on two
       machines with network connectivity between them.  If  you  have  not  yet
       installed  OpenVPN, consult the INSTALL file included in the OpenVPN dis&#8208;
       tribution.

   TUN/TAP Setup:
       If you are using Linux 2.4 or higher, make the tun device node  and  load
       the tun module:

              mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

              modprobe tun

       If you installed from RPM, the mknod step may be omitted, because the RPM
       install does that for you.

       Only Linux 2.4 and newer are supported.

       For  other  platforms,  consult  the   INSTALL   file   at   http://open&#8208;
       vpn.net/install.html for more information.

   Firewall Setup:
       If  firewalls  exist between the two machines, they should be set to for&#8208;
       ward UDP port 1194 in both directions.  If you do not have  control  over
       the  firewalls  between  the  two  machines, you may still be able to use
       OpenVPN by adding --ping 15 to each of the openvpn commands used below in
       the  examples  (this  will  cause each peer to send out a UDP ping to its
       remote peer once every 15 seconds which will cause  many  stateful  fire&#8208;
       walls  to forward packets in both directions without an explicit firewall
       rule).

       If you are using a Linux iptables-based firewall, you may need  to  enter
       the following command to allow incoming packets on the TUN device:

              iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       See the firewalls section below for more information on configuring fire&#8208;
       walls for use with OpenVPN.

   VPN Address Setup:
       For purposes of our example, our two machines will be called  may.kg  and
       june.kg.   If  you are constructing a VPN over the internet, then replace
       may.kg and june.kg with the internet hostname or  IP  address  that  each
       machine will use to contact the other over the internet.

       Now we will choose the tunnel endpoints.  Tunnel endpoints are private IP
       addresses that only have meaning in the context of the VPN.  Each machine
       will  use  the tunnel endpoint of the other machine to access it over the
       VPN.  In our example, the tunnel endpoint for may.kg will be 10.4.0.1 and
       for june.kg, 10.4.0.2.

       Once the VPN is established, you have essentially created a secure alter&#8208;
       nate path between the two hosts which is addressed by  using  the  tunnel
       endpoints.   You  can  control  which  network traffic passes between the
       hosts (a) over the VPN or (b)  independently  of  the  VPN,  by  choosing
       whether  to  use  (a) the VPN endpoint address or (b) the public internet
       address, to access the remote host. For example if you are on may.kg  and
       you  wish  to connect to june.kg via ssh without using the VPN (since ssh
       has its own built-in security) you would use  the  command  ssh  june.kg.
       However  in  the  same  scenario,  you  could also use the command telnet
       10.4.0.2 to create a telnet session with june.kg over the VPN, that would
       use the VPN to secure the session rather than ssh.

       You  can  use any address you wish for the tunnel endpoints but make sure
       that they are private addresses (such as those  that  begin  with  10  or
       192.168)  and  that  they are not part of any existing subnet on the net&#8208;
       works of either peer, unless you are bridging.  If  you  use  an  address
       that is part of your local subnet for either of the tunnel endpoints, you
       will get a weird feedback loop.

   Example 1: A simple tunnel without security
       On may:

              openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig  10.4.0.1  10.4.0.2
              --verb 9

       On june:

              openvpn  --remote  may.kg  --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1
              --verb 9

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On may:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On june:

              ping 10.4.0.1

       The --verb 9 option will produce verbose  output,  similar  to  the  tcp&#8208;
       dump(8) program.  Omit the --verb 9 option to have OpenVPN run quietly.

   Example 2: A tunnel with static-key security (i.e. using a pre-shared secret)
       First build a static key on may.

              openvpn --genkey --secret key

       This  command  will build a random key file called key (in ascii format).
       Now copy key to june over a secure medium such as  by  using  the  scp(1)
       program.

       On may:

              openvpn  --remote  june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2
              --verb 5 --secret key

       On june:

              openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1  --ifconfig  10.4.0.2  10.4.0.1
              --verb 5 --secret key

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On may:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On june:

              ping 10.4.0.1

   Example 3: A tunnel with full TLS-based security
       For  this  test,  we will designate may as the TLS client and june as the
       TLS server.  Note that client or server designation only has meaning  for
       the TLS subsystem. It has no bearing on OpenVPN&apos;s peer-to-peer, UDP-based
       communication model.

       First, build a separate certificate/key pair for both may and  june  (see
       above  where  --cert  is discussed for more info).  Then construct Diffie
       Hellman parameters (see above where --dh is  discussed  for  more  info).
       You  can  also  use  the  included  test  files  client.crt,  client.key,
       server.crt, server.key and ca.crt.  The .crt files are  certificates/pub&#8208;
       lic-keys,  the .key files are private keys, and ca.crt is a certification
       authority who has signed both  client.crt  and  server.crt.   For  Diffie
       Hellman  parameters  you can use the included file dh1024.pem.  Note that
       all client, server,  and  certificate  authority  certificates  and  keys
       included  in  the OpenVPN distribution are totally insecure and should be
       used for testing only.

       On may:

              openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig  10.4.0.1  10.4.0.2
              --tls-client   --ca  ca.crt  --cert  client.crt  --key  client.key
              --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5

       On june:

              openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1  --ifconfig  10.4.0.2  10.4.0.1
              --tls-server  --dh  dh1024.pem --ca ca.crt --cert server.crt --key
              server.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On may:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On june:

              ping 10.4.0.1

       Notice the --reneg-sec 60 option we used above.  That  tells  OpenVPN  to
       renegotiate  the  data channel keys every minute.  Since we used --verb 5
       above, you will see status information on each new key negotiation.

       For production operations, a key renegotiation interval of 60 seconds  is
       probably  too  frequent.  Omit the --reneg-sec 60 option to use OpenVPN&apos;s
       default key renegotiation interval of one hour.

   Routing:
       Assuming you can ping across the tunnel, the next step is to route a real
       subnet  over  the secure tunnel.  Suppose that may and june have two net&#8208;
       work interfaces each, one connected to the internet, and the other  to  a
       private  network.  Our goal is to securely connect both private networks.
       We will assume that may&apos;s private subnet is  10.0.0.0/24  and  june&apos;s  is
       10.0.1.0/24.

       First,  ensure  that  IP  forwarding is enabled on both peers.  On Linux,
       enable routing:

              echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

       and enable TUN packet forwarding through the firewall:

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       On may:

              route add -net 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.2

       On june:

              route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.1

       Now any machine on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet can access any machine  on  the
       10.0.1.0/24 subnet over the secure tunnel (or vice versa).

       In  a  production  environment,  you  could put the route command(s) in a
       shell script and execute with the --up option.

FIREWALLS
       OpenVPN&apos;s usage of a single UDP port makes it  fairly  firewall-friendly.
       You  should add an entry to your firewall rules to allow incoming OpenVPN
       packets.  On Linux 2.4+:

              iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

       This will allow incoming packets on UDP port 1194 (OpenVPN&apos;s default  UDP
       port) from an OpenVPN peer at 1.2.3.4.

       If  you are using HMAC-based packet authentication (the default in any of
       OpenVPN&apos;s secure modes), having the firewall filter on source address can
       be  considered  optional, since HMAC packet authentication is a much more
       secure method of verifying the authenticity of a packet source.  In  that
       case:

              iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

       would  be  adequate and would not render the host inflexible with respect
       to its peer having a dynamic IP address.

       OpenVPN also works well on stateful firewalls.  In some  cases,  you  may
       not  need to add any static rules to the firewall list if you are using a
       stateful firewall that knows how to track UDP connections.  If you  spec&#8208;
       ify  --ping n, OpenVPN will be guaranteed to send a packet to its peer at
       least once every n seconds.  If n is less than the stateful firewall con&#8208;
       nection  timeout,  you  can  maintain  an OpenVPN connection indefinitely
       without explicit firewall rules.

       You should also add firewall rules to allow incoming IP traffic on TUN or
       TAP devices such as:

              iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tun devices,

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tun devices to be forwarded to other hosts on
       the local network,

              iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tap devices, and

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tap devices to be forwarded to other hosts on
       the local network.

       These  rules are secure if you use packet authentication, since no incom&#8208;
       ing packets will arrive on a TUN or TAP virtual device unless they  first
       pass an HMAC authentication test.
