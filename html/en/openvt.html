OPENVT(1)                           Linux 1.x                          OPENVT(1)



NAME
       openvt - start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT).

SYNOPSIS
       openvt [-c vtnumber] [OPTIONS] [--] command

DESCRIPTION
       openvt  will find the first available VT, and run on it the given command
       with the given command options, standard  input,  output  and  error  are
       directed  to  that  terminal.  The current search path ($PATH) is used to
       find the requested command. If no command is specified then the  environ&#8208;
       ment variable $SHELL is used.

   OPTIONS
       -c, --console=VTNUMBER
              Use the given VT number and not the first available. Note you must
              have write access to the supplied VT for this to work;

       -f, --force
              Force opening a VT without checking whether it is already in use;

       -e, --exec
              Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This  option
              is meant for use in /etc/inittab.  If you want to use this feature
              in another context, be aware that  openvt  has  to  be  a  session
              leader in order for -e to work.  See setsid(2) or setsid(1) on how
              to achieve this.

       -s, --switch
              Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT of the  new
              command will be made the new current VT;

       -u, --user
              Figure  out  the  owner  of  the current VT, and run login as that
              user.  Suitable to be called by init. Shouldn&apos;t be used with -c or
              -l;

       -l, --login
              Make  the  command  a login shell. A - is prepended to the name of
              the command to be executed;

       -v, --verbose
              Be a bit more verbose;

       -w, --wait
              wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used together  then
              openvt  will switch back to the controlling terminal when the com&#8208;
              mand completes;

       -V, --version
              print program version and exit;

       -h, --help
              show this text and exit.

       --     end of options to openvt.

NOTE
       If openvt is compiled with a getopt_long() and you wish to set options to
       the  command  to  be run, then you must supply the end of options -- flag
       before the command.
&#12;EXAMPLES
       openvt can be used to start a shell on the next free  VT,  by  using  the
       command:

       openvt bash


       To start the shell as a login shell, use:

       openvt -l bash


       To get a long listing you must supply the -- separator:

       openvt -- ls -l



HISTORY
       Earlier,   openvt   was  called  open.   It  was  written  by  Jon  Tombs
       &lt;jon@gtex02.us.es or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk&gt;.  The -w idea is from &quot;sam&quot;.
