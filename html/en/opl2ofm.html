       default) or to a file specified as OFMFILE.

       The  program  also  works  with  TeX  PL  files, producing TeX TFM files.
       (opl2ofm is based on the WEB source code for pltotf(1).)

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The  first PLtoTF program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer
              of 1978.  Contributions by  Frank  Liang,  Doug  Wyatt,  and  Lyle
              Ramshaw  also  had  a  significant  effect on the evolution of the
              present code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added  by  D.E.
              Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions  to  handle  extended  font metric files (``OFM&apos;&apos;) were
              added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996,  resulting
              in the new program OPL2OFM.
