org.debian.apt(7)                D-Bus Interface               org.debian.apt(7)



NAME
       org.debian.apt - the main interface of aptdaemon

SYNOPSIS
       The daemon is accessed through the D-Bus object at /or/debian/apt.  Which
       provides the following interface.

DESCRIPTION
   METHODS
       AddRepository
              AddRepository  (in &apos;s&apos; type,
                        in &apos;s&apos; uri,
                        in &apos;s&apos; dist,

                        in &apos;s&apos; sourcesfile)

              Add a new repository to the sources list file. The repository  has
              to  define  the  type  (e.g. deb or deb-src), uri (e.g. http://ar&#8208;
              chive.debian.org/debian), the distribution  (e.g.  stable)  and  a
              list of components (e.g. main).

              Optionally  a  comment and an alternative sources.list file can be
              specified.

       EnableDistroComponent
              EnableDistroComponent    (in &apos;s&apos; comp)

              Enable a component for all distro repositories, e.g. main or  uni&#8208;
              verse.

       GetTrustedVendorKeys
              GetTrustedVendorKeys     (out &apos;as&apos; keys)

              Return the GnuPG keys which are used to authenticate packages.

       GetAtiveTransactions
              GetActiveTransactions    (out &apos;as&apos; tids)

              Return an array of the currently queued transactions.

       Quit
              Quit ()

              Request  the shutdown of the daemon. The daemon will finish a cur&#8208;
              rently running transaction before.

   TRANSACTION BASED METHODS
       The following methods are handled by transactions. By calling the methods
       a  new  transaction will be created for the task. The return value of the
       method is the D-Bus object path of  the  corresponding  transaction.  The
       transaction can be modified, to use an http proxy or to run in a specific
       language   by   setting   the    corresponding    properties    on    the
       org.debian.apt.transaction(7)  interface.  Afterwards the transaction has
       to  be  queued  for  processing  by  calling  its  Run  method   on   the
       org.debian.apt.transaction(7) interface.

              Return  the id of a newly created transaction which will fetch the
