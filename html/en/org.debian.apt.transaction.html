org.debian.apt.transaction(7)    D-Bus Interface   org.debian.apt.transaction(7)



NAME
       org.debian.apt.transaction  - the main interface of an aptdaemon transac&#8208;
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       Each transaction is represented as an unique D-Bus object, e.g. at the D-
       Bus path /or/debian/apt/transaction/12123-123-123213.  Which provides the
       following interface.

DESCRIPTION
   METHODS
       ProvideMedium
              ProvideMedium  (in &apos;s&apos; medium)

              Continue a paused transaction  which  is  waiting  for  the  given
              medium.

              If  a  media  change  is  required to e.g. install packages from a
              CD/DVD the transaction will be paused and the RequiredMedium prop&#8208;
              erty  changed to an array of the medium label and its mount point.
              Furthermore the MediumRequired signal will be emitted.

       ResolveConfigFileConflict
              ResolveConfigFilePrompt  (in &apos;s&apos; config,
                                  in &apos;s&apos; answer)

              Continue a paused transaction which is waiting for  an  answer  to
              handle  a  configuration file conflict.  Config is the path to the
              current configuration file and answer can be either  &quot;replace&quot;  or
              &quot;keep&quot;.

              If  a  later  config  file is shipped in a package which overrides
              some user modifications the transaction will  be  paused  and  the
              ConfigFileConflict  property  of the transaction will be set to an
              array of the old and new configuration file path. The later one is
              supposed  to  replace the former one.  Furthermore the ConfigFile&#8208;
              Conflict signal will be emitted.

       Simulate
              Simulate  ()

              Simulate the transaction and calculate dependencies, required disk
              space  and  download  size. If a transaction would fail the corre&#8208;
              sponding error will be raised.

       Run    Run  ()

              Queue the transaction for processing. Afterwards there  cannot  be
              made  any  further  changes  to the transaction, e.g. modifing the
              http proxy.

       Cancel Cancel    ()

              Cancel the transaction if possible.

   SIGNALS
       Finished
              Finished  (&apos;s&apos; exit_state)

              The signal will be emitted when  the  transaction  has  been  pro&#8208;
              cessed. The exit_state indicates if the transaction was completed,
              cancelled or failed.

       MediumRequired
              MediumRequired (&apos;s&apos; label,
                             &apos;s&apos; mount_point)

              The signal will be emitted if the transaction has been paused  and
              waits for a media change to install packages.

       ConfigFileConflict
              ConfigFileConflict  (&apos;s&apos; old,
                             &apos;s&apos; new)

              The  signal  will  be  emitted  if the transaction has been paused
              because a new configuration file is shipped  in  a  package  which
              would override changes by the user in the old configuration file.

       PropertyChanged
              PropertyChanged     (&apos;s&apos; property_name ,
                             &apos;v&apos; value)

              The  signal will be emitted if one of the following properties has
              changed.

   PROPERTIES
       The properties of the transaction  are  available  through  the  Get  And
       GetAll methods of the D-Bus properties interface and can be changed using
       the Set method.

       Role read &apos;s&apos;
              The role enum of the transaction, e.g. update-cache.

       Status read &apos;s&apos;
              The current status enum of the transaction, e.g. downloading

       StatusDetails read &apos;s&apos;
              A clear text message describing the current status.

              The additional disk space in Bytes which will be required  by  the
              transaction.   The  Simulate  method has to be called to calculate
              the download size.

       Download read &apos;i&apos;
              The required download size in Bytes of the transaction.  The Simu&#8208;
              late method has to be called to calculate the download size.

              The  lists of packages which are initially queued to be installed,

              point of the requested medium.

       ConfigFileConflict read &apos;a(ss)&apos;

       Terminal read-write &apos;s&apos;
              The  path to the master pty which will be the controlling terminal

              larly.  MetaData  read-write  &apos;a{ss}&apos;  A  dictonary  which  allows
              client  application  to  store additional data in the transaction.
