OSAGE(1)                                                                OSAGE(1)



NAME
       osage - filter for drawing clustered graphs

SYNOPSIS
       osage  [-(G|N|E)name=value]  [-Tlang]  [-llibfile]  [-ooutfile] [-O] [-P]
       [-v] [-V] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       osage draws clustered graphs. As input, it takes any  graph  in  the  dot
       format.  It  draws  the graph recursively. At each level, there will be a
       collection of nodes and a collection of cluster subgraphs.  The internals
       of  each  cluster  subgraph  are laid out, then the cluster subgraphs and
       nodes at the current level are positioned relative to each other,  treat&#8208;
       ing each cluster subgraph as a node.

       At  each  level, the nodes and cluster subgraphs are viewed as rectangles
       to be packed together. At present,  edges  are  ignored  during  packing.
       Packing  is done using the standard packing functions. In particular, the
       graph attributes pack and packmode control the layout.   Each  graph  and
       cluster  can  specify its own values for these attributes.  Remember also
       that a cluster inherits its attribute values from its parent graph.

       After all nodes and clusters, edges are routed based on the value of  the
       splines attribute.

OUTPUT FORMATS
       Osage uses an extensible plugin mechanism for its output renderers, so to
       see what output formats your installation of osage supports you  can  use
       ``osage  -Txxx&apos;&apos;  (where xxx is an unlikely format) and check the warning
       message.  Also, The plugin mechanism supports multiple implementations of
       the  output  formats.  To see what variants are available, use, for exam&#8208;
       ple: ``osage -Tpng:&apos;&apos; and to force a particular variant, use,  for  exam&#8208;
       ple: ``osage -Tpng:gd&apos;&apos;

       Traditionally,  osage  supports  the  following: -Tps (PostScript), -Tsvg
       -Tsvgz  (Structured  Vector  Graphics),  -Tfig  (XFIG  graphics),   -Tmif
       (FrameMaker  graphics),  -Thpgl  (HP  pen  plotters), and -Tpcl (Laserjet
       printers), -Tpng -Tgif (bitmap graphics), -Tdia  (GTK+  based  diagrams),
       -Timap (imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge that has a
       non&#8208;null &quot;href&quot; attribute.), -Tcmapx (client&#8208;side  imagemap  for  use  in
       html  and  xhtml).  Additional less common or more special&#8208;purpose output
       formats  can  be   found   at   http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/out&#8208;
       put.html.)

       Alternative  plugins  providing  support for a given output format can be
       found from the error message resulting from appending a &apos;:&apos; to  the  for&#8208;
       mat. e.g. -Tpng: The first plugin listed is always the default.

GRAPH FILE LANGUAGE
       Here  is  a  synopsis of the graph file language, traditionally using the
       extension .gv or .dot, for graphs:

       [strict] (graph|digraph) name { statement&#8208;list }
       Is the top level graph. If the graph is strict then  multiple  edges  are
       not  allowed between the same pairs of nodes.  If it is a directed graph,
       indicated by digraph, then the edgeop must be &quot;-&gt;&quot;. If  it  is  an  undi&#8208;
       rected graph then the edgeop must be &quot;--&quot;.  Statements may be:

       name=val;
       node [name=val];
       edge [name=val];
       Set  default  graph,  node, or edge attribute name to val.  Any subgraph,
       node, or edge appearing after this inherits the new default attributes.

       n0 [name0=val0,name1=val1,...]; Creates node n0 (if it does  not  already
       exist) and sets its attributes according to the optional list.

       n0 edgeop n1 edgeop ... edgeop nn [name0=val0,name1=val1,...];
       Creates  edges  between  nodes  n0, n1, ..., nn and sets their attributes
       according to the optional list.  Creates nodes as necessary.

       [subgraph name] { statement&#8208;list }
       Creates a subgraph.  Subgraphs may be used in place of n0, ..., nn in the
       above  statements to create edges.  [subgraph name] is optional; if miss&#8208;
       ing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name.

       Comments may be /*C&#8208;like*/ or //C++&#8208;like.


       Attribute names and values are ordinary (C&#8208;style) strings.  The following
       sections describe attributes that control graph layout.


GRAPH ATTRIBUTES
       size=&quot;x,y&quot; sets bounding box of drawing in inches.

       page=&quot;x,y&quot; sets the PostScript pagination unit.

       ratio=f  sets the aspect ratio to f which may be a floating point number,
       or one of the keywords fill, compress, or auto.

       pagedir=[TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of pagination.

       rotate=90 sets landscape mode.  (orientation=land is backward  compatible
       but obsolete.)

       center=n a non&#8208;zero value centers the drawing on the page.

       layers=&quot;id:id:id:id&quot;  is a sequence of layer identifiers for overlay dia&#8208;
       grams.  The PostScript array variable layercolorseq sets  the  assignment
       of  colors  to  layers.  The  least index is 1 and each element must be a
       3&#8208;element array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.

       color=colorvalue sets foreground color (bgcolor for background).

       href=&quot;url&quot; the default url for image map files; in PostScript files,  the
       base  URL  for  all relative URLs, as recognized by Acrobat Distiller 3.0
       and up.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       stylesheet=&quot;file.css&quot; includes a reference to a stylesheet in  -Tsvg  and
       -Tsvgz outputs.  Ignored by other formats.

       splines. If set to true, edges are drawn as splines.  If set to polyline,
       edges are drawn as polylines.  If  set  to  ortho,  edges  are  drawn  as
       orthogonal  polylines.  In all of these cases, the nodes may not overlap.
       If splines=false or splines=line, edges are drawn as line segments.   The
       default is false.


NODE ATTRIBUTES
       height=d  or width=d sets minimum height or width.  Adding fixedsize=true
       forces these to be the actual size (text labels are ignored).

       shape=record polygon epsf builtin_polygon
       builtin_polygon is one of: plaintext ellipse oval circle egg triangle box
       diamond trapezium parallelogram house hexagon octagon note tab box3d com&#8208;
       ponent.   (Polygons  are  defined  or  modified  by  the  following  node
       attributes:  regular,  peripheries,  sides,  orientation,  distortion and
       skew.)  epsf uses the node&apos;s shapefile attribute as the path name  of  an
       external EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node shape.

       label=text where text may include escaped newlines \n, \l, or \r for cen&#8208;
       ter, left, and right justified lines.  The  string  &apos;\N&apos;  value  will  be
       replaced by the node name.  The string &apos;\G&apos; value will be replaced by the
       graph name.  Record labels may contain recursive box lists delimited by {
       |  }.   Port identifiers in labels are set off by angle brackets &lt; &gt;.  In
       the graph file, use colon (such as, node0:port28).

       fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.

       fontname=name sets the label font family name.

       color=colorvalue sets the outline color, and the default  fill  color  if
       style=filled and fillcolor is not specified.

       fillcolor=colorvalue sets the fill color when style=filled.  If not spec&#8208;
       ified, the fillcolor when style=filled defaults to be  the  same  as  the
       outline color.

       fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.

       A  colorvalue may be &quot;h,s,v&quot; (hue, saturation, brightness) floating point
       numbers between 0 and 1, or an X11 color name such  as  white  black  red
       green  blue yellow magenta cyan or burlywood, or a &quot;#rrggbb&quot; (red, green,
       blue, 2 hex characters each) value.

       style=filled solid dashed dotted bold invis or any Postscript code.

       layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the  node&apos;s  active  layers.   The  empty
       string means no layers (invisible).

       The following attributes apply only to polygon shape nodes:

       regular=n if n is non&#8208;zero then the polygon is made regular, i.e. symmet&#8208;
       ric about the x and y axis, otherwise the polygon  takes  on  the  aspect
       ratio  of  the  label.  builtin_polygons that are not already regular are
       made regular by this attribute.  builtin_polygons that are already  regu&#8208;
       lar are not affected (i.e.  they cannot be made asymmetric).

       peripheries=n  sets  the number of periphery lines drawn around the poly&#8208;
       gon.   This  value  supersedes  the  number   of   periphery   lines   of
       builtin_polygons.

       sides=n  sets  the  number  of  sides  to  the polygon. n&lt;3 results in an
       ellipse.  This attribute is ignored by builtin_polygons.

       orientation=f sets the orientation of the first apex of the polygon coun&#8208;
       terclockwise  from  the  vertical, in degrees.  f may be a floating point
       number.  The orientation of labels is not  affected  by  this  attribute.
       This attribute is added to the initial orientation of builtin_polygons.

       distortion=f  sets  the  amount of broadening of the top and narrowing of
       the bottom of the polygon (relative to its orientation).  Floating  point
       values  between  -1  and  +1 are suggested.  This attribute is ignored by
       builtin_polygons.

       skew=f sets the amount of right&#8208;displacement of  the  top  and  left&#8208;dis&#8208;
       placement  of  the  bottom  of the polygon (relative to its orientation).
       Floating point values between -1 and +1 are suggested.  This attribute is
       ignored by builtin_polygons.

       href=&quot;url&quot;  sets  the  url  for  the node in imagemap, PostScript and SVG
       files.  The substrings &apos;\N&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the  same  manner
       as for the node label attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is sub&#8208;
       stituted with the node label string.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for  client&#8208;side  imagemaps  and  SVG,
       effective  when nodes have a URL.  The target string is used to determine
       which window of  the  browser  is  used  for  the  URL.   Setting  it  to
       &quot;_graphviz&quot;  will open a new window if it doesn&apos;t already exist, or reuse
       it if it does.  If the target string is empty, the default, then no  tar&#8208;
       get  attribute  is  included in the output.  The substrings &apos;\N&apos; and &apos;\G&apos;
       are substituted in the same manner  as  for  the  node  label  attribute.
       Additionally  the  substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the node label
       string.

       tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and  SVG,
       effective  when  nodes have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be the
       same as the label string, but this attribute permits nodes without labels
       to  still  have  tooltips  thus permitting denser graphs.  The substrings
       &apos;\N&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner as for  the  node  label
       attribute.   Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the node
       label string.



EDGE ATTRIBUTES
       label=text where text may include escaped newlines \n, \l, or \r for cen&#8208;
       tered, left, or right justified lines.  If the substring &apos;\T&apos; is found in
       a label it will be replaced by the tail_node name.  If the substring &apos;\H&apos;
       is  found  in  a label it will be replaced by the head_node name.  If the
       substring &apos;\E&apos; value is  found  in  a  label  it  will  be  replaced  by:
       tail_node_name-&gt;head_node_name  If the substring &apos;\G&apos; is found in a label
       it    will    be    replaced    by    the    graph    name.     or    by:
       tail_node_name--head_node_name for undirected graphs.

       fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.

       fontname=name sets the label font family name.

       fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.

       style=solid dashed dotted bold invis

       color=colorvalue sets the line color for edges.

       color=colorvaluelist  a &apos;:&apos; separated list of colorvalue creates parallel
       edges, one edge for each color.

       dir=forward back both none controls arrow direction.

       tailclip,headclip=false disables endpoint shape clipping.

       href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node  in  imagemap,  PostScript  and  SVG
       files.   The  substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the
       same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the  substring
       &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;href&quot;.)

       target=&quot;target&quot;  is  a  target  string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and SVG,
       effective when edges have a URL.  If the  target  string  is  empty,  the
       default,  then  no  target attribute is included in the output.  The sub&#8208;
       strings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same  manner  as
       for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substi&#8208;
       tuted with the edge label string.

       tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for client&#8208;side imagemaps effective
       when edges have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the
       edge label string.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are  substi&#8208;
       tuted  in  the same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally

       name,labelfontsize  for head and tail labels.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;,
       &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner as for  the  edge  label
       attribute.   Additionally the substring &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge
       label string.

       headhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the head port in imagemap, PostScript and
       SVG  files.   The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in

       string &apos;\L&apos; is substituted with the edge label string.

       headURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;headURL&quot; is a synonym for &quot;headhref&quot;.)

       headtarget=&quot;headtarget&quot;  is a target string for client&#8208;side imagemaps and
       SVG, effective when edge heads have a URL.  The headtarget string is used
       to  determine  which  window  of the browser is used for the URL.  If the
       headtarget string is empty, the default, then headtarget defaults to  the
       same  value  as target for the edge.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;, &apos;\H&apos;, &apos;\E&apos; and
       &apos;\G&apos; are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label  attribute.
       Additionally  the  substring  &apos;\L&apos;  is  substituted  with  the edge label
       string.

       headtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is  a  tooltip  string  for  client&#8208;side  imagemaps
       effective  when head ports have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be
       the same as the headlabel string.  The substrings &apos;\T&apos;,  &apos;\H&apos;,  and  &apos;\E&apos;
       are  substituted  in  the  same  manner  as for the edge label attribute.

       the average landing point.

       layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the  edge&apos;s  active  layers.   The  empty
       string means no layers (invisible).


       (neato&#8208;specific attributes)
       w=f  sets  the  weight (spring constant) of an edge to the given floating
       point value.  The default is 1.0; greater values make the edge tend  more
       toward its optimal length.

       len=f sets the optimal length of an edge.  The default is 1.0.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -G sets a default graph attribute.
       -N sets a default node attribute.
       -E  sets  a  default  edge  attribute.  Example: -Gsize=&quot;7,8&quot; -Nshape=box
       -Efontsize=8

       -lfile loads custom PostScript library files.  Usually these define  cus&#8208;
       tom  shapes or styles.  If -l is given by itself, the standard library is
       omitted.

       -Tlang sets the output language as described above.

       -O automatically generate output filenames based on  the  input  filename
       and the -T format.

       -v (verbose) prints various information useful for debugging.

       -V (version) prints version information and exits.

       -? prints the usage and exits.
