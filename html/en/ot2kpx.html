OT2KPX(1)                         Marc Penninga                        OT2KPX(1)



NAME
       ot2kpx - extract kerning information from OpenType fonts

SYNOPSIS
       ot2kpx  fontfile

DESCRIPTION
       ot2kpx extract the kerning data from OpenType fonts (both otf and ttf
       formats) and prints it (in afm format) to &quot;stdout&quot;.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       fontfile
           The OpenType font (in either otf or ttf format).

RESTRICTIONS
       -   ot2kpx doesn&apos;t implement all of the OpenType specification.  Things
           that are missing include: support for font files containing multiple
           fonts, LookupTables with LookupTypes other than 2, &quot;kern&quot; tables with
           format other than 0 and ValueRecords with other types of data than
           just XAdvance data.

           Most of these limitations don&apos;t really matter, since the missing
           features are rare (the only fonts I know of that use them are the
           non-western fonts that come with Adobe Reader). Furthermore, some of
           these features concern (according to the OpenType specification)
           &quot;define subtle, device-dependent adjustments at specific font sizes
           or device resolutions&quot;.  Since there&apos;s no way to express such
           adjustments in afm format, ignoring them seems to be the only option
           anyway.

       -   ot2kpx collects kerning data first from the &quot;kern&quot; table, then from
           all LookupTables associated with the &quot;kern&quot; feature; if a kerning
           pair occurs multiple times, the first value seen is chosen.  There
           are (or may be) several issues with this approach:

           -   The OpenType specification says that fonts in otf format
               shouldn&apos;t use the &quot;kern&quot; table at all, just the lookups from the
               &quot;GPOS&quot; table.  Many such fonts do, however, contain a &quot;kern&quot;
               table, but no &quot;GPOS&quot; table; so we use the &quot;kern&quot; table anyway.

           -   Instead of reading all LookupTables, it might be better to let
               the user specify a script and language and process only the
               LookupTables for those values.  However, at least in the fonts I
               checked, all script/language combinations eventually point to the
               same &quot;kern&quot; LookupTables, so this approach wouldn&apos;t make any
               difference (apart from further complicating the code).
