NAME
       otp - One-Time Passwords

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.2

       package require otp  ?1.0.0?

       ::otp::otp-md4 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-md5 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-sha1 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-rmd160 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package is an implementation in Tcl of the One-Time Password system
       as described in RFC 2289 (1). This system uses message-digest  algorithms
       to  sequentially  hash  a  passphrase to create single-use passwords. The
       resulting data is then provided to the user as either hexadecimal  digits
       or encoded using a dictionary of 2048 words. This system is used by Open&#8208;
       BSD for secure login and can be used as a SASL mechanism for authenticat&#8208;
       ing users.

       In  this  implementation  we provide support for four algorithms that are
       included in the tcllib distribution: MD5 (2), MD4 (3), RIPE-MD160 (4) and
       SHA-1 (5).

COMMANDS
       ::otp::otp-md4 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-md5 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-sha1 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-rmd160 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

EXAMPLES
              % otp::otp-md5 -count 99 -seed host67821 &quot;My Secret Pass Phrase&quot;
              (binary gibberish)
              % otp::otp-md5 -words -count 99 -seed host67821 &quot;My Secret Pass Phrase&quot;
