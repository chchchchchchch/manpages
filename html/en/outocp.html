NAME
       outocp - debug an OCP file

SYNOPSIS
       outocp OCPFILE[.ocp]

DESCRIPTION
       outocp  is  used  for  debugging Omega Compiled Translation Process (OCP)
       files.  It generates some statistics about the OCP file,  and  then  runs
       through the states that the file defines.

       Omega Translation Processes are rules used to translate one character set
       to another and to choose between characters with one or more context-sen&#8208;
       sitive  variants.   OTPs could also be used to change the case or hyphen&#8208;
       ation of text.

BUGS
       None known, but report any found to &lt;omega@ens.fr&gt; (mailing list).
