NAME
       ovf2ovp - convert a virtual font file and its associated font metric file
       into property-list format

SYNOPSIS
       ovf2ovp [OPTIONS] OVFNAME[.ovf] [OFMNAME[.ofm] [OVPFILE[.ovp]]]

DESCRIPTION
       ovf2ovp translates a virtual font (OVF) file, OVFNAME, and its  companion
       font metric (OFM) file, OFMNAME, into a human-readable property-list for&#8208;
       mat.  The program writes to standard output (by default)  or  to  a  file
       specified as OVPNAME.

       The program also works with TeX VF and TFM files, producing TeX VP files.
       (ovf2ovp is based on the WEB source code for vftovp(1).)

OPTIONS
       -charcode-format=TYPE
              output character codes according to  TYPE,  which  can  be  either
              `hex&apos;  or  `ascii&apos;.   Default  is `hex&apos;.  ascii specifes all ASCII
              letters and digits; hex gets you everything else.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VFtoVP is an extended version of the program TFtoPL, which is part
              of the standard tex()ware library.  The idea of a virtual font was
              inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs who designed a similar  set
              of conventions in 1984 while developing a device driver for Arbor&#8208;
              Text, Inc.  He wrote a somewhat similar program called AMFtoXPL.
