AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VPtoVF is an extended version of the program PLtoTF, which is part
              of the standard TeXware library.  OVP2OVF is an  extended  version
              of  VPtoVF  that  allows much larger fonts.  The idea of a virtual
              font was inspired by the work of David R.  Fuchs  who  designed  a
              similar  set  of  conventions  in  1984  while developing a device
              driver for ArborText, Inc.  He wrote a  somewhat  similar  program
              called PLFONT.
