OWNERSHIP(8)                                                        OWNERSHIP(8)



NAME
       ownership - Compaq ownership tag retriever

SYNOPSIS
       ownership [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       ownership  retrieves  and  prints  the &quot;ownership tag&quot; that can be set on
       Compaq computers. Contrary to all other programs of the  dmidecode  pack&#8208;
       age,  ownership  doesn&apos;t  print  any version information, nor labels, but
       only the raw ownership tag. This should help its integration in scripts.


OPTIONS
       -d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit
