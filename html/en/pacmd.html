NAME
       pacmd - Reconfigure a PulseAudio sound server during runtime

SYNOPSIS
       pacmd

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool  can be used to introspect or reconfigure a running PulseAudio
       sound server during runtime. It connects to the sound server and offers a
       simple  live shell that can be used to enter the commands also understood
       in the default.pa configuration scripts.

       To exit the live shell, use ctrl+d. Note that the &apos;exit&apos;  command  inside
       the shell will tell the PulseAudio daemon itself to shutdown!

       If any arguments are passed on the command line, they will be passed into
       the live shell which will process the command and exit.
