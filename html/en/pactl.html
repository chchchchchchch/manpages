NAME
       pactl - Control a running PulseAudio sound server

SYNOPSIS
       pactl [options] COMMAND [ARGS ...]

       pactl --help

       pactl --version

DESCRIPTION
       pactl  can  be  used  to  issue  control commands to the PulseAudio sound
       server.

       pactl only exposes a subset of the available operations. For the full set
       use the pacmd(1).

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show help.

       --version
              Show version information.

       -s | --server=SERVER
              Choose the server to connect to.

       -n | --client-name=NAME
              Specify  the  client name pactl shall pass to the server when con&#8208;
              necting.

COMMANDS
       stat [short]
              Dump a few statistics about the memory  usage  of  the  PulseAudio
              daemon.  (Note: for backwards compatibility, we also show the out&#8208;
              put of the info command. In order to only show statistics, use the
              optional  short  argument.  In a future version of PA we will make
              this the default)

       info   Dump some info about the PulseAudio daemon.

       list [short] [TYPE]
              Dump all  currently  loaded  modules,  available  sinks,  sources,
              streams,  etc. TYPE must be one of: modules, sinks, sources, sink-
              inputs, source-outputs, clients, samples, cards. If not specified,
              all info is listed. If short is given, output is in a tabular for&#8208;
              mat, for easy parsing by scripts.

       exit   Asks the PulseAudio server to terminate.

       upload-sample FILENAME [NAME]
              Upload a sound from the  specified  audio  file  into  the  sample
              cache.  The  file  types supported are those understood by libsnd&#8208;
              file. The sample in the cache  is  named  after  the  audio  file,
              unless the name is explicitly specified.

       play-sample NAME [SINK]
              Play  the  specified sample from the sample cache. It is played on
              the default sink, unless the symbolic name or the numerical  index
              of the sink to play it on is specified.

       remove-sample NAME
              Remove the specified sample from the sample cache.
&#12;       load-module NAME [ARGUMENTS ...]
              Load  the  specified  module with the specified arguments into the
              running sound server. Prints the numeric index of the module  just
              loaded to STDOUT. You can use it to unload the module later.

       unload-module ID
              Unload  the  module  instance  identified by the specified numeric
              index.

       move-sink-input ID SINK
              Move the specified playback stream (identified  by  its  numerical
              index)  to  the specified sink (identified by its symbolic name or
              numerical index).

       move-source-output ID SOURCE
              Move the specified recording stream (identified by  its  numerical
              index) to the specified source (identified by its symbolic name or
              numerical index).

       suspend-sink SINK 1|0
              Suspend or resume the specified sink (which my be specified either
              by  its symbolic name, or by its numeric index), depending whether
              1 (suspend) or 0 (resume) is passed as last argument. Suspending a
              sink will pause all playback. Depending on the module implementing
              the sink this might have the effect that the underlying device  is
              closed,  making  it  available  for other applications to use. The
              exact behaviour depends on the module.

       suspend-source SOURCE 1|0
              Suspend or resume the specified  source  (which  my  be  specified
              either  by  its symbolic name, or by its numeric index), depending
              whether 1 (suspend) or 0 (resume) is passed as last argument. Sus&#8208;
              pending a source will pause all capturing. Depending on the module
              implementing the source this might have the effect that the under&#8208;
              lying device is closed, making it available for other applications
              to use. The exact behaviour depends on the module.

       set-card-profile CARD PROFILE
              Set the specified card (identified by its symbolic name or numeri&#8208;
              cal  index)  to  the specified profile (identified by its symbolic
              name).

       set-sink-port SINK PORT
              Set the specified sink (identified by its symbolic name or numeri&#8208;
              cal  index)  to  the  specified  port  (identified by its symbolic
              name).

       set-source-port SOURCE PORT
              Set the specified source  (identified  by  its  symbolic  name  or
              numerical index) to the specified port (identified by its symbolic
              name).

       set-sink-volume SINK VOLUME
              Set the volume of the specified sink (identified by  its  symbolic
              name  or  numerical  index). VOLUME can be specified as an integer

              age  (e.g.  10%, 100%) or a decibel value (e.g. 0dB, 20dB). If the
              volume specification start with a + or  -  the  volume  adjustment
              will be relative to the current sink volume.

       set-source-volume SOURCE VOLUME
              Set the volume of the specified source (identified by its symbolic
              name or numerical index). VOLUME can be specified  as  an  integer
              (e.g.  2000, 16384), a linear factor (e.g. 0.4, 1.100), a percent&#8208;
              age (e.g. 10%, 100%) or a decibel value (e.g. 0dB, 20dB).  If  the
              volume  specification  start  with  a + or - the volume adjustment
              will be relative to the current source volume.
&#12;       set-sink-input-volume INPUT VOLUME
              Set the volume of the specified  sink  input  (identified  by  its
              numerical  index).  VOLUME  can  be  specified as an integer (e.g.
              2000, 16384), a linear factor  (e.g.  0.4,  1.100),  a  percentage
              (e.g.  10%, 100%) or a decibel value (e.g. 0dB, 20dB). If the vol&#8208;
              ume specification start with a + or - the volume  adjustment  will
              be relative to the current sink input volume.

       set-source-output-volume OUTPUT VOLUME
              Set  the  volume of the specified source output (identified by its
              numerical index). VOLUME can be  specified  as  an  integer  (e.g.
              2000,  16384),  a  linear  factor  (e.g. 0.4, 1.100), a percentage
              (e.g. 10%, 100%) or a decibel value (e.g. 0dB, 20dB). If the  vol&#8208;
              ume  specification  start with a + or - the volume adjustment will
              be relative to the current source output volume.

       set-sink-mute SINK 1|0
              Set the mute status of the specified sink (identified by its  sym&#8208;
              bolic name or numerical index).

       set-source-mute SOURCE 1|0
              Set  the  mute  status  of the specified source (identified by its
              symbolic name or numerical index).

       set-sink-input-mute INPUT 1|0
              Set the mute status of the specified sink input (identified by its
              numerical index).

       set-source-output-mute INPUT 1|0
              Set  the mute status of the specified source output (identified by
              its numerical index).

       set-sink-formats SINK FORMATS
              Set the supported formats of the specified sink (identified by its
              numerical index) if supported by the sink. FORMATS is specified as
              a semi-colon (;) separated list of formats in the form &apos;encoding[,
              key1=value1,  key2=value2, ...]&apos; (for example, AC3 at 32000, 44100
              and 48000 Hz would be specified as &apos;ac3-iec61937, format.rate = &quot;[
              32000, 44100, 48000 ]&quot;&apos;).
