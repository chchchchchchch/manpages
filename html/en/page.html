NAME
       page - Parser Generator

SYNOPSIS
       page ?options...? ?input ?output??

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  application described by this document, page, is actually not just a
       parser generator, as the name implies, but a generic tool for the  execu&#8208;
       tion of arbitrary transformations on texts.

       Its  genericity  comes through the use of plugins for reading, transform&#8208;
       ing, and writing data, and the predefined  set  of  plugins  provided  by
       Tcllib  is for the generation of memoizing recursive descent parsers (aka
       packrat parsers) from grammar specifications  (Parsing  Expression  Gram&#8208;
       mars).

       page is written on top of the package page::pluginmgr, wrapping its func&#8208;
       tionality into a command line based application. All  the  other  page::*
       packages  are  plugin  and/or  supporting  packages for the generation of
       parsers. The parsers themselves are based on the  packages  grammar::peg,
       grammar::peg::interp, and grammar::mengine.

   COMMAND LINE
       page ?options...? ?input ?output??
              This  is  general form for calling page. The application will read
              the contents of the file input, process them under the control  of
              the  specified options, and then write the result to the file out&#8208;
              put.

              If input is the string - the data to process  will  be  read  from
              stdin instead of a file. Analogously the result will be written to
              stdout instead of a file if output is the string -. A missing out&#8208;
              put or input specification causes the application to assume -.

              The detailed specifications of the recognized options are provided
              in section OPTIONS.

              path input (in)
                     This argument specifies the path to the  file  to  be  pro&#8208;
                     cessed  by the application, or -. The last value causes the
                     application to read the text from stdin. Otherwise  it  has
                     to  exist, and be readable. If the argument is missing - is
                     assumed.

              path output (in)
                     This argument specifies where to write the generated  text.
                     It  can  be the path to a file, or -. The last value causes
                     the application to write the generated documented  to  std&#8208;
                     out.

                     If  the file output does not exist then [file dirname $out&#8208;
                     put] has to exist and must be a writable directory, as  the
                     application will create the fileto write to.

                     If the argument is missing - is assumed.

   OPERATION
       ... reading ... transforming ... writing - plugins - pipeline ...
&#12;   OPTIONS
       This  section  describes  all  the  options  available to the user of the
       application. Options are always processed in order. I.e. of  both  --help
       and --version are specified the option encountered first has precedence.

       Unknown options specified before any of the options -rd, -wr, or -tr will
       cause processing to abort  with  an  error.  Unknown  options  coming  in
       between  these  options,  or after the last of them are assumed to always
       take a single argument and are associated with  the  last  plugin  option
       coming  before them. They will be checked after all the relevant plugins,
       and thus the options  they  understand,  are  known.  I.e.  such  unknown
       options  cause error if and only if the plugin option they are associated
       with does not understand them, and was not superceded by a plugin  option
       coming after.

       Default  options are used if and only if the command line did not contain
       any options at all. They will set  the  application  up  as  a  PEG-based
       parser generator. The exact list of options is

              -c peg

       And now the recognized options and their arguments, if they have any:

       --help

       -h

       -?     When  one  of these options is found on the command line all argu&#8208;
              ments coming before or after are  ignored.  The  application  will
              print a short description of the recognized options and exit.

       --version

       -V     When  one  of these options is found on the command line all argu&#8208;
              ments coming before or after are  ignored.  The  application  will
              print its own revision and exit.

       -P     This  option  signals  the application to activate visual feedback
              while reading the input.

       -T     This option signals the application to  collect  statistics  while
              reading  the  input and to print them after reading has completed,
              before processing started.

       -D     This option signals the application to  activate  logging  in  the
              Safe base, for the debugging of problems with plugins.

       -r parser

       -rd parser

       --reader parser
              These  options  specify  the plugin the application has to use for
              reading the input. If the options are used multiple times the last
              one will be used.

       -w generator

       -wr generator

       --writer generator
              These  options  specify  the plugin the application has to use for
              generating and writing the final output. If the options  are  used
              multiple times the last one will be used.

       -t process

       -tr process

       --transform process
              These options specify a plugin to run on the input. In contrast to
              readers and writers each use will not supersede previous uses, but
              add each chosen plugin to a list of transformations, either at the
              front, or the end, per the last seen use of either  option  -p  or
              -a. The initial default is to append the new transformations.

       -a

       --append
              These  options signal the application that all following transfor&#8208;
              mations should be added at the end of the list of transformations.

       -p

       --prepend
              These options signal the application that all following  transfor&#8208;
              mations  should be added at the beginning of the list of transfor&#8208;
              mations.

       --reset
              This option signals the application to clear the list of transfor&#8208;
              mations. This is necessary to wipe out the default transformations
              used.

       -c file

       --configuration file
              This option causes the application to load  a  configuration  file
              and/or  plugin.  This is a plugin which in essence provides a pre-
              defined set of commandline options. They are processed exactly  as
              if  they  have been specified in place of the option and its argu&#8208;
              ments. This means that unknown options found at the  beginning  of
              the  configuration  file are associated with the last plugin, even
              if that plugin was specified before the configuration file itself.
              Conversely,  unknown  options  coming after the configuration file
              can be associated with a plugin specified in the file.

              If the argument is a file which cannot be loaded as a  plugin  the
              application  will  assume  that its contents are a list of options
              and their arguments,  separated  by  space,  tabs,  and  newlines.
              Options and argumentes containing spaces can be quoted via double-
              quotes (&quot;) and quotes (&apos;). The quote character  can  be  specified
              within  in  a  quoted  string by doubling it. Newlines in a quoted
              string are accepted as is.

   PLUGINS
       page makes use of four different types of plugins, namely: readers, writ&#8208;
       ers,  transformations,  and  configurations. Here we provide only a basic
       introduction on how to use them from page. The exact APIs provided to and
       expected  from  the  plugins  can  be  found  in  the  documentation  for
       page::pluginmgr, for those who wish to write their own plugins.

       Plugins are specified as arguments to the options -r,  -w,  -t,  -c,  and
       their equivalent longer forms. See the section OPTIONS for reference.

       Each  such  argument will be first treated as the name of a file and this
       file is loaded as the plugin. If however there is no file with that name,
       then  it  will be translated into the name of a package, and this package
       is then loaded. For each type of plugins the package management  searches
       not  only  the  regular  paths,  but a set application- and type-specific
       paths as well. Please see the section PLUGIN LOCATIONS for a  listing  of
       all paths and their sources.

       -c name
              Configurations.  The  name  of  the package for the plugin name is
              &quot;page::config::name&quot;.

              We have one predefined plugin:

              peg    It sets the application up as a parser generator  accepting
                     parsing expression grammars and writing a packrat parser in
                     Tcl. The actual arguments it specifies are:
&#12;
                       --reset
                       --append
                       --reader    peg
                       --transform reach
                       --transform use
                       --writer    me



       -r name
              Readers.  The  name  of  the  package  for  the  plugin  name   is
              &quot;page::reader::name&quot;.

              We have five predefined plugins:

              peg    Interprets  the input as a parsing expression grammar (PEG)
                     and generates a tree representation for it. Both the syntax
                     of  PEGs  and  the structure of the tree representation are
                     explained in their own manpages.

              hb     Interprets the input as Tcl code as generated by the writer
                     plugin hb and generates its tree representation.

              ser    Interprets the input as the serialization of a PEG, as gen&#8208;
                     erated by the writer plugin ser, using  the  package  gram&#8208;
                     mar::peg.

              lemon  Interprets  the  input as a grammar specification as under&#8208;
                     stood by Richard Hipp&apos;s LEMON parser generator  and  gener&#8208;
                     ates  a  tree  representation for it. Both the input syntax
                     and the structure of the tree representation are  explained
                     in their own manpages.

              treeser
                     Interprets   the   input   as   the   serialization   of  a
                     struct::tree. It is validated as such, but nothing else. It
                     is not assumed to be the tree representation of a grammar.

       -w name
              Writers.   The  name  of  the  package  for  the  plugin  name  is
              &quot;page::writer::name&quot;.

              We have eight predefined plugins:

              identity
                     Simply writes the incoming data as it  is,  without  making
                     any  changes. This is good for inspecting the raw result of
                     a reader or transformation.

              null   Generates nothing, and ignores the incoming data structure.

              tree   Assumes that the incoming data structure is a  struct::tree
                     and  generates  an  indented  textual representation of all
                     nodes, their parental relationships,  and  their  attribute
                     information.

              peg    Assumes  that  the incoming data structure is a tree repre&#8208;
                     sentation of a PEG or other other grammar and writes it out
                     as a PEG. The result is nicely formatted and partially sim&#8208;
                     plified (strings as  sequences  of  characters).  A  pretty
                     printer in essence, but can also be used to obtain a canon&#8208;
                     ical representation of the input grammar.

              tpc    Assumes that the incoming data structure is a  tree  repre&#8208;
                     sentation  of  a  PEG or other other grammar and writes out
                     Tcl code defining a package which  defines  a  grammar::peg
                     object  containing  the  grammar  when it is loaded into an
                     interpreter.

              hb     This is like the writer plugin tpc, but it writes only  the
                     statements  which define stat expression and grammar rules.
                     The code making the result a package is left out.

              ser    Assumes that the incoming data structure is a  tree  repre&#8208;
                     sentation  of  a  PEG or other other grammar, transforms it
                     internally into a grammar::peg object and  writes  out  its
                     serialization.

              me     Assumes  that  the incoming data structure is a tree repre&#8208;
                     sentation of a PEG or other other grammar  and  writes  out
                     Tcl  code  defining  a package which implements a memoizing
                     recursive descent parser based on  the  match  engine  (ME)
                     provided by the package grammar::mengine.

       -t name
              Transformers.  The  name  of  the  package  for the plugin name is
              &quot;page::transform::name&quot;.

              We have two predefined plugins:

              reach  Assumes that the incoming data structure is a  tree  repre&#8208;
                     sentation  of  a  PEG or other other grammar. It determines
                     which nonterminal symbols  and  rules  are  reachable  from
                     start-symbol/expression. All nonterminal symbols which were
                     not reached are removed.

              use    Assumes that the incoming data structure is a  tree  repre&#8208;
                     sentation  of  a  PEG or other other grammar. It determines
                     which nonterminal symbols and rules are able to generate  a
                     finite  sequences  of  terminal symbols (in the sense for a
                     Context Free Grammar). All nonterminal symbols  which  were
                     not deemed useful in this sense are removed.
