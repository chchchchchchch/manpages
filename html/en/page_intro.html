NAME
       page_intro - page introduction

DESCRIPTION
       page  (short  for  parser generator) stands for a set of related packages
       which help in the construction of parser generators, and other  utilities
       doing text processing.

       They  are  mainly  geared towards supporting the Tcllib application page,
       with the package page::pluginmgr in a central role as the plugin  manage&#8208;
       ment  for  the  application.  The other packages are performing low-level
       text processing and utility tasks geared towards  parser  generation  and
       mainly accessed by page through plugins.

       The packages implementing the plugins are not documented as regular pack&#8208;
       ages, as they cannot be loaded into a general  interpreter,  like  tclsh,
       without  extensive  preparation  of the interpreter. Preparation which is
       done for them by the plugin manager.
