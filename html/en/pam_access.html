PAM_ACCESS(8)                   Linux-PAM Manual                   PAM_ACCESS(8)



NAME
       pam_access - PAM module for logdaemon style login access control

SYNOPSIS
       pam_access.so [debug] [nodefgroup] [noaudit] [accessfile=file]
                     [fieldsep=sep] [listsep=sep]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It provides
       logdaemon style login access control based on login names, host or domain
       names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on terminal line names
       in case of non-networked logins.

       By default rules for access management are taken from config file
       /etc/security/access.conf if you don&apos;t specify another file.

       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when
       it denies access based on origin (host or tty).

OPTIONS
       accessfile=/path/to/access.conf
           Indicate an alternative access.conf style configuration file to
           override the default. This can be useful when different services need
           different access lists.

       debug
           A lot of debug information is printed with syslog(3).

       noaudit
           Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit
           subsystem.

       fieldsep=separators
           This option modifies the field separator character that pam_access
           will recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For
           example: fieldsep=| will cause the default `:&apos; character to be
           treated as part of a field value and `|&apos; becomes the field separator.
           Doing this may be useful in conjunction with a system that wants to
           use pam_access with X based applications, since the PAM_TTY item is
           likely to be of the form &quot;hostname:0&quot; which includes a `:&apos; character
           in its value. But you should not need this.

       listsep=separators
           This option modifies the list separator character that pam_access
           will recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For
           example: listsep=, will cause the default ` &apos; (space) and `\t&apos; (tab)
           characters to be treated as part of a list element value and `,&apos;
           becomes the only list element separator. Doing this may be useful on
           a system with group information obtained from a Windows domain, where
           the default built-in groups &quot;Domain Users&quot;, &quot;Domain Admins&quot; contain a
           space.

       nodefgroup
           User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be matched
           against the group database. The backwards compatible default is to
           try the group database match even for tokens not enclosed in
           parentheses.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       All module types (auth, account, password and session) are provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Access was granted.

       PAM_PERM_DENIED
           Access was not granted.

       PAM_IGNORE

           pam_setcred was called which does nothing.

       PAM_ABORT
           Not all relevant data or options could be gotten.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           The user is not known to the system.

FILES
       /etc/security/access.conf
           Default configuration file

SEE ALSO
       access.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(7).

AUTHORS
       The logdaemon style login access control scheme was designed and
       implemented by Wietse Venema. The pam_access PAM module was developed by
       Alexei Nogin &lt;alexei@nogin.dnttm.ru&gt;. The IPv6 support and the
       network(address) / netmask feature was developed and provided by Mike
       Becher &lt;mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de&gt;.
