PAM_CK_CONNECTOR(8)             ConsoleKit Manual            PAM_CK_CONNECTOR(8)



NAME
       pam_ck_connector - Register session with ConsoleKit

SYNOPSIS
       pam_ck_connector.so [debug]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_ck_connector PAM module registers a login session with the
       system-wide ConsoleKit daemon. This PAM module should be used with
       caution; only local login managers such as login(1) should use this.
       Since the ConsoleKit daemon can accept both an tty and an X11 display the
       normal parameters set by PAM are not always useful.

       An application can therefore override these with the PAM environment
       variables CKCON_TTY, CKCON_X11_DISPLAY and CKCON_X11_DISPLAY_DEVICE (the
       application should remember to unset these before starting the login
       session).

       Also note that the ConsoleKit daemon may reject registration attempts if
       the given set of data are inconsistent with each other. More more
       information, see the ConsoleKit documentation on the
       OpenSessionWithParameters() method call on the
       org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager D-Bus interface.

       If registration with the ConsoleKit daemon succeeds, this PAM module will
       set the environment variable XDG_SESSION_COOKIE which is used to defined
       membership of a login session.

       This PAM module has the side effect that it creates a connection to the
       system message bus that is kept open until the session ends. This is used
       by the ConsoleKit daemon to track the life-cycle of the session and, as
       such, should the login manager crash, the session will be properly
       unregistered.


OPTIONS
       debug

       nox11
          Do not create a session if PAM specifies an X11 display instead of a
          /dev/tty terminal.
