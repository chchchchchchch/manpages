PAM_ENV(8)                      Linux-PAM Manual                      PAM_ENV(8)



NAME
       pam_env - PAM module to set/unset environment variables

SYNOPSIS
       pam_env.so [debug] [conffile=conf-file] [envfile=env-file] [readenv=0|1]
                  [user_envfile=env-file] [user_readenv=0|1]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_env PAM module allows the (un)setting of environment variables.
       Supported is the use of previously set environment variables as well as
       PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST.

       By default rules for (un)setting of variables is taken from the config
       file /etc/security/pam_env.conf if no other file is specified.

       This module can also parse a file with simple KEY=VAL pairs on separate
       lines (/etc/environment by default). You can change the default file to
       parse, with the envfile flag and turn it on or off by setting the readenv
       flag to 1 or 0 respectively.

       Since setting of PAM environment variables can have side effects to other
       modules, this module should be the last one on the stack.

OPTIONS
       conffile=/path/to/pam_env.conf
           Indicate an alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file to
           override the default. This can be useful when different services need
           different environments.

       debug
           A lot of debug information is printed with syslog(3).

       envfile=/path/to/environment
           Indicate an alternative environment file to override the default.
           This can be useful when different services need different
           environments.

       readenv=0|1
           Turns on or off the reading of the file specified by envfile (0 is
           off, 1 is on). By default this option is on.

       user_envfile=filename
           Indicate an alternative .pam_environment file to override the
           default. This can be useful when different services need different
           environments. The filename is relative to the user home directory.

       user_readenv=0|1
           Turns on or off the reading of the user specific environment file. 0
           is off, 1 is on. By default this option is on.
