PAM_EXEC(8)                     Linux-PAM Manual                     PAM_EXEC(8)



NAME
       pam_exec - PAM module which calls an external command

SYNOPSIS
       pam_exec.so [debug] [expose_authtok] [seteuid] [quiet] [log=file] command
                   [...]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_exec is a PAM module that can be used to run an external command.

       The child&apos;s environment is set to the current PAM environment list, as
       returned by pam_getenvlist(3) In addition, the following PAM items are
       exported as environment variables: PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE,
       PAM_TTY, PAM_USER and PAM_TYPE, which contains one of the module types:
       account, auth, password, open_session and close_session.

       Commands called by pam_exec need to be aware of that the user can have
       controll over the environment.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Print debug information.

       expose_authtok
           During authentication the calling command can read the password from
           stdin(3).

       log=file
           The output of the command is appended to file

       quiet
           Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status of the external
           command if it fails. Specifying this option will suppress the
           message.

       seteuid
           Per default pam_exec.so will execute the external command with the
           real user ID of the calling process. Specifying this option means the
           command is run with the effective user ID.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       All module types (auth, account, password and session) are provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The external command was run successfully.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           No argument or a wrong number of arguments were given.

       PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
           A system error occurred or the command to execute failed.

       PAM_IGNORE

           pam_setcred was called, which does not execute the command.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to rebuild the NIS database
       after each local password change:

                   password optional pam_exec.so seteuid /usr/bin/make -C /var/yp


       This will execute the command

           make -C /var/yp

       with effective user ID.
