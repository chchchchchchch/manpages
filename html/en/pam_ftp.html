PAM_FTP(8)                      Linux-PAM Manual                      PAM_FTP(8)



NAME
       pam_ftp - PAM module for anonymous access module

SYNOPSIS
       pam_ftp.so [debug] [ignore] [users=XXX,YYY,...]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_ftp is a PAM module which provides a pluggable anonymous ftp mode of
       access.

       This module intercepts the user&apos;s name and password. If the name is ftp
       or anonymous, the user&apos;s password is broken up at the @ delimiter into a
       PAM_RUSER and a PAM_RHOST part; these pam-items being set accordingly.
       The username (PAM_USER) is set to ftp. In this case the module succeeds.
       Alternatively, the module sets the PAM_AUTHTOK item with the entered
       password and fails.

       This module is not safe and easily spoofable.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Print debug information.

       ignore
           Pay no attention to the email address of the user (if supplied).

       ftp=XXX,YYY,...
           Instead of ftp or anonymous, provide anonymous login to the comma
           separated list of users: XXX,YYY,.... Should the applicant enter one
           of these usernames the returned username is set to the first in the
           list: XXX.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the auth module type is provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The authentication was successful.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/ftpd to handle ftp style anonymous
       login:

           #
           # ftpd; add ftp-specifics. These lines enable anonymous ftp over
           #       standard UN*X access (the listfile entry blocks access to
           #       users listed in /etc/ftpusers)
           #
           auth    sufficient  pam_ftp.so
           auth    required    pam_unix.so use_first_pass
           auth    required    pam_listfile.so \
                      onerr=succeed item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers
