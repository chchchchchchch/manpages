NAME
       pam_lastlog - PAM module to display date of last login

SYNOPSIS
       pam_lastlog.so [debug] [silent] [never] [nodate] [nohost] [noterm]
                      [nowtmp] [noupdate] [showfailed]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about the
       last login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the
       /var/log/lastlog file.

       Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such cases,
       this module is not necessary.

       never
           If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries for the
           user, indicate that the user has never previously logged in with a
