PAM_LOGINUID(8)                 Linux-PAM Manual                 PAM_LOGINUID(8)



NAME
       pam_loginuid - Record user&apos;s login uid to the process attribute

SYNOPSIS
       pam_loginuid.so [require_auditd]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_loginuid module sets the loginuid process attribute for the
       process that was authenticated. This is necessary for applications to be
       correctly audited. This PAM module should only be used for entry point
       applications like: login, sshd, gdm, vsftpd, crond and atd. There are
       probably other entry point applications besides these. You should not use
       it for applications like sudo or su as that defeats the purpose by
       changing the loginuid to the account they just switched to.

OPTIONS
       require_auditd
           This option, when given, will cause this module to query the audit
           daemon status and deny logins if it is not running.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the session module type is provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           An error occurred during session management.

EXAMPLES
           #%PAM-1.0
           auth       required     pam_unix.so
           auth       required     pam_nologin.so
           account    required     pam_unix.so
           password   required     pam_unix.so
           session    required     pam_unix.so
           session    required     pam_loginuid.so
