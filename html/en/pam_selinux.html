PAM_SELINUX(8)                  Linux-PAM Manual                  PAM_SELINUX(8)



NAME
       pam_selinux - PAM module to set the default security context

SYNOPSIS
       pam_selinux.so [close] [debug] [open] [nottys] [verbose] [select_context]
                      [env_params] [use_current_range]

DESCRIPTION
       In a nutshell, pam_selinux sets up the default security context for the
       next execed shell.

       When an application opens a session using pam_selinux, the shell that
       gets executed will be run in the default security context, or if the user
       chooses and the pam file allows the selected security context. Also the
       controlling tty will have it&apos;s security context modified to match the
       users.

       Adding pam_selinux into a pam file could cause other pam modules to
       change their behavior if the exec another application. The close and open
       option help mitigate this problem. close option will only cause the close
       portion of the pam_selinux to execute, and open will only cause the open
       portion to run. You can add pam_selinux to the config file twice. Add the
       pam_selinux close as the executes the open pass through the modules,
       pam_selinux open_session will happen last. When PAM executes the close
       pass through the modules pam_selinux close_session will happen first.

OPTIONS
       close
           Only execute the close_session portion of the module.

       debug
           Turns on debugging via syslog(3).

       open
           Only execute the open_session portion of the module.

       nottys
           Do not try to setup the ttys security context.

       verbose
           attempt to inform the user when security context is set.

       select_context
           Attempt to ask the user for a custom security context role. If MLS is
           on ask also for sensitivity level.

       env_params
           Attempt to obtain a custom security context role from PAM
           environment. If MLS is on obtain also sensitivity level. This option
           and the select_context option are mutually exclusive. The respective
           PAM environment variables are SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED,
           SELINUX_LEVEL_REQUESTED, and SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE. The first two
           variables are self describing and the last one if set to 1 makes the
           PAM module behave as if the use_current_range was specified on the
           command line of the module.

       use_current_range
           Use the sensitivity level of the current process for the user context
           instead of the default level. Also suppresses asking of the
           sensitivity level from the user or obtaining it from PAM environment.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the session module type is provided.
&#12;RETURN VALUES
       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Unable to get or set a valid context.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           The security context was set successfully.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           The user is not known to the system.

EXAMPLES
           auth     required  pam_unix.so
           session  required  pam_permit.so
           session  optional  pam_selinux.so
