PAM_SEPERMIT(8)                 Linux-PAM Manual                 PAM_SEPERMIT(8)



NAME
       pam_sepermit - PAM module to allow/deny login depending on SELinux
       enforcement state

SYNOPSIS
       pam_sepermit.so [debug] [conf=/path/to/config/file]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_sepermit module allows or denies login depending on SELinux
       enforcement state.

       When the user which is logging in matches an entry in the config file he
       is allowed access only when the SELinux is in enforcing mode. Otherwise
       he is denied access. For users not matching any entry in the config file
       the pam_sepermit module returns PAM_IGNORE return value.

       The config file contains a list of user names one per line with optional
       arguments. If the name is prefixed with @ character it means that all
       users in the group name match. If it is prefixed with a % character the
       SELinux user is used to match against the name instead of the account
       name. Note that when SELinux is disabled the SELinux user assigned to the
       account cannot be determined. This means that such entries are never
       matched when SELinux is disabled and pam_sepermit will return PAM_IGNORE.

       See sepermit.conf(5) for details.
