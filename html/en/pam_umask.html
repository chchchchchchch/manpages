PAM_UMASK(8)                    Linux-PAM Manual                    PAM_UMASK(8)



NAME
       pam_umask - PAM module to set the file mode creation mask

SYNOPSIS
       pam_umask.so [debug] [silent] [usergroups] [umask=mask]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_umask is a PAM module to set the file mode creation mask of the
       current environment. The umask affects the default permissions assigned
       to newly created files.

       The PAM module tries to get the umask value from the following places in
       the following order:

       &#183;   umask= argument

       &#183;   umask= entry of the users GECOS field

       &#183;   pri= entry of the users GECOS field

       &#183;   ulimit= entry of the users GECOS field

       &#183;   UMASK= entry from /etc/default/login

       &#183;   UMASK entry from /etc/login.defs

       usergroups
           If the user is not root and the username is the same as primary group
           name, the umask group bits are set to be the same as owner bits
           (examples: 022 -&gt; 002, 077 -&gt; 007).
