NAME
       pamstack - stack planes of multiple PAM images into one PAM image

SYNOPSIS
       pamstack [-tupletype tupletype] [inputfilespec]

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  multiple  PAM or PNM images as input. Produces a PAM image as out&#8208;
       put, consisting of all the planes (channels) of the  inputs,  stacked  in
       the order specified.

       The output is the same dimensions as the inputs, except that the depth is
       the sum of the depths of the inputs. It has the  same  maxval.   pamstack
       fails  if  the inputs are not all the same width, height, and maxval. The
       tuple type is a null string unless you specify the -tupletype option.

       pamchannel does the opposite of pamstack: It extracts  individual  planes
       from a single PAM.

       Use  pamtopnm  to  convert a suitable PAM image to a more traditional PNM
       (PBM, PGM, or PPM) image.

       One example of using pamstack is that  some  Netpbm  programs  accept  as
       input  a  PAM that represents graphic image with transparency information
       -- tuple type &quot;RGBA&quot;. In Netpbm, such images  were  traditionally  repre&#8208;
       sented  as  two  images  -  a  PPM for the color and a PGM for the trans&#8208;
       parency. To convert a PPM/PGM pair into PAM(RGBA) input that  newer  pro&#8208;
       grams require, do something like this:

       pamstack -tupletype=RGBA myimage.ppm myalpha.pgm | pamtouil &gt;myimage.uil


OPTIONS
       -tupletype tupletype
              This  specified  the tuple type name to be recorded in the output.
              You may use any string up to 255 characters. Some programs  recog&#8208;
              nize  some  names. If you omit this option, the default tuple type
              name is null.
