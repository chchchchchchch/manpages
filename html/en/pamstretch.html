NAME
       pamstretch - scale up a PNM or PAM image by interpolating between pixels

SYNOPSIS
       pamstretch [-xscale=X] [-yscale=Y]
       [-blackedge] [-dropedge] N [infile]

       You  can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can use
       two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an  option  name  from  its
       value with white space instead of an equals sign.


DESCRIPTION
       pamstretch scales up pictures by integer values, either vertically, hori&#8208;
       zontally, or both.  pamstretch differs from pnmscale  and  pnmenlarge  in
       that  when  it inserts the additional rows and columns, instead of making
       the new row or column a copy of its neighbor, pamstretch  makes  the  new
       row  or  column  an interpolation between its neighbors.  In some images,
       this produces better looking output.

       To scale up to non-integer pixel sizes, e.g. 2.5,  try  pamstretch-gen(1)
       instead.

       Options let you select alternative methods of dealing with the right/bot&#8208;
       tom edges of the picture.  Since the interpolation is  done  between  the
       top-left  corners  of  the  scaled-up pixels, it&apos;s not obvious what to do
       with the right/bottom edges.  The default behaviour is to scale those  up
       without  interpolation  (more  precisely, the right edge is only interpo&#8208;
       lated vertically, and the bottom edge is only interpolated horizontally),
       but  there  are  two  other  possibilities, selected by the blackedge and
       dropedge options.



PARAMETERS
       The N parameter is the scale factor.  It is valid only if you don&apos;t spec&#8208;
       ify  -xscale  or -yscale.  In that case, pamstretch scales in both dimen&#8208;
       sions and by the scale factor N.


OPTIONS
       -xscale=X
              This is the horizontal scale factor.  If you don&apos;t  specify  this,
              but  do specify a vertical scale factor, the horizontal scale fac&#8208;
              tor is 1.


       -yscale=Y
              This is the vertical scale factor.  If you don&apos;t specify this, but
              do specify a horizontal scale factor, the vertical scale factor is
              1.


       -blackedge
              interpolate to black at right/bottom edges.
       -dropedge
              drop one (source) pixel at right/bottom edges.  This  is  arguably
              more  logical  than  the default behaviour, but it means producing
              output which is a slightly odd size.

BUGS
       Usually produces fairly ugly output for PBMs. For most PBM  input  you&apos;ll
       probably  want  to  reduce  the `noise&apos; first using something like pnmnl&#8208;
       filt(1).
