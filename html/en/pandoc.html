PANDOC(1)                                                              PANDOC(1)



NAME
       pandoc - general markup converter

SYNOPSIS
       pandoc [options] [input-file]...

DESCRIPTION
       Pandoc  is  a  Haskell  library  for converting from one markup format to
       another, and a command-line tool that uses this  library.   It  can  read
       markdown  and  (subsets  of)  Textile, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, and
       DocBook XML; and it can write  plain  text,  markdown,  reStructuredText,
       XHTML,  HTML  5, LaTeX (including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, Doc&#8208;
       Book XML, OpenDocument  XML,  ODT,  Word  docx,  GNU  Texinfo,  MediaWiki
       markup,  EPUB,  Textile,  groff  man pages, Emacs Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, and
       Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, or S5 HTML slide shows.  It can  also  produce
       PDF output on systems where LaTeX is installed.

       Pandoc&apos;s  enhanced  version  of  markdown  includes syntax for footnotes,
       tables, flexible ordered lists, definition lists, delimited code  blocks,
       superscript, subscript, strikeout, title blocks, automatic tables of con&#8208;
       tents, embedded LaTeX math, citations, and  markdown  inside  HTML  block
       elements.   (These enhancements, described below under Pandoc&apos;s markdown,
       can be disabled using the --strict option.)

       In contrast to most existing tools for converting markdown to HTML, which
       use  regex  substitutions,  Pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a
       set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce  a  native
       representation  of the document, and a set of writers, which convert this
       native representation into a target format.  Thus,  adding  an  input  or
       output format requires only adding a reader or writer.

   Using pandoc
       If  no input-file is specified, input is read from stdin.  Otherwise, the
       input-files are concatenated (with a blank line between each) and used as
       input.  Output goes to stdout by default (though output to stdout is dis&#8208;
       abled for the odt, docx, and epub output formats).  For output to a file,
       use the -o option:

              pandoc -o output.html input.txt

       Instead  of  a  file,  an absolute URI may be given.  In this case pandoc
       will fetch the content using HTTP:

              pandoc -f html -t markdown http://www.fsf.org

       If multiple input files are given, pandoc will concatenate them all (with
       blank lines between them) before parsing.

       The format of the input and output can be specified explicitly using com&#8208;
       mand-line options.  The input format can be specified using the -r/--read
       or  -f/--from  options, the output format using the -w/--write or -t/--to
       options.  Thus, to convert hello.txt from markdown to  LaTeX,  you  could
       type:

              pandoc -f markdown -t latex hello.txt

       To convert hello.html from html to markdown:

              pandoc -f html -t markdown hello.html

       Supported output formats are listed below under the -t/--to option.  Sup&#8208;
       ported input formats are listed below under the -f/--from  option.   Note
       that  the  rst,  textile, latex, and html readers are not complete; there
       are some constructs that they do not parse.

       If the input or output format is not specified  explicitly,  pandoc  will
       attempt  to  guess  it  from the extensions of the input and output file&#8208;
       names.  Thus, for example,

              pandoc -o hello.tex hello.txt

       will convert hello.txt from markdown to LaTeX.   If  no  output  file  is
       specified (so that output goes to stdout), or if the output file&apos;s exten&#8208;
       sion is unknown, the output format will default to  HTML.   If  no  input
       file  is  specified  (so  that  input  comes from stdin), or if the input
       files&apos; extensions are unknown, the input format will  be  assumed  to  be
       markdown unless explicitly specified.

       Pandoc  uses  the UTF-8 character encoding for both input and output.  If
       your local character encoding is not UTF-8, you  should  pipe  input  and
       output through iconv:

              iconv -t utf-8 input.txt | pandoc | iconv -f utf-8

   Creating a PDF
       Earlier  versions  of pandoc came with a program, markdown2pdf, that used
       pandoc and pdflatex to produce a PDF.  This is no  longer  needed,  since
       pandoc can now produce pdf output itself.  To produce a PDF, simply spec&#8208;
       ify an output file with a .pdf extension.  Pandoc  will  create  a  latex
       file  and use pdflatex (or another engine, see --latex-engine) to convert
       it to PDF:

              pandoc test.txt -o test.pdf

       Production of a PDF requires  that  a  LaTeX  engine  be  installed  (see
       --latex-engine, below), and assumes that the following LaTeX packages are
       available: amssymb, amsmath, ifxetex, ifluatex, listings (if the  --list&#8208;
       ings  option is used), fancyvrb, enumerate, ctable, url, graphicx, hyper&#8208;
       ref, ulem, babel (if the lang variable is set), fontspec (if  xelatex  or
       lualatex  is  used as the LaTeX engine), xltxtra and xunicode (if xelatex
       is used).

   hsmarkdown
       A user who wants a drop-in replacement for Markdown.pl may create a  sym&#8208;
       bolic  link  to  the  pandoc  executable called hsmarkdown.  When invoked
       under the name hsmarkdown, pandoc will behave as if the --strict flag had
       been  selected, and no command-line options will be recognized.  However,
       this approach does not work under Cygwin, due to problems with its  simu&#8208;
       lation of symbolic links.

OPTIONS
   General options
       -f FORMAT, -r FORMAT,
              --from=FORMAT,  --read=FORMAT Specify input format.  FORMAT can be
              native (native Haskell), json (JSON version of native AST),  mark&#8208;
              down  (markdown),  textile (Textile), rst (reStructuredText), html
              (HTML), docbook (DocBook XML),  or  latex  (LaTeX).   If  +lhs  is
              appended  to  markdown,  rst,  latex, the input will be treated as
              literate Haskell source: see Literate Haskell support, below.

       -t FORMAT, -w FORMAT,
              --to=FORMAT, --write=FORMAT Specify output format.  FORMAT can  be
              native  (native Haskell), json (JSON version of native AST), plain
              (plain text), markdown (markdown),  rst  (reStructuredText),  html
              (XHTML  1),  html5  (HTML  5), latex (LaTeX), beamer (LaTeX beamer
              slide show), context (ConTeXt), man (groff man), mediawiki  (Medi&#8208;
              aWiki  markup),  textile  (Textile), org (Emacs Org-Mode), texinfo
              (GNU Texinfo), docbook (DocBook XML),  opendocument  (OpenDocument
              XML), odt (OpenOffice text document), docx (Word docx), epub (EPUB
              book), asciidoc (AsciiDoc), slidy (Slidy HTML and javascript slide
              show),  slideous  (Slideous  HTML and javascript slide show), dzs&#8208;
              lides (HTML5 + javascript slide show), s5 (S5 HTML and  javascript
              slide  show),  or  rtf (rich text format).  Note that odt and epub
              output will not be directed to stdout; an output filename must  be
              specified  using  the  -o/--output option.  If +lhs is appended to
              markdown, rst, latex, beamer, html, or html5, the output  will  be
              rendered as literate Haskell source: see Literate Haskell support,
              below.

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write output to FILE instead of stdout.  If FILE is -, output will
              go  to  stdout.  (Exception: if the output format is odt, docx, or
              epub, output to stdout is disabled.)

       --data-dir=DIRECTORY
              Specify the user data directory to search for pandoc  data  files.
              If  this  option is not specified, the default user data directory
              will be used:

                     $HOME/.pandoc

              in unix and

                     C:\Documents And Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\pandoc

              in  Windows.   A   reference.odt,   reference.docx,   default.csl,
              epub.css,  templates,  slidy,  slideous, or s5 directory placed in
              this directory will override pandoc&apos;s normal defaults.

       -v, --version
              Print version.

       -h, --help
              Show usage message.

   Reader options
       --strict
              Use strict markdown syntax, with no pandoc extensions or variants.
              When  the  input  format  is HTML, this means that constructs that
              have no equivalents in standard markdown (e.g.   definition  lists
              or strikeout text) will be parsed as raw HTML.

       -R, --parse-raw
              Parse untranslatable HTML codes and LaTeX environments as raw HTML
              or LaTeX, instead of ignoring them.  Affects only HTML  and  LaTeX
              input.   Raw  HTML  can  be printed in markdown, reStructuredText,
              HTML, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, and S5 output; raw LaTeX  can  be
              printed  in markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and ConTeXt output.
              The default is for the readers to omit untranslatable  HTML  codes
              and  LaTeX  environments.   (The  LaTeX  reader  does pass through
              untranslatable LaTeX commands, even if -R is not specified.)

       -S, --smart
              Produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes
              to  curly  quotes,  ---  to em-dashes, -- to en-dashes, and ... to
              ellipses.  Nonbreaking spaces are inserted after certain abbrevia&#8208;
              tions,  such  as &quot;Mr.&quot; (Note: This option is significant only when
              the input format is markdown or textile.  It is selected automati&#8208;
              cally  when  the  input  format is textile or the output format is
              latex or context, unless --no-tex-ligatures is used.)

       --old-dashes
              Selects the pandoc &lt;= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart dashes: -
              before a numeral is an en-dash, and -- is an em-dash.  This option
              is selected automatically for textile input.

       --base-header-level=NUMBER
              Specify the base level for headers (defaults to 1).

       --indented-code-classes=CLASSES
              Specify classes to use  for  indented  code  blocks--for  example,
              perl,numberLines or haskell.  Multiple classes may be separated by
              spaces or commas.

       --normalize
              Normalize the document after reading: merge adjacent Str  or  Emph
              elements, for example, and remove repeated Spaces.

       -p, --preserve-tabs
              Preserve tabs instead of converting them to spaces (the default).

       --tab-stop=NUMBER
              Specify the number of spaces per tab (default is 4).

   General writer options
       -s, --standalone
              Produce  output  with  an  appropriate  header and footer (e.g.  a
              standalone HTML, LaTeX, or RTF file, not a fragment).  This option
              is set automatically for pdf, epub, docx, and odt output.

       --template=FILE
              Use FILE as a custom template for the generated document.  Implies
              --standalone.  See Templates below for a description  of  template
              syntax.   If no extension is specified, an extension corresponding
              to the writer will be added, so that --template=special looks  for
              special.html  for HTML output.  If the template is not found, pan&#8208;
              doc will search for it in the user  data  directory  (see  --data-
              dir).   If this option is not used, a default template appropriate
              for the output format will be  used  (see  -D/--print-default-tem&#8208;
              plate).

       -V KEY[=VAL],
              --variable=KEY[:VAL]  Set  the  template variable KEY to the value
              VAL when rendering the document in standalone mode.  This is  gen&#8208;
              erally only useful when the --template option is used to specify a
              custom template, since pandoc  automatically  sets  the  variables
              used  in  the  default templates.  If no VAL is specified, the key
              will be given the value true.

       -D FORMAT,
              --print-default-template=FORMAT Print the default template for  an
              output FORMAT.  (See -t for a list of possible FORMATs.)

       --no-wrap
              Disable  text  wrapping  in  output.   By default, text is wrapped
              appropriately for the output format.

       --columns=NUMBER
              Specify length of lines in characters (for text wrapping).

       --toc, --table-of-contents
              Include an automatically generated table of contents (or,  in  the
              case  of latex, context, and rst, an instruction to create one) in
              the output document.  This option has no effect on  man,  docbook,
              slidy, slideous, or s5 output.

       --no-highlight
              Disables  syntax  highlighting  for  code blocks and inlines, even
              when a language attribute is given.
&#12;       --highlight-style=STYLE
              Specifies the coloring style to  be  used  in  highlighted  source
              code.   Options  are  pygments  (the  default),  kate, monochrome,
              espresso, zenburn, haddock, and tango.

       -H FILE, --include-in-header=FILE
              Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at  the  end  of  the  header.
              This  can  be  used,  for  example,  to  include  special  CSS  or
              javascript in HTML documents.  This option can be used  repeatedly
              to include multiple files in the header.  They will be included in
              the order specified.  Implies --standalone.

       -B FILE,
              --include-before-body=FILE Include contents of FILE, verbatim,  at
              the  beginning of the document body (e.g.  after the &lt;body&gt; tag in
              HTML, or the \begin{document} command in LaTeX).  This can be used
              to  include  navigation  bars  or banners in HTML documents.  This
              option can be used repeatedly to  include  multiple  files.   They
              will be included in the order specified.  Implies --standalone.

       -A FILE,
              --include-after-body=FILE  Include  contents of FILE, verbatim, at
              the end of the document body (before the &lt;/body&gt; tag in  HTML,  or
              the  \end{document} command in LaTeX).  This option can be be used
              repeatedly to include multiple files.  They will  be  included  in
              the order specified.  Implies --standalone.

   Options affecting specific writers
       --self-contained
              Produce  a  standalone  HTML  file  with no external dependencies,
              using data: URIs to incorporate the contents  of  linked  scripts,
              stylesheets,  images,  and  videos.   The resulting file should be
              &quot;self-contained,&quot; in the sense that it needs no external files and
              no  net access to be displayed properly by a browser.  This option
              works only  with  HTML  output  formats,  including  html,  html5,
              html+lhs,  html5+lhs, s5, slidy, slideous, and dzslides.  Scripts,
              images, and stylesheets at absolute URLs will be downloaded; those
              at  relative  URLs  will  be  sought first relative to the working
              directory, then relative to the user data directory  (see  --data-
              dir), and finally relative to pandoc&apos;s default data directory.

       --offline
              Deprecated synonym for --self-contained.

       -5, --html5
              Produce  HTML5  instead  of  HTML4.  This option has no effect for
              writers other than html.  (Deprecated: Use the html5 output format
              instead.)

       --ascii
              Use only ascii characters in output.  Currently supported only for
              HTML output (which uses numerical entities instead of  UTF-8  when
              this option is selected).

       --reference-links
              Use  reference-style  links,  rather than inline links, in writing
              markdown or reStructuredText.  By default inline links are used.

       --atx-headers
              Use ATX style headers in markdown output.  The default is  to  use
              setext-style headers for levels 1-2, and then ATX headers.

       --chapters
              Treat top-level headers as chapters in LaTeX, ConTeXt, and DocBook
              output.  When the LaTeX template uses the report, book, or  memoir
              class,  this  option  is  implied.  If --beamer is used, top-level
              headers will become \part{..}.

       -N, --number-sections
              Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt,  or  HTML  output.   By
              default, sections are not numbered.

       --no-tex-ligatures
              Do not convert quotation marks, apostrophes, and dashes to the TeX
              ligatures when writing LaTeX or ConTeXt.  Instead, just  use  lit&#8208;
              eral  unicode characters.  This is needed for using advanced Open&#8208;
              Type features with XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.  Note:  normally  --smart
              is  selected  automatically  for  LaTeX and ConTeXt output, but it
              must be specified explicitly if  --no-tex-ligatures  is  selected.
              If  you  use  literal  curly  quotes, dashes, and ellipses in your
              source, then  you  may  want  to  use  --no-tex-ligatures  without
              --smart.

       --listings
              Use listings package for LaTeX code blocks

       -i, --incremental
              Make list items in slide shows display incrementally (one by one).
              The default is for lists to be displayed all at once.

       --slide-level=NUMBER
              Specifies that headers with the specified level create slides (for
              beamer,  s5, slidy, slideous, dzslides).  Headers above this level
              in the hierarchy are used to divide the slide show into  sections;
              headers  below  this  level  create  subheads within a slide.  The
              default is to set the slide level based on  the  contents  of  the
              document; see Structuring the slide show, below.

       --section-divs
              Wrap  sections  in  &lt;div&gt;  tags  (or &lt;section&gt; tags in HTML5), and
              attach identifiers to the enclosing &lt;div&gt;  (or  &lt;section&gt;)  rather
              than the header itself.  See Section identifiers, below.

       --email-obfuscation=none|javascript|references
              Specify  a method for obfuscating mailto: links in HTML documents.
              none leaves mailto: links as they are.  javascript obfuscates them
              using  javascript.   references  obfuscates them by printing their
              letters  as  decimal  or  hexadecimal  character  references.   If
              --strict  is specified, references is used regardless of the pres&#8208;
              ence of this option.

       --id-prefix=STRING
              Specify a prefix to be added to all automatically generated  iden&#8208;
              tifiers  in  HTML output.  This is useful for preventing duplicate
              identifiers when generating fragments  to  be  included  in  other
              pages.

       -T STRING, --title-prefix=STRING
              Specify  STRING  as  a  prefix  at the beginning of the title that
              appears in the HTML header (but not in the title as it appears  at
              the beginning of the HTML body).  Implies --standalone.

       -c URL, --css=URL
              Link to a CSS style sheet.

       --reference-odt=FILE
              Use  the  specified file as a style reference in producing an ODT.
              For best results, the reference ODT should be a  modified  version
              of  an  ODT  produced using pandoc.  The contents of the reference
              ODT are ignored, but its stylesheets are used in the new ODT.   If
              no  reference  ODT  is  specified on the command line, pandoc will
              look for a file reference.odt in  the  user  data  directory  (see
              --data-dir).   If this is not found either, sensible defaults will
              be used.

       --reference-docx=FILE
              Use the specified file as a style reference in  producing  a  docx
              file.   For  best results, the reference docx should be a modified
              version of a docx file produced using pandoc.  The contents of the
              reference  docx  are  ignored, but its stylesheets are used in the
              new docx.  If no reference docx is specified on the command  line,
              pandoc will look for a file reference.docx in the user data direc&#8208;
              tory (see --data-dir).  If this  is  not  found  either,  sensible
              defaults will be used.

       --epub-stylesheet=FILE
              Use the specified CSS file to style the EPUB.  If no stylesheet is
              specified, pandoc will look for a file epub.css in the  user  data
              directory  (see  --data-dir).   If it is not found there, sensible
              defaults will be used.

       --epub-cover-image=FILE
              Use the specified image as the EPUB cover.  It is recommended that
              the image be less than 1000px in width and height.

       --epub-metadata=FILE
              Look  in  the  specified  XML file for metadata for the EPUB.  The
              file should contain a series of Dublin  Core  elements,  as  docu&#8208;
              mented at http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/.  For example:

                      &lt;dc:rights&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/dc:rights&gt;
                      &lt;dc:language&gt;es-AR&lt;/dc:language&gt;

              By  default,  pandoc will include the following metadata elements:
              &lt;dc:title&gt; (from the document title), &lt;dc:creator&gt; (from the docu&#8208;
              ment  authors), &lt;dc:date&gt; (from the document date, which should be
              in ISO 8601 format), &lt;dc:language&gt; (from the lang variable, or, if
              is  not  set, the locale), and &lt;dc:identifier id=&quot;BookId&quot;&gt; (a ran&#8208;
              domly generated UUID).  Any of these may be overridden by elements
              in the metadata file.

       --epub-embed-font=FILE
              Embed the specified font in the EPUB.  This option can be repeated
              to embed multiple fonts.  To use embedded fonts, you will need  to
              add  declarations  like  the  following  to  your CSS (see --epub-
              stylesheet):

                     @font-face {
                     font-family: DejaVuSans;
                     font-style: normal;
                     font-weight: normal;
                     src:url(&quot;DejaVuSans-Regular.ttf&quot;);
                     }
                     @font-face {
                     font-family: DejaVuSans;
                     font-style: normal;
                     font-weight: bold;
                     src:url(&quot;DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf&quot;);
                     }
                     @font-face {
                     font-family: DejaVuSans;
                     font-style: italic;
                     font-weight: normal;
                     src:url(&quot;DejaVuSans-Oblique.ttf&quot;);
                     }
                     @font-face {
                     font-family: DejaVuSans;
                     font-style: italic;
                     font-weight: bold;
                     src:url(&quot;DejaVuSans-BoldOblique.ttf&quot;);
                     }
                     body { font-family: &quot;DejaVuSans&quot;; }

       --latex-engine=pdflatex|lualatex|xelatex
              Use the specified LaTeX engine when  producing  PDF  output.   The
              default  is pdflatex.  If the engine is not in your PATH, the full
              path of the engine may be specified here.

   Citations
       --bibliography=FILE
              Specify bibliography database to be used in  resolving  citations.
              The  database  type will be determined from the extension of FILE,
              which may be .mods (MODS format), .bib  (BibTeX/BibLaTeX  format),
              .ris  (RIS  format), .enl (EndNote format), .xml (EndNote XML for&#8208;
              mat), .wos (ISI format), .medline (MEDLINE format), .copac  (Copac
              format),  or  .json  (citeproc JSON).  If you want to use multiple
              bibliographies, just use this option repeatedly.

       --csl=FILE
              Specify CSL style to be used in formatting citations and the  bib&#8208;
              liography.  If FILE is not found, pandoc will look for it in

                     $HOME/.csl

              in unix and

                     C:\Documents And Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\csl

              in Windows.  If the --csl option is not specified, pandoc will use
              a default style: either default.csl in  the  user  data  directory
              (see  --data-dir), or, if that is not present, the Chicago author-
              date style.

       --citation-abbreviations=FILE
              Specify a file containing abbreviations  for  journal  titles  and
              other  bibliographic  fields (indicated by setting form=&quot;short&quot; in
              the  CSL  node  for  the  field).   The  format  is  described  at
              http://citationstylist.org/2011/10/19/abbreviations-for-zotero-
              test-release/.  Here is a short example:

                     { &quot;default&quot;: {
                         &quot;container-title&quot;: {
                                 &quot;Lloyd&apos;s Law Reports&quot;: &quot;Lloyd&apos;s Rep&quot;,
                                 &quot;Estates Gazette&quot;: &quot;EG&quot;,
                                 &quot;Scots Law Times&quot;: &quot;SLT&quot;
                         }
                       }
                     }

       --natbib
              Use natbib for citations in LaTeX output.

       --biblatex
              Use biblatex for citations in LaTeX output.

   Math rendering in HTML
       -m [URL], --latexmathml[=URL]
              Use the LaTeXMathML script to display embedded TeX  math  in  HTML
              output.   To  insert  a link to a local copy of the LaTeXMathML.js
              script, provide a URL.  If no URL is provided, the contents of the
              script  will be inserted directly into the HTML header, preserving
              portability at the price of efficiency.  If you plan to  use  math
              on  several  pages,  it  is  much  better to link to a copy of the
              script, so it can be cached.

       --mathml[=URL]
              Convert TeX math to MathML (in docbook as well as html and html5).
              In standalone html output, a small javascript (or a link to such a
              script if a URL is supplied) will  be  inserted  that  allows  the
              MathML to be viewed on some browsers.

       --jsmath[=URL]
              Use  jsMath  to display embedded TeX math in HTML output.  The URL
              should    point    to    the    jsMath    load    script     (e.g.
              jsMath/easy/load.js);  if  provided,  it  will be linked to in the
              header of standalone HTML documents.  If a URL is not provided, no
              link  to the jsMath load script will be inserted; it is then up to
              the author to provide such a link in the HTML template.

       --mathjax[=URL]
              Use MathJax to display embedded TeX math in HTML output.  The  URL
              should  point to the MathJax.js load script.  If a URL is not pro&#8208;
              vided, a link to the MathJax CDN will be inserted.

       --gladtex
              Enclose TeX math in &lt;eq&gt; tags in HTML output.  These can  then  be
              processed  by  gladTeX  to  produce links to images of the typeset
              formulas.

       --mimetex[=URL]
              Render TeX math using the mimeTeX CGI script.  If URL is not spec&#8208;
              ified, it is assumed that the script is at /cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi.

       --webtex[=URL]
              Render  TeX  formulas  using  an external script that converts TeX
              formulas to images.  The formula will be concatenated with the URL
              provided.   If  URL is not specified, the Google Chart API will be
              used.

   Options for wrapper scripts
       --dump-args
              Print information about command-line  arguments  to  stdout,  then
              exit.   This  option  is  intended  primarily  for  use in wrapper
              scripts.  The first line of output contains the name of the output
              file  specified with the -o option, or - (for stdout) if no output
              file was specified.  The remaining lines contain the  command-line
              arguments,  one  per line, in the order they appear.  These do not
              include regular Pandoc options and their arguments, but do include
              any options appearing after a -- separator at the end of the line.

       --ignore-args
              Ignore command-line arguments (for use in wrapper scripts).  Regu&#8208;
              lar Pandoc options are not ignored.  Thus, for example,

                     pandoc --ignore-args -o foo.html -s foo.txt -- -e latin1

              is equivalent to

                     pandoc -o foo.html -s

TEMPLATES
       When the -s/--standalone option is used, pandoc uses a  template  to  add
       header  and  footer material that is needed for a self-standing document.
       To see the default template that is used, just type

              pandoc -D FORMAT

       where FORMAT is the name of the output format.  A custom template can  be
       specified  using the --template option.  You can also override the system
       default templates for a given output format FORMAT by putting a file tem&#8208;
       plates/default.FORMAT in the user data directory (see --data-dir, above).
       Exceptions: For odt output, customize the default.opendocument  template.
       For  pdf  output, customize the default.latex template.  For epub output,
       customize   the   epub-page.html,   epub-coverimage.html,    and    epub-
       titlepage.html templates.

       Templates  may  contain  variables.   Variable  names  are  sequences  of
       alphanumerics, -, and _, starting with a letter.  A  variable  name  sur&#8208;
       rounded  by  $  signs  will  be  replaced by its value.  For example, the
       string $title$ in

              &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;

       will be replaced by the document title.

       To write a literal $ in a template, use $$.

       Some variables are set automatically  by  pandoc.   These  vary  somewhat
       depending on the output format, but include:

       header-includes
              contents  specified  by  -H/--include-in-header (may have multiple
              values)

       toc    non-null value if --toc/--table-of-contents was specified

       include-before
              contents specified by -B/--include-before-body (may have  multiple
              values)

       include-after
              contents  specified  by -A/--include-after-body (may have multiple
              values)

       body   body of document

       title  title of document, as specified in title block

       author author of document, as specified in title block (may have multiple
              values)

       date   date of document, as specified in title block

       lang   language code for HTML or LaTeX documents

       slidy-url
              base      URL     for     Slidy     documents     (defaults     to
              http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2)

       slideous-url
              base URL for Slideous documents (defaults to default)

       s5-url base URL for S5 documents (defaults to ui/default)

       fontsize
              font size (10pt, 11pt, 12pt) for LaTeX documents

       documentclass
              document class for LaTeX documents

       geometry
              options  for  LaTeX  geometry  class,  e.g.   margin=1in;  may  be
              repeated for multiple options

       mainfont, sansfont, monofont,
              mathfont  fonts  for  LaTeX documents (works only with xelatex and
              lualatex)

       theme  theme for LaTeX beamer documents

       colortheme
              colortheme for LaTeX beamer documents

       linkcolor
              color for internal links in LaTeX documents (red, green,  magenta,
              cyan, blue, black)

       urlcolor
              color for external links in LaTeX documents

       links-as-notes
              causes links to be printed as footnotes in LaTeX documents

       Variables  may be set at the command line using the -V/--variable option.
       This allows users to include custom variables in their templates.

       Templates may contain conditionals.  The syntax is as follows:

              $if(variable)$
              X
              $else$
              Y
              $endif$

       This will include X in the template if variable  has  a  non-null  value;
       otherwise it will include Y.  X and Y are placeholders for any valid tem&#8208;
       plate text, and may include interpolated variables or other conditionals.
       The $else$ section may be omitted.

       When  variables can have multiple values (for example, author in a multi-
       author document), you can use the $for$ keyword:

              $for(author)$
              &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;$author$&quot; /&gt;
              $endfor$

       You can optionally specify a separator to  be  used  between  consecutive
       items:

              $for(author)$$author$$sep$, $endfor$

       If  you  use  custom  templates,  you  may  need to revise them as pandoc
       changes.  We recommend tracking the changes in the default templates, and
       modifying  your  custom templates accordingly.  An easy way to do this is
       to fork the  pandoc-templates  repository  (http://github.com/jgm/pandoc-
       templates) and merge in changes after each pandoc release.

PRODUCING SLIDE SHOWS WITH PANDOC
       You  can  use  Pandoc  to produce an HTML + javascript slide presentation
       that can be viewed via a web browser.  There are four ways  to  do  this,
       using S5, DZSlides, Slidy, or Slideous.  You can also produce a PDF slide
       show using LaTeX beamer.

       Here&apos;s the markdown source for a simple slide show, habits.txt:

              % Habits
              % John Doe
              % March 22, 2005

              # In the morning

              ## Getting up

              - Turn off alarm
              - Get out of bed

              ## Breakfast

              - Eat eggs
              - Drink coffee

              # In the evening

              ## Dinner

              - Eat spaghetti
              - Drink wine

              ------------------

              ![picture of spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

              ## Going to sleep

              - Get in bed
              - Count sheep

       To produce the slide show, simply type

              pandoc -t s5 -s habits.txt -o habits.html

       for S5,

              pandoc -t slidy -s habits.txt -o habits.html

       for Slidy,

              pandoc -t slideous -s habits.txt -o habits.html

       for Slideous,

              pandoc -t dzslides -s habits.txt -o habits.html

       for DZSlides, or

              pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -o habits.pdf

       for beamer.

       With all HTML slide formats, the --self-contained option can be  used  to
       produce  a single file that contains all of the data necessary to display
       the slide  show,  including  linked  scripts,  stylesheets,  images,  and
       videos.

   Structuring the slide show
       By  default, the slide level is the highest header level in the hierarchy
       that is followed immediately by content, and not  another  header,  some&#8208;
       where  in the document.  In the example above, level 1 headers are always
       followed by level 2 headers, which are followed by content, so 2  is  the
       slide  level.   This  default  can  be overridden using the --slide-level
       option.

       The document is carved up into slides according to the following rules:

       &#183; A horizontal rule always starts a new slide.

       &#183; A header at the slide level always starts a new slide.

       &#183; Headers below the slide level in the hierarchy create headers within  a
         slide.
&#12;       &#183; Headers  above  the slide level in the hierarchy create &quot;title slides,&quot;
         which just contain the section title and help to break the  slide  show
         into sections.

       &#183; A  title  page  is  constructed automatically from the document&apos;s title
         block, if present.  (In the case of beamer, this  can  be  disabled  by
         commenting out some lines in the default template.)

       These  rules are designed to support many different styles of slide show.
       If you don&apos;t care about structuring your slides into sections and subsec&#8208;
       tions,  you  can  just  use level 1 headers for all each slide.  (In that
       case, level 1 will be the slide level.)
        But you can also structure the slide show into sections, as in the exam&#8208;
       ple above.

       For  Slidy,  Slideous  and  S5,  the  file  produced  by  pandoc with the
       -s/--standalone option embeds a link to javascripts and CSS files,  which
       are  assumed  to be available at the relative path s5/default (for S5) or
       slideous (for Slideous), or at the Slidy website at w3.org  (for  Slidy).
       (These  paths  can  be  changed by setting the slidy-url, slideous-url or
       s5-url variables; see --variable, above.)
        For DZSlides, the (relatively short) javascript and css are included  in
       the file by default.

   Incremental lists
       By  default,  these writers produces lists that display &quot;all at once.&quot; If
       you want your lists to display incrementally (one item at  a  time),  use
       the  -i option.  If you want a particular list to depart from the default
       (that is, to display incrementally without the -i option and all at  once
       with the -i option), put it in a block quote:

              &gt; - Eat spaghetti
              &gt; - Drink wine

       In this way incremental and nonincremental lists can be mixed in a single
       document.

   Styling the slides
       You can change the style of HTML slides by putting customized  CSS  files
       in   $DATADIR/s5/default   (for   S5),  $DATADIR/slidy  (for  Slidy),  or
       $DATADIR/slideous (for Slideous), where $DATADIR is the user data  direc&#8208;
       tory  (see  --data-dir,  above).   The originals may be found in pandoc&apos;s
       system data  directory  (generally  $CABALDIR/pandoc-VERSION/s5/default).
       Pandoc  will  look  there for any files it does not find in the user data
       directory.

       For dzslides, the CSS is included in the HTML file  itself,  and  may  be
       modified there.

       To  style beamer slides, you can specify a beamer &quot;theme&quot; or &quot;colortheme&quot;
       using the -V option:

              pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -V theme:Warsaw -o habits.pdf

LITERATE HASKELL SUPPORT
       If you append +lhs to an appropriate input or  output  format  (markdown,
       rst,  or  latex  for  input  or  output; beamer, html or html5 for output
       only), pandoc will treat the document as literate Haskell  source.   This
       means that

       &#183; In markdown input, &quot;bird track&quot; sections will be parsed as Haskell code
         rather than block quotations.  Text between \begin{code} and \end{code}
         will also be treated as Haskell code.

       &#183; In  markdown output, code blocks with classes haskell and literate will
         be rendered using bird tracks, and block quotations  will  be  indented
         one  space,  so they will not be treated as Haskell code.  In addition,
         headers will be rendered setext-style  (with  underlines)  rather  than
         atx-style (with &apos;#&apos; characters).  (This is because ghc treats &apos;#&apos; char&#8208;
         acters in column 1 as introducing line numbers.)

       &#183; In restructured text input, &quot;bird track&quot; sections  will  be  parsed  as
         Haskell code.

       &#183; In  restructured  text  output,  code blocks with class haskell will be
         rendered using bird tracks.

       &#183; In LaTeX input, text in code environments will  be  parsed  as  Haskell
         code.

       &#183; In LaTeX output, code blocks with class haskell will be rendered inside
         code environments.

       &#183; In HTML output, code blocks with class haskell will  be  rendered  with
         class literatehaskell and bird tracks.

       Examples:

              pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html

       reads  literate  Haskell  source  formatted with markdown conventions and
       writes ordinary HTML (without bird tracks).

              pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html+lhs

       writes HTML with the Haskell code in bird tracks, so it can be copied and
       pasted as literate Haskell source.
