PANDOC_MARKDOWN(5)                                            PANDOC_MARKDOWN(5)



NAME
       pandoc_markdown - markdown syntax for pandoc(1)

DESCRIPTION
       Pandoc  understands an extended and slightly revised version of John Gru&#8208;
       ber&apos;s markdown syntax.  This document explains the syntax, noting differ&#8208;
       ences  from standard markdown.  Except where noted, these differences can
       be suppressed by specifying the --strict command-line option.

PHILOSOPHY
       Markdown is designed to be easy to write,  and,  even  more  importantly,
       easy to read:

              A  Markdown-formatted  document  should  be  publishable as-is, as
              plain text, without looking like it&apos;s been marked up with tags  or
              formatting instructions.  -- John Gruber

       This  principle  has  guided  pandoc&apos;s  decisions  in  finding syntax for
       tables, footnotes, and other extensions.

       There is, however, one respect in which pandoc&apos;s aims are different  from
       the  original aims of markdown.  Whereas markdown was originally designed
       with HTML generation in mind, pandoc is designed for multiple output for&#8208;
       mats.   Thus,  while pandoc allows the embedding of raw HTML, it discour&#8208;
       ages it, and provides other, non-HTMLish ways of  representing  important
       document  elements  like definition lists, tables, mathematics, and foot&#8208;
       notes.

PARAGRAPHS
       A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one  or  more  blank
       line.   Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs
       as you like.  If you need a hard line break, put two or  more  spaces  at
       the end of a line, or type a backslash followed by a newline.

HEADERS
       There are two kinds of headers, Setext and atx.

   Setext-style headers
       A  setext-style  header  is  a  line of text &quot;underlined&quot; with a row of =
       signs (for a level one header) of - signs (for a level two header):

              A level-one header
              ==================

              A level-two header
              ------------------

       The header text can contain inline  formatting,  such  as  emphasis  (see
       Inline formatting, below).

   Atx-style headers
       An  Atx-style  header  consists of one to six # signs and a line of text,
       optionally followed by any number of # signs.  The number of #  signs  at
       the beginning of the line is the header level:

              ## A level-two header

              ### A level-three header ###

       As with setext-style headers, the header text can contain formatting:

              # A level-one header with a [link](/url) and *emphasis*
&#12;       Standard  markdown  syntax does not require a blank line before a header.
       Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of the doc&#8208;
       ument).   The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a
       # to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps through  line
       wrapping).  Consider, for example:

              I like several of their flavors of ice cream:
              #22, for example, and #5.

   Header identifiers in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt
       Pandoc extension.

       Each header element in pandoc&apos;s HTML and ConTeXt output is given a unique
       identifier.  This identifier is based on the  text  of  the  header.   To
       derive the identifier from the header text,

       &#183; Remove all formatting, links, etc.

       &#183; Remove all punctuation, except underscores, hyphens, and periods.

       &#183; Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.

       &#183; Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.

       &#183; Remove  everything  up  to  the first letter (identifiers may not begin
         with a number or punctuation mark).

       &#183; If nothing is left after this, use the identifier section.

       Thus, for example,

       tab(@); l l.  T{ Header T}@T{ Identifier T} _ T{  Header  identifiers  in
       HTML  T}@T{  header-identifiers-in-html  T} T{ Dogs?--in my house?  T}@T{
       dogs--in-my-house T} T{ HTML, S5, or RTF?  T}@T{ html-s5-or-rtf T} T{  3.
       Applications T}@T{ applications T} T{ 33 T}@T{ section T}

       These  rules should, in most cases, allow one to determine the identifier
       from the header text.  The exception is when  several  headers  have  the
       same  text;  in  this case, the first will get an identifier as described
       above; the second will get the same  identifier  with  -1  appended;  the
       third with -2; and so on.

       These  identifiers  are used to provide link targets in the table of con&#8208;
       tents generated by the --toc|--table-of-contents option.  They also  make
       it  easy  to  provide links from one section of a document to another.  A
       link to this section, for example, might look like this:

              See the section on
              [header identifiers](#header-identifiers-in-html).

       Note, however, that this method of providing links to sections works only
       in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt formats.

       If  the  --section-divs  option  is  specified, then each section will be
       wrapped in a div (or a section, if --html5 was specified), and the  iden&#8208;
       tifier  will be attached to the enclosing &lt;div&gt; (or &lt;section&gt;) tag rather
       than the header itself.  This allows entire sections  to  be  manipulated
       using javascript or treated differently in CSS.

BLOCK QUOTATIONS
       Markdown uses email conventions for quoting blocks of text.  A block quo&#8208;
       tation is one or more paragraphs or other block elements (such  as  lists
       or  headers), with each line preceded by a &gt; character and a space.  (The
       &gt; need not start at the left margin, but it should not be  indented  more
       than three spaces.)

              &gt; This is a block quote. This
              &gt; paragraph has two lines.
              &gt;
              &gt; 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
              &gt; 2. Second item.

       A  &quot;lazy&quot;  form, which requires the &gt; character only on the first line of
       each block, is also allowed:

              &gt; This is a block quote. This
              paragraph has two lines.

              &gt; 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
              2. Second item.

       Among the block elements that can be contained in a block quote are other
       block quotes.  That is, block quotes can be nested:

              &gt; This is a block quote.
              &gt;
              &gt; &gt; A block quote within a block quote.

       Standard  markdown  syntax  does  not require a blank line before a block
       quote.  Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning  of
       the document).  The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy
       for a &gt; to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps through
       line wrapping).  So, unless --strict is used, the following does not pro&#8208;
       duce a nested block quote in pandoc:

              &gt; This is a block quote.
              &gt;&gt; Nested.

VERBATIM (CODE) BLOCKS
   Indented code blocks
       A block of text indented four spaces (or one tab) is treated as  verbatim
       text:  that is, special characters do not trigger special formatting, and
       all spaces and line breaks are preserved.  For example,

                  if (a &gt; 3) {
                    moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
                  }

       The initial (four space or one tab) indentation is not considered part of
       the verbatim text, and is removed in the output.

       Note: blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces.

   Delimited code blocks
       Pandoc extension.

       In  addition  to standard indented code blocks, Pandoc supports delimited
       code blocks.  These begin with a row of three or more tildes (~) or back&#8208;
       ticks (`) and end with a row of tildes or backticks that must be at least
       as long as the starting row.  Everything between these lines  is  treated
       as code.  No indentation is necessary:

              ~~~~~~~
              if (a &gt; 3) {
                moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
              }
              ~~~~~~~

       Like  regular  code  blocks, delimited code blocks must be separated from
       surrounding text by blank lines.

       If the code itself contains a row of tildes  or  backticks,  just  use  a
       longer row of tildes or backticks at the start and end:

              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              ~~~~~~~~~~
              code including tildes
              ~~~~~~~~~~
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Optionally,  you  may attach attributes to the code block using this syn&#8208;
       tax:

              ~~~~ {#mycode .haskell .numberLines startFrom=&quot;100&quot;}
              qsort []     = []
              qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (&lt; x) xs) ++ [x] ++
                             qsort (filter (&gt;= x) xs)
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Here mycode is an identifier, haskell and numberLines  are  classes,  and
       startFrom  is  an  attribute with value 100.  Some output formats can use
       this information to do syntax highlighting.  Currently, the  only  output
       formats  that  uses this information are HTML and LaTeX.  If highlighting
       is supported for your output format and language,  then  the  code  block
       above  will  appear highlighted, with numbered lines.  (To see which lan&#8208;
       guages are supported, do pandoc --version.)
        Otherwise, the code block above will appear as follows:

              &lt;pre id=&quot;mycode&quot; class=&quot;haskell numberLines&quot; startFrom=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
                &lt;code&gt;
                ...
                &lt;/code&gt;
              &lt;/pre&gt;

       A shortcut form can also be used for specifying the language of the  code
       block:

              ```haskell
              qsort [] = []
              ```

       This is equivalent to:

              ``` {.haskell}
              qsort [] = []
              ```

       To  prevent  all  highlighting,  use the --no-highlight flag.  To set the
       highlighting style, use --highlight-style.

LISTS
   Bullet lists
       A bullet list is a list of bulleted list items.   A  bulleted  list  item
       begins with a bullet (*, +, or -).  Here is a simple example:

              * one
              * two
              * three

       This will produce a &quot;compact&quot; list.  If you want a &quot;loose&quot; list, in which
       each item is formatted as a paragraph, put spaces between the items:

              * one

              * two

              * three

       The bullets need not be flush with the left margin; they may be  indented
       one, two, or three spaces.  The bullet must be followed by whitespace.

       List  items  look  best if subsequent lines are flush with the first line
       (after the bullet):
&#12;              * here is my first
                list item.
              * and my second.

       But markdown also allows a &quot;lazy&quot; format:

              * here is my first
              list item.
              * and my second.

   The four-space rule
       A list item may contain multiple paragraphs and  other  block-level  con&#8208;
       tent.   However,  subsequent  paragraphs must be preceded by a blank line
       and indented four spaces or a tab.  The list  will  look  better  if  the
       first paragraph is aligned with the rest:

                * First paragraph.

                  Continued.

                * Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented
                  eight spaces:

                      { code }

       List  items  may  include  other lists.  In this case the preceding blank
       line is optional.  The nested list must be indented four  spaces  or  one
       tab:

              * fruits
                  + apples
                      - macintosh
                      - red delicious
                  + pears
                  + peaches
              * vegetables
                  + brocolli
                  + chard

       As noted above, markdown allows you to write list items &quot;lazily,&quot; instead
       of indenting continuation lines.  However, if there  are  multiple  para&#8208;
       graphs  or  other  blocks  in a list item, the first line of each must be
       indented.

              + A lazy, lazy, list
              item.

              + Another one; this looks
              bad but is legal.

                  Second paragraph of second
              list item.

       Note: Although the four-space rule for continuation paragraphs comes from
       the  official  markdown syntax guide, the reference implementation, Mark&#8208;
       down.pl, does not follow it.  So pandoc will give different results  than
       Markdown.pl when authors have indented continuation paragraphs fewer than
       four spaces.

       The markdown syntax guide is not explicit  whether  the  four-space  rule
       applies to all block-level content in a list item; it only mentions para&#8208;
       graphs and code blocks.  But it implies that  the  rule  applies  to  all
       block-level  content  (including  nested lists), and pandoc interprets it
       that way.

   Ordered lists
       Ordered lists work just like bulleted lists, except that the items  begin
       with enumerators rather than bullets.

       In  standard  markdown,  enumerators  are  decimal  numbers followed by a
       period and a space.  The numbers themselves are ignored, so there  is  no
       difference between this list:

              1.  one
              2.  two
              3.  three

       and this one:

              5.  one
              7.  two
              1.  three

       Pandoc extension.

       Unlike  standard  markdown, Pandoc allows ordered list items to be marked
       with uppercase and lowercase letters and roman numerals, in  addition  to
       arabic numerals.  List markers may be enclosed in parentheses or followed
       by a single right-parentheses or period.  They must be separated from the
       text  that  follows  by  at least one space, and, if the list marker is a
       capital letter with a period, by at least two spaces.[1]

       Pandoc also pays attention to the type of list marker used,  and  to  the
       starting  number,  and  both of these are preserved where possible in the
       output format.  Thus, the following yields a list with  numbers  followed
       by  a  single  parenthesis, starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase
       roman numerals:

               9)  Ninth
              10)  Tenth
              11)  Eleventh
                     i. subone
                    ii. subtwo
                   iii. subthree

       Pandoc will start a new list each time a different type of list marker is
       used.  So, the following will create three lists:

              (2) Two
              (5) Three
              1.  Four
              *   Five

       If default list markers are desired, use #.:

              #.  one
              #.  two
              #.  three

   Definition lists
       Pandoc extension.

       Pandoc supports definition lists, using a syntax inspired by PHP Markdown
       Extra and reStructuredText:[2]

              Term 1

              :   Definition 1

              Term 2 with *inline markup*

              :   Definition 2

                      { some code, part of Definition 2 }

                  Third paragraph of definition 2.

       Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally  be  followed  by  a
       blank  line,  and must be followed by one or more definitions.  A defini&#8208;
       tion begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one or two  spa&#8208;
       ces.   The  body  of the definition (including the first line, aside from
       the colon or tilde) should be indented four spaces.  A term may have mul&#8208;
       tiple  definitions,  and each definition may consist of one or more block
       elements (paragraph, code block, list, etc.)  , each indented four spaces
       or one tab stop.

       If  you  leave  space after the definition (as in the example above), the
       blocks of the definitions will be considered paragraphs.  In some  output
       formats,  this  will  mean greater spacing between term/definition pairs.
       For a compact definition list, do not leave space between the  definition
       and the next term:

              Term 1
                ~ Definition 1
              Term 2
                ~ Definition 2a
                ~ Definition 2b

   Numbered example lists
       Pandoc extension.

       The special list marker @ can be used for sequentially numbered examples.
       The first list item with a @ marker will be numbered &apos;1&apos;, the  next  &apos;2&apos;,
       and so on, throughout the document.  The numbered examples need not occur
       in a single list; each new list using @  will  take  up  where  the  last
       stopped.  So, for example:

              (@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
              (@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

              Explanation of examples.

              (@)  My third example will be numbered (3).

       Numbered  examples  can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the docu&#8208;
       ment:

              (@good)  This is a good example.

              As (@good) illustrates, ...

       The label can be any string of alphanumeric characters,  underscores,  or
       hyphens.

   Compact and loose lists
       Pandoc  behaves differently from Markdown.pl on some &quot;edge cases&quot; involv&#8208;
       ing lists.  Consider this source:

              +   First
              +   Second:
                   -   Fee
                   -   Fie
                   -   Foe

              +   Third

       Pandoc transforms this into a &quot;compact list&quot; (with  no  &lt;p&gt;  tags  around
       &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;, or &quot;Third&quot;), while markdown puts &lt;p&gt; tags around &quot;Sec&#8208;
       ond&quot; and &quot;Third&quot; (but not &quot;First&quot;), because of  the  blank  space  around
       &quot;Third&quot;.   Pandoc  follows  a  simple  rule: if the text is followed by a
       blank line, it is treated as a paragraph.  Since &quot;Second&quot; is followed  by
       a  list, and not a blank line, it isn&apos;t treated as a paragraph.  The fact
       that the list is followed by a blank line is irrelevant.   (Note:  Pandoc
       works this way even when the --strict option is specified.  This behavior
       is consistent with the official markdown syntax description, even  though
       it is different from that of Markdown.pl.)

   Ending a list
       What if you want to put an indented code block after a list?

              -   item one
              -   item two

                  { my code block }

       Trouble!  Here  pandoc  (like  other markdown implementations) will treat
       { my code block } as the second paragraph of item two, and not as a  code
       block.

       To  &quot;cut  off&quot;  the list after item two, you can insert some non-indented
       content, like an HTML comment, which won&apos;t produce visible output in  any
       format:

              -   item one
              -   item two

              &lt;!-- end of list --&gt;

                  { my code block }

       You  can  use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead of
       one big list:

              1.  one
              2.  two
              3.  three

              &lt;!-- --&gt;

              1.  uno
              2.  dos
              3.  tres

HORIZONTAL RULES
       A line containing a row of three or more *, -, or _  characters  (option&#8208;
       ally separated by spaces) produces a horizontal rule:

              *  *  *  *

TABLES
       Pandoc extension.

       Three kinds of tables may be used.  All three kinds presuppose the use of
       a fixed-width font, such as Courier.

       Simple tables look like this:

                Right     Left     Center     Default
              -------     ------ ----------   -------
                   12     12        12            12
                  123     123       123          123
                    1     1          1             1

              Table:  Demonstration of simple table syntax.

       The headers and table rows must each fit on one line.  Column  alignments
       are  determined by the position of the header text relative to the dashed
       line below it:[3]

       &#183; If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the right side  but
         extends beyond it on the left, the column is right-aligned.

       &#183; If  the  dashed line is flush with the header text on the left side but
         extends beyond it on the right, the column is left-aligned.

       &#183; If the dashed line extends beyond the header text on  both  sides,  the
         column is centered.

       &#183; If  the  dashed  line  is flush with the header text on both sides, the
         default alignment is used (in most cases, this will be left).

       The table must end with a blank line, or a line of dashes followed  by  a
       blank  line.  A caption may optionally be provided (as illustrated in the
       example above).  A caption is a paragraph beginning with the  string  Ta&#8208;
       ble:  (or  just  :),  which  will  be stripped off.  It may appear either
       before or after the table.

       The column headers may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used to  end
       the table.  For example:

              -------     ------ ----------   -------
                   12     12        12             12
                  123     123       123           123
                    1     1          1              1
              -------     ------ ----------   -------

       When  headers  are omitted, column alignments are determined on the basis
       of the first line of the table body.  So, in the tables above,  the  col&#8208;
       umns would be right, left, center, and right aligned, respectively.

       Multiline  tables  allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of
       text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table  are  not
       supported).  Here is an example:

              -------------------------------------------------------------
               Centered   Default           Right Left
                Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
              ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
                 First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                                  spans multiple lines.

                Second    row                 5.0 Here&apos;s another one. Note
                                                  the blank line between
                                                  rows.
              -------------------------------------------------------------

              Table: Here&apos;s the caption. It, too, may span
              multiple lines.

       These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:

       &#183; They  must  begin  with a row of dashes, before the header text (unless
         the headers are omitted).

       &#183; They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.

       &#183; The rows must be separated by blank lines.

       In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of the
       columns,  and  the  writers try to reproduce these relative widths in the
       output.  So, if you find that one of the columns is  too  narrow  in  the
       output, try widening it in the markdown source.

       Headers may be omitted in multiline tables as well as simple tables:

              ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
                 First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                                  spans multiple lines.

                Second    row                 5.0 Here&apos;s another one. Note
                                                  the blank line between
                                                  rows.
              -------------------------------------------------------------

              : Here&apos;s a multiline table without headers.

       It  is  possible  for a multiline table to have just one row, but the row
       should be followed by a blank line (and then the row of dashes that  ends
       the table), or the table may be interpreted as a simple table.

       Grid tables look like this:

              : Sample grid table.

              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
              | Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
              +===============+===============+====================+
              | Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
              |               |               | - bright color     |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
              | Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
              |               |               | - tasty            |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

       The  row of =s separates the header from the table body, and can be omit&#8208;
       ted for a headerless table.  The cells of grid tables may  contain  arbi&#8208;
       trary  block  elements (multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists, etc.)  .
       Alignments are not supported, nor are cells that span multiple columns or
       rows.  Grid tables can be created easily using Emacs table mode.

TITLE BLOCK
       Pandoc extension.

       If the file begins with a title block

              % title
              % author(s) (separated by semicolons)
              % date

       it  will  be  parsed as bibliographic information, not regular text.  (It
       will be used, for example, in the title of standalone LaTeX or HTML  out&#8208;
       put.)
        The  block may contain just a title, a title and an author, or all three
       elements.  If you want to include an author but no title, or a title  and
       a date but no author, you need a blank line:

              %
              % Author

              % My title
              %
              % June 15, 2006

       The  title  may  occupy multiple lines, but continuation lines must begin
       with leading space, thus:

              % My title
                on multiple lines

       If a document has multiple authors, the authors may be  put  on  separate
       lines  with  leading space, or separated by semicolons, or both.  So, all
       of the following are equivalent:

              % Author One
                Author Two

              % Author One; Author Two

              % Author One;
                Author Two

       The date must fit on one line.

       All three metadata fields may contain standard inline  formatting  (ital&#8208;
       ics, links, footnotes, etc.)  .

       Title  blocks will always be parsed, but they will affect the output only
       when the --standalone (-s) option is chosen.  In HTML output, titles will
       appear  twice:  once  in the document head -- this is the title that will
       appear at the top of the window in a browser -- and once at the beginning
       of  the  document  body.   The  title  in  the  document head can have an
       optional prefix attached (--title-prefix or -T option).  The title in the
       body appears as an H1 element with class &quot;title&quot;, so it can be suppressed
       or reformatted with CSS.  If a title prefix is specified with -T  and  no
       title  block  appears  in  the document, the title prefix will be used by
       itself as the HTML title.

       The man page writer extracts a title, man page section number, and  other
       header  and footer information from the title line.  The title is assumed
       to be the first word on the title line, which may optionally end  with  a
       (single-digit)  section number in parentheses.  (There should be no space
       between the title and the parentheses.)
        Anything after this is assumed to be additional footer and header  text.
       A  single  pipe  character (|) should be used to separate the footer text
       from the header text.  Thus,

              % PANDOC(1)

       will yield a man page with the title PANDOC and section 1.

              % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals

       will also have &quot;Pandoc User Manuals&quot; in the footer.

              % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals | Version 4.0

       will also have &quot;Version 4.0&quot; in the header.

BACKSLASH ESCAPES
       Except inside a code block or inline code, any punctuation or space char&#8208;
       acter preceded by a backslash will be treated literally, even if it would
       normally indicate formatting.  Thus, for example, if one writes

              *\*hello\**

       one will get

              &lt;em&gt;*hello*&lt;/em&gt;

       instead of

              &lt;strong&gt;hello&lt;/strong&gt;

       This rule is easier to remember  than  standard  markdown&apos;s  rule,  which
       allows only the following characters to be backslash-escaped:

              \`*_{}[]()&gt;#+-.!

       (However,  if the --strict option is supplied, the standard markdown rule
       will be used.)

       A backslash-escaped space is parsed as  a  nonbreaking  space.   It  will
       appear in TeX output as ~ and in HTML and XML as \&amp;#160; or \&amp;nbsp;.

       A  backslash-escaped newline (i.e.  a backslash occurring at the end of a
       line) is parsed as a hard line break.  It will appear in TeX output as \\
       and in HTML as &lt;br /&gt;.  This is a nice alternative to markdown&apos;s &quot;invisi&#8208;
       ble&quot; way of indicating hard line breaks using two trailing  spaces  on  a
       line.

       Backslash escapes do not work in verbatim contexts.

SMART PUNCTUATION
       Pandoc extension.

       If  the  --smart option is specified, pandoc will produce typographically
       correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes,  ---  to  em-
       dashes,  --  to  en-dashes,  and ... to ellipses.  Nonbreaking spaces are
       inserted after certain abbreviations, such as &quot;Mr.&quot;

       Note: if your LaTeX template  uses  the  csquotes  package,  pandoc  will
       detect automatically this and use \enquote{...} for quoted text.

INLINE FORMATTING
   Emphasis
       To emphasize some text, surround it with *s or _, like this:

              This text is _emphasized with underscores_, and this
              is *emphasized with asterisks*.

       Double * or _ produces strong emphasis:

              This is **strong emphasis** and __with underscores__.

       A  *  or _ character surrounded by spaces, or backslash-escaped, will not
       trigger emphasis:

              This is * not emphasized *, and \*neither is this\*.

       Because _ is sometimes used inside words and identifiers, pandoc does not
       interpret  a  _  surrounded  by  alphanumeric  characters  as an emphasis
       marker.  If you want to emphasize just part of a word, use *:

              feas*ible*, not feas*able*.

   Strikeout
       Pandoc extension.

       To strikeout a section of text with a horizontal line, begin and  end  it
       with ~~.  Thus, for example,

              This ~~is deleted text.~~

   Superscripts and subscripts
       Pandoc extension.

       Superscripts  may  be  written by surrounding the superscripted text by ^
       characters; subscripts may be written by surrounding the subscripted text
       by ~ characters.  Thus, for example,

              H~2~O is a liquid.  2^10^ is 1024.

       If  the  superscripted  or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces
       must be escaped with backslashes.  (This is to prevent accidental  super&#8208;
       scripting and subscripting through the ordinary use of ~ and ^.)
        Thus,  if  you  want  the  letter  P  with  &apos;a  cat&apos;  in subscripts, use
       P~a\ cat~, not P~a cat~.

   Verbatim
       To make a short span of text verbatim, put it inside backticks:

              What is the difference between `&gt;&gt;=` and `&gt;&gt;`?

       If the verbatim text includes a backtick, use double backticks:

              Here is a literal backtick `` ` ``.
&#12;       (The spaces after the opening backticks and before the closing  backticks
       will be ignored.)

       The general rule is that a verbatim span starts with a string of consecu&#8208;
       tive backticks (optionally followed by a space) and ends with a string of
       the same number of backticks (optionally preceded by a space).

       Note  that  backslash-escapes (and other markdown constructs) do not work
       in verbatim contexts:

              This is a backslash followed by an asterisk: `\*`.

       Attributes can be attached to verbatim text, just as with delimited  code
       blocks:

              `&lt;$&gt;`{.haskell}

MATH
       Pandoc extension.

       Anything between two $ characters will be treated as TeX math.  The open&#8208;
       ing $ must have a character immediately to its right, while the closing $
       must have a character immediately to its left.  Thus, $20,000 and $30,000
       won&apos;t parse as math.  If for some reason you need to enclose text in lit&#8208;
       eral  $  characters,  backslash-escape  them and they won&apos;t be treated as
       math delimiters.

       TeX math will be printed in all  output  formats.   How  it  is  rendered
       depends on the output format:

       Markdown, LaTeX, Org-Mode, ConTeXt
              It will appear verbatim between $ characters.

       reStructuredText
              It  will  be  rendered  using  an interpreted text role :math:, as
              described here.

       AsciiDoc
              It will be rendered as latexmath:[...].

       Texinfo
              It will be rendered inside a @math command.

       groff man
              It will be rendered verbatim without $&apos;s.

       MediaWiki
              It will be rendered inside &lt;math&gt; tags.

       Textile
              It will be rendered inside &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt; tags.

       RTF, OpenDocument, ODT
              It will be rendered, if possible, using  unicode  characters,  and
              will otherwise appear verbatim.

       Docbook
              If  the --mathml flag is used, it will be rendered using mathml in
              an inlineequation or informalequation tag.  Otherwise it  will  be
              rendered, if possible, using unicode characters.

       Docx   It will be rendered using OMML math markup.

       HTML, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, S5, EPUB
              The  way  math is rendered in HTML will depend on the command-line
              options selected:

              1. The default is to render TeX math as far as possible using uni&#8208;
                 code characters, as with RTF, DocBook, and OpenDocument output.
                 Formulas are put inside a span with class=&quot;math&quot;, so that  they
                 may be styled differently from the surrounding text if needed.

              2. If the --latexmathml option is used, TeX math will be displayed
                 between $ or $$ characters and put in &lt;span&gt;  tags  with  class
                 LaTeX.   The  LaTeXMathML  script  will be used to render it as
                 formulas.  (This trick does not work in all  browsers,  but  it
                 works in Firefox.  In browsers that do not support LaTeXMathML,
                 TeX math will appear verbatim between $ characters.)

              3. If the --jsmath option is used, TeX math  will  be  put  inside
                 &lt;span&gt;  tags (for inline math) or &lt;div&gt; tags (for display math)
                 with class math.  The jsMath script will be used to render it.

              4. If the --mimetex option is used, the mimeTeX CGI script will be
                 called  to  generate  images for each TeX formula.  This should
                 work in all browsers.  The --mimetex option takes  an  optional
                 URL  as  argument.   If no URL is specified, it will be assumed
                 that the mimeTeX CGI script is at /cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi.

              5. If the --gladtex option is used, TeX formulas will be  enclosed
                 in  &lt;eq&gt;  tags in the HTML output.  The resulting htex file may
                 then be processed by gladTeX, which will  produce  image  files
                 for  each  formula and an html file with links to these images.
                 So, the procedure is:

                         pandoc -s --gladtex myfile.txt -o myfile.htex
                         gladtex -d myfile-images myfile.htex
                         # produces myfile.html and images in myfile-images

              6. If the --webtex option is used, TeX formulas will be  converted
                 to  &lt;img&gt;  tags  that  link to an external script that converts
                 formulas to images.  The formula will be URL-encoded  and  con&#8208;
                 catenated  with  the URL provided.  If no URL is specified, the
                 Google       Chart        API        will        be        used
                 (http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=).

RAW HTML
       Markdown  allows  you to insert raw HTML (or DocBook) anywhere in a docu&#8208;
       ment (except verbatim contexts, where &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; are interpreted  liter&#8208;
       ally).

       The  raw  HTML  is passed through unchanged in HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous,
       DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown, and Textile output,  and  suppressed  in  other
       formats.

       Pandoc extension.

       Standard  markdown  allows  you  to include HTML &quot;blocks&quot;: blocks of HTML
       between balanced tags that are separated from the surrounding  text  with
       blank  lines, and start and end at the left margin.  Within these blocks,
       everything is interpreted as HTML, not markdown; so (for example), * does
       not signify emphasis.

       Pandoc  behaves this way when --strict is specified; but by default, pan&#8208;
       doc interprets material between HTML block tags as markdown.   Thus,  for
       example, Pandoc will turn

              &lt;table&gt;
                   &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;*one*&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;[a link](http://google.com)&lt;/td&gt;
                   &lt;/tr&gt;
              &lt;/table&gt;

       into

              &lt;table&gt;
                   &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                   &lt;/tr&gt;
              &lt;/table&gt;

       whereas Markdown.pl will preserve it as is.

       There  is  one  exception to this rule: text between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt;
       tags is not interpreted as markdown.

       This departure from standard markdown should make it easier to mix  mark&#8208;
       down  with HTML block elements.  For example, one can surround a block of
       markdown text with &lt;div&gt; tags without preventing  it  from  being  inter&#8208;
       preted as markdown.

RAW TEX
       Pandoc extension.

       In  addition to raw HTML, pandoc allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be
       included in a document.  Inline TeX commands will be preserved and passed
       unchanged  to  the LaTeX and ConTeXt writers.  Thus, for example, you can
       use LaTeX to include BibTeX citations:

              This result was proved in \cite{jones.1967}.

       Note that in LaTeX environments, like

              \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
              Age &amp; Frequency \\ \hline
              18--25  &amp; 15 \\
              26--35  &amp; 33 \\
              36--45  &amp; 22 \\ \hline
              \end{tabular}

       the material between the begin and end tags will be  interpreted  as  raw
       LaTeX, not as markdown.

       Inline LaTeX is ignored in output formats other than Markdown, LaTeX, and
       ConTeXt.

   Macros
       For output formats other than LaTeX, pandoc will parse LaTeX  \newcommand
       and \renewcommand definitions and apply the resulting macros to all LaTeX
       math.  So, for example, the following will work in  all  output  formats,
       not just LaTeX:

              \newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}

              $\tuple{a, b, c}$

       In  LaTeX  output,  the  \newcommand  definition  will  simply  be passed
       unchanged to the output.

LINKS
       Markdown allows links to be specified in several ways.

   Automatic links
       If you enclose a URL or email address in pointy brackets, it will  become
       a link:

              &lt;http://google.com&gt;
              &lt;sam@green.eggs.ham&gt;

   Inline links
       An  inline link consists of the link text in square brackets, followed by
       the URL in parentheses.  (Optionally, the URL can be followed by  a  link
       title, in quotes.)

              This is an [inline link](/url), and here&apos;s [one with
              a title](http://fsf.org &quot;click here for a good time!&quot;).

       There  can  be  no space between the bracketed part and the parenthesized
       part.  The link text can contain formatting (such as emphasis),  but  the
       title cannot.

   Reference links
       An  explicit  reference  link has two parts, the link itself and the link
       definition, which may occur elsewhere in the document (either  before  or
       after the link).

       The link consists of link text in square brackets, followed by a label in
       square brackets.  (There can be space between the two.)
        The link definition must begin at the left margin or  indented  no  more
       than  three  spaces.   It  consists of the bracketed label, followed by a
       colon and a space, followed by the URL, and optionally (after a space)  a
       link title either in quotes or in parentheses.

       Here are some examples:

              [my label 1]: /foo/bar.html  &quot;My title, optional&quot;
              [my label 2]: /foo
              [my label 3]: http://fsf.org (The free software foundation)
              [my label 4]: /bar#special  &apos;A title in single quotes&apos;

       The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:

              [my label 5]: &lt;http://foo.bar.baz&gt;

       The title may go on the next line:

              [my label 3]: http://fsf.org
                &quot;The free software foundation&quot;

       Note that link labels are not case sensitive.  So, this will work:

              Here is [my link][FOO]

              [Foo]: /bar/baz

       In  an  implicit reference link, the second pair of brackets is empty, or
       omitted entirely:

              See [my website][], or [my website].

              [my website]: http://foo.bar.baz

   Internal links
       To link to another section of the same document,  use  the  automatically
       generated identifier (see Header identifiers in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt,
       below).  For example:

              See the [Introduction](#introduction).

       or

              See the [Introduction].

              [Introduction]: #introduction

       Internal links are currently supported for HTML formats  (including  HTML
       slide shows and EPUB), LaTeX, and ConTeXt.

IMAGES
       A link immediately preceded by a ! will be treated as an image.  The link
       text will be used as the image&apos;s alt text:

              ![la lune](lalune.jpg &quot;Voyage to the moon&quot;)

              ![movie reel]
&#12;              [movie reel]: movie.gif

   Pictures with captions
       Pandoc extension.

       An image occurring by itself in a paragraph will be rendered as a  figure
       with a caption.[4] (In LaTeX, a figure environment will be used; in HTML,
       the image will be placed in a div with class figure, together with a cap&#8208;
       tion in a p with class caption.)
        The image&apos;s alt text will be used as the caption.

              ![This is the caption](/url/of/image.png)

       If  you  just  want  a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the
       only thing in the paragraph.  One way to do this is to insert a nonbreak&#8208;
       ing space after the image:

              ![This image won&apos;t be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\

FOOTNOTES
       Pandoc extension.

       Pandoc&apos;s markdown allows footnotes, using the following syntax:

              Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

              [^1]: Here is the footnote.

              [^longnote]: Here&apos;s one with multiple blocks.

                  Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
              belong to the previous footnote.

                      { some.code }

                  The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
                  line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
                  multi-paragraph list items.

              This paragraph won&apos;t be part of the note, because it
              isn&apos;t indented.

       The  identifiers  in footnote references may not contain spaces, tabs, or
       newlines.  These identifiers are used only to correlate the footnote ref&#8208;
       erence  with  the  note itself; in the output, footnotes will be numbered
       sequentially.

       The footnotes themselves need not be placed at the end of  the  document.
       They may appear anywhere except inside other block elements (lists, block
       quotes, tables, etc.)  .

       Inline footnotes are also allowed (though,  unlike  regular  notes,  they
       cannot contain multiple paragraphs).  The syntax is as follows:

              Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
              you don&apos;t have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
              note.]

       Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.

CITATIONS
       Pandoc extension.

       Pandoc  can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a num&#8208;
       ber of styles (using Andrea Rossato&apos;s hs-citeproc).  In order to use this
       feature,  you  will need a bibliographic database in one of the following
       formats:

       tab(@); l l.  T{ Format T}@T{ File extension T} _ T{ MODS T}@T{ .mods  T}
       T{  BibTeX/BibLaTeX  T}@T{  .bib T} T{ RIS T}@T{ .ris T} T{ EndNote T}@T{
       .enl T} T{ EndNote XML T}@T{ .xml T} T{ ISI  T}@T{  .wos  T}  T{  MEDLINE
       T}@T{  .medline  T} T{ Copac T}@T{ .copac T} T{ JSON citeproc T}@T{ .json
       T}

       You will need to specify the bibliography file using  the  --bibliography
       command-line option (which may be repeated if you have several bibliogra&#8208;
       phies).

       By default, pandoc will use a Chicago author-date  format  for  citations
       and  references.   To  use  another style, you will need to use the --csl
       option to specify a CSL 1.0 style file.  A primer on creating and modify&#8208;
       ing   CSL   styles   can   be  found  at  http://citationstyles.org/down&#8208;
       loads/primer.html.   A  repository  of  CSL  styles  can  be   found   at
       https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles.         See       also
       http://zotero.org/styles for easy browsing.

       Citations go inside square brackets  and  are  separated  by  semicolons.
       Each  citation must have a key, composed of &apos;@&apos; + the citation identifier
       from the database, and may optionally have a prefix,  a  locator,  and  a
       suffix.  Here are some examples:

              Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

              Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

              Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

       A  minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the
       citation.  This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the
       text:

              Smith says blah [-@smith04].

       You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

              @smith04 says blah.

              @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.

       If  the  style  calls for a list of works cited, it will be placed at the
       end of the document.  Normally, you will want to end your  document  with
       an appropriate header:

              last paragraph...

              # References

       The bibliography will be inserted after this header.

NOTES
   [1]
       The  point of this rule is to ensure that normal paragraphs starting with
       people&apos;s initials, like

              B. Russell was an English philosopher.

       do not get treated as list items.

       This rule will not prevent

              (C) 2007 Joe Smith

       from being interpreted as a list item.  In this case, a backslash  escape
       can be used:

              (C\) 2007 Joe Smith

   [2]
       I have also been influenced by the suggestions of David Wheeler.
&#12;   [3]
       This scheme is due to Michel Fortin, who proposed it on the Markdown dis&#8208;
       cussion list.

   [4]
       This feature is not yet implemented for RTF, OpenDocument,  or  ODT.   In
       those formats, you&apos;ll just get an image in a paragraph by itself, with no
       caption.
