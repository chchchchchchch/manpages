NAME
       par - filter for reformatting paragraphs

SYNOPSIS
       par  [ help ] [ version ] [ Bopset ] [ Popset ] [ Qopset ] [ h[hang] ]
            [ p[prefix] ] [ r[repeat] ] [ s[suffix] ] [ T[Tab] ] [ w[width] ]
            [ b[body] ] [ c[cap] ] [ d[div] ] [ E[Err] ] [ e[expel] ] [ f[fit] ]
            [ g[guess] ] [ j[just] ] [ l[last] ] [ q[quote] ] [ R[Report] ]
            [ t[touch] ]

DESCRIPTION
       par  is a filter which copies its input to its output, changing all white
       characters (except newlines) to spaces, and reformatting each  paragraph.
       Paragraphs are separated by protected, blank, and bodiless lines (see the
       TERMINOLOGY section for definitions), and optionally delimited by  inden&#8208;
       tation (see the d option in the OPTIONS section).

       Each output paragraph is generated from the corresponding input paragraph
       as follows:

           1) An optional prefix and/or suffix is removed from each input line.

           2) The remainder is divided into words (separated by spaces).

           3) The words are joined into lines to make an eye-pleasing paragraph.

           4) The prefixes and suffixes are reattached.

       If there are suffixes, spaces are inserted before them so that  they  all
       end in the same column.

QUICK START
       par is necessarily complex.  For those who wish to use it immediately and
       understand it later, assign the PARINIT environment variable the  follow&#8208;
       ing value:

              rTbgqR B=.,?_A_a Q=_s&gt;|

       The spaces, question mark, greater-than sign, and vertical bar will prob&#8208;
       ably have to be escaped or quoted to prevent your shell from interpreting
       them.

       The  documentation, though precise, is unfortunately not well-written for
       the end-user.  Your best bet is probably to read quickly the DESCRIPTION,
       TERMINOLOGY,  OPTIONS,  and ENVIRONMENT sections, then read carefully the
       EXAMPLES section, referring back to the OPTIONS and TERMINOLOGY  sections
       as needed.

       For  the  &quot;power user&quot;, a full understanding of par will require multiple
       readings of the TERMINOLOGY, OPTIONS, DETAILS, and EXAMPLES sections.

TERMINOLOGY
       Miscellaneous terms:

              charset syntax
                     A way of representing a set of characters as a string.  The
                     set  includes  exactly those characters which appear in the
                     string, except that the underscore (_) is an escape charac&#8208;
                     ter.  Whenever it appears, it must begin one of the follow&#8208;
                     ing escape sequences:

                        __ = an underscore

                        _s = a space

                        _b = a backslash (\)

                        _q = a single quote (&apos;)

                        _Q = a double quote (&quot;)

                        _A = all upper case letters

                        _a = all lower case letters

                        _0 = all decimal digits

                      _xhh = the character represented by  the  two  hexadecimal
                             digits hh (which may be upper or lower case)

                     The NUL character must not appear in the string, but it may
                     be included in the set with the _x00 sequence.

              error  A condition which causes par to abort.  See the DIAGNOSTICS
                     section.

              IP     Input paragraph.

              OP     Output paragraph.

              parameter
                     A symbol which may take on unsigned integral values.  There
                     are several parameters whose values affect the behavior  of
                     par.   Parameters can be assigned values using command line
                     options.

       Types of characters:

              alphanumeric character
                     An upper case letter, lower case letter, or decimal digit.

              body character
                     A member of the set of characters defined  by  the  PARBODY
                     environment  variable  (see the ENVIRONMENT section) and/or
                     the B option (see the OPTIONS section).

              protective character
                     A member  of the set of characters defined by  the  PARPRO&#8208;
                     TECT environment variable and/or the P option.

              quote character
                     A  member  of the set of characters defined by the PARQUOTE
                     environment variable and/or the Q option.

              terminal character
                     A period, question mark, exclamation point, or colon.

              white character
                     A space, formfeed, newline, carriage return, tab, or verti&#8208;
                     cal tab.

       Functions:

              comprelen
                     Given a non-empty sequence S of lines, let c be their long&#8208;
                     est common prefix.  If the parameter body  is  0,  place  a
                     divider just after the leading non-body characters in c (at
                     the beginning if there are none).  If body is 1, place  the
                     divider just after the last non-space non-body character in
                     c (at the beginning if there is  none),  then  advance  the
                     divider over any immediately following spaces.  The compre&#8208;
                     len of S is the number of characters preceding the divider.

              comsuflen
                     Given a non-empty sequence S of lines, let p be the compre&#8208;
                     len  of  S.   Let  T  be the set of lines which result from
                     stripping the first p characters from each line in S.   Let
                     c  be the longest common suffix of the lines in T.  If body
                     is 0, place a divider just  before  the  trailing  non-body
                     characters  in  c  (at  the  end  if  there are none), then
                     advance the divider over all but the last  of  any  immedi&#8208;
                     ately  following  spaces.   If body is 1, place the divider
                     just before the first non-space  non-body  character,  then
                     back up the divider over one immediately preceding space if
                     there is one.  The comsuflen of S is the number of  charac&#8208;
                     ters following the divider.

              fallback prelen (suflen)
                     The  fallback  prelen  (suflen)  of an IP is: the comprelen
                     (comsuflen) of the IP, if the  IP  contains  at  least  two
                     lines;  otherwise,  the  comprelen (comsuflen) of the block
                     containing the IP, if  the  block  contains  at  least  two
                     lines;  otherwise, the length of the longer of the prefixes
                     (suffixes) of the bodiless lines just above and  below  the
                     block, if the segment containing the block has any bodiless
                     lines; otherwise, 0.  (See below  for  the  definitions  of
                     block, segment, and bodiless line.)

              augmented fallback prelen
                     Let fp be the fallback prelen of an IP.  If the IP contains
                     more than one line, or if quote is 0,  then  the  augmented
                     fallback  prelen  of the IP is simply fp.  Otherwise, it is
                     fp plus the number of quote characters immediately  follow&#8208;
                     ing the first fp characters of the line.

              quoteprefix
                     The  quoteprefix  of  a line is the longest string of quote
                     characters appearing at the beginning of  the  line,  after
                     this string has been stripped of any trailing spaces.

       Types of lines:

              blank line
                     An  empty line, or a line whose first character is not pro&#8208;
                     tective and which contains only spaces.

              protected line
                     An input line whose first character is protective.

              bodiless line
                     A line which is order k bodiless for some k.

              order k bodiless line
                     There is no such thing as an order 0 bodiless  line.   Sup&#8208;
                     pose  S  is  a  a  contiguous subsequence of a segment (see
                     below) containing at least two lines, containing  no  order
                     k-1  bodiless  lines,  bounded above and below by order k-1
                     bodiless lines and/or the  beginning/end  of  the  segment.
                     Let  p and s be the comprelen and comsuflen of S.  Any mem&#8208;
                     ber of S which, if stripped of its first p and last s char&#8208;
                     acters, would be blank (or, if the parameter repeat is non-
                     zero, would consist of the same character repeated at least
                     repeat times), is order k bodiless.  The first p characters
                     of the bodiless line comprise its prefix; the last s  char&#8208;
                     acters comprise its suffix.  The character which repeats in
                     the middle is called its repeat character.  If  the  middle
                     is empty, the space is taken to be its repeat character.

              vacant line
                     A bodiless line whose repeat character is the space.

              superfluous line
                     Only  blank  and  vacant lines may be superfluous.  If con&#8208;
                     tiguous vacant lines lie at the beginning or end of a  seg&#8208;
                     ment,  they  are  all superfluous.  But if they lie between
                     two non-vacant lines within a segment, then all are  super&#8208;
                     fluous  except  one&#8212;the  one which contains the fewest non-
                     spaces.  In case of a tie, the first of the tied  lines  is
                     chosen.   Similarly,  if contiguous blank lines lie outside
                     of any segments at the beginning or end of the input,  they
                     are  all superfluous.  But if they lie between two segments
                     and/or protected lines, then all are superfluous except the
                     first.

       Groups of lines:

              segment
                     A  contiguous  sequence  of  input lines containing no pro&#8208;
                     tected or blank lines, bounded above and below by protected
                     lines, blank lines, and/or the beginning/end of the input.

              block  A  contiguous  subsequence of a segment containing no bodi&#8208;
                     less lines, bounded  above  and  below  by  bodiless  lines
                     and/or the beginning/end of the segment.

       Types of words:

              capitalized word
                     If  the parameter cap is 0, a capitalized word is one which
                     contains at least one alphanumeric character,  whose  first
                     alphanumeric  character is not a lower case letter.  If cap
                     is 1, every word is considered a  capitalized  word.   (See
                     the c option in the OPTIONS section.)

              curious word
                     A  word  which  contains  a  terminal character c such that
                     there are no alphanumeric characters in the word  after  c,
                     but  there  is  at  least one alphanumeric character in the
                     word before c.

OPTIONS
       Any command line argument may begin with one  minus  sign  (-)  which  is
       ignored.   Generally, more than one option may appear in a single command
       line argument, but there are exceptions:  The help, version, B, P, and  Q
       options must have whole arguments all to themselves.

       help      Causes  all  remaining  arguments  to  be ignored.  No input is
                 read.  A  usage  message  is  printed  on  the  output  briefly
                 describing the options used by par.

       version   Causes  all  remaining  arguments  to  be ignored.  No input is
                 read.  &quot;par 1.52&quot; is printed on the output.   Of  course,  this
                 will change in future releases of Par.

       Bopset    op is a single character, either an equal sign (=), a plus sign
                 (+), or a minus sign (-), and set is  a  string  using  charset
                 syntax.   If op is an equal sign, the set of body characters is
                 set to the character set defined by set.  If op is a plus/minus
                 sign,   the   characters   in   the  set  defined  by  set  are
                 added/removed to/from  the  existing  set  of  body  characters
                 defined  by the PARBODY environment variable and any previous B
                 options.  It is okay to add characters that are already in  the
                 set or to remove characters that are not in the set.

       Popset    Just  like  the  B option, except that it applies to the set of
                 protective characters.

       Qopset    Just like the B option, except that it applies to  the  set  of
                 quote characters.

       All  remaining  options are used to set values of parameters.  Values set
       by command line options hold for all paragraphs.   Unset  parameters  are
       given  default values.  Any parameters whose default values depend on the
       IP (namely prefix and suffix), if left unset, are  recomputed  separately
       for each paragraph.

       The approximate role of each variable is described here.  See the DETAILS
       section for the rest of the story.

       The first six parameters, hang, prefix, repeat, suffix, Tab,  and  width,
       may be set to any unsigned decimal integer less than 10000.

       h[hang]   Mainly  affects  the  default  values  of  prefix  and  suffix.
                 Defaults to 0.  If the h option is given without a number,  the
                 value 1 is inferred.  (See also the p and s options.)

       p[prefix] The  first  prefix characters of each line of the OP are copied
                 from the first prefix characters of the corresponding  line  of
                 the  IP.   If  there  are more than hang+1 lines in the IP, the
                 default value is the comprelen of  all  the  lines  in  the  IP
                 except the first hang of them.  Otherwise, the default value is
                 the augmented fallback prelen of the IP.  If the  p  option  is
                 given  without  a  number, prefix is unset, even if it had been
                 set earlier.  (See also the h and q options.)

       r[repeat] If repeat is  non-zero,  bodiless  lines  have  the  number  of
                 instances  of  their  repeat  characters increased or decreased
                 until the length of the line is  width.   The  exact  value  of
                 repeat affects the definition of bodiless line.  Defaults to 0.
                 If the r option is given without  a  number,  the  value  3  is
                 inferred.  (See also the w option.)

       s[suffix] The  last  suffix  characters of each line of the OP are copied
                 from the last suffix characters of the  corresponding  line  of
                 the  IP.   If  there  are more than hang+1 lines in the IP, the
                 default value is the comsuflen of  all  the  lines  of  the  IP
                 except the first hang of them.  Otherwise, the default value is
                 the fallback suflen of the IP.  If the s option is given  with&#8208;
                 out a number, suffix is unset, even if it had been set earlier.
                 (See also the h option.)

       T[Tab]    Tab characters in the input are expanded  to  spaces,  assuming
                 tab  stops  every  Tab columns.  Must not be 0.  Defaults to 1.
                 If the T option is given without  a  number,  the  value  8  is
                 inferred.

       w[width]  No  line  in the OP may contain more than width characters, not
                 including the trailing newlines.  Defaults to  72.   If  the  w
                 option is given without a number, the value 79 is inferred.

       The  remaining  thirteen  parameters,  body,  cap,  div, Err, expel, fit,
       guess, invis, just, last, quote, Report, and touch, may be set to  either
       0 or 1.  If the number is absent in the option, the value 1 is inferred.

       b[body]   If  body is 1, prefixes may not contain any trailing body char&#8208;
                 acters, and suffixes may not contain any leading  body  charac&#8208;
                 ters.  (Actually, the situation is complicated by space charac&#8208;
                 ters.  See comprelen and comsuflen in the Terminology section.)
                 If  body  is  0, prefixes and suffixes may not contain any body
                 characters at all.  Defaults to 0.

       c[cap]    If cap is 1, all words are considered capitalized.   This  cur&#8208;
                 rently  affects only the application of the g option.  Defaults
                 to 0.

       d[div]    If div is 0, each block becomes an IP.  If div is 1, each block
                 is  subdivided  into IPs as follows:  Let p be the comprelen of
                 the block.  Let a line&apos;s status be 1 if its  (p+1)st  character
                 is  a space, 0 otherwise.  Every line in the block whose status
                 is the same as the status of the first line will  begin  a  new
                 paragraph.  Defaults to 0.

       E[Err]    If  Err is 1, messages to the user (caused by the help and ver&#8208;
                 sion options, or by  errors)  are  sent  to  the  error  stream
                 instead of the output stream.  Defaults to 0.

       e[expel]  If  expel is 1, superfluous lines are withheld from the output.
                 Defaults to 0.

       f[fit]    If fit is 1 and just is 0, par tries to make the lines  in  the
                 OP as nearly the same length as possible, even if it means mak&#8208;
                 ing the OP narrower.  Defaults to 0.  (See also the j option.)

       g[guess]  If guess is 1, then when par is choosing line breaks,  whenever
                 it encounters a curious word followed by a capitalized word, it
                 takes one of two special actions.  If the two words  are  sepa&#8208;
                 rated  by a single space in the input, they will be merged into
                 one word with an embedded non-breaking space.  If the two words
                 are  separated  by more than one space, or by a line break, par
                 will insure that they are separated by two spaces, or by a line
                 break, in the output.  Defaults to 0.

       i[invis]  If  invis  is  1, then vacant lines inserted because quote is 1
                 are invisible; that is, they are not output.  If  quote  is  0,
                 invis has no effect.  Defaults to 0.  (See also the q option.)

       j[just]   If  just  is  1, par justifies the OP, inserting spaces between
                 words so that all lines in the OP have length width (except the
                 last, if last is 0).  Defaults to 0.  (See also the w, l, and f
                 options.)

       l[last]   If last is 1, par tries to make the last line of the  OP  about
                 the same length as the others.  Defaults to 0.

       q[quote]  If quote is 1, then before each segment is scanned for bodiless
                 lines, par supplies vacant lines  between  different  quotation
                 nesting  levels as follows:  For each pair of adjacent lines in
                 the segment, (scanned from the top down) which  have  different
                 quoteprefixes, one of two actions is taken.  If invis is 0, and
                 either line consists entirely of quote  characters  and  spaces
                 (or  is  empty),  that  line is truncated to the longest common
                 prefix of the two lines (both are truncated if  both  qualify).
                 Otherwise,  a  line  consisting of the longest common prefix of
                 the two lines is inserted between them.  quote also affects the
                 default value of prefix.  Defaults to 0.  (See also the p and i
                 options.)

       R[Report] If Report is 1, it is considered an error for an input word  to
                 contain  more  than  L =  (width - prefix - suffix) characters.
                 Otherwise, such words are chopped after each Lth character into
                 shorter words.  Defaults to 0.
&#12;       t[touch]  Has no effect if suffix is 0 or just is 1.  Otherwise, if touch
                 is 0, all lines in the OP have length width.  If  touch  is  1,
                 the  length  of the lines is decreased until the suffixes touch
                 the body of the OP.  Defaults to the  logical  OR  of  fit  and
                 last.  (See also the s, j, w, f, and l options.)

       If  an argument begins with a number, that number is assumed to belong to
       a p option if it is 8 or less, and to a w option otherwise.

       If the value of any parameter is set more than once, the  last  value  is
       used.   When unset parameters are assigned default values, hang and quote
       are assigned before prefix, and fit and last are  assigned  before  touch
       (because of the dependencies).

       It is an error if width &lt;= prefix + suffix.

ENVIRONMENT
       PARBODY   Determines  the  initial set of body characters (which are used
                 for determining comprelens and comsuflens), using charset  syn&#8208;
                 tax.  If PARBODY is not set, the set of body characters is ini&#8208;
                 tially empty.

       PARINIT   If set, par will read command line options from PARINIT  before
                 it  reads  them  from  the  command  line.  Within the value of
                 PARINIT, arguments are separated by white characters.

       PARPROTECT
                 Determines the set of protective characters, using charset syn&#8208;
                 tax.   If  PARPROTECT is not set, the set of protective charac&#8208;
                 ters is initially empty.

       PARQUOTE  Determines the set of quote characters, using  charset  syntax.
                 If  PARQUOTE  is not set, the set of quote characters initially
                 contains only the greater-than sign (&gt;) and the space.

       If a NUL character appears in the value of an  environment  variable,  it
       and the rest of the string will not be seen by par.

       Note  that  the  PARINIT variable, together with the B, P, and Q options,
       renders the other environment variables unnecessary.  They  are  included
       for backward compatibility.

DETAILS
       Lines are terminated by newline characters, but the newlines are not con&#8208;
       sidered to be included in the lines.  If the last character of the  input
       is a non-newline, a newline will be inferred immediately after it (but if
       the input is empty, no newline will be  inferred;  the  number  of  input
       lines  will be 0).  Thus, the input can always be viewed as a sequence of
       lines.

       Protected lines are copied unchanged from the input to the  output.   All
       other input lines, as they are read, have any NUL characters removed, and
       every white character (except newlines) turned into a  space.   Actually,
       each  tab character is turned into Tab - (n % Tab) spaces, where n is the
       number of characters preceding the tab character on the  line  (evaluated
       after earlier tab characters have been expanded).

       Blank lines in the input are transformed into empty lines in the output.

       If  repeat  is  0, all bodiless lines are vacant, and they are all simply
       stripped of trailing spaces before being output.  If  repeat  is  not  0,
       only  vacant  lines  whose  suffixes  have length 0 are treated that way;
       other bodiless lines have the number of instances of their repeat charac&#8208;
       ters increased or decreased until the length of the line is width.

       If  expel is 1, superfluous lines are not output.  If quote and invis are
       both 1, there may be invisible lines; they are not output.

       The input is divided into segments, which are divided into blocks,  which
       are  divided  into IPs.  The exact process depends on the values of quote
       and div (see q and d in the OPTIONS section).  The remainder of this sec&#8208;
       tion  describes  the process which is applied independently to each IP to
       construct the corresponding OP.

       After the values of the parameters are determined (see the  OPTIONS  sec&#8208;
       tion), the first prefix characters and the last suffix characters of each
       input line are removed and remembered.  It is an error for  any  line  to
       contain fewer than prefix + suffix characters.

       The  remaining  text  is  treated as a sequence of characters, not lines.
       The text is broken into words, which are separated by spaces.  That is, a
       word  is a maximal sub-sequence of non-spaces.  If guess is 1, some words
       might be merged (see g in the OPTIONS section).  The first word  includes
       any spaces that precede it on the same line.

       Let L = width - prefix - suffix.

       If Report is 0, some words may get chopped up at this point (see R in the
       OPTIONS section).

       The words are reassembled, preserving their order, into lines.   If  just
       is  0,  adjacent words within a line are separated by a single space, (or
       sometimes two if guess is 1), and line breaks  are  chosen  so  that  the
       paragraph satisfies the following properties:

              1) No line contains more than L characters.

              2) If fit is 1, the difference between the lengths of the shortest
                 and longest lines is as small as possible.

              3) The shortest line is as long as possible, subject to properties
                 1 and 2.

              4) Let  target be L if fit is 0, or the length of the longest line
                 if fit is 1.  The sum of the squares of the differences between
                 target  and  the  lengths of the lines is as small as possible,
                 subject to properties 1, 2, and 3.

            If last is 0, the last line does not count as a line  for  the  pur&#8208;
            poses of properties 2, 3, and 4 above.

            If  all  the  words  fit  on a single line, the properties as worded
            above don&apos;t make much sense.  In  that  case,  no  line  breaks  are
            inserted.

       If just is 1, adjacent words within a line are separated by one space (or
       sometimes two if guess is 1) plus zero or more extra spaces.   The  value
       of  fit  is disregarded, and line breaks are chosen so that the paragraph
       satisfies the following properties:

              1) Every line contains exactly L characters.

              2) The largest inter-word gap is as small as possible, subject  to
                 property 1.  (An inter-word gap consists only of the extra spa&#8208;
                 ces, not the regular spaces.)

              3) The sum of the squares of the lengths of the inter-word gaps is
                 as small as possible, subject to properties 1 and 2.

            If  last  is  0, the last line does not count as a line for the pur&#8208;
            poses of property 1, and it does not require or  contain  any  extra
            spaces.

            Extra  spaces  are  distributed  as  uniformly as possible among the
            inter-word gaps in each line.

            In a justified paragraph, every  line  must  contain  at  least  two
            words,  but  that&apos;s not always possible to accomplish.  If the para&#8208;
            graph cannot be justified, it is considered an error.

       If the number of lines in the resulting  paragraph  is  less  than  hang,
       empty lines are added at the end to bring the number of lines up to hang.

       If just is 0 and touch is 1, L is changed to be the length of the longest
       line.

       If suffix is not 0, each line is padded at the end with spaces  to  bring
       its length up to L.

       To  each  line  is  prepended  prefix characters.  Let n be the number of
       lines in the IP, let afp be the augmented fallback prelen of the IP,  and
       let  fs  be  the  fallback  suflen  of  the IP.  The characters which are
       prepended to the ith line are chosen as follows:

           1) If i &lt;= n, the characters are  copied  from  the  ones  that  were
              removed from the beginning of the nth input line.

           2) If i &gt; n &gt; hang, the characters are copied from the ones that were
              removed from the beginning of the last input line.

           3) If i &gt; n and n &lt;= hang, the first min(afp,prefix) of  the  charac&#8208;
              ters are copied from the ones that were removed from the beginning
              of the last input line, and the rest are all spaces.

       Then to each line is appended suffix characters.   The  characters  which
       are appended to the ith line are chosen as follows:

           1) If  i  &lt;=  n,  the  characters  are copied from the ones that were
              removed from the end of the nth input line.

           2) If i &gt; n &gt; hang, the characters are copied from the ones that were
              removed from the end of the last input line.

           3) If i &gt; n and n &lt;= hang, the first min(fs,suffix) of the characters
              are copied from the ones that were removed from the  beginning  of
              the last input line, and the rest are all spaces.

       Finally, the lines are printed to the output as the OP.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If there are no errors, par returns EXIT_SUCCESS (see &lt;stdlib.h&gt;).

       If there is an error, an error message will be printed to the output, and
       par will return EXIT_FAILURE.  If the error is local to  a  single  para&#8208;
       graph,  the  preceding  paragraphs will have been output before the error
       was detected.  Line numbers in error messages are  local  to  the  IP  in
       which  the error occurred.  All error messages begin with &quot;par error:&quot; on
       a line by itself.  Error messages concerning command line or  environment
       variable  syntax  are accompanied by the same usage message that the help
       option produces.

       Unless the option E is set, trying to print an  error  message  would  be
       futile  if  an  error  resulted  from  an output function, so par doesn&apos;t
       bother doing any error checking on output functions if E is 0.

EXAMPLES
       The superiority of par&apos;s dynamic  programming  algorithm  over  a  greedy
       algorithm  (such  as  the  one  used by fmt) can be seen in the following
       example:

       Original paragraph (note that each line begins with 8 spaces):

          We the people of the United States,
          in order to form a more perfect union,
          establish justice,
          insure domestic tranquility,
          provide for the common defense,
          promote the general welfare,
          and secure the blessing of liberty
          to ourselves and our posterity,
          do ordain and establish the Constitution
          of the United States of America.

       After a greedy algorithm with width = 39:

          We the people of the United
          States, in order to form a more
          perfect union, establish
          justice, insure domestic
          tranquility, provide for the
          common defense, promote the
          general welfare, and secure the
          blessing of liberty to
          ourselves and our posterity, do
          ordain and establish the
          Constitution of the United
          States of America.

       After &quot;par 39&quot;:

          We the people of the United
          States, in order to form a
          more perfect union, establish
          justice, insure domestic
          tranquility, provide for the
          common defense, promote the
          general welfare, and secure
          the blessing of liberty to
          ourselves and our posterity,
          do ordain and establish the
          Constitution of the United
          States of America.

       The line breaks chosen by par are clearly more eye-pleasing.

       par is most useful in conjunction with the text-filtering features of  an
       editor,  such as the ! commands of vi.  You may wish to add the following
       lines to your .exrc file:

          &quot; use Bourne shell for speed:
          set shell=/bin/sh
          &quot;
          &quot; reformat paragraph with no arguments:
          map ** {!}par^M}
          &quot;
          &quot; reformat paragraph with arguments:
          map *^V  {!}par

       Note that the leading spaces must be removed, and that what is  shown  as
       ^M  and  ^V really need to be ctrl-M and ctrl-V.  Also note that the last
       map command contains two spaces following the ctrl-V, plus one at the end
       of the line.

       To  reformat  a  simple paragraph delimited by blank lines in vi, you can
       put the cursor anywhere in it and type &quot;**&quot; (star star). If you  need  to
       supply  arguments  to  par,  you can type &quot;* &quot; (star space) instead, then
       type the arguments.

       The rest of this section is a series of before-and-after pictures showing
       some  typical  uses  of  par.  In all cases, no environment variables are
       set.

LIMITATIONS
       The guess feature guesses wrong in cases like the following:
&#12;          I calc&apos;d the approx.
          Fermi level to 3 sig. digits.

       With guess = 1, par will incorrectly assume that &quot;approx.&quot;  ends  a  sen&#8208;
       tence.  If the input were:

          I calc&apos;d the approx. Fermi
          level to 3 sig. digits.

       then  par  would refuse to put a line break between &quot;approx.&quot; and &quot;Fermi&quot;
       in the output, mainly to avoid creating the first situation (in case  the
       paragraph  were  to  be  fed  back through par again).  This non-breaking
       space policy  does  come  in  handy  for  cases  like  &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot;  and
       &quot;Jan. 1&quot;, though.

       The  guess  feature  only  goes  one way.  par can preserve wide sentence
       breaks in a paragraph, or remove them, but it can&apos;t insert them  if  they
       aren&apos;t already in the input.

       If you use tabs, you may not like the way par handles (or doesn&apos;t handle)
       them.  It expands them into spaces.  I didn&apos;t let par output tabs because
       tabs  don&apos;t  make  sense.   Not everyone&apos;s terminal has the same tab set&#8208;
       tings, so text files containing tabs are  sometimes  mangled.   In  fact,
       almost  every  text  file  containing tabs gets mangled when something is
       inserted at the beginning of each line (when quoting e-mail or commenting
       out  a  section  of  a  shell script, for example), making them a pain to
       edit.  In my opinion, the world  would  be  a  nicer  place  if  everyone
       stopped  using tabs, so I&apos;m doing my part by not letting par output them.
       (Thanks to Eric Stuebe for showing me the light about tabs.)

       There is currently no way for the length of the output prefix  to  differ
       from  the  length of the input prefix.  Ditto for the suffix.  I may con&#8208;
       sider adding this capability in a future release, but right now  I&apos;m  not
       sure how I&apos;d want it to work.

APOLOGIES
       Par began in July 1993 as a small program designed to do one narrow task:
       reformat a single paragraph that might have a border on either side.   It
       was  pretty clean back then.  Over the next three months, it very rapidly
       expanded to handle multiple paragraphs, offer more options, and take bet&#8208;
       ter guesses, at the cost of becoming extremely complex, and very unclean.
       It is nowhere near the optimal design for the larger task it now tries to
       address.   Its only redeeming features are that it is extremely useful (I
       find it indispensable), extremely portable, and very stable (between  the
       release of version 1.41 on 1993-Oct-31 and the release of version 1.52 on
       2001-Apr-29, no incorrect behavior was reported).

       Back in 1993 I had very little experience at  writing  documentation  for
       users,  so the documentation for Par became rather nightmarish.  There is
       no separation between how-it-works (which is painfully complex) and  how-
       to-use-it (which is fairly simple, if you can ever figure it out).

       Someday I ought to reexamine the problem, and redesign a new, clean solu&#8208;
       tion from scratch.  I don&apos;t know when I might get  enough  free  time  to
       start on such a project.  Text files may be obsolete by then.

BUGS
       If  I knew of any bugs, I wouldn&apos;t release the package.  Of course, there
       may be bugs that I haven&apos;t yet discovered.

       If you find any bugs (in the program or in the documentation), or if  you
       have any suggestions, please send e-mail to:

              amc@cs.berkeley.edu

       When  reporting  a  bug,  please include the exact input and command line
       options used, and the version number of par, so that I can reproduce it.

       The latest release of Par is available on the Web at:
