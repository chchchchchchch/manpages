       Parcellite  features  a  clipboard CLI. Unrecognized options and the con&#8208;
       tents of your standard input get copied to your clipboard. See CLI  EXAM&#8208;
       PLES.

              Do not use status icon

               Check &apos;Save history&apos; to save history on close.
               &apos;Position history&apos; - Set the location where history  appears.  If

              Turns red if not found. Goes to top (Alt-E) line when no chars are
              entered for search

              ning and end of entry.

               &apos;Trim Newlines&apos; - If checked, will replace newlines with spaces.


Display Tab
        &apos;Show in Single line&apos; does nothing

        &apos;Show in reverse order&apos; reverses the history so the first entry is  last
       and the last is first.

        &apos;Omit  items&apos;  referrs to omitting characters that don&apos;t fit in the his&#8208;
       tory window width. This is for display only.


History Dialog Behavior
       use the Ctrl or Shift key in conjunction with right-click.

        If you hold Ctrl, then it toggles the delete on a single item.

        If you hold Shift while holding down right-click (this is like a  right-
       drag), then it toggles each item as it enters the item.

        To complete the delete, hit enter.
