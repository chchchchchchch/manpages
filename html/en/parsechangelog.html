NAME
       parsechangelog - parse Debian changelogs and output them in other formats

SYNOPSIS
       parsechangelog [options] [changelogfile]

        Options:
           --help, -h                  print usage information
           --version, -V               print version information
           --file, -l &lt;file&gt;           changelog file to parse, defaults
                                       to &apos;debian/changelog&apos;
           -F&lt;changelogformat&gt;         ignored if changelogformat = &apos;debian&apos;
                                       for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           -L&lt;libdir&gt;                  ignored for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           --format &lt;outputformat&gt;     see man page for list of available
                                       output formats, defaults to &apos;dpkg&apos;
                                       for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           --since, -s, -v &lt;version&gt;   include all changes later than version
           --until, -u &lt;version&gt;       include all changes earlier than version
           --from, -f &lt;version&gt;        include all changes equal or later
                                       than version
           --to, -t &lt;version&gt;          include all changes up to or equal
                                       than version
           --count, -c, -n &lt;number&gt;    include &lt;number&gt; entries from the top
                                       (or the tail if &lt;number&gt; is lower than 0)
           --offset, -o &lt;number&gt;       change the starting point for --count,
                                       counted from the top (or the tail if
                                       &lt;number&gt; is lower than 0)
           --all                       include all changes

       If neither &quot;changelogfile&quot; nor &quot;-l &lt;file&gt;&quot; are specified,
       debian/changelog will be used. If two different files are specified the
       program will abort.

       If the filename is &quot;-&quot; the program reads the changelog from standard
       input.

       &quot;--all&quot; overrides all other range selecting options. &quot;--count&quot; overrides
       all other range selection options except for &quot;--all&quot;.  The range
       selecting options can be mixed together, but only one of &quot;--since&quot; and
       &quot;--from&quot; and one of &quot;--until&quot; and &quot;--to&quot; can be specified at the same
       time.

       The dpkg and rfc822 formats default to showing only the first entry when
       no other options are given with while the HTML and XML formats default to
       showing all entries.

       For a more extensive documentation of the range selecting options and
       some (hopefully enlightening) examples see &quot;COMMON OUTPUT OPTIONS&quot; in
       Parse::DebianChangelog.

DESCRIPTION
       parsechangelog parses Debian changelogs as described in the Debian policy
       (version 3.6.2.1 at the time of this writing) and converts them to other
       output formats. See section &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; for locations where to find the
       full format definition.

       The output formats supported are currently:

       dpkg
           Format as known from dpkg-parsechangelog(1). All requested entries
           (see &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; on how to select specific entries) are returned in
           the usual Debian control format, merged in one stanza, ready to be
           used in a .changes file.

       rfc822
           Similar to the &quot;dpkg&quot; format, but the requested entries are returned
           as one stanza each, i.e. they are not merged. This is probably the
           format to use if you want a machine-usable representation of the
           changelog.

       xml Just a simple XML dump of the changelog data. Without any schema or
           DTD currently, just some made up XML. The actual format might still
           change. Comments and Improvements welcome.

       html
           The changelog is converted to a somewhat nice looking HTML file with
           some nice features as a quick-link bar with direct links to every
           entry.  NOTE: This is not configurable yet and was specifically
           designed to be used on &lt;http://packages.debian.org/&gt;. This is planned
           to be changed until version 1.0. The used Parse::DebianChangelog
           module already supports configuration, however, this isn&apos;t exposed by
           this program yet.
