PAUSE(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   PAUSE(2)



NAME
       pause - wait for signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int pause(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pause() causes the calling process (or thread) to sleep until a signal is
       delivered that either terminates the process or causes the invocation  of
       a signal-catching function.

RETURN VALUE
       pause()  only  returns  when  a signal was caught and the signal-catching
       function returned.  In this case pause() returns -1, and errno is set  to
       EINTR.

ERRORS
       EINTR  a signal was caught and the signal-catching function returned.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
