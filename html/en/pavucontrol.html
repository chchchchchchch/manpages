PAVUCONTROL(1)                                                    PAVUCONTROL(1)



NAME
       pavucontrol - A volume control for the PulseAudio sound server

SYNOPSIS
       pavucontrol

DESCRIPTION
       A simple volume control tool (mixer) for the PulseAudio sound server. In
       contrast to classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the
       volume of hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It
       also allows you to redirect a playback stream to another output device
       without interrupting playback.

OPTIONS
       pavucontrol does not accept any options.
