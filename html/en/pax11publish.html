NAME
       pax11publish - PulseAudio X11 Credential Utility

SYNOPSIS
       pax11publish -h

       pax11publish [options] [-d]

       pax11publish [options] -e

       pax11publish [options] -i

       pax11publish [options] -r

DESCRIPTION
       The pax11publish utility can be used to dump or manipulate the PulseAudio
       server credentials that can be stored as properties on the X11 root  win&#8208;
       dow.

       Please  note that the loadable module module-x11-publish exports the same
       information directly from the PulseAudio sound server, and should in most
       cases be used in preference over this tool.

       Use  the  following command to dump the raw PulseAudio-specific data that
       is stored in your X11 root window:

       xprop -root | grep ^PULSE_

OPTIONS
       -h     Show help.

       -d     Read the PulseAudio server credentials currently set  on  the  X11
              root window and dump them in a human readable form. This reads the
              PULSE_SERVER, PULSE_SINK, PULSE_SOURCE  and  PULSE_COOKIE  proper&#8208;
              ties.

       -i     Similar  to  -d,  however  dumps them in a Bourne shell compatible
              format so they may be used together with the eval shell command to
              set  the  $PULSE_SERVER,  $PULSE_SINK,  $PULSE_SOURCE  environment
              variables. Also reads the authentication cookie from the root win&#8208;
              dow and stores it in ~/.pulse-cookie.

       -e     Export  the currently locally used sound server, sink, source con&#8208;
              figuration to the X11 root window. This takes the  data  from  the
              $PULSE_SERVER,  $PULSE_SINK,  $PULSE_SOURCE  environment variables
              and combines them with  the  data  from  ~/.pulse/client.conf  (or
              /etc/pulse/client.conf  if  that file does not exist). If specific
              options are passed on the  command  line  (-S,  -O,  -I,  -c,  see
              below),  they  take precedence. Also uploads the local authentica&#8208;
              tion cookie ~/.pulse-cookie to the X11 server.

       -r     Removes the configured PulseAudio configuration from the X11  root
              window.

       -D DISPLAY
              Connect  to  the specified X11 display, instead of the default one
              configured in $DISPLAY.

       -S SERVER
              Only valid for -e:  export  the  specified  PulseAudio  server  as
              default to the X11 display instead of the one configured via local
              configuration.

       -O SINK
              Only valid for -e: export the specified sink as  default  sink  to
              the X11 display instead of the one configured via local configura&#8208;
              tion.

       -I SOURCE
              Only valid for -e: export the specified source as default  to  the
              X11 display instead of the one configured via local configuration.

       -c FILE
              Only  valid  for  -e:  export the PulseAudio authentication cookie
              stored in the specified file to the X11 display instead of the one
              stored in ~/.pulse-cookie.
