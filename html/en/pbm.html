NAME
       pbm - portable bitmap file format

DESCRIPTION
       The portable bitmap format is a lowest common denominator monochrome file
       format.  It serves as the common language of a  large  family  of  bitmap
       conversion filters.  Because the format pays no heed to efficiency, it is
       simple and general enough that one can easily develop programs to convert
       to  and  from  just about any other graphics format, or to manipulate the
       image.

       This is not a format that one would normally use to store a  file  or  to
       transmit  it  to  someone -- it&apos;s too expensive and not expressive enough
       for that.  It&apos;s just an intermediary format.   In  it&apos;s  purest  use,  it
       lives only in a pipe between two other programs.

       The format definition is as follows.

       A PBM file consists of a sequence of one or more PBM images. There are no
       data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between images.

       Each PBM image consists of the following:

       - A &quot;magic number&quot; for identifying the file type.  A  pbm  image&apos;s  magic
         number is the two characters &quot;P4&quot;.

       - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

       - The width in pixels of the image, formatted as ASCII characters in dec&#8208;
         imal.

       - Whitespace.

       - The height in pixels of the image, again in ASCII decimal.

       - Newline or other single whitespace character.

       - A raster of Height rows, in order from top  to  bottom.   Each  row  is
         Width  bits,  packed  8 to a byte, with don&apos;t care bits to fill out the
         last byte in the row.  Each bit represents a pixel: 1 is  black,  0  is
         white.   The  order of the pixels is left to right.  The order of their
         storage within each file byte is most significant bit to least signifi&#8208;
         cant  bit.   The  order  of the file bytes is from the beginning of the
         file toward the end of the file.

       - Characters from a &quot;#&quot; to the next end-of-line, before the  width/height
         line, are comments and are ignored.

       There  is actually another version of the PBM format, even more more sim&#8208;
       plistic, more lavishly wasteful of space  than  PBM,  called  Plain  PBM.
       Plain  PBM  actually came first, but even its inventor couldn&apos;t stand its
       recklessly squanderous use of resources after a  while  and  switched  to
       what  we  now know as the regular PBM format.  But Plain PBM is so redun&#8208;
       dant -- so overstated -- that it&apos;s virtually impossible  to  break.   You
       can  send it through the most liberal mail system (which was the original
       purpose of the PBM format) and it will arrive still  readable.   You  can
       flip  a  dozen  random  bits  and easily piece back together the original
       image.  And we hardly need to define the format  here,  because  you  can
       decode it by inspection.

       The difference is:
&#12;       - There is exactly one image in a file.

       - The &quot;magic number&quot; is &quot;P1&quot; instead of &quot;P4&quot;.

       - Each  pixel in the raster is represented by a byte containing ASCII &apos;1&apos;
         or &apos;0&apos;, representing black and white respectively.  There are  no  fill
         bits at the end of a row.

       - White space in the raster section is ignored.

       - You  can  put  any  junk you want after the raster, if it starts with a
         white space character.

       - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

       Here is an example of a small bitmap in the plain PBM format:
       P1
       # feep.pbm
       24 7
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
       0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
       0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
       0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
       0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

       You can generate the Plain PBM format from the regular PBM format  (first
       image in the file only) with the pnmtoplainpnm program.


       Programs  that read this format should be as lenient as possible, accept&#8208;
       ing anything that looks remotely like a bitmap.


COMPATIBILITY
       Before July 2000, there could be at most one image in a PBM file.   As  a
       result,  most tools to process PBM files ignore (and don&apos;t read) any data
       after the first image.
