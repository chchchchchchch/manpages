NAME
       pbmreduce - read a portable bitmap and reduce it N times

SYNOPSIS
       pbmreduce [-floyd|-fs|-threshold ] [-value val] N [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable bitmap as input.  Reduces it by a factor of N, and pro&#8208;
       duces a portable bitmap as output.

       pbmreduce duplicates a lot of the functionality of pgmtopbm; you could do
       something like pnmscale | pgmtopbm, but pbmreduce is a lot faster.

       pbmreduce  can  be  used to &quot;re-halftone&quot; an image.  Let&apos;s say you have a
       scanner that only produces black&amp;white, not grayscale, and it does a ter&#8208;
       rible  job  of  halftoning (most b&amp;w scanners fit this description).  One
       way to fix the halftoning is to scan at the highest possible  resolution,
       say  300 dpi, and then reduce by a factor of three or so using pbmreduce.
       You can even correct the brightness of an  image,  by  using  the  -value
       flag.

OPTIONS
       By  default, the halftoning after the reduction is done via boustrophedo&#8208;
       nic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion; however, the -threshold flag can  be
       used  to  specify  simple  thresholding.   This gives better results when
       reducing line drawings.

       The -value flag alters the thresholding value for all quantizations.   It
       should  be a real number between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images;
       below 0.5 means lighter.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
