NAME
       pbmto10x - convert a portable bitmap into Gemini 10X printer graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmto10x [-h] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable bitmap as input.  Produces a file of Gemini 10X printer
       graphics as output.  The 10x&apos;s printer codes are alleged to be similar to
       the Epson codes.

       Note that there is no 10xtopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

OPTIONS
       The resolution is normally 60H by 72V.  If the -h flag is specified, res&#8208;
       olution is 120H by 144V.  You may find  it  useful  to  rotate  landscape
       images before printing.
