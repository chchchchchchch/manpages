NAME
       pbmtobbnbg - convert a portable bitmap into BitGraph graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtobbnbg [rasterop] [x y] &lt; pbmfile

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Produces BBN BitGraph terminal Display
       Pixel Data (DPD) sequence as output.

       The rasterop can be specified on the command line.  If this is omitted, 3
       (replace)  will  be  used.   A  position in (x,y) coordinates can also be
       specified.  If both are given, the rasterop comes  first.   The  portable
       bitmap is always taken from the standard input.

       Note that there is no bgtopbm tool.

       This programm was initially named pbmtobg.
