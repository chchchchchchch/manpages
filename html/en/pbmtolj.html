NAME
       pbmtolj - convert a portable bitmap into HP LaserJet format


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolj  [-resolution  N] [-float] [-noreset] [-packbits] [-delta] [-com&#8208;
       press] [pbmfile] [-copies N]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PBM image as input.  Produces HP LaserJet data as output.

       Note that there is no ljtopbm tool.


OPTIONS
       -resolution
              Specifies the resolution of the output device,  in  dpi.   Typical
              values are 75, 100, 150, 300, and 600.  The default is 75.

       -float Suppresses  positioning  information.  The default is to write the
              sequence ESC &amp; l 0 E to the output file.

       -noreset
              Prevents pbmtolj from writing the reset sequences to the beginning
              and end of the output file.

       -packbits
              Enables use of TIFF packbits compression.

       -delta Enables use of delta-between-rows compression.

       -compress
              Enables use of both TIFF packbits, and delta-between-rows compres&#8208;
              sion.

       -copies
              Specifies the the number of copies. The default is 1.  This option
              controls the &quot;number of copies&quot; printer control; pbmtolj generates
              only one copy of the image.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
