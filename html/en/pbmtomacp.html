NAME
       pbmtomacp - convert a portable bitmap into a MacPaint file

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomacp [-l left] [-r right] [-b bottom] [-t top] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  bitmap as input.  If no input-file is given, standard
       input is assumed.  Produces a MacPaint file as output.

       The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will  need  a
       program such as mcvert to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that con&#8208;
       tains the necessary information to identify the file as a  PNTG  file  to
       MacOS.

OPTIONS
       Left, right, bottom &amp; top let you define a square into the pbm file, that
       must be converted.  Default is the whole file.  If the file is too  large
       for a MacPaint-file, the bitmap is cut to fit from ( left, top ).

BUGS
       The source code contains comments in a language other than English.
