NAME
       pbmtopgm - convert portable bitmap to portable graymap by averaging areas


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtopgm width height [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       pbmtopgm reads a portable bitmap as input.  It outputs a portable graymap
       in which each pixel&apos;s gray level is the average the surrounding black and
       white  input  pixels.   The  surrounding  area is a rectangle of width by
       height pixels.

       In other words, this is a convolution.  pbmtopgm is similar to a  special
       case of pnmconvol.

       You may need a ppmsmooth step after pbmtopgm.

       pbmtopgm  has  the effect of anti-aliasing bitmaps which contain distinct
       line features.

       pbmtopgm works best with odd sample width and heights.

       You don&apos;t need pbmtopgm just to use a PGM program on a  PBM  image.   Any
       PGM program (assuming it uses the Netpbm libraries to read the PGM input)
       takes PBM input as if it were PGM, with only the mininum and maximum gray
       levels.   So  unless your convolution rectangle is bigger than one pixel,
       you&apos;re not gaining anything with a pbmtopgm step.
