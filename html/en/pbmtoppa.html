NAME
       pbmtoppa - convert PBM image to HP Printer Performance Architecture (PPA)

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoppa

       [pbm_file [ppa_file]]


DESCRIPTION
       pbmtoppa  converts  page  images  in  PBM format to Hewlett Packard&apos;s PPA
       (Printer Performance Architecture) format, which is the data stream  for&#8208;
       mat  expected by some HP &quot;Windows-only&quot; printers including the HP Deskjet
       820C series, the HP DeskJet 720 series, and the HP DeskJet 1000 series.

       pbm_file is the file specification of the input file or  -  for  Standard
       Input.  The default is Standard Input.

       The  input  file  contains  one or more PBM images, with each one being a
       single page.  Each image must have the exact dimensions of a page (at 600
       pixels  per  inch in both directions).  Significantly, this is the format
       the Ghostscript produces.

       ppa_file is the file specification of the output file or -  for  Standard
       Output.  The default is Standard Output.


       To  print  Postscript on an HP PPA printer, just use Ghostscript with the
       pbmraw (or pbm) device driver.

       You can generate a test page for use with this program with pbmpage.

       You can also set up a printer filter so you can submit PBM input directly
       to  your  print  queue.  See the documentation for your print spooler for
       information on how to do that, or look in hp820install.doc for an example
       lpd print filter for Postscript and text files.

       Sometimes,  pbmtoppa  generates  a  file which the printer will not print
       (because pbmtoppa&apos;s input is unprintable).  When this happens, all  three
       lights blink to signal the error.  This is usually because there is mate&#8208;
       rial outside of the printer&apos;s printable area.  To make  the  file  print,
       increase  the  margins via pbmtoppa options or a configuration file.  See
       the CALIBRATION section below.


OPTIONS
       -v version
              printer version (720, 820, or 1000)

       -x xoff
              vertical offset adjustment in 1&quot;/600

       -y yoff
              horizontal offset adjustment in 1&quot;/600

       -t topmarg
              top margin in 1&quot;/600    (default: 150 = 0.25&quot;)

       -l leftmarg
              left margin in 1&quot;/600   (default: 150 = 0.25&quot;)

       -r rightmarg
              right margin in 1&quot;/600  (default: 150 = 0.25&quot;)
&#12;       -b botmarg
              bottom margin in 1&quot;/600 (default: 150 = 0.25&quot;)

       -s paper
              paper size: us or a4.  Default is us.

       -f cfgfile
              read parameters from configuration file cfgfile


       The -x and -y options accumulate.

       The -v option resets the horizontal and vertical adjustments to an inter&#8208;
       nal default.




CONFIGURATION FILES
       You  can  use  configuration  files to specify parameters rather than use
       invocation options.  pbmtoppa processes the file  /etc/pbmtoppa.conf,  if
       it exists, before processing any options.  It then processes each config&#8208;
       uration file named by a -f option in order, applying the parameters  from
       the  configuration  file  as  if they were invocation options used in the
       place of the -f option.

       Configuration files have the following format:

       #Comment
       key1 value1
       key2 value2
       [etc.]

       Valid keys are version, xoffset, yoffset, topmargin,  leftmargin,  right&#8208;
       margin,  bottommargin,  papersize, or any non-null prefix of these words.
       Valid values are the same as with the  corresponding  invocation  parame&#8208;
       ters.



EXAMPLES
       Print a test pattern:

       pbmpage | pbmppa &gt;/dev/lp1

       Print three pages:

       cat page1.pbm page2.pbm page3.pbm | pbmppa &gt;/dev/lp1

       Print the Postscript file myfile.ps:

       gs -sDEVICE=rawpbm -q -dNOPAUSE -r600 \
          -sOutputFile=- myfile.ps \
       | pbmtoppa | lpr


CALIBRATION
       To  be able to print successfully and properly, you need to tell pbmtoppa
       an X and a Y offset appropriate for your printer to use  when  generating
       the  page.   You  can specify these offsets with the -x and -y invocation
       options or with the xoff and yoff parameters in a pbmtoppa  configuration
       file.

       To determine the correct offsets, use the pbmpage program.

       If  while  trying  to do this calibration, the printer refuses to print a
       page, but just blinks all three lights, specify large margins  (e.g.  600
       pixels  -- one inch) via pbmpage invocation options while doing the cali&#8208;
       bration.

       For example:

       pbmpage | pbmtoppa &gt;/dev/lp1
       or
       pbmpage | pbmtoppa | lpr -l
       (if your printer filter recognizes the &apos;-l&apos; (direct output) parameter).

       In the test pattern, the grid is marked off in pixel coordinate  numbers.
       Unfortunately,  these coordinates are probably cut off before the edge of
       the paper.  You&apos;ll have to use a ruler to estimate the  pixel  coordinate
       of  the left and top edges of the actual sheet of paper (should be within
       +/- 300, may be negative; there are 600 pixels per inch).

       Add these coordinates to the X and Y offsets by either editing  the  con&#8208;
       figuration file or using the -x and -y command-line parameters.

       When  pbmtoppa  is  properly calibrated, the center mark should be in the
       center of the paper.  Also, the margins should be able to be as small  as
       1/4  inch without causing the printer to choke with &apos;blinking lights syn&#8208;
       drome&apos;.


REDHAT LINUX INSTALLATION
       RedHat users may find the following  tip  from  Panayotis  Vryonis  &lt;vry&#8208;
       pan@hol.gr&gt;  helpful.   The same should work for the 820 and 1000, but it
       hasn&apos;t been tested.  Also, use the pbmraw GSDriver if you have  it;  it&apos;s
       faster.

       Here is a tip to intergrate HP720C support in RedHat&apos;s printtool:

       Install pbm2ppa. Copy pbm2ppa to /usr/bin.

       Edit  &quot;printerdb&quot; (in my system it is found in /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfil&#8208;
       ters ) and append the following lines:

       ----------------------Cut here-----------------------
       StartEntry: DeskJet720C
         GSDriver: pbm
         Description: {HP DeskJet 720C}
         About: { \
               This driver supports the HP DeskJet 720C \
               inkjet printer. \
               It does does not support color printing. \
               IMPORTANT! Insert \
                    &quot;- | pbm2ppa -&quot; \
               in the &quot;Extra GS Otions&quot; field.\
             }
         Resolution: {600} {600} {}
       EndEntry ----------------------------------------------------

       Now you can add an HP720C printer just like any other, using printtool.

       pnm2ppa is not part of Netpbm, but  does  the  same  things  as  pbmtoppa
       except  it  also  works  with  color  and  has  lots  more features.  See
       &lt;http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1322&gt;.

       The file INSTALL-MORE in the pbmtoppa directory of the Netpbm source code
       contains  detailed instructions on setting up a system to use pbmtoppa to
       allow convenient printing on HP PPA printers.  It was written by  Michael
       Buehlmann.
&#12;       For  information  about  the  PPA protocol and the separately distributed
       pbm2ppa    program    from    which    pbmtoppa    was    derived,    see
