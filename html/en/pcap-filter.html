PCAP-FILTER(7)                                                    PCAP-FILTER(7)



NAME
       pcap-filter - packet filter syntax

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_compile()  is  used  to compile a string into a filter program.  The
       resulting filter program can then be applied to some stream of packets to
       determine which packets will be supplied to pcap_loop(), pcap_dispatch(),
       pcap_next(), or pcap_next_ex().

       The filter expression consists of one  or  more  primitives.   Primitives
       usually  consist of an id (name or number) preceded by one or more quali&#8208;
       fiers.  There are three different kinds of qualifier:

       type   qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.
              Possible  types  are  host, net , port and portrange.  E.g., `host
              foo&apos;, `net 128.3&apos;, `port 20&apos;, `portrange 6000-6008&apos;.  If there  is
              no type qualifier, host is assumed.

       dir    qualifiers  specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from
              id.  Possible directions are src, dst, src or dst,  src  and  dst,
              ra, ta, addr1, addr2, addr3, and addr4.  E.g., `src foo&apos;, `dst net
              128.3&apos;, `src or dst port ftp-data&apos;.  If there is no dir qualifier,
              src or dst is assumed.  The ra, ta, addr1, addr2, addr3, and addr4
              qualifiers are only valid for IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN  link  lay&#8208;
              ers.   For some link layers, such as SLIP and the ``cooked&apos;&apos; Linux
              capture mode used for the ``any&apos;&apos; device and for some other device
              types,  the inbound and outbound qualifiers can be used to specify
              a desired direction.

       proto  qualifiers restrict the match to a particular protocol.   Possible
              protos are: ether, fddi, tr, wlan, ip, ip6, arp, rarp, decnet, tcp
              and udp.  E.g., `ether src foo&apos;, `arp net 128.3&apos;, `tcp  port  21&apos;,
              `udp  portrange 7000-7009&apos;, `wlan addr2 0:2:3:4:5:6&apos;.  If there is
              no proto qualifier, all protocols consistent  with  the  type  are
              assumed.   E.g.,  `src  foo&apos;  means  `(ip or arp or rarp) src foo&apos;
              (except the latter is not legal syntax), `net bar&apos; means  `(ip  or
              arp or rarp) net bar&apos; and `port 53&apos; means `(tcp or udp) port 53&apos;.

       [`fddi&apos;  is actually an alias for `ether&apos;; the parser treats them identi&#8208;
       cally as meaning ``the data link level  used  on  the  specified  network
       interface.&apos;&apos;   FDDI  headers contain Ethernet-like source and destination
       addresses, and often contain Ethernet-like packet types, so you can  fil&#8208;
       ter  on  these  FDDI  fields  just as with the analogous Ethernet fields.
       FDDI headers also contain other fields, but you cannot name them  explic&#8208;
       itly in a filter expression.

       Similarly,  `tr&apos;  and  `wlan&apos; are aliases for `ether&apos;; the previous para&#8208;
       graph&apos;s statements about FDDI headers also apply to Token Ring and 802.11
       wireless LAN headers.  For 802.11 headers, the destination address is the
       DA field and the source address is the SA field; the BSSID,  RA,  and  TA
       fields aren&apos;t tested.]

       In  addition  to  the  above, there are some special `primitive&apos; keywords
       that don&apos;t follow the pattern:  gateway,  broadcast,  less,  greater  and
       arithmetic expressions.  All of these are described below.

       More  complex  filter expressions are built up by using the words and, or
       and not to combine primitives.  E.g., `host foo and not port ftp and  not
       port  ftp-data&apos;.   To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omit&#8208;
       ted.  E.g., `tcp dst port ftp or ftp-data or domain&apos; is exactly the  same
       as `tcp dst port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain&apos;.
&#12;       Allowable primitives are:

       dst host host
              True if the IPv4/v6 destination field of the packet is host, which
              may be either an address or a name.

       src host host
              True if the IPv4/v6 source field of the packet is host.

       host host
              True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination of the packet  is
              host.

              Any  of  the above host expressions can be prepended with the key&#8208;
              words, ip, arp, rarp, or ip6 as in:
                   ip host host
              which is equivalent to:
                   ether proto \ip and host host
              If host is a name with multiple IP addresses, each address will be
              checked for a match.

       ether dst ehost
              True  if  the Ethernet destination address is ehost.  Ehost may be
              either a name from /etc/ethers or a  number  (see  ethers(3N)  for
              numeric format).

       ether src ehost
              True if the Ethernet source address is ehost.

       ether host ehost
              True  if  either  the  Ethernet  source  or destination address is
              ehost.

       gateway host
              True if the packet used host as a  gateway.   I.e.,  the  Ethernet
              source  or  destination address was host but neither the IP source
              nor the IP destination was host.  Host must be a name and must  be
              found  both  by  the  machine&apos;s host-name-to-IP-address resolution
              mechanisms (host name file, DNS, NIS, etc.) and by  the  machine&apos;s
              host-name-to-Ethernet-address  resolution  mechanism (/etc/ethers,
              etc.).  (An equivalent expression is
                   ether host ehost and not host host
              which can be used with either names or numbers for host /  ehost.)
              This  syntax  does  not work in IPv6-enabled configuration at this
              moment.

       dst net net
              True if the IPv4/v6 destination address of the packet has  a  net&#8208;
              work  number  of  net.  Net may be either a name from the networks
              database (/etc/networks, etc.) or a network number.  An IPv4  net&#8208;
              work  number  can be written as a dotted quad (e.g., 192.168.1.0),
              dotted triple (e.g., 192.168.1), dotted  pair  (e.g,  172.16),  or
              single  number  (e.g.,  10);  the netmask is 255.255.255.255 for a
              dotted  quad  (which  means  that  it&apos;s  really  a  host   match),
              255.255.255.0  for a dotted triple, 255.255.0.0 for a dotted pair,
              or 255.0.0.0 for a single number.  An IPv6 network number must  be
              written out fully; the netmask is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, so IPv6
              &quot;network&quot; matches are really always host matches,  and  a  network
              match requires a netmask length.

       src net net
              True  if  the  IPv4/v6  source address of the packet has a network
              number of net.

       net net
              True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination  address  of  the
              packet has a network number of net.

       net net mask netmask
              True  if  the  IPv4 address matches net with the specific netmask.
              May be qualified with src or dst.  Note that this  syntax  is  not
              valid for IPv6 net.

       net net/len
              True  if  the  IPv4/v6 address matches net with a netmask len bits
              wide.  May be qualified with src or dst.

       dst port port
              True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a
              destination  port  value  of  port.  The port can be a number or a
              name used in /etc/services (see tcp(4P) and udp(4P)).  If  a  name
              is used, both the port number and protocol are checked.  If a num&#8208;
              ber or ambiguous name is used, only the  port  number  is  checked
              (e.g.,  dst port 513 will print both tcp/login traffic and udp/who
              traffic, and port domain will print both tcp/domain and udp/domain
              traffic).

       src port port
              True if the packet has a source port value of port.

       port port
              True  if  either  the  source or destination port of the packet is
              port.

       dst portrange port1-port2
              True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a
              destination  port  value between port1 and port2.  port1 and port2
              are interpreted in the same fashion  as  the  port  parameter  for
              port.

       src portrange port1-port2
              True  if  the  packet  has  a  source port value between port1 and
              port2.

       portrange port1-port2
              True if either the source or destination port  of  the  packet  is
              between port1 and port2.

              Any  of  the above port or port range expressions can be prepended
              with the keywords, tcp or udp, as in:
                   tcp src port port
              which matches only tcp packets whose source port is port.

       less length
              True if the packet has a length less  than  or  equal  to  length.
              This is equivalent to:
                   len &lt;= length.

       greater length
              True  if  the packet has a length greater than or equal to length.
              This is equivalent to:
                   len &gt;= length.

       ip proto protocol
              True if the packet is an IPv4 packet (see ip(4P)) of protocol type
              protocol.   Protocol  can  be  a  number or one of the names icmp,
              icmp6, igmp, igrp, pim, ah, esp, vrrp, udp, or tcp.  Note that the
              identifiers  tcp,  udp,  and  icmp  are  also keywords and must be
              escaped via backslash (\), which is \\ in the C-shell.  Note  that
              this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.

       ip6 proto protocol
              True  if  the  packet is an IPv6 packet of protocol type protocol.
              Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.

       ip6 protochain protocol
              True if the packet is IPv6 packet, and  contains  protocol  header
              with type protocol in its protocol header chain.  For example,
                   ip6 protochain 6
              matches  any  IPv6 packet with TCP protocol header in the protocol
              header chain.  The packet may contain, for example, authentication
              header,  routing header, or hop-by-hop option header, between IPv6
              header and TCP header.  The BPF code emitted by this primitive  is
              complex and cannot be optimized by the BPF optimizer code, so this
              can be somewhat slow.

       ip protochain protocol
              Equivalent to ip6 protochain protocol, but this is for IPv4.

       ether broadcast
              True if the packet is an Ethernet  broadcast  packet.   The  ether
              keyword is optional.

       ip broadcast
              True  if  the  packet  is an IPv4 broadcast packet.  It checks for
              both the all-zeroes and all-ones broadcast conventions, and  looks
              up  the subnet mask on the interface on which the capture is being
              done.

              If the subnet mask of the interface on which the capture is  being
              done  is not available, either because the interface on which cap&#8208;
              ture is being done has no netmask or because the capture is  being
              done  on the Linux &quot;any&quot; interface, which can capture on more than
              one interface, this check will not work correctly.

       ether multicast
              True if the packet is an Ethernet  multicast  packet.   The  ether
              keyword is optional.  This is shorthand for `ether[0] &amp; 1 != 0&apos;.

       ip multicast
              True if the packet is an IPv4 multicast packet.

       ip6 multicast
              True if the packet is an IPv6 multicast packet.

       ether proto protocol
              True  if  the packet is of ether type protocol.  Protocol can be a
              number or one of the names ip, ip6, arp, rarp, atalk,  aarp,  dec&#8208;
              net,  sca,  lat,  mopdl,  moprc,  iso, stp, ipx, or netbeui.  Note
              these identifiers are also keywords and must be escaped via  back&#8208;
              slash (\).

              [In  the  case  of  FDDI  (e.g.,  `fddi protocol arp&apos;), Token Ring
              (e.g., `tr protocol arp&apos;), and IEEE 802.11  wireless  LANS  (e.g.,
              `wlan  protocol  arp&apos;),  for most of those protocols, the protocol
              identification comes from the 802.2  Logical  Link  Control  (LLC)
              header,  which  is usually layered on top of the FDDI, Token Ring,
              or 802.11 header.

              When filtering for most protocol identifiers on FDDI, Token  Ring,
              or  802.11, the filter checks only the protocol ID field of an LLC
              header in so-called SNAP format with an Organizational Unit  Iden&#8208;
              tifier  (OUI)  of  0x000000, for encapsulated Ethernet; it doesn&apos;t
              check whether the  packet  is  in  SNAP  format  with  an  OUI  of
              0x000000.  The exceptions are:

              iso    the  filter  checks  the  DSAP  (Destination Service Access
                     Point) and SSAP (Source Service Access Point) fields of the
                     LLC header;

              stp and netbeui
                     the filter checks the DSAP of the LLC header;
&#12;              atalk  the  filter  checks for a SNAP-format packet with an OUI of
                     0x080007 and the AppleTalk etype.

              In the case of Ethernet, the filter checks the Ethernet type field
              for most of those protocols.  The exceptions are:

              iso, stp, and netbeui
                     the  filter  checks  for an 802.3 frame and then checks the
                     LLC header as it does for FDDI, Token Ring, and 802.11;

              atalk  the filter checks both for the AppleTalk etype in an Ether&#8208;
                     net frame and for a SNAP-format packet as it does for FDDI,
                     Token Ring, and 802.11;

              aarp   the filter checks for the AppleTalk ARP etype in either  an
                     Ethernet  frame  or  an  802.2  SNAP  frame  with an OUI of
                     0x000000;

              ipx    the filter checks for the IPX etype in an  Ethernet  frame,
                     the  IPX  DSAP  in  the  LLC header, the 802.3-with-no-LLC-
                     header encapsulation of IPX, and the IPX etype  in  a  SNAP
                     frame.

       decnet src host
              True if the DECNET source address is host, which may be an address
              of the form ``10.123&apos;&apos;, or a DECNET host name.  [DECNET host  name
              support is only available on ULTRIX systems that are configured to
              run DECNET.]

       decnet dst host
              True if the DECNET destination address is host.

       decnet host host
              True if either the DECNET source or destination address is host.

       ifname interface
              True if the packet was logged as coming from the specified  inter&#8208;
              face  (applies  only  to  packets logged by OpenBSD&apos;s or FreeBSD&apos;s
              pf(4)).

       on interface
              Synonymous with the ifname modifier.

       rnr num
              True if the packet was logged as matching the  specified  PF  rule
              number  (applies  only to packets logged by OpenBSD&apos;s or FreeBSD&apos;s
              pf(4)).

       rulenum num
              Synonymous with the rnr modifier.

       reason code
              True if the packet was logged with the specified PF  reason  code.
              The  known  codes are: match, bad-offset, fragment, short, normal&#8208;
              ize, and memory (applies only to packets logged  by  OpenBSD&apos;s  or
              FreeBSD&apos;s pf(4)).

       rset name
              True if the packet was logged as matching the specified PF ruleset
              name of an anchored ruleset (applies only  to  packets  logged  by
              OpenBSD&apos;s or FreeBSD&apos;s pf(4)).

       ruleset name
              Synonomous with the rset modifier.

       srnr num
              True  if  the  packet was logged as matching the specified PF rule
              number of an anchored ruleset (applies only to packets  logged  by
              OpenBSD&apos;s or FreeBSD&apos;s pf(4)).

       subrulenum num
              Synonomous with the srnr modifier.

       action act
              True  if  PF took the specified action when the packet was logged.
              Known actions are: pass and block  and,  with  later  versions  of
              pf(4)),  nat, rdr, binat and scrub (applies only to packets logged
              by OpenBSD&apos;s or FreeBSD&apos;s pf(4)).

       wlan ra ehost
              True if the IEEE 802.11 RA is ehost.  The RA field is used in  all
              frames except for management frames.

       wlan ta ehost
              True  if the IEEE 802.11 TA is ehost.  The TA field is used in all
              frames except for management frames and CTS (Clear  To  Send)  and
              ACK (Acknowledgment) control frames.

       wlan addr1 ehost
              True if the first IEEE 802.11 address is ehost.

       wlan addr2 ehost
              True if the second IEEE 802.11 address, if present, is ehost.  The
              second address field is used in all frames except for  CTS  (Clear
              To Send) and ACK (Acknowledgment) control frames.

       wlan addr3 ehost
              True  if the third IEEE 802.11 address, if present, is ehost.  The
              third address field is used in management and data frames, but not
              in control frames.

       wlan addr4 ehost
              True if the fourth IEEE 802.11 address, if present, is ehost.  The
              fourth address field is only used for WDS  (Wireless  Distribution
              System) frames.

       ip, ip6, arp, rarp, atalk, aarp, decnet, iso, stp, ipx, netbeui
              Abbreviations for:
                   ether proto p
              where p is one of the above protocols.

       lat, moprc, mopdl
              Abbreviations for:
                   ether proto p
              where p is one of the above protocols.  Note that not all applica&#8208;
              tions using pcap(3) currently know how to parse these protocols.

       type wlan_type
              True  if  the  IEEE  802.11  frame  type  matches  the   specified
              wlan_type.  Valid wlan_types are: mgt, ctl and data.

       type wlan_type subtype wlan_subtype
              True if the IEEE 802.11 frame type matches the specified wlan_type
              and frame subtype matches the specified wlan_subtype.

              If the specified wlan_type is mgt, then valid  wlan_subtypes  are:
              assoc-req,   assoc-resp,   reassoc-req,  reassoc-resp,  probe-req,
              probe-resp, beacon, atim, disassoc, auth and deauth.

              If the specified wlan_type is ctl, then valid  wlan_subtypes  are:
              ps-poll, rts, cts, ack, cf-end and cf-end-ack.

              If  the specified wlan_type is data, then valid wlan_subtypes are:
              data, data-cf-ack, data-cf-poll, data-cf-ack-poll,  null,  cf-ack,
              cf-poll, cf-ack-poll, qos-data, qos-data-cf-ack, qos-data-cf-poll,
              qos-data-cf-ack-poll, qos, qos-cf-poll and qos-cf-ack-poll.

       subtype wlan_subtype
              True if the  IEEE  802.11  frame  subtype  matches  the  specified
              wlan_subtype  and  frame  has  the  type  to  which  the specified
              wlan_subtype belongs.

       dir dir
              True if the IEEE 802.11 frame direction matches the specified dir.
              Valid  directions  are:  nods,  tods, fromds, dstods, or a numeric
              value.

       vlan [vlan_id]
              True if the packet is an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN packet.  If [vlan_id] is
              specified,  only  true  if  the  packet has the specified vlan_id.
              Note that the first vlan keyword encountered in expression changes
              the  decoding  offsets  for  the  remainder  of  expression on the
              assumption that the packet is a VLAN packet.  The  vlan  [vlan_id]
              expression  may  be used more than once, to filter on VLAN hierar&#8208;
              chies.  Each use of that expression increments the filter  offsets
              by 4.

              For example:
                   vlan 100 &amp;&amp; vlan 200
              filters on VLAN 200 encapsulated within VLAN 100, and
                   vlan &amp;&amp; vlan 300 &amp;&amp; ip
              filters  IPv4  protocols  encapsulated  in  VLAN  300 encapsulated
              within any higher order VLAN.

       mpls [label_num]
              True if the packet is an MPLS packet.  If  [label_num]  is  speci&#8208;
              fied,  only  true is the packet has the specified label_num.  Note
              that the first mpls keyword encountered in expression changes  the
              decoding offsets for the remainder of expression on the assumption
              that the packet  is  a  MPLS-encapsulated  IP  packet.   The  mpls
              [label_num]  expression  may  be used more than once, to filter on
              MPLS hierarchies.  Each use of that expression increments the fil&#8208;
              ter offsets by 4.

              For example:
                   mpls 100000 &amp;&amp; mpls 1024
              filters  packets  with an outer label of 100000 and an inner label
              of 1024, and
                   mpls &amp;&amp; mpls 1024 &amp;&amp; host 192.9.200.1
              filters packets to or from 192.9.200.1 with an inner label of 1024
              and any outer label.

       pppoed True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet Discovery packet (Ether&#8208;
              net type 0x8863).

       pppoes True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet Session packet (Ethernet
              type  0x8864).   Note that the first pppoes keyword encountered in
              expression changes the  decoding  offsets  for  the  remainder  of
              expression  on  the  assumption that the packet is a PPPoE session
              packet.

              For example:
                   pppoes &amp;&amp; ip
              filters IPv4 protocols encapsulated in PPPoE.

       tcp, udp, icmp
              Abbreviations for:
                   ip proto p or ip6 proto p
              where p is one of the above protocols.

       iso proto protocol
              True if the packet is an OSI packet  of  protocol  type  protocol.
              Protocol can be a number or one of the names clnp, esis, or isis.

       clnp, esis, isis
              Abbreviations for:
                   iso proto p
              where p is one of the above protocols.

       l1, l2, iih, lsp, snp, csnp, psnp
              Abbreviations for IS-IS PDU types.
&#12;       vpi n  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, with a
              virtual path identifier of n.

       vci n  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, with a
              virtual channel identifier of n.

       lane   True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              an ATM LANE packet.  Note that the first lane keyword  encountered
              in  expression  changes the tests done in the remainder of expres&#8208;
              sion on the assumption that the packet is either a  LANE  emulated
              Ethernet packet or a LANE LE Control packet.  If lane isn&apos;t speci&#8208;
              fied, the tests are done under the assumption that the  packet  is
              an LLC-encapsulated packet.

       llc    True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              an LLC-encapsulated packet.

              an end-to-end OAM F4 flow cell (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=4).

       oamf4  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              a  segment  or  end-to-end  OAM  F4  flow  cell  (VPI=0 &amp; (VCI=3 |
              VCI=4)).

       oam    True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              a  segment  or  end-to-end  OAM  F4  flow  cell  (VPI=0 &amp; (VCI=3 |
              VCI=4)).

       metac  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              on a meta signaling circuit (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=1).

       bcc    True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              on a broadcast signaling circuit (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=2).

       sc     True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              on a signaling circuit (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=5).

              on an ILMI circuit (VPI=0 &amp; VCI=16).

       connectmsg
              True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              on  a  signaling  circuit  and is a Q.2931 Setup, Call Proceeding,
              Connect, Connect Ack, Release, or Release Done message.

       metaconnect
              True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, and is
              on  a  meta signaling circuit and is a Q.2931 Setup, Call Proceed&#8208;
              ing, Connect, Release, or Release Done message.

       expr relop expr
              True if the relation holds, where relop is one of &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, =,
              !=,  and expr is an arithmetic expression composed of integer con&#8208;
              stants (expressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary  opera&#8208;
              tors  [+,  -,  *, /, &amp;, |, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;], a length operator, and special
              packet data accessors.  Note that all comparisons are unsigned, so
              that,  for  example, 0x80000000 and 0xffffffff are &gt; 0.  To access
              data inside the packet, use the following syntax:
                   proto [ expr : size ]
              Proto is one of ether, fddi, tr, wlan, ppp, slip, link,  ip,  arp,
              rarp,  tcp,  udp,  icmp,  ip6 or radio, and indicates the protocol
              layer for the index operation.  (ether, fddi, wlan, tr, ppp,  slip
              and  link  all refer to the link layer. radio refers to the &quot;radio
              header&quot; added to some 802.11 captures.)  Note that  tcp,  udp  and
              other  upper-layer  protocol  types  only  apply to IPv4, not IPv6
              (this will be fixed in the future).  The byte offset, relative  to
              the  indicated protocol layer, is given by expr.  Size is optional
              and indicates the number of bytes in the field of interest; it can
              be  either  one,  two,  or  four, and defaults to one.  The length
              operator, indicated by the keyword len, gives the  length  of  the
              packet.

              For  example,  `ether[0]  &amp; 1 != 0&apos; catches all multicast traffic.
              The expression `ip[0] &amp; 0xf != 5&apos; catches all  IPv4  packets  with
              options.   The  expression  `ip[6:2]  &amp;  0x1fff  = 0&apos; catches only
              unfragmented IPv4 datagrams and frag zero of fragmented IPv4 data&#8208;
              grams.   This check is implicitly applied to the tcp and udp index
              operations.  For instance, tcp[0] always means the first  byte  of
              the  TCP  header, and never means the first byte of an intervening
              fragment.

              Some offsets and field values may be  expressed  as  names  rather
              than  as numeric values.  The following protocol header field off&#8208;
              sets are available: icmptype (ICMP  type  field),  icmpcode  (ICMP
              code field), and tcpflags (TCP flags field).

              The  following  ICMP type field values are available: icmp-echore&#8208;
              ply, icmp-unreach,  icmp-sourcequench,  icmp-redirect,  icmp-echo,
              icmp-routeradvert,  icmp-routersolicit, icmp-timxceed, icmp-param&#8208;
              prob, icmp-tstamp,  icmp-tstampreply,  icmp-ireq,  icmp-ireqreply,
              icmp-maskreq, icmp-maskreply.

              The  following TCP flags field values are available: tcp-fin, tcp-
              syn, tcp-rst, tcp-push, tcp-ack, tcp-urg.

       Primitives may be combined using:

              A parenthesized group of primitives and operators (parentheses are
              special to the Shell and must be escaped).

              Negation (`!&apos; or `not&apos;).

              Concatenation (`&amp;&amp;&apos; or `and&apos;).

              Alternation (`||&apos; or `or&apos;).

       Negation  has  highest  precedence.   Alternation  and concatenation have
       equal precedence and associate left to right.   Note  that  explicit  and
       tokens, not juxtaposition, are now required for concatenation.

       If  an  identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent keyword is
       assumed.  For example,
            not host vs and ace
       is short for
            not host vs and host ace
       which should not be confused with
            not ( host vs or ace )

EXAMPLES
       To select all packets arriving at or departing from sundown:
              host sundown

       To select traffic between helios and either hot or ace:
              host helios and \( hot or ace \)

       To select all IP packets between ace and any host except helios:
              ip host ace and not helios

       To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at Berkeley:
              net ucb-ether

       To select all ftp traffic through internet gateway snup:
              gateway snup and (port ftp or ftp-data)

       To select traffic neither sourced from nor destined for local  hosts  (if
       you  gateway  to one other net, this stuff should never make it onto your
       local net).
              ip and not net localnet

       To select the start and end packets (the SYN and FIN packets) of each TCP
       conversation that involves a non-local host.
              tcp[tcpflags] &amp; (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net localnet

       To  select  all  IPv4  HTTP  packets to and from port 80, i.e. print only
       packets that contain data, not, for example, SYN and FIN packets and ACK-
       only packets.  (IPv6 is left as an exercise for the reader.)
              tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&amp;0xf)&lt;&lt;2)) - ((tcp[12]&amp;0xf0)&gt;&gt;2)) != 0)

       To select IP packets longer than 576 bytes sent through gateway snup:
              gateway snup and ip[2:2] &gt; 576

       To select IP broadcast or multicast packets that were not sent via Ether&#8208;
       net broadcast or multicast:
              ether[0] &amp; 1 = 0 and ip[16] &gt;= 224

       To select all ICMP packets that are not echo requests/replies (i.e.,  not
       ping packets):
              icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echo and icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echoreply

       Filter expressions on fields other than those in Token Ring headers  will
       not correctly handle source-routed Token Ring packets.

       Filter  expressions on fields other than those in 802.11 headers will not
       correctly handle 802.11 data packets with both To DS and From DS set.

       ip6 proto should chase header chain, but at this moment it does not.  ip6
       protochain is supplied for this behavior.

       Arithmetic  expression against transport layer headers, like tcp[0], does
       not work against IPv6 packets.  It only looks at IPv4 packets.
