NAME
       pcilib - a library for accessing PCI devices


DESCRIPTION
       The  PCI  library (also known as pcilib and libpci) is a portable library
       for accessing PCI devices and their configuration space.


ACCESS METHODS
       The library supports a variety of methods  to  access  the  configuration
       space  on  different  operating  systems.  By default, the first matching
       method in this list is used, but you can specify  override  the  decision
       (see the -A switch of lspci).


       linux-sysfs
              The /sys filesystem on Linux 2.6 and newer. The standard header of
              the config space is available to all users, the rest only to root.
              Supports  extended  configuration  space,  PCI  domains, VPD (from
              Linux 2.6.26), physical slots (also since Linux 2.6.26) and infor&#8208;
              mation on attached kernel drivers.

       linux-proc
              The  /proc/bus/pci interface supported by Linux 2.1 and newer. The
              standard header of the config space is available to all users, the
              rest only to root.

       intel-conf1
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. Avail&#8208;
              able on i386 and compatibles on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Win&#8208;
              dows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges.

       intel-conf2
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. Avail&#8208;
              able on i386 and compatibles on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Win&#8208;
              dows,  BeOS  and  Haiku.  Requires  root privileges. Warning: This
              method is able to address only the first 16 devices on any bus and
              it seems to be very unreliable in many cases.

       fbsd-device
              The /dev/pci device on FreeBSD. Requires root privileges.

       aix-device
              Access method used on AIX. Requires root privileges.

       nbsd-libpci
              The  /dev/pci0  device  on  NetBSD accessed using the local libpci
              library.

       obsd-device
              The /dev/pci device on OpenBSD. Requires root privileges.

       dump   Read the contents of configuration registers from a file specified
              in  the  dump.name parameter. The format corresponds to the output
              of lspci -x.


PARAMETERS
       The library is controlled by several parameters. They should have  sensi&#8208;
       ble default values, but in case you want to do something unusual (or even
       something weird), you can override them (see the -O switch of lspci).


   Parameters of specific access methods
       dump.name
              Name of the bus dump file to read from.

       fbsd.path
              Path to the FreeBSD PCI device.

       nbsd.path
              Path to the NetBSD PCI device.

       obsd.path
              Path to the OpenBSD PCI device.

       proc.path
              Path to the procfs bus tree.

       sysfs.path
              Path to the sysfs device tree.


   Parameters for resolving of ID&apos;s via DNS
       net.domain
              DNS domain containing the ID database.

       net.cache_name
              Name of the file used for caching of resolved ID&apos;s.
