NAME
       pcimodules  -  List  kernel  driver  modules  available for all currently
       plugged in PCI devices

SYNOPSIS
       pcimodules [--classclass_id] [--classmaskmask] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       pcimodules lists all driver modules for  all  currently  plugged  in  PCI
       devices.   pcimodules  should  be  run  at  boot time, and whenever a PCI
       device is &quot;hot plugged&quot; into the system.  This can be done by the follow&#8208;
       ing Bourne shell syntax:

                   for module in $(pcimodules) ; do

                        modprobe -s -k &quot;$module&quot;

                   done

       When  a  PCI  device  is  removed  from the system, the Linux kernel will
       decrement a usage count on PCI driver module.  If  this  count  drops  to
       zero  (i.e., there are no PCI drivers), then the modprobe -r process that
       is normally configured to run from cron every few minutes will eventually
       remove the unneeded module.

       The  --class and --classmask arguments can be used to limit the search to
       certain classes of PCI devices.  This is useful, for example, to generate
       a  list  of  ethernet card drivers to be loaded when the kernel has indi&#8208;
       cated that it is trying to resolve an unknown network interface.

       Modules are listed in the order in which the PCI devices  are  physically
       arranged  so  that the computer owner can arrange things like having scsi
       device 0 be on a controller that is not  alphabetically  the  first  scsi
       controller.

OPTIONS
       --class class --classmask mask

       --class  and  --classmask  limit  the  search  to PCI cards in particular
       classes.  These arguments are always used  together.   The  arguments  to
       --class  and --classmask can be given as hexadecimal numbers by prefixing
       a leading &quot;0x&quot;.  Note that the classes used by pcimodules are in  &quot;Linux&quot;
       format,  meaning the class value that you see with lspci would be shifted
       left eight bits, with the new low eight bits  programming  interface  ID.
       An examples of how to use class and classmask is provided below.  --help,
       -h Print a help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       pcimodules
              lists all  modules  corresponding  to  currently  plugged  in  PCI
              devices.

       pcimodules --class 0x20000 --classmask 0xffff00
              lists  all  modules corresponding to currently plugged in ethernet
              PCI devices.

FILES
       /lib/modules/&lt;kernel-version&gt;/modules.pcimap
              This file is automatically generated by depmod, and used  by  pci&#8208;
              modules to determine which modules correspond to which PCI ID&apos;s.

       /proc/bus/pci
              An  interface  to  PCI  bus  configuration  space  provided by the
              post-2.1.82 Linux kernels. Contains  per-bus  subdirectories  with
              per-card  config  space files and a devices file containing a list
              of all PCI devices.
