PCRE-CONFIG(1)                                                    PCRE-CONFIG(1)



NAME
       pcre-config - program to return PCRE configuration

SYNOPSIS
       pcre-config  [--prefix]  [--exec-prefix]  [--version]  [--libs]  [--libs-
       posix] [--cflags] [--cflags-posix]


DESCRIPTION
       pcre-config returns the configuration of the  installed  PCRE  libraries:
       the options required to compile a program to use them.


OPTIONS
       --prefix  Writes  the  directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture independent files (e.g. /usr) to standard output.

       --exec-prefix
                 Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE  installation  for
                 architecture dependent files (normally the same as --prefix) to
                 standard output.

       --version Writes the version of PCRE installed to standard output.

       --libs    Writes to standard output the command line options required  to
                 link with PCRE (e.g. -lpcre).

       --libs-posix
                 Writes  to standard output the command line options required to
                 link with the PCRE POSIX emulation  library  (e.g.  -lpcreposix
                 -lpcre).

       --cflags  Writes  to standard output the command line options required to
                 compile files that  use  PCRE  (this  often  includes  some  -I
                 options, but is blank on debian systems).

       --cflags-posix
                 Writes  to standard output the command line options required to
                 compile files that use the PCRE POSIX emulation  library  (this
                 often  includes  some  -I  options, but is blank on debian sys&#8208;
                 tems). Suppress printing of filenames when  searching  multiple
                 files.
