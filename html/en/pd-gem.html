NAME
       pd-gem - Graphical Environment for Multimedia - Pure Data external

DESCRIPTION
       Gem  (Graphics  Environment  for Multimedia) is a library to be used with
       Miller Puckette&apos;s Max-like  realtime-computermusic-software  &quot;Pure  Data&quot;
       (Pd),  which  allows  one  to draw and control openGL- and pixel-graphics
       (like video) in realtime from within pd.

       This script starts Pd with Gem enabled. All arguments passed to it,  will
       be forwarded to Pd.  To get a list of allowable arguments to Pd (pd-gem),
       type

              pd-gem -help

       and for more documentation either start pd-gem and get help, or consult
