NAME
       pd-gui - User Interface for Pure Data

SYNOPSIS
       pd-gui

       pd-gui server:port

DESCRIPTION
       Pure  Data (Pd) is a raphical programming environment for real-time audio
       synthesis and related applications.

       This is the graphical user interface for Pd, that  communicates  with  Pd
       via  a  network  socket.  Normally, Pd will automatically start this user
       interface for you.  However, if you want to run Pd and pd-gui on  differ&#8208;
       ent machines, you will have to launch the GUI manually.

       If  you  specify server:port, pd-gui will try to connect to Pd running on
       the remote server and listening on port.

       If you do not specify anything, pd-gui will simply launch Pd for you.
