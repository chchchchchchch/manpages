NAME
       pdb2mdb - Program Database to Mono Debugging Symbol converter.

SYNOPSIS
       pdb2mdb pdb_file

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool  is used to convert debugging symbols generated by Microsoft&apos;s
       compilers into debugging symbols that can be consumed by Mono&apos;s runtime.

       Program Database files are files that end with the extension .pdb and are
       associated with a library or executable (a .dll or .exe file).  This for&#8208;
       mat was until recently not documented so Mono used its  own  file  format
       for storing debugging information, the Mono debugging format.

       Just  like  PDB  files Mono Debugging information is stored in files that
       reside side-by-side with a program executable or a library.

       You can use the pdb2mdb tool to transform these PDB files into MDB  files
       that  Mono  can  then  consume  to  debug programs or provide line-number
       information for stack traces or exceptions.

LICENSE
       The pdb2mdb tool is  released under the terms  of  the  Microsoft  Public
       License (MS-PL).  JB Evain wrote the tool.   The PDB reading support came
       from Microsoft Common Compiler Infrastructure.
