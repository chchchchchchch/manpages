NAME
       pdf180 - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdf180 [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf180  rotates  the pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format
       (PDF) through 180 degrees.

       If no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin.  If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source  files  are processed sequentially into a single output unless the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdf180 operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the  &apos;--batch&apos;
       option  or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory) the resulting
       files have the suffix &apos;-rotated180&apos; applied to their  names  by  default.
       To change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdf180 --suffix &apos;upturned&apos; --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will     result     in    files    named    &apos;myfile1-upturned.pdf&apos;    and
       &apos;myfile2-upturned.pdf&apos;.

       pdf180 is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which is a front end  to  many  of
       the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working instal&#8208;
       lation of pdflatex with the pdfpages package is required.

       pdf180 is part of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools,  whose  homepage  is  at
       http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
