PDF2DSC(1)                      Ghostscript Tools                     PDF2DSC(1)



NAME
       pdf2dsc - generate a PostScript page list of a PDF document

SYNOPSIS
       pdf2dsc input.pdf [ output.dsc ]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf2dsc  uses gs(1) to read an Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) docu&#8208;
       ment &quot;input.pdf&quot; and create a PostScript(tm) document  &quot;output.dsc&quot;  that
       conforms to Adobe&apos;s Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) requirements.

       This  new  document  simply tells Ghostscript to read the PDF file and to
       display pages one at a time.  The generated document can then  be  viewed
       with  any  PostScript  viewer  based on Ghostscript, like ghostview(1) on
       Unix or GSview on Windows, with which the user  can  browse  through  the
       pages of the PDF document in any order.

       If  no  output  file is named on the command line, the name of the output
       file is that of the input file with any extension  removed,  followed  by
       the extension &quot;.dsc&quot;.

CAVEATS
       The  DSC document uses Ghostscript-specific procedures.  In addition, the
       original PDF document must be accessible when the DSC  document  is  pro&#8208;
       cessed.

       You need the file &quot;pdf2dsc.ps&quot; (originally by Russell Lang) supplied with
       Ghostscript since release 3.53.

SEE ALSO
       gs(1), ghostview(1)
