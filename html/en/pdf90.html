NAME
       pdf90 - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdf90 [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf90  rotates  the  pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format
       (PDF) through 90 degrees (anti-clockwise).

       If no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin.  If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source  files  are processed sequentially into a single output unless the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdf90 operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with  the  &apos;--batch&apos;
       option  or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory) the resulting
       files have the suffix &apos;rotated90&apos; applied to their names by default.   To
       change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdf90 --suffix &apos;-turned&apos; --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named &apos;myfile1-turned.pdf&apos; and &apos;myfile2-turned.pdf&apos;.

       pdf90 is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which is a front end to many of the
       capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A  working  installa&#8208;
       tion of pdflatex with the pdfpages package is required.

       pdf90  is  part  of  the  &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose homepage is at
       http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
