NAME
       pdfbook - put the pages of PDF files into 2-up signatures

SYNOPSIS
       pdfbook  [--short-edge] [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGE&#8208;
       SPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfbook makes 2-up versions of PDF files, with the pages ordered as  sig&#8208;
       natures.  The default signature size is 4: to change this, use the option
       &apos;--signature N&apos;, where N is a multiple of 4 (alternatively use  &apos;--signa&#8208;
       ture* N&apos; for right-edge binding).

       The  default is to make pages suitable for long-edge binding.  For short-
       edge binding, use &apos;--short-edge&apos; as the first argument;  this  will  only
       work if the LaTeX package &apos;everyshi&apos; is installed.

       The  default  output  page orientation is landscape.  To change this, use
       the &apos;--no-landscape&apos; option.

       By default, the option &apos;--booklet true&apos; is used (see the pdfpages  manual
       for details).  To turn this off, just specify &apos;--booklet false&apos;.

       If  no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output  unless  the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdfbook  is  a  simple  wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to
       many of the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working
       installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfbook operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the &apos;--batch&apos;
       option or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory) the  resulting
       files  have  the  suffix  &apos;-book&apos;  applied to their names by default.  To
       change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdfbook --suffix &apos;sig4&apos; --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named &apos;myfile1-sig4.pdf&apos; and &apos;myfile2-sig4.pdf&apos;.

       pdfbook is part of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose  homepage  is  at
       http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam.
