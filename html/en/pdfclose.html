PDFOPEN(1)                                                            PDFOPEN(1)



NAME
       pdfopen, pdfclose - open or close a PDF file viewer

SYNOPSIS
       pdfopen [OPTION] FILE.PDF
       pdfclose FILE.PDF

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               output help and exit

       -v, --version
               output the version number and exit

       -r, --reset_focus
               after  sending  commands  to the PDF viewer, attempt to reset the
               input focus to the window which had  focus  before  the  commands
               were sent

       -viewer &lt;ar9|ar9-tab|ar8|ar7|ar5|xpdf|evince&gt;  use  (respectively)  Adobe
               Reader 9 (in a new window), Adobe Reader 9 (in a  new  tab  of  a
               running  AR9,  if  any),  Adobe  Reader  8, Adobe Reader 7, Adobe
               Reader 5, xpdf or evince as the PDF viewer program.  Adobe Reader
               9 (in a new window) is the default.

RATIONALE
       At  certain  points  of  TeX  document  preparation, many people repeat a
       &quot;edit-compile-view&quot; cycle.  Since PDF viewers  such  as  Adobe&apos;s  Acrobat
       Reader (&quot;acroread&quot;) do not automatically refresh the display when the PDF
       file changes, this cycle  can  be  more  cumbersome  than  desired.   The
       pdfopen program provides the ability to automate the reloading of the PDF
       document when it is changed.

       Note: there seems to be little need for pdfclose under  GNU/Linux,  since
       (unlike  the  situation  for  MS  windows) acroread does not lock the PDF
       file, which would prevent pdftex (or a DVI to PDF converter) from  creat&#8208;
       ing  a new version of the PDF output file.  However, pdfclose is provided
       in case someone finds it useful.

DESCRIPTION
       pdfopen searches for an instance of the specified (or default) PDF viewer
       displaying  the  specified  PDF file.  If there is already an instance of
       the given viewer displaying the given file, the viewer is  instructed  to
       reload  the  file.  If no such instance is found, pdfopen attempts to run
       the specified viewer on the specified document.

       The default viewer is &quot;acroread&quot;, which could start any one of  a  number
       of  versions  of  Acrobat  Reader, depending on what is installed on your
       system.  However, the commands to reload the current document  vary  from
       one version of acroread to another; consequently, if you are using a ver&#8208;
       sion of acroread other than AR9, you should explicitly specify the viewer
       program.

       Version 0.83 of pdfopen accepts the following viewer options:
       ar9, ar9-tab, ar8, ar7, ar5, xpdf, and evince.
       The  difference  between  ar9 and ar9-tab is significant when there is no
       instance of AR9 already displaying the requested document.  In this situ&#8208;
       ation,  while  ar9  will  request  acroread  to  create a new instance of
       acroread (and thus open a new window)  by  using  the  -openInNewInstance
       argument,  ar9-tab  starts  acroread  without  this argument; if there is
       already an instance of acroread running, a new tab will be opened  in  an
       existing window.

       pdfclose  searches  for one of the above PDF viewers displaying the given
       file and instructs the viewer to &quot;close&quot; the window.  In most cases,  the
       PDF viewer continues to run, possibly now displaying just a blank window.
       (This behaviour varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.)

PORTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY
       Users familiar with the Windows version of pdfopen might wonder about the
       lack  of  a  --page  &lt;pagenumber&gt;  option.   Unfortunately,  to  date  no
       GNU/Linux versions of acroread support this  feature.   Anyone  having  a
       friend at Adobe is encouraged to ask them to implement a &quot;-page &lt;pagenum&#8208;
       ber&gt;&quot; command line option for acroread.

       These programs have been tested on Slackware64 Version 13.37  and  a  few
       other  versions  /  distributions  of  GNU/Linux.  The code is reasonably
       generic and should work out of the box using most recent X11  implementa&#8208;
       tions.   (Reports  to the contrary are welcome, particularly if they come
       with robust fixes.)

       These programs are designed for X11-based systems.  If you  somehow  find
       compiled versions of these programs on a system using another window sys&#8208;
       tem, they are very unlikely to be of any use to you.

       Source and binaries of the programs can be  downloaded  from  CTAN://sup&#8208;
       port/xpdfopen/ (e.g., http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen).

CAVEATS
       If  you  use  ar9-tab  to  reload  the  PDF  document and the instance of
       acroread with the given document is currently displaying some other docu&#8208;
       ment, the command causes your document to be displayed, but not reloaded.

       pdfopen works by looking for a window with a name (window title) matching
       that expected for the given viewer and document.  If for some reason your
       viewer&apos;s window name is not as expected, pdfopen may not work for you.

       With  at  least AR9 and some window managers, using pdfopen to reload the
       document gives focus to the acroread window, even though the mouse cursor
       is   not  necessarily  in  that  window.   This  can  be  annoying.   The
       -reset_focus option can be used to deal with this problem.

AUTHOR
       This manual page was written by Jim Diamond &lt;Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca&gt;.   I
       am  the  current  maintainer of the X11 versions of pdfopen and pdfclose.
       Report any bugs you find to me.  Feature enhancement  requests  are  wel&#8208;
       come, coded enhancements even more so.

       Past  authors:  Fabrice Popineau wrote the MS-windows versions of pdfopen
       and pdfclose upon which these programs were originally based.  Taco Hoek&#8208;
       water  created the GNU/Linux versions, up to Version 0.61 (including some
       documentation which inspired parts of this man page).
