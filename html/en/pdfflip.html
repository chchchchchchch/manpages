NAME
       pdfflip - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfflip [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfflip  reflects  (left-right)  the pages of files in the Adobe Portable
       Document Format (PDF).

       If no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin.  If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source  files  are processed sequentially into a single output unless the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdfflip operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the &apos;--batch&apos;
       option  or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory) the resulting
       files have the suffix &apos;-flipped&apos; applied to their names by  default.   To
       change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdfflip --suffix &apos;reflected&apos; --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will     result    in    files    named    &apos;myfile1-reflected.pdf&apos;    and
       &apos;myfile2-reflected.pdf&apos;.

       pdfflip is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which is a front end to  many  of
       the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working instal&#8208;
       lation of pdflatex with the pdfpages package is required.

       pdfflip is part of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose  homepage  is  at
       http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
