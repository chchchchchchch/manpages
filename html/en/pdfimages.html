NAME
       pdfimages - Portable Document Format (PDF) image extractor (version 3.00)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfimages [options] PDF-file image-root

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfimages saves images from a Portable Document Format (PDF) file as Por&#8208;
       table Pixmap (PPM), Portable Bitmap (PBM), or JPEG files.

       Pdfimages reads the PDF file PDF-file,  scans  one  or  more  pages,  and
       writes  one  PPM,  PBM,  or JPEG file for each image, image-root-nnn.xxx,
       where nnn is the image number and xxx is  the  image  type  (.ppm,  .pbm,
       .jpg).

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to scan.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to scan.

       -j     Normally, all images are written as PBM (for monochrome images) or
              PPM (for non-monochrome images) files.  With this  option,  images
              in  DCT  format  are  saved as JPEG files.  All non-DCT images are
              saved in PBM/PPM format as usual.

       -opw password

              bypass all security restrictions.
