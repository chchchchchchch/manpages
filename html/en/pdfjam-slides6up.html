NAME
       pdfjam-slides6up - put presentation slides onto 6-up pages

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjam-slides6up  [--pagenumbering  SWITCH]  [OPTION  [OPTION]  ...] [SRC
       [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjam-slides6up converts PDF files whose pages are  presentation  slides
       (with  4:3 aspect ratio) into 6-up versions suitable for making a handout
       (for example).  By default, the 6-up pages do not  themselves  have  page
       numbers.

       To  put  page  numbers  on  the output pages, use either &apos;--pagenumbering
       true&apos; or, for example, &apos;--pagenumbering 3.0cm&apos; to place the page  numbers
       a bit lower on the page than the default position.  The value of &apos;SWITCH&apos;
       must be either &apos;true&apos;, &apos;false&apos; or a dimension that can be used by  LateX.
       (To  be  precise, it&apos;s the value of the &apos;footskip&apos; dimension in LaTeX; by
       default, pdfjam-slides6up sets that as 2.7cm, which works pretty well  in
       conjunction with both &apos;--paper a4paper&apos; and &apos;--paper letterpaper&apos;.)

       If  no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output  unless  the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdfjam-slides6up  is  a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front
       end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.   A
       working installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfjam-slides6up  operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory)  the
       resulting files have the suffix &apos;-6up&apos; applied to their names by default.
       To change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdfjam-slides6up  --suffix  &apos;2x3&apos;   --batch   myslides1.pdf   mys&#8208;
              lides2.pdf

       will result in files named &apos;myslides1-2x3.pdf&apos; and &apos;myslides2-2x3.pdf&apos;.

       By  default  a narrow line frame is printed around every slide.  This can
       be turned off if required by using the option &apos;--frame false&apos;.

       pdfjam-slides6up is part of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose homepage
       is at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam .
