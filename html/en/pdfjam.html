NAME
       pdfjam - A shell script for manipulating PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjam [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjam  provides a front end to most capabilities of the &quot;pdfpages&quot; pack&#8208;
       age (by Andreas Matthias) of pdflatex.  Detailed information can be found
       via &quot;pdfjam --help&quot;, and also in the web page mentioned below .

       A  working  installation  of  pdflatex,  with  the  pdfpages  package, is
       required.

       The pdfjam script is distributed as (the main) part of the  PDFjam  pack&#8208;
       age.  The homepage of PDFjam is at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

SETUP
       See http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

       For   further   information   and   some   examples   see  http://go.war&#8208;
       wick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

CONFIGURATION FILES
       Configuration of the PDFjam utilities involves specifying the location of
       pdflatex,  the location of temporary files, specification of default page
       size, etc.  This is done in a block of lines near the top of  the  pdfjam
       script;  settings  made  there are over-ridden by any that are found at a
       site-wide configuration file  (at  /etc/pdfjam.conf,  /usr/share/etc/pdf&#8208;
       jam.conf,  /usr/local/share/pdfjam.conf,  or /usr/local/etc/pdfjam.conf),
       which in turn are over-ridden by any that are found  in  a  user-defaults
       file at ~/.pdfjam.conf.

LIMITATIONS AND BUGS
       pdfjam  does  not  work  with  encrypted PDF files, and does not preserve
       hyperlinks.

       Please report bugs! See the website at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .
