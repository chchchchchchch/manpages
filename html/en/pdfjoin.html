NAME
       pdfjoin - join together pages from multiple PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjoin [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjoin concatenates the pages of multiple Portable Document Format (PDF)
       files together into a single file..

       If no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input (but just one  file  --
       not  very useful here!  is from /dev/stdin. If &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all
       pages are processed.

       Source files are  processed  sequentially  into  a  single  output.   The
       &apos;--batch&apos; option of pdfjam(1) cannot be used.

       pdfjoin  is  a  simple  wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to
       many of the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working
       installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfjoin  is  part  of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose homepage is at
       http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .
