NAME
       pdfnup - n-up the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfnup [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfnup  converts files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) to &quot;n-
       up&quot; PDF files, that is, with multiple input pages per  output  page,  for
       more  economical  printing  etc.  The default processing is to 2-up land&#8208;
       scape output with no frame around pages, equivalent to using the  options
       &apos;--nup 2x1 --landscape true --frame false&apos;.

       If  no source PDF file (&apos;SRC&apos;) is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If
       &apos;PAGESPEC&apos; is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output  unless  the
       &apos;--batch&apos; option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdfnup  operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the &apos;--batch&apos;
       option or with &apos;--outfile DIR&apos; where &apos;DIR&apos; is a directory) the  resulting
       files  have  the  suffix  &apos;-nup&apos;  applied  to their names by default.  To
       change the suffix, use the &apos;--suffix&apos; option, for example

              pdfnup --nup 2x2 --suffix &apos;2x2&apos; --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named &apos;myfile1-2x2.pdf&apos; and &apos;myfile2-2x2.pdf&apos;.

       pdfnup is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many
       of  the  capabilities  of  the  pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working
       installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages  and  geometry  packages,  is
       required.

       pdfnup  is  part  of  the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools, whose homepage is at
       http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam .
