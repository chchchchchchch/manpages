PDFOPT(1)                       Ghostscript Tools                      PDFOPT(1)



NAME
       pdfopt - Ghostscript PDF Optimizer

SYNOPSIS
       pdfopt [ options ] input.pdf output.pdf

DESCRIPTION
       pdfopt  uses  gs(1)  to  convert the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
       file &quot;input.pdf&quot; to a so-called optimized form  in  &quot;output.pdf&quot;.   Opti&#8208;
       mization  puts the elements of the file into a more linear order and adds
       &quot;hint&quot; pointers, allowing Adobe&apos;s Acrobat(TM) products to  display  indi&#8208;
       vidual  pages  of the file more quickly when accessing the file through a
       network.

       Note: input.pdf and output.pdf must not be the same.  If  they  are,  the
       file  will  probably  be  destroyed.  pdfopt currently does not check for
       this.

FILES
       Run &quot;gs -h&quot; to find the location of  Ghostscript  documentation  on  your
       system, from which you can get more details.
