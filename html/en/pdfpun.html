NAME
       pdfpun - n-up the pages of a pdf file, with right-to-left ordering

SYNOPSIS
       pdfpun SRC [PAGESPEC] --outfile FILENAME [OPTION [OPTION] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfpun  converts  a file in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) to a
       &quot;n-up&quot; PDF file, that is, with multiple input pages per output page,  for
       more economical printing etc.  The pages are ordered right-to-left in the
       output.  The default processing is to 2-up landscape output with no frame
       around  pages,  equivalent  to  using  the options &apos;--nup 2x1 --landscape
       --frame false&apos;.

       SRC must be a PDF file; &apos;/dev/stdin&apos; can be used  for  PDF  input  via  a
       pipeline.

       If  PAGESPEC  is  omitted,  all pages are processed (equivalent to &apos;-&apos; as
       PAGESPEC)

       OPTION is any option of pdfjam(1) other than --batch.

       pdfpun is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many
       of  the  capabilities  of  the  pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working
       installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfpun is part of the &quot;PDFjam&quot; package of tools,  whose  homepage  is  at
       http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam.
