DESCRIPTION
       If PDF is electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic staple-remover,
       hole-punch, binder, secret-decoder-ring, and X-Ray-glasses.  Pdftk is a
       simple tool for doing everyday things with PDF documents.  Use it to:

       * Merge PDF Documents or Collate PDF Page Scans
       * Split PDF Pages into a New Document
       * Rotate PDF Documents or Pages
       * Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
       * Encrypt Output as Desired
       * Fill PDF Forms with X/FDF Data and/or Flatten Forms
       * Generate FDF Data Stencils from PDF Forms
       * Apply a Background Watermark or a Foreground Stamp
       * Report PDF Metrics such as Metadata and Bookmarks
       * Update PDF Metadata
       * Attach Files to PDF Pages or the PDF Document
       * Unpack PDF Attachments
       * Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages
       * Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams
       * Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       --help, -h
              Show summary of options.

       &lt;input PDF files | - | PROMPT&gt;
              A list of the input PDF files. If you plan to combine these PDFs
              (without using handles) then list files in the order you want them
              combined.  Use - to pass a single PDF into pdftk via stdin.  Input
              files can be associated with handles, where a handle is a single,
              upper-case letter:
&#12;              &lt;input PDF handle&gt;=&lt;input PDF filename&gt;

              Handles are often omitted.  They are useful when specifying PDF
              passwords or page ranges, later.

              For example: A=input1.pdf B=input2.pdf

       [input_pw &lt;input PDF owner passwords | PROMPT&gt;]
              Input PDF owner passwords, if necessary, are associated with files
              by using their handles:

              &lt;input PDF handle&gt;=&lt;input PDF file owner password&gt;

              If handles are not given, then passwords are associated with input
              files by order.

              Most pdftk features require that encrypted input PDF are accompa&#8208;
              nied by the ~owner~ password. If the input PDF has no owner pass&#8208;
              word, then the user password must be given, instead.  If the input
              PDF has no passwords, then no password should be given.

              When running in do_ask mode, pdftk will prompt you for a password
              if the supplied password is incorrect or none was given.

       [&lt;operation&gt; &lt;operation arguments&gt;]
              If this optional argument is omitted, then pdftk runs in &apos;filter&apos;
              mode.  Filter mode takes only one PDF input and creates a new PDF
              after applying all of the output options, like encryption and com&#8208;
              pression.

              Available operations are: cat, shuffle, burst, generate_fdf,
              fill_form, background, multibackground, stamp, multistamp,
              dump_data, dump_data_utf8, dump_data_fields,
              dump_data_fields_utf8, update_info, update_info_utf8,
              attach_files, unpack_files. Some operations takes additional argu&#8208;
              ments, described below.

          cat [&lt;page ranges&gt;]
                 Catenates pages from input PDFs to create a new PDF.  Page
                 order in the new PDF is specified by the order of the given
                 page ranges.  Page ranges are described like this:

                 &lt;input PDF handle&gt;[&lt;begin page number&gt;[-&lt;end page num&#8208;
                 ber&gt;[&lt;qualifier&gt;]]][&lt;page rotation&gt;]

                 Where the handle identifies one of the input PDF files, and the
                 beginning and ending page numbers are one-based references to
                 pages in the PDF file, and the qualifier can be even or odd,
                 and the page rotation can be N, S, E, W, L, R, or D.

                 If the handle is omitted from the page range, then the pages
                 are taken from the first input PDF.

                 The even qualifier causes pdftk to use only the even-numbered
                 PDF pages, so 1-6even yields pages 2, 4 and 6 in that order.
                 6-1even yields pages 6, 4 and 2 in that order.

                 The odd qualifier works similarly to the even.

                 The page rotation setting can cause pdftk to rotate pages and
                 documents.  Each option sets the page rotation as follows (in
                 degrees): N: 0, E: 90, S: 180, W: 270, L: -90, R: +90, D: +180.
                 L, R, and D make relative adjustments to a page&apos;s rotation.

                 If no arguments are passed to cat, then pdftk combines all
                 input PDFs in the order they were given to create the output.

                 NOTES:
                 * &lt;end page number&gt; may be less than &lt;begin page number&gt;.
                 * The keyword end may be used to reference the final page of a
                 document instead of a page number.
                 * Reference a single page by omitting the ending page number.
                 * The handle may be used alone to represent the entire PDF doc&#8208;
                 ument, e.g., B1-end is the same as B.

                 Page Range Examples w/o Handles:
                 1-endE - rotate entire document 90 degrees
                 5 11 20 - take single pages from input PDF
                 5-25oddW - take odd pages in range, rotate 90 degrees
                 6-1 - reverse pages in range from input PDF

                 Page Range Examples Using Handles:
                 Say A=in1.pdf B=in2.pdf, then:
                 A1-21 - take range from in1.pdf
                 Bend-1odd - take all odd pages from in2.pdf in reverse order
                 A72 - take a single page from in1.pdf
                 A1-21 Beven A72 - assemble pages from both in1.pdf and in2.pdf
                 AW - rotate entire in1.pdf document 90 degrees
                 B - use all of in2.pdf
                 A2-30evenL - take the even pages from the range, remove 90
                 degrees from each page&apos;s rotation
                 A A - catenate in1.pdf with in1.pdf
                 AevenW AoddE - apply rotations to even pages, odd pages from
                 in1.pdf
                 AW BW BD - catenate rotated documents

          shuffle [&lt;page ranges&gt;]
                 Collates pages from input PDFs to create a new PDF.  Works like
                 the cat operation except that it takes one page at a time from
                 each page range to assemble the output PDF.  If one range runs
                 out of pages, it continues with the remaining ranges.  Ranges
                 can use all of the features described above for cat, like
                 reverse page ranges, multiple ranges from a single PDF, and
                 page rotation.  This feature was designed to help collate PDF
                 pages after scanning paper documents.

          burst  Splits a single, input PDF document into individual pages. Also
                 creates a report named doc_data.txt which is the same as the
                 output from dump_data.  If the output section is omitted, then
                 PDF pages are named: pg_%04d.pdf, e.g.: pg_0001.pdf,
                 pg_0002.pdf, etc.  To name these pages yourself, supply a
                 printf-styled format string via the output section.  For exam&#8208;
                 ple, if you want pages named: page_01.pdf, page_02.pdf, etc.,
                 pass output page_%02d.pdf to pdftk.  Encryption can be applied
                 to the output by appending output options such as owner_pw,
                 e.g.:

                 pdftk in.pdf burst owner_pw foopass

          generate_fdf
                 Reads a single, input PDF file and generates an FDF file suit&#8208;
                 able for fill_form out of it to the given output filename or
                 (if no output is given) to stdout.  Does not create a new PDF.

          fill_form &lt;FDF data filename | XFDF data filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Fills the single input PDF&apos;s form fields with the data from an
                 FDF file, XFDF file or stdin. Enter the data filename after
                 fill_form, or use - to pass the data via stdin, like so:

                 pdftk form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output form.filled.pdf

                 After filling a form, the form fields remain interactive unless
                 you also use the flatten output option. flatten merges the form
                 fields with the PDF pages. You can use flatten alone, too, but
                 only on a single PDF:

                 pdftk form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output out.pdf flatten

                 or:

                 pdftk form.filled.pdf output out.pdf flatten

                 If the input FDF file includes Rich Text formatted data in
                 addition to plain text, then the Rich Text data is packed into
                 the form fields as well as the plain text.  Pdftk also sets a
                 flag that cues Acrobat/Reader to generate new field appearances
                 based on the Rich Text data.  That way, when the user opens the
                 PDF, the viewer will create the Rich Text fields on the spot.
                 If the user&apos;s PDF viewer does not support Rich Text, then the
                 user will see the plain text data instead.  If you flatten this
                 form before Acrobat has a chance to create (and save) new field
                 appearances, then the plain text field data is what you&apos;ll see.

          background &lt;background PDF filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Applies a PDF watermark to the background of a single input
                 PDF.  Pass the background PDF&apos;s filename after background like
                 so:

                 pdftk in.pdf background back.pdf output out.pdf

                 Pdftk uses only the first page from the background PDF and
                 applies it to every page of the input PDF.  This page is scaled
                 and rotated as needed to fit the input page.  You can use - to
                 pass a background PDF into pdftk via stdin.

                 If the input PDF does not have a transparent background (such
                 as a PDF created from page scans) then the resulting background
                 won&apos;t be visible -- use the stamp operation instead.

          multibackground &lt;background PDF filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Same as the background operation, but applies each page of the
                 background PDF to the corresponding page of the input PDF.  If
                 the input PDF has more pages than the stamp PDF, then the final
                 stamp page is repeated across these remaining pages in the
                 input PDF.

          stamp &lt;stamp PDF filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 This behaves just like the background operation except it over&#8208;
                 lays the stamp PDF page on top of the input PDF document&apos;s
                 pages.  This works best if the stamp PDF page has a transparent
                 background.

          multistamp &lt;stamp PDF filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Same as the stamp operation, but applies each page of the back&#8208;
                 ground PDF to the corresponding page of the input PDF.  If the
                 input PDF has more pages than the stamp PDF, then the final
                 stamp page is repeated across these remaining pages in the
                 input PDF.

          dump_data
                 Reads a single, input PDF file and reports various statistics,
                 metadata, bookmarks (a/k/a outlines), and page labels to the
                 given output filename or (if no output is given) to stdout.
                 Non-ASCII characters are encoded as XML numerical entities.
                 Does not create a new PDF.

          dump_data_utf8
                 Same as dump_data excepct that the output is encoded as UTF-8.
&#12;          dump_data_fields
                 Reads a single, input PDF file and reports form field statis&#8208;
                 tics to the given output filename or (if no output is given) to
                 stdout. Non-ASCII characters are encoded as XML numerical enti&#8208;
                 ties. Does not create a new PDF.

          dump_data_fields_utf8
                 Same as dump_data_fields excepct that the output is encoded as
                 UTF-8.

          update_info &lt;info data filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Changes the metadata stored in a single PDF&apos;s Info dictionary
                 to match the input data file. The input data file uses the same
                 syntax as the output from dump_data. Non-ASCII characters
                 should be encoded as XML numerical entities. This does not
                 change the metadata stored in the PDF&apos;s XMP stream, if it has
                 one. For example:

                 pdftk in.pdf update_info in.info output out.pdf

          update_info_utf8 &lt;info data filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
                 Same as update_info except that the input is encoded as UTF-8.

          attach_files &lt;attachment filenames | PROMPT&gt; [to_page &lt;page number |
          PROMPT&gt;]
                 Packs arbitrary files into a PDF using PDF&apos;s file attachment
                 features. More than one attachment may be listed after
                 attach_files. Attachments are added at the document level
                 unless the optional to_page option is given, in which case the
                 files are attached to the given page number (the first page is
                 1, the final page is end). For example:

                 pdftk in.pdf attach_files table1.html table2.html to_page 6
                 output out.pdf

          unpack_files
                 Copies all of the attachments from the input PDF into the cur&#8208;
                 rent folder or to an output directory given after output. For
                 example:

                 pdftk report.pdf unpack_files output ~/atts/

                 or, interactively:

                 pdftk report.pdf unpack_files output PROMPT

       [output &lt;output filename | - | PROMPT&gt;]
              The output PDF filename may not be set to the name of an input
              filename. Use - to output to stdout.  When using the dump_data
              operation, use output to set the name of the output data file.
              When using the unpack_files operation, use output to set the name
              of an output directory.  When using the burst operation, you can
              use output to control the resulting PDF page filenames (described
              above).

       [encrypt_40bit | encrypt_128bit]
              If an output PDF user or owner password is given, output PDF
              encryption strength defaults to 128 bits.  This can be overridden
              by specifying encrypt_40bit.

       [allow &lt;permissions&gt;]
              Permissions are applied to the output PDF only if an encryption
              strength is specified or an owner or user password is given.  If
              permissions are not specified, they default to &apos;none,&apos; which means
              all of the following features are disabled.

              The permissions section may include one or more of the following
              features:

              Printing
                     Top Quality Printing

       [owner_pw &lt;owner password | PROMPT&gt;]

       [user_pw &lt;user password | PROMPT&gt;]
              If an encryption strength is given but no passwords are supplied,
              then the owner and user passwords remain empty, which means that
              the resulting PDF may be opened and its security parameters
              altered by anybody.

       [compress | uncompress]
              These are only useful when you want to edit PDF code in a text
              editor like vim or emacs.  Remove PDF page stream compression by
              applying the uncompress filter. Use the compress filter to restore
              compression.

       [flatten]
              Use this option to merge an input PDF&apos;s interactive form fields
              (and their data) with the PDF&apos;s pages. Only one input PDF may be
              given. Sometimes used with the fill_form operation.

       [keep_first_id | keep_final_id]
              When combining pages from multiple PDFs, use one of these options
              to copy the document ID from either the first or final input docu&#8208;
              ment into the new output PDF. Otherwise pdftk creates a new docu&#8208;
              ment ID for the output PDF. When no operation is given, pdftk
              always uses the ID from the (single) input PDF.

       [drop_xfa]
              If your input PDF is a form created using Acrobat 7 or Adobe
              Designer, then it probably has XFA data.  Filling such a form
              using pdftk yields a PDF with data that fails to display in Acro&#8208;
              bat 7 (and 6?).  The workaround solution is to remove the form&apos;s
              XFA data, either before you fill the form using pdftk or at the
              time you fill the form. Using this option causes pdftk to omit the
              XFA data from the output PDF form.

              This option is only useful when running pdftk on a single input
              PDF.  When assembling a PDF from multiple inputs using pdftk, any
              XFA data in the input is automatically omitted.

       [verbose]
              By default, pdftk runs quietly. Append verbose to the end and it
              will speak up.

       [dont_ask | do_ask]
              Depending on the compile-time settings (see ASK_ABOUT_WARNINGS),
              pdftk might prompt you for further input when it encounters a
              problem, such as a bad password. Override this default behavior by
              adding dont_ask (so pdftk won&apos;t ask you what to do) or do_ask (so
              pdftk will ask you what to do).

              When running in dont_ask mode, pdftk will over-write files with
              its output without notice.

EXAMPLES
       Collate scanned pages
         pdftk A=even.pdf B=odd.pdf shuffle A B output collated.pdf
         or if odd.pdf is in reverse order:
         pdftk A=even.pdf B=odd.pdf shuffle A Bend-1 output collated.pdf

       Decrypt a PDF
         pdftk secured.pdf input_pw foopass output unsecured.pdf

       Encrypt a PDF using 128-bit strength (the default), withhold all permis&#8208;
       sions (the default)
         pdftk 1.pdf output 1.128.pdf owner_pw foopass

       Same as above, except password &apos;baz&apos; must also be used to open output PDF
         pdftk 1.pdf output 1.128.pdf owner_pw foo user_pw baz

       Same as above, except printing is allowed (once the PDF is open)
         pdftk 1.pdf output 1.128.pdf owner_pw foo user_pw baz allow printing

       Join in1.pdf and in2.pdf into a new PDF, out1.pdf
         pdftk in1.pdf in2.pdf cat output out1.pdf
         or (using handles):
         pdftk A=in1.pdf B=in2.pdf cat A B output out1.pdf
         or (using wildcards):
         pdftk *.pdf cat output combined.pdf

       Remove &apos;page 13&apos; from in1.pdf to create out1.pdf
         pdftk in.pdf cat 1-12 14-end output out1.pdf
         or:
         pdftk A=in1.pdf cat A1-12 A14-end output out1.pdf

       Apply 40-bit encryption to output, revoking all permissions (the
       default). Set the owner PW to &apos;foopass&apos;.
         pdftk 1.pdf 2.pdf cat output 3.pdf encrypt_40bit owner_pw foopass

       Join two files, one of which requires the password &apos;foopass&apos;. The output
       is not encrypted.
         pdftk A=secured.pdf 2.pdf input_pw A=foopass cat output 3.pdf

       Uncompress PDF page streams for editing the PDF in a text editor (e.g.,
       vim, emacs)
         pdftk doc.pdf output doc.unc.pdf uncompress

       Repair a PDF&apos;s corrupted XREF table and stream lengths, if possible
         pdftk broken.pdf output fixed.pdf

       Burst a single PDF document into pages and dump its data to doc_data.txt
         pdftk in.pdf burst

       Burst a single PDF document into encrypted pages. Allow low-quality
       printing
         pdftk in.pdf burst owner_pw foopass allow DegradedPrinting

       Write a report on PDF document metadata and bookmarks to report.txt
         pdftk in.pdf dump_data output report.txt

       Rotate the first PDF page to 90 degrees clockwise
         pdftk in.pdf cat 1E 2-end output out.pdf
&#12;       Rotate an entire PDF document to 180 degrees
         pdftk in.pdf cat 1-endS output out.pdf
