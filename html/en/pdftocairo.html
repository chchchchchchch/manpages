NAME
       pdftocairo  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) to PNG/JPEG/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG
       using cairo

SYNOPSIS
       pdftocairo [options] PDF-file [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       pdftocairo converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files, using the cairo
       output  device of the poppler PDF library, to any of the following output
       formats:

       &#183;      Portable Network Graphics (PNG)

       &#183;      JPEG Interchange Format (JPEG)

       &#183;      Portable Document Format (PDF)

       &#183;      PostScript (PS)

       &#183;      Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

       &#183;      Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

       pdftocairo reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes to output-file.   The
       image  formats  (PNG  and  JPEG) generate one file per page with the page
       number and file type appended to output-file (except when -singlefile  is
       used).  When the output format is a vector format (PDF, PS, EPS, and SVG)
       or when -singlefile is used, output-file is the full filename.

       If the PDF-file is &#8220;-&#8221; , the PDF is read from stdin.  If the  output-file
       is  &#8220;-&#8221;  , the output file will be written to stdout. Using stdout is not
       valid with image formats unless -singlefile is used.  If  output-file  is
       not used, the output filename will be derived from the PDF-file filename.

       Not  all options are valid with all output formats. One (and only one) of
       the output format options (-png, -jpeg, -pdf, -ps, -eps, or -svg) must be
       used.

       The  resolution  options  (-r,  -rx, -ry) set the resolution of the image
       output formats. The image dimensions will depend on the PDF page size and
       the  resolution. For the vector outputs, regions of the page that can not
       be represented natively in the output format (eg translucency in PS) will
       be rasterized at the resolution specified by the resolution options.

       The  -scale-to  options  may be used to set a fixed image size. The image
       resolution will vary with the page size.

       The cropping options (-x, -y, -W, and -H) use units of  pixels  with  the
       image  formats and PostScript points (1/72 inch) with the vector formats.
       When cropping is used with vector output the cropped region  is  centered
       unless  -nocenter  is used in which case the cropped region is at the top
       left (SVG) or bottom left (PDF, PS, EPS).

OPTIONS
       -png   Generates a PNG file(s)

       -jpeg  Generates a JPEG file(s)

       -pdf   Generates a PDF file

       -ps    Generate a PS file
&#12;       -eps   Generate an EPS file. An EPS file contains a single image,  so  if
              you  use  this  option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f
              and -l to specify a single page.  The page size options  (-origpa&#8208;
              gesizes,  -paper,  -paperw,  -paperh)  can  not  be used with this
              option.

       -svg   Generate a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to convert.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to convert.

       -o     Generates only the odd numbered pages.

       -e     Generates only the even numbered pages.

       -singlefile
              Writes only the first page and does not add digits.

       -r number
              Specifies the X and Y resolution, in  pixels  per  inch  of  image
              files (or rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150
              PPI.

       -rx number
              Specifies the X resolution, in pixels per inch of image files  (or
              rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150 PPI.

       -ry number
              Specifies  the Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or
              rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150 PPI.

       -scale-to number
              Scales each page to fit in scale-to*scale-to pixel  box  (PNG/JPEG
              only).

       -scale-to-x number
              Scales   each  page  horizontally  to  fit  in  scale-to-x  pixels
              (PNG/JPEG only).

       -scale-to-y number
              Scales each page vertically to fit in scale-to-y pixels  (PNG/JPEG
              only).

       -x number
              Specifies  the  x-coordinate  of  the crop area top left corner in
              pixels (image output) or points (vector output)

       -y number
              Specifies the y-coordinate of the crop area  top  left  corner  in
              pixels (image output) or points (vector output)

       -W number
              Specifies  the  width  of  crop  area  in pixels (image output) or
              points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -H number
              Specifies the height of crop area  in  pixels  (image  output)  or
              points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -sz number
              Specifies  the  size  of  crop  square in pixels (image output) or
              points (vector output)  (sets -W and -H)

       -cropbox
              Uses the crop box rather than media box when generating the files
&#12;       -mono  Generate a monochrome file (PNG only).

       -gray  Generate a grayscale file (PNG and JPEG only).

       -transp
              Use a transparent page color instead of white (PNG only).

       -icc icc-file
              Use the specified ICC file as the output profile (PNG  only).  The
              profile will be embedded in the PNG file.

       -level2
              Generate Level 2 PostScript (PS only).

       -level3
              Generate  Level  3  PostScript (PS only). This enables all Level 2
              features plus shading patterns and  masked  images.  This  is  the
              default setting.

       -origpagesizes
              Generate  a file with variable page sizes and orientations (PS and
              PDF only). The size of each page will be the original page in  the
              PDF  file.   If the output is PS the file will contain %%Document&#8208;
              Media and %%PageMedia DSC comments specifying  the  size  of  each
              page.   Any specification of the page size via -paper, -paperw, or
              -paperh will get overridden as long as each page of the  PDF  file
              has a defined paper size.

       -paper size
              Set  the  paper  size  to  one of &quot;letter&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, or &quot;A3&quot;
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).  This can also be set to  &quot;match&quot;,  which  will
              set  the  paper  size to match the size specified in the PDF file.
              -origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has  defined
              page sizes.

       -paperw size
              Set  the  paper width, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only). -origpagesizes
              overrides this setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only).  -origpagesizes
              overrides this setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -nocrop
              By  default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF
              file.  This option disables cropping.

       -expand
              Expand PDF  pages  smaller  than  the  paper  to  fill  the  paper
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By default, these pages are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don&apos;t  scale PDF pages which are larger than the paper (PS,PDF,SVG
              only).  By default, pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after  any  scaling)
              are  centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be aligned
              to the lower-left corner of the paper instead (PS,PDF,SVG only).

       -duplex
              Adds the %%IncludeFeature: *Duplex DuplexNoTumble DSC  comment  to
              the  PostScript  file  (PS only).  This tells the print manager to
              enable duplexing.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this  will
              bypass all security restrictions.
&#12;       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don&apos;t print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The poppler tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       4      Error related to ICC profile.

       99     Other error.
