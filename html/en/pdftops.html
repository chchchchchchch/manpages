NAME
       pdftops - Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter (version
       3.00)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftops [options] &lt;PDF-file&gt; [&lt;PS-file&gt;]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files  to  PostScript  so
       they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a PostScript file, PS-
       file.  If PS-file is not specified, pdftops converts file.pdf to  file.ps
       (or file.eps with the -eps option).  If PS-file is &#180;-&apos;, the PostScript is
       sent to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -level1
              Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The resulting PostScript files  will
              be  significantly  larger (if they contain images), but will print
              on Level 1 printers.  This also converts all images to  black  and
              white.  No more than one of the PostScript level options (-level1,
              -level1sep,  -level2,  -level2sep,  -level3,  -level3Sep)  may  be
              given.

       -level1sep
              Generate  Level  1 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted
              to CMYK.  Images are written with separate  stream  data  for  the
              four components.

       -level2
              Generate  Level  2  PostScript.  Level 2 supports color images and
              image compression.  This is the default setting.

       -level2sep
              Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.  All colors  are  converted
              to  CMYK.  The PostScript separation convention operators are used
              to handle custom (spot) colors.

       -level3
              Generate Level 3 PostScript.  This enables all  Level  2  features
              plus CID font embedding.

       -level3Sep
              Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separation handling is
              the same as for -level2Sep.

       -origpagesizes
              Generate a PostScript file with variable page sizes  and  orienta&#8208;
              tions,  taking  for each page the size of the original page in the
              PDF  file.   The  PostScript  file  contains  &quot;&lt;&lt;/PageSize  [WIDTH
              HEIGHT]&gt;&gt;  setpagedevice&quot;  lines  in each page header, so that the
              paper input tray gets  correctly  changed  on  the  printer.  This
              option  should be used when pdftops is used as a print filter. Any
              specification of the page size via  -paper,  -paperw,  or  -paperh
              will  get  overridden  as  long as each page of the PDF file has a
              defined paper size.  No more than one of the mode options  (-orig&#8208;
              pagesizes, -eps, -form) may be given.

       -eps   Generate  an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An EPS file con&#8208;
              tains a single image, so if you use this option with a  multi-page
              PDF  file,  you  must  use -f and -l to specify a single page.  No
              more than one of the mode options  (-origpagesizes,  -eps,  -form)
              may be given.

       -form  Generate  a PostScript form which can be imported by software that
              understands forms.  A form contains a single page, so if  you  use
              this  option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to
              specify a single page.  The -level1 option  cannot  be  used  with
              -form.   No  more  than  one  of the mode options (-origpagesizes,
              -eps, -form) may be given.

       -opi   Generate OPI comments for all images  and  forms  which  have  OPI
              information.   (This  option is only available if pdftops was com&#8208;
              piled with OPI support.)

       -binary
              Write binary data in Level  1  PostScript.   By  default,  pdftops
              writes  hex-encoded  data  in  Level 1 PostScript.  Binary data is
              non-standard in Level 1 PostScript but reduces the file  size  and
              can  be  useful  when  Level 1 PostScript is required only for its
              restricted use of PostScript operators.

       -r number
              Set the resolution in DPI  when  pdftops  rasterizes  images  with
              transparencies or, for Level 1 PostScript, when pdftops rasterizes
              images with color masks.  By default, pdftops rasterizes images to
              300 DPI.

       -noembt1
              By  default,  any  Type 1 fonts which are embedded in the PDF file
              are copied into the PostScript file.  This option  causes  pdftops
              to  substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript
              files larger, but may be necessary for readable output.

       -noembtt
              By default, any TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF  file
              are  copied  into the PostScript file.  This option causes pdftops
              to substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make  PostScript
              files  larger,  but  may  be necessary for readable output.  Also,
              some PostScript interpreters do not have TrueType rasterizers.

       -noembcidps
              By default, any CID PostScript fonts which are embedded in the PDF
              file  are  copied  into the PostScript file.  This option disables
              that embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded
              CID PostScript fonts.

       -noembcidtt
              By  default,  any CID TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF
              file are copied into the PostScript file.   This  option  disables
              that embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded
              CID TrueType fonts.

       -passfonts
              By default, references to non-embedded 8-bit fonts in the PDF file
              are  substituted  with  the closest &quot;Helvetica&quot;, &quot;Times-Roman&quot;, or
              &quot;Courier&quot; font.  This option  passes  references  to  non-embedded
              fonts through to the PostScript file.

       -preload
              preload images and forms
&#12;       -paper size
              Set  the  paper  size  to one of &quot;letter&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, or &quot;A3&quot;.
              This can also be set to &quot;match&quot;, which will set the paper size  to
              match the size specified in the PDF file. -origpagesizes overrides
              this setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points. -origpagesizes overrides this set&#8208;
              ting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -paperh size
              Set  the  paper  height,  in points. -origpagesizes overrides this
              setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -nocrop
              By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the  PDF
              file.  This option disables cropping.

       -expand
              Expand  PDF  pages  smaller  than the paper to fill the paper.  By
              default, these pages are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don&apos;t scale PDF  pages  which  are  larger  than  the  paper.   By
              default, pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By  default,  PDF pages smaller than the paper (after any scaling)
              are centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be  aligned
              to the lower-left corner of the paper instead.

       -duplex
              Set  the  Duplex  pagedevice  entry  in the PostScript file.  This
              tells duplex-capable printers to enable duplexing.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this  will
              bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don&apos;t print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
