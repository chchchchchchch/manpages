pdreceive(1)                                                        pdreceive(1)



NAME
       pdreceive - receive messages from pd on this or a remote machine

SYNOPSIS
       pdreceive port-number [udp|tcp]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdreceive  opens  a socket (with the specified port number) and waits for
       messages to arrive from one or more instances  of  pd(1).   Each  message
       received  is  printed  to  the standard output with a trailing semicolon.
       The protocol used is easy to implement and is called FUDI.

       The port number should agree with the port number of a  &quot;netsend&quot;  object
       within  pd.   The  protocol is &quot;tcp&quot; by default; this does a handshake to
       guarantee that all messages arrive complete and in their  correct  order;
       if  you  are sending messages locally or point-to-point you can often get
       away with the faster udp protocol instead.

       You can also use this to get messages from a Max  &quot;pdnetsend&quot;  object  or
       even just a &quot;pdsend&quot; in another shell.  If you&apos;re writing another program
       you&apos;re welcome to just grab the sources for  pdsend/pdreceive  and  adapt
       them to your own ends; they&apos;re part of the Pd distribution.
