NAME
       pdsend - send messages to pd on this or a remote machine

SYNOPSIS
       pdsend port-number [hostname] [udp|tcp]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdsend  sends  messages  to  pd(1), via a socket conection, from pdsend&apos;s
       standard input.  This input can be any stream of Pd messages separated by
       semicolons.   This is probably the easiest way to control pd from another
       application.  The protocol used is easy to implement and is called FUDI.

       The port number should agree with  the  port  number  of  a  &quot;netreceive&quot;
       object  within  pd.   The hostname is &quot;localhost&quot; by default and can be a
       domain name or an IP address.  The protocol is  &quot;tcp&quot;  by  default;  this
       does  a  handshake  to guarantee that all messages arrive complete and in
       their correct order; if you are sending  messages  locally  or  point-to-
       point you can often get away with the faster udp protocol instead.

       You can also use this to talk to a Max &quot;pdnetreceive&quot; object or even just
       a &quot;pdreceive&quot; in another shell.  If you&apos;re writing another program you&apos;re
       welcome  to  just grab the sources for pdsend/pdreceive and adapt them to
       your own ends; they&apos;re part of the Pd distribution.
