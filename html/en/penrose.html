DESCRIPTION
       The penrose program draws quasiperiodic tilings.

       See  Onoda,  Steinhardt,  DiVincenzo  and Socolar in Phys. Rev. Lett. 60,
       #25, 1988 or Strandburg in Computers in Physics, Sep/Oct 1991.

       This implementation uses the simpler version  of  the  growth  algorithm,
       i.e., if there are no forced vertices, a randomly chosen tile is added to
       a randomly chosen vertex (no preference for those 108 degree angles).

       There are two essential differences to the  algorithm  presented  in  the
       literature: First, we do not allow the tiling to enclose an untiled area.
       Whenever this is in danger of happening, we just do  not  add  the  tile,
       hoping for a better random choice the next time.  Second, when choosing a
       vertex randomly, we will take one  that  lies  withing  the  viewport  if
       available.  If this seems to cause enclosures in the forced rule case, we
       will allow invisible vertices to be chosen.

       Tiling is restarted whenever one of the following happens: there  are  no
       incomplete vertices within the viewport or the tiling has extended a win&#8208;
       dow&apos;s length beyond the edge of the window horizontally or vertically  or
       forced  rule  choice  has  failed  100 times due to areas about to become
       enclosed.

       Although quasiperiodic tilings are produced, the tiles themselves are not
       penrose  tiles  (darts  and  kites).  In contrast to penrose tiles, these
       tiles can be arranged to form a periodic tiling.


OPTIONS
       penrose accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -mono   If on a color display, pretend we&apos;re on a monochrome display.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -ncolors integer
               How many colors should be used (if possible).  Default  64.   The
               colors are chosen randomly.

       -size integer
               How big the tiles should be.  Default 40 pixels.
&#12;
       -delay milliseconds
               How long (in 1/1,000,000&apos;ths of a second) to wait between drawing
               each tile.  Default 10,000 or .01 seconds.


       -ammann

       -no-ammann
               Whether Ammann lines should be added.


       -fps    Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
