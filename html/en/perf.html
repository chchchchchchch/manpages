NAME
       perf - performance analysis tools for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       perf [--version] [--help] COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       Performance  counters for Linux are are a new kernel-based subsystem that
       provide a framework for all things performance analysis.  It covers hard&#8208;
       ware  level  (CPU/PMU, Performance Monitoring Unit) features and software
       features (software counters, tracepoints) as well.

       Each version of the perf tools may depend on new kernel features, so  you
       must  install a different version for each kernel version.  The perf com&#8208;
       mand will automatically run the correct version for  the  running  kernel
       version.
