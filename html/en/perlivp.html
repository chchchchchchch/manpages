PERLIVP(1)              Perl Programmers Reference Guide              PERLIVP(1)



NAME
       perlivp - Perl Installation Verification Procedure

SYNOPSIS
       perlivp [-a] [-p] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The perlivp program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the
       Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:

           make install

       (or your platform&apos;s equivalent procedure) to verify that perl and its
       libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is
       verified by output that looks like:

           ok 1
           ok 2

       etc.

OPTIONS
       -h help
            Prints out a brief help message.

       -a run all tests
            Normally tests for optional features are skipped.  With -a all tests
            are executed.

       -p print preface
            Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.

       -v verbose
            Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been
            performed.  Note that any failed tests ought to print out some extra
            information whether or not -v is thrown.

DIAGNOSTICS
       &#183;   print &quot;# Perl binary `$perlpath&apos; does not appear executable.\n&quot;;

           Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.
           Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Perl version `$]&apos; installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\n&quot;;

           Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.  Correct
           by conducting a proper installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Perl \@INC directory `$_&apos; does not appear to exist.\n&quot;;

           Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly
           installed.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Needed module `$_&apos; does not appear to be properly
           installed.\n&quot;;

           One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the
           installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely affects
           perlivp&apos;s ability to function.  You may be able to correct this by
           performing a proper perl installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Required module `$_&apos; does not appear to be properly
           installed.\n&quot;;

           An attempt to &quot;eval &quot;require $module&quot;&quot; failed, even though the list
           of extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by
           conducting a proper installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Unnecessary module `bLuRfle&apos; appears to be installed.\n&quot;;

           This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact
           installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the &quot;eval &quot; require
           \&quot;$module_name.pm\&quot;; &quot;&quot; test may give misleading results with your
           installation of perl.  If yours is the latter case then please let
           the author know.

       &#183;   print &quot;# file&quot;,+($#missing == 0) ? &apos;&apos; : &apos;s&apos;,&quot; missing from
           installation:\n&quot;;

           One or more files turned up missing according to a run of
           &quot;ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()&quot; over your installation.  Correct
           by conducting a proper installation.

       &#183;   print &quot;# Perl header `$_&apos; does not appear to be properly
           installed.\n&quot;;

           Correct by running h2ph over your system&apos;s C header files.  If
           necessary, edit the resulting *.ph files to eliminate perl syntax
           errors.

       For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult
       the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file for
       your platform.
