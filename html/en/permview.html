SYNOPSIS
       permview [options] assembly

DESCRIPTION
       This tools allow to list the declarative security attributes  present  in
       an  assembly.  The  security  attributes are either found on the assembly
       level, on the classes and the methods. This tool is  useful  to  diagnose
       why an assembly won&apos;t load or why some class/method throws SecurityExcep&#8208;
       tion.

OPTIONS
       -output filename
              Output all declarative security  attributes  related  informations
              into the specified file.

       -xml | --xml | /XML
              Output all declarative security attributes in an XML format.

       -decl | --decl | /DECL
              Show  declarative  security attributes on classes and methods. The
              default, without the -decl option, is to show  only  the  assembly
              level permission sets.

       -? | /? | -h[elp] | /h[elp]
              Display help informations about the permview tool.


EXAMPLES
       permview mscorlib.dll
              This  will show the minimum, optional and refused permissions sets
              (i.e. the assembly  level  security  actions)  that  are  compiled
              inside the mscorlib assembly.

       permview -decl permview.exe
              This  will  show all (assembly, class or method level) declarative
              security attributes present in the permview.exe assembly.
