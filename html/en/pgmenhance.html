DESCRIPTION

       The edge enhancing technique is taken from  Philip  R.  Thompson&apos;s  &quot;xim&quot;

       Dot Diffusion&quot;, D. E. Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics Vol. 6,  No.  4,
       October  1987,  which in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J. F. Jarvis
       et. al.

OPTIONS
       The optional -N flag should be a digit from 1 to  9.   1  is  the  lowest
       level of enhancement, 9 is the highest, The default is 9.
