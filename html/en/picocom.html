NAME
       picocom - minimal dumb-terminal emulation program

SYNOPSIS
       picocom [ options ] device

DESCRIPTION
       As  its  name suggests, picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation pro&#8208;
       gram. It is, in principle, very much like minicom(1) , only  it&apos;s  &quot;pico&quot;
       instead  of  &quot;mini&quot;!  It was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem
       configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It  has  also  served  (quite
       well)  as  a low-tech &quot;terminal-window&quot; to allow operator intervention in
       PPP connection scripts (something like the ms-windows &quot;open terminal win&#8208;
       dow  before / after dialing&quot; feature). It could also prove useful in many
       other similar tasks.

       When picocom starts it opens the terminal (serial device)  given  as  its
       non-option  argument.  Unless the --noinit option is given, it configures
       the device to the settings specified by the option-arguments (or to  some
       default  settings),  and sets it to &quot;raw&quot; mode. If --noinit is given, the
       initialization and configuration is skipped; the device is  just  opened.
       Following  this,  picocom  sets the standard-input and standard-output to
       raw mode. Having done so, it goes in a loop where it  listens  for  input
       from stdin, or from the serial port. Input from the serial port is copied
       to the standard output while input from the standard input is  copied  to
       the  serial  port.  picocom also scans its input stream for a user-speci&#8208;
       fied control character, called the &quot;escape character&quot; (being  by  default
       &quot;C-a&quot;).  If  the  escape character is seen, then instead of sending it to
       the serial-device, the program enters &quot;command mode&quot; and  waits  for  the
       next  character  (which is called the &quot;function character&quot;). Depending on
       the value of the function character, picocom performs one of  the  opera&#8208;
       tions described in the &quot;Commands&quot; section below.


COMMANDS
       Commands  are  given  to  picocom  by first keying the &quot;espace character&quot;
       which by default is &quot;C-a&quot; (see &quot;Options&quot; below on how to change it),  and
       then keying one for the function (command) characters shown here.

       [escape character]
          Send  the escape character to the serial port and return to &quot;transpar&#8208;
          ent&quot; mode. This means that if the escape character (&quot;C-a&quot;, by default)
          is  typed  twice, the program sends the escape character to the serial
          port, and remains in transparent mode. This is a new  behavior  imple&#8208;
          mented in v1.4. Previously picocom used to ignore the escape-character
          when it was entered as a function character.

       C-x
          Exit the program: if the &quot;--noreset&quot; option was  not  given  then  the
          serial  port  is  reset to its original settings before exiting; if it
          was given the serial port is not reset.

       C-q
          Quit the program *without* reseting the serial port, regardless of the
          &quot;--noreset&quot; option.

       C-p
          Pulse the DTR line. Lower it for 1 sec, and then raise it again.

       C-t
          Toggle  the DTR line. If DTR is up, then lower it. If it is down, then
          raise it.

       C-backslash
          Generate a break sequence on the serial line. A break sequence is usu&#8208;
          ally  generated by marking (driving to logical one) the serial Tx line
          for an amount of time coresponding to several character durations.

       C-u
          Baud up. Increase the  baud-rate.  The  list  of  baud-rates  stepped-
          through  by  this command is: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200,
          38400, 57600, 115200.

       C-d
          Baud down. Decrease the baud-rate. The  list  of  baud-rates  stepped-
          through by this command is the same as for the &quot;baud-up&quot; command.

       C-f
          Cycle through flow-control settings (RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF, none).

       C-y
          Cycle through parity settings (even, odd, none).

       C-b
          Cycle through databits-number settings (5, 6, 7, 8).

       C-c
          Toggle local-echo mode.

       C-v
          Show  program  options  (like  baud  rate,  data  bits, etc). Only the
          options that can be modified online (through commands) are shown,  not
          those that can only be set at the command-line.

       C-s
          Send (upload) a file (see &quot;Sending and Receiving Files&quot; below)

       C-r
          Receive (download) a file (see &quot;Sending and Receiving Files&quot; below)

       After  performing one of the above operations the program leaves the com&#8208;
       mand mode and enters transparent mode. Example: To increase the baud-rate
       by two steps, you have to type:

       C-a, C-u, C-a, C-u

       assuming of-course that &quot;C-a&quot; is the escape character.


SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES
       picocom  can  send  and receive files over the serial port using external
       programs that implement the respective protocols. In Linux  typical  pro&#8208;
       grams for this purpose are:

       &#8212;  rx(1) - receive using the X-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  rb(1) - receive using the Y-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  rz(1) - receive using the Z-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  sx(1) - send using the X-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  sb(1) - send using the Y-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  sz(1) - send using the Z-MODEM protocol

       &#8212;  ascii-xfr(1) - receive or transmit ASCII files
&#12;       The  name of, and the command-line options to, the program to be used for
       transmitting files are given by the &quot;--send-cmd&quot;  option.  Similarly  the
       program  to receive files, and its argumets, are given by the &quot;--receive-
       cmd&quot; option. For example, in order to start a picocom session  that  uses
       &quot;sz&quot;  to  transmit  files, and &quot;rz&quot; to receive, you have to say something
       like this:

       picocom --send-cmd &quot;sz -vv&quot; --receive-cmd &quot;rz -vv&quot;

       During the picocom session, if you key the &quot;send&quot; or  &quot;receive&quot;  commands
       (e.g. by pressing C-a, C-s, or C-a, C-r) you will be prompted for a file&#8208;
       name. At this prompt you can enter one or more file-names, and any  addi&#8208;
       tional  arguments  to  the transmission or reception program. After that,
       picocom will start the the external program as specified by the  &quot;--send-
       cmd&quot;,  or  &quot;--receive-cmd&quot;  option, and with any filenames and additional
       arguments you may have supplied. The standard input  and  output  of  the
       external program will be connected to the serial port. The standard error
       of the external program will be connected to the  terminal  which---while
       the  program  is  running---will revert to canonical mode. Pressing &apos;C-c&apos;
       while the external program is running will prematurely terminate it,  and
       return control to picocom


INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING
       Using  the  &quot;--imap&quot;, &quot;--omap&quot;, and &quot;--emap&quot; options you can make picocom
       map (tranlate, replace) certain special characters after being read  from
       the  serial  port (with --imap ), before being written to the serial port
       (with --omap ), and before being locally echoed to the terminal (standard
       output)  if  local  echo is enabled (with --emap ). These mapping options
       take, each, a single argument which is a comma-separated list of  one  or
       more of the following identifiers:

       &#8212;  crlf: map CR to LF

       &#8212;  crcrlf: map CR to CR + LF

       &#8212;  igncr: ignore CR

       &#8212;  lfcr: map LF to CR

       &#8212;  lfcrlf: map LF to CR + LF

       &#8212;  ignlf: ignore LF

       &#8212;  bsdel: map BS --&gt; DEL

       &#8212;  delbs: map DEL --&gt; BS

       For example the command:

       picocom --omap crlf,delbs --imap inglf,bsdel --emap crcrlf ...

       will:  Replace  every  CR  (carriage return, 0x0d) caracter with LF (line
       feed, 0x0a) and every DEL (delete, 0x7f) character  with  BS  (backspace,
       0x08) before writing it to the serial port. Ignore (not write to the ter&#8208;
       minal) every LF character read from the serial port and replace every  BS
       character  read from the serial port with DEL. Replace every CR character
       with CR and LF when echoing to the terminal (if local-echo is enabled).


OPTIONS
       picocom accepts the following command-line options

       --baud | -b
          Defines the baud-rate to set the serial-port (terminal) to.
&#12;       --flow | -f
          Defines the flow-control mode to set the serial-port to. Must  be  one
          of:

          &#8212;  &#180;x&apos; for xon/xoff (software) mode

          &#8212;  &#180;h&apos; for hardware flow control (RTS/CTS)

          &#8212;  &#180;n&apos; for no flow control

          (Default: &apos;n&apos;)

       --parity | -p
          Defines the parity mode to set the serial-port to. Must be one of:

          &#8212;  &#180;o&apos; for odd parity mode.

          &#8212;  &#180;e&apos; for even parity mode.

          &#8212;  &#180;n&apos; for no parity, mode.

          (Default: &apos;n&apos;)

       --databits | -d
          Defines the number of data bits in every character. Must be one of: 5,
          6, 7, 8

          (Default: 8)

       --esacpe | -e
          Defines the character that will make picocom enter  command-mode  (see
          description  above). If &apos;x&apos; is given, then C-x will make picocom enter
          command mode.

          (Default: &apos;a&apos;)

       --echo | -c
          Enable local echo. Every character being read from the terminal (stan&#8208;
          dard input) is echoed to the terminal (standard output) subject to the
          echo-mapping configuration (see --emap option.

          (Default: Disabled)

       --noinit | -i
          If given, picocom will not initialize, reset, or otherwise meddle with
          the serial port at start-up. It will just open it. This is useful, for
          example,  for  connecting  picocom  to  already-connected  modems,  or
          already configured ports without terminating the connection, or alter&#8208;
          ing the settings. If required  serial  port  parameters  can  then  be
          adjusted at run-time by commands.

       --noreset | -r
          If  given,  picocom  will not *reset* the serial port when exiting. It
          will just close the filedes and do nothing more. This is  useful,  for
          example,  for  leaving  modems  connected when exiting picocom picocom
          using the &quot;Quit&quot; command (instead of &quot;Exit&quot;), which never  resets  the
          serial  port.  If  &quot;--noreset&quot;  is given then &quot;Quit&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; behave
          essentially the same.

       --nolock | -l
          If given, picocom will *not* attempt to lock the  serial  port  before
          opening  it.  Normally  picocom attempts to get a UUCP-style lock-file
          (e.g. &quot;/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0&quot;) before opening the port. Failing  to  do
          so, results in the program exiting after emitting an error-message. It
          is possible that your picocom binary is compiled without this option.
&#12;       --send-cmd | -s
          Specifies the external program (and any arguments to it) that will  be
          used for transmitting files.

          Default: &quot;sz -vv&quot;

       --receive-cmd | -v
          Specifies  the external program (and any arguments to it) that will be
          used for receiving files.

          (Default: &quot;rz -vv&quot;)

       --imap
          Specifies the input character  map  (i.e.  special  characters  to  be
          replaced when read from the serial port). Example: &quot;--imap crlf,delbs&quot;

          (Defaul: Empty)

       --omap
          Specifies  the  output  character  map  (i.e. special characters to be
          replaced before  being  written  to  serial  port).  Example:  &quot;--omap
          crcrlf,bsdel&quot;

          (Defaul: Empty)

       --emap
          Specifies  the local-echo character map (i.e. special characters to be
          replaced before being echoed-back to the terminal,  if  local-echo  is
          enabled). Example: &quot;--emap crcrlf,bsdel&quot;

          (Defaul: delbs,crcrlf)

       --help | -h
          Print a short help message describing the command-line options.
