NAME
       pidgin - Instant Messaging client

SYNOPSIS
       pidgin [options]


DESCRIPTION
       pidgin  is  a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple which
       is capable of connecting to AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, XMPP, ICQ, IRC, SILC,  Nov&#8208;
       ell  GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It
       has many common features found in other clients, as well as  many  unique
       features.   Pidgin  is not endorsed by or affiliated with America Online,
       ICQ, Microsoft, or Yahoo.

       Pidgin can be extended by plugins written in  multiple  programming  lan&#8208;
       guages and controlled through DBus or purple-remote.


OPTIONS
       The  following options are provided by Pidgin using the standard GNU com&#8208;
       mand line syntax:

       -c, --config=DIR
              Use DIR as the directory for config files instead of ~/.purple.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging messages to stdout.  These are the same  debugging
              messages that are displayed in the Debug Window.

       -f, --force-online
              Try  to  be online even if the network is reported (by Windows, or
              NetworkManager on Linux) to be unavailable.

       -h, --help
              Print a summary of command line options and exit.

       -m, --multiple
              Allow multiple instances of Pidgin to run.

       -n, --nologin
              Don&apos;t automatically login when Pidgin  starts.   Sets  the  global
              status to Offline.

       -l, --login[=NAME,NAME,...]
              Enable  the  comma-separated  list of accounts provided, disabling
              all other accounts.  If the user does not specify  such  a  comma-
              separated list, the first account in accounts.xml will be enabled.

       -v, --version
              Print the current version and exit.


TERMS
       Pidgin  uses a few terms differently from other applications.  For conve&#8208;
       nience they are defined here:

       Buddy List
              The list of other users who the user wants to see status  informa&#8208;
              tion for and have quick access to for messaging.

       Buddy  A user who has been added to the Buddy List.

       Contact
              A  grouping of more than one buddy who are all the same person.  A
              contact may contain buddies from any protocol and may  contain  as
              many buddies as the user desires.  Contact arrangements are stored
              locally only.

       Alias  A private &quot;nickname&quot; that may be set for Buddies or the user  him&#8208;
              self.   On some protocols, aliases are saved on the server but not
              visible to other users.  On other  protocols,  aliases  are  saved
              only locally.

       Protocol
              A  messaging service.  AIM, XMPP, MSN, Zephyr, etc. are protocols.
              Others may call these  &quot;service  types,&quot;  &quot;account  types,&quot;  &quot;ser&#8208;
              vices,&quot; and so on.


BUDDY LIST
       The Buddy List window is Pidgin&apos;s main interface window.  Using this win&#8208;
       dow a user can see which of his/her buddies is online, away,  idle,  etc.
       The user can also add buddies to and remove buddies from the buddy list.

       The  Buddy  List  window  contains  a  list of the user&apos;s buddies who are
       online and have allowed the user to be notified of their  presence.   The
       icon  to  the  left  of  each buddy indicates the buddy&apos;s current status.
       Double clicking a buddy will  open  a  new  Conversation  window.   Right
       clicking will pop up a menu:

       Get Info
              Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.  This informa&#8208;
              tion is also known as a Profile.

       IM     Opens a new Conversation window to the selected buddy.

       Send File
              Sends a file to the selected buddy (only  available  on  protocols
              that support file transfer).

       Add Buddy Pounce
              A  Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be performed
              when the buddy&apos;s state changes.  This will open the  Buddy  Pounce
              dialog, which will be discussed later.

       View Log
              Pidgin  is  capable of automatically logging messages.  These logs
              are either plain text files (with a .txt extension) or html  files
              (with  a  .html extension) located under the ~/.purple/logs direc&#8208;
              tory.  This menu command will display  Pidgin&apos;s  log  viewer  with
              logs loaded for that buddy or chat.

       Alias  Create  an  alias for this buddy.  This will show an editable text
              field where the buddy&apos;s name was displayed.  In this field one can
              give  this buddy an alternate, more friendly name to appear on the
              buddy list and in conversations.

              For example, if a buddy&apos;s name was jsmith1281xx and his real  name
              was  &apos;John Q. Smith,&apos; one could create an alias as to identify the
              buddy by his common name.

       The remainder of the menu will consist  of  protocol  specific  commands.
       These commands vary depending on the protocol.

       Status Selector
              At  the bottom of the Buddy List is a status selector which allows
              one to change his/her status.  This will be discussed  further  in
              the STATUS MESSAGES section below.


ACCOUNT EDITOR
       The  account  editor consists of a list of accounts and information about
       them.  It can be accessed by selecting Manage  from  the  Accounts  menu.
       Clicking Delete will delete the currently selected account.  Clicking Add
       or Modify will invoke a Modify Account window.  Here, the user   can  add
       or alter account information.  When creating a new account, the user will
       submit a username and password.  The user will also choose  the  protocol
       for the account.

       If  Remember  Password  is chosen, the password will be saved in Pidgin&apos;s
       ~/.purple/accounts.xml configuration file.

       If Enabled is checked in the accounts dialog, this  account  will  follow
       the  status  currently  selected  in  the  status selector.  If it is not
       checked, the account will always be offline.

       Each protocol has its own specific options that can be found in the  mod&#8208;
       ify screen.


PREFERENCES
       All options take effect immediately.


Interface
       Show system tray icon
              Specifies  when  to show a Pidgin icon in the notification area of
              the user&apos;s panel (commonly referred to as the System Tray).


       Hide new IM conversations
              Specifies when to hide new IM messages.  Messages will queue under
              the  specified condition until shown.  Clicking the Pidgin icon in
              the notification area or system tray will display the queued  mes&#8208;
              sages.   An  icon  also appears in the buddy list&apos;s menu bar; this
              icon may also be used to display queued messages.


       Show IMs and chats in tabbed windows
              When checked, this option will  cause  IM  and  chat  sessions  to
              appear  in windows with multiple tabs.  One tab will represent one
              conversation or chat.  Where tabs are placed will be  dictated  by
              the preferences below.


       Show close buttons on tabs
              When checked, this option will cause a clickable &quot;U+2715 MULTIPLI&#8208;
              CATION X&quot; unicode character to appear at the right  edge  of  each
              tab.  Clicking this will cause the tab to be closed.


       Placement
              Specifies  where  to  place tabs in the window.  Some tab orienta&#8208;
              tions may allow some users to fit more tabs into a  single  window
              comfortably.


       New conversations
              Specifies  under  which  conditions  tabs are placed into existing
              windows or into new windows.  For a  single  window,  select  Last
              created window here.


Conversations
       Enable buddy icon animation
              If  a buddy&apos;s icon happens to be animated, this option will enable
              the animation, otherwise only the first frame will be displayed.


       Notify buddies that you are typing to them
              Some protocols allow clients to tell their buddies when  they  are
              typing.   This option enables this feature for protocols that sup&#8208;
              ports it.


       Default Formatting
              Allows specifying the default formatting to apply to all  outgoing
              messages  (only applicable to protocols that support formatting in
              messages).


Smiley Themes
       Allows the user to choose between different  smiley  themes.  The  &quot;none&quot;
       theme  will  disable graphical emoticons - they will be displayed as text
       instead.  The Add and Remove buttons may be used to install or  uninstall
       smiley  themes.   Themes  may  also be installed by dragging and dropping
       them onto the list of themes.


Sounds
       Method Lets the user choose between different playback methods. The  user
              can  also  manually enter a command to be executed when a sound is
              to be played(%s expands to the full path to the file name).


       Sounds when conversation has focus
              When checked, sounds will play for events in the active  conversa&#8208;
              tion  if  the  window is focused.  When unchecked, sounds will not
              play for the active conversation when the window is focused.


       Enable Sounds
              Determines when to play sounds.


       Sound Events
              Lets the user choose when and what sounds are to be played.


Network
       STUN server
              This allows specifying a server which uses the  STUN  protocol  to
              determine  a  host&apos;s  public IP address.  This can be particularly
              useful for some protocols.


       Autodetect IP address
              When checked, causes Pidign to attempt to determine the public  IP
              address  of  the  host on which Pidgin is running and disables the
              Public IP text field listed below.


       Public IP
              If Autodetect IP address is disabled, this field  allows  manually
              specifying  the  public IP address for the host on which Pidgin is
              running.  This is mainly useful for users  with  multiple  network
              interfaces or behind NATs.


       Manually specify range of ports to listen on
              Specify a range ports to listen on, overriding any defaults.  This
              is sometimes useful for file transfers and Direct IM.


       Proxy Server
              The configuration section to enable Pidgin to  operate  through  a
              proxy  server.  Pidgin currently supports SOCKS 4/5 and HTTP prox&#8208;
              ies.


Browser
       Browser
              Allows the user to select Pidgin&apos;s default web browser.   Firefox,
              Galeon,  Konqueror,  Mozilla,  Netscape  and  Opera  are supported
              natively.  The user can also manually enter a command to  be  exe&#8208;
              cuted  when  a link is clicked (%s expands to the URL).  For exam&#8208;
              ple, xterm -e lynx &quot;%s&quot; will open the link with lynx.


       Open link in
              Allows the user to specify whether to use an  existing  window,  a
              new  tab, a new window, or to let the browser to decide what to do
              when calling the browser to open a link.  Which options are avail&#8208;
              able will depend on which browser is selected.


Logging
       Log format
              Specifies  how  to  log.  Pidgin supports HTML and plain text, but
              plugins can provide other logging methods.


       Log all instant messages
              When enabled, all IM conversations are logged.  This can be  over&#8208;
              ridden on a per-conversation basis in the conversation window.


       Log all chats
              When  enabled,  all  chat  conversations  are logged.  This can be
              overridden on a per-conversation basis in the conversation window.


       Log all status changes to system log
              When enabled, status changes are logged.


Status / Idle
       Report idle time
              Determines under which conditions to report idle time.   Based  on
              keyboard  and mouse use uses keyboard and mouse activity to deter&#8208;
              mine idle time.  From last sent message uses the time at which the
              user  last sent a message in Pidgin to determine idle.  Never dis&#8208;
              ables idle reporting.


       Auto-reply
              Determines when to send an auto-reply on protocols  which  support
              it (currently only AIM).


       Change status when idle
              When  enabled,  this  uses  the  Minutes  before becoming idle and
              Change status to preferences described  below  to  set  status  on
              idle.


       Minutes before becoming idle
              Specifies  how many minutes of inactivity are required before con&#8208;
              sidering the user to be idle.


       Change status to
              Specifies which &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; status to use when  setting
              status on idle.


       Use status from last exit at startup
              If  this  is  checked, Pidgin will remember what status was active
              when the user closed Pidgin and restore it at the next run.   When
              disabled,  Pidgin will always set the status selected in Status to
              apply at startup at startup.


       Status to apply at startup
              When Use status from last exit at startup is disabled, this speci&#8208;
              fies which &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; status to use at startup.


CONVERSATIONS
       When  starting a new conversation, the user is presented with the Conver&#8208;
       sation window.  The conversation appears in the upper text  box  and  the
       user  types  his/her message in the lower text box.  Between the two is a
       row of options, represented by icons.  Some or all  buttons  may  not  be
       active  if  the  protocol  does not support the specific formatting. From
       left to right:

       Font   This menu provides font control options for the current  conversa&#8208;
              tion.  Size, style, and face may be configured here.

       Insert This menu provides the ability to insert images, horizontal rules,
              and links where the protocol supports each of these features.

       Smile! Allows the insertion of graphical smileys  via  the  mouse.   This
              button  shows the user a dialog with the available smileys for the
              current conversation.


CHATS
       For protocols that allow it, Chats can be  entered  through  the  Buddies
       menu.

       Additional features available in chat, depending on the protocol are:

       Whisper
              The text will appear in the chat conversation, but it will only be
              visible to the sender and the receiver.

       Invite Invite other people to join the chat room.

       Ignore Ignore anything said by the chosen person

       Set Topic
              Set the topic of the chat room.  This is usually a brief  sentence
              describing  the  nature  of  the  chat--an explanation of the chat
              room&apos;s name.

       Private Message (IM)
              Send a message to a specific person in the  chat.   Messages  sent
              this  way  will  not appear in the chat window, but instead open a
              new IM conversation.


STATUS MESSAGES
       Most protocols allow for status messages.  By using  status  messages,  a
       user can leave an informative message for others to see.  Status and sta&#8208;
       tus messages are configured via the status selector at the bottom of  the
       Buddy  List  window.  By default the menu shown here is divided into sec&#8208;
       tions for &quot;primitive&quot; status types, such as Available, Away, etc.; a  few
       &quot;popular&quot;  statuses  (including  &quot;transient&quot;  statuses)   which have been
       recently used, and a section which shows New  Status...  and  Saved  Sta&#8208;
       tuses... options for more advanced status manipulation.


       Primitive Statuses
              A  primitive  status  is a basic status supported by the protocol.
              Examples of primitive statuses would be Available,  Away,  Invisi&#8208;
              ble,  etc.   A  primitive status can be used to create a Transient
              Status or a Saved  Status,  both  explained  below.   Essentially,
              primitive  statuses  are  building blocks of more complicated sta&#8208;
              tuses.
&#12;
       Transient Statuses
              When one of the statuses from the topmost section  of  the  status
              selector&apos;s  menu  is selected, this creates a transient, or tempo&#8208;
              rary, status.  The status will show in the &quot;popular statuses&quot; sec&#8208;
              tion  in  the  menu  until it has not been used for a sufficiently
              long time.  A transient status may also be  created  by  selecting
              New  Status...  from the status selector&apos;s menu, then clicking Use
              once the user has entered the message.


       Saved Statuses
              Saved statuses are permanent--once created, they will exist  until
              deleted.   Saved  statuses are useful for statuses and status mes&#8208;
              sages that will be used on a regular basis.  They are also  useful
              for creating complex statuses in which some accounts should always
              have a different status from others.  For example, one might  wish
              to  create a status called &quot;Sleeping&quot; that has all accounts set to
              &quot;Away&quot;, then create another status called &quot;Working&quot; that has three
              accounts set to &quot;Away&quot; and another account set to &quot;Available.&quot;


       New Status Window
              When the user selects New Status... from the status selector menu,
              Pidgin presents the user with a dialog asking  for  status-related
              information.  That information is discussed below:

              Title  -  The  name  of  the status that will appear in the status
              selctor&apos;s menu.  If the user clicks the Save or Save &amp; Use button,
              this  name  will  also  be  shown in the Saved Status Window.  The
              title should be a short description of the status.

              Status - The type of status  being  created,  such  as  Available,
              Away, etc.

              Message - The content of the status message.  This is what is vis&#8208;
              ible to other users.  Some protocols will allow formatting in some
              status  messages;  where  formatting  is  not supported it will be
              stripped to the bare text entered.

              Use a different status for some accounts - This  allows  the  cre&#8208;
              ation  of  complex statuses in which some accounts&apos; status differs
              from that of other accounts.  To use this, the user will click the
              expander  to the left of the text, then select individual accounts
              which will have a different status and/or  status  message.   When
              the  user  selects  an account, Pidgin will present another status
              dialog asking for a status and a message  just  for  the  selected
              account.


       Saved Status Window
              When the user selects Saved Statuses... from the status selector&apos;s
              menu, Pidgin presents a dialog  that  lists  all  saved  statuses.
              &quot;Transient&quot;  statuses,  discussed above, are NOT shown here.  This
              window provides the ability to manage saved statuses  by  allowing
              the  creation,  modification, and deletion of saved statuses.  The
              Use, Modify, and Delete buttons here allow operation on the status
              selected  from  the  list;  the dd button allows creation of a new
              saved status, and the Close button closes the window.

       A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a  buddy  returns
       to a normal state from an away state.  The Buddy Pounce dialog box can be
       activated by selecting the Buddy Pounce option from the Tools menu.  From
       this  dialog, new pounces can be created with the Add button and existing
       pounces can be removed with the Delete button.  A pounce can  be  set  to
       occur  on  any  combination  of the events listed, and any combination of
       actions can result.  If Pounce only when my status is  not  Available  is
       checked, the pounce will occur only if the user is set to a non-available
       status, such as invisible, do not disturb, away, etc.   If  Recurring  is
       checked, the pounce will remain until removed by the Delete button.


CUSTOM SMILIES
       Pidgin 2.5.0 introduced support for custom smilies on those protocols for
       which interested contributors have developed support.  The custom  smiley
       manager  can  be  accessed by selecting Smiley from the Tools menu.  From
       here, custom smilies may be added, edited, or  deleted  by  clicking  the
       Add, Edit, or Delete buttons, respectively.

       During  a  conversation with another user, that user&apos;s custom smileys may
       be added to the user&apos;s own custom smiley list directly from the conversa&#8208;
       tion  window  by  right-clicking  the new custom smiley and selecting Add
       Custom Smiley...


PLUGINS
       Pidgin allows for dynamic loading of plugins to add  extra  functionality
       to  Pidgin.   See plugins/HOWTO or http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/CHowTo
       for information on writing plugins.

       The plugins dialog can be accessed by selecting Plugins  from  the  Tools
       menu.  Each  plugin  available appears in this dialog with its name, ver&#8208;
       sion, and a short summary of its functionality. Plugins  can  be  enabled
       with  the  checkbox beside the name and short description.  More informa&#8208;
       tion on the currently  selected  plugin  is  available  by  clicking  the
       expander  beside  the  text  Plugin  Details.  If the selected plugin has
       preferences or configuration options, the Configure  Plugin  button  will
       present the plugin&apos;s preferences dialog.


PERL
       Pidgin  allows  for plugins to be written in the perl scripting language.
       See Perl Scripting HOWTO in the Pidgin documentation for more information
       about perl scripting.


TCL
       Pidgin  allows  for  plugins to be written in the Tcl scripting language.
       See plugins/tcl/TCL-HOWTO for more information about Tcl scripting.


D-Bus
       Pidgin allows for interaction via D-Bus.  Currently very little  documen&#8208;
       tation about this interaction exists.
