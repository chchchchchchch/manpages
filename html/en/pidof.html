PIDOF(8)               Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual              PIDOF(8)



NAME
       pidof -- find the process ID of a running program.

SYNOPSIS
       pidof  [-s]  [-c]  [-n] [-x] [-o omitpid[,omitpid..]]  [-o omitpid[,omit&#8208;
       pid..]..]  program [program..]

DESCRIPTION
       Pidof finds the process id&apos;s (pids) of  the  named  programs.  It  prints
       those  id&apos;s  on the standard output. This program is on some systems used
       in run-level change scripts, especially when the system  has  a  System-V
       like  rc structure. In that case these scripts are located in /etc/rc?.d,
       where ? is the runlevel. If the system has a start-stop-daemon  (8)  pro&#8208;
       gram that should be used instead.

OPTIONS
       -s     Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one pid.

       -c     Only return process ids that are running with the same root direc&#8208;
              tory.  This option is ignored for non-root users, as they will  be
              unable  to  check  the current root directory of processes they do
              not own.

       -n     Avoid stat(2) system function  call  on  all  binaries  which  are
              located  on network based file systems like NFS.  Instead of using
              this option the the variable PIDOF_NETFS may be set and exported.

       -x     Scripts too - this causes the program to also return process  id&apos;s
              of shells running the named scripts.

       -o omitpid
              Tells  pidof  to  omit processes with that process id. The special
              pid %PPID can be used to name the parent process of the pidof pro&#8208;
              gram, in other words the calling shell or shell script.

EXIT STATUS
       0      At least one program was found with the requested name.

       1      No program was found with the requested name.

NOTES
       pidof  is  actually  the  same  program  as killall5; the program behaves
       according to the name under which it is called.

       When pidof is invoked with a full pathname to the program it should  find
       the  pid  of,  it  is  reasonably  safe. Otherwise it is possible that it
       returns pids of running programs that happen to have the same name as the
       program  you&apos;re after but are actually other programs. Note that that the
       executable name of running processes is calculated with  readlink(2),  so
       symbolic links to executables will also match.
