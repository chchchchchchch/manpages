NAME
       pingus - A puzzle game where you have to save penguins

SYNOPSIS
       pingus [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Pingus  is  a  side-scrolling puzzle game where the player has to guide a
       group of penguins from the entrance of a level to the  exit,  in  between
       the path is blocked by numerous obstacles and dangers that the player has
       to overcome by assigning actions to the penguins.

OPTIONS
   GENERAL OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays this help

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Enable info level log output

       -D, --debug
              Enable debug level log output

       -Q, --quiet
              Disable all log output

   DISPLAY OPTIONS
       -w, --window
              Start in Window Mode

       -f, --fullscreen
              Start in Fullscreen

       -r, --renderer=RENDERER
              Use the given renderer, defaults to sdl. Available renderers are:

              sdl    A simple software renderer based on SDL, this  is  the  de&#8208;
                     fault and the safest options.

              opengl The  OpenGL renderer will use hardware acceleration to ren&#8208;
                     der the graphics, it is much faster then the  SDL  renderer
                     and recommended when the hardware supports OpenGL.

              delta  The  delta  renderer uses SDL for rendering and doesn&apos;t use
                     hardware acceleration, it will however try to increase ren&#8208;
                     dering  performance  by  only  re rendering screen elements
                     that have changed. Using the delta  renderer  will  disable
                     some  effects such as scrolling background to allow maximum
                     benefits.

       -g, --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Set the window resolution for pingus (default: 800x600). Note that
              --geometry   only  applies  to  the  window  resolution,  for  the
              fullscreen resolution use --fullscreen-resolution

       -R, --fullscreen-resolution=WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Set the resolution used in fullscreen mode (default: 800x600)

       --software-cursor
              Enable software cursor
&#12;   GAME OPTIONS
       --no-auto-scrolling
              Disable automatic scrolling. Automatic scrolling  will  cause  the
              screen  to  scroll  whenever  the  mouse reaches the border of the
              screen. Automatic scrolling will only be active in fullscreen mode
              or when mouse-grab is enabled.

       --drag-drop-scrolling
              Enable drag&apos;n drop scrolling. By default Pingus will use a rubber-
              band scrolling where the scroll speed depends on how far away  the
              cursor  is  from  the  position  when  the  mouse  button has been
              clicked. In drag&amp;drop mode scrolling will behave more like in tra&#8208;
              ditional  GUI applications such as Gimp, where clicking the scroll
              button will &apos;pick up&apos; the playfield and allow to  move  it  around
              till it is released again.

   SOUND OPTIONS
       -s, --disable-sound
              Disable sound

       -m, --disable-music
              Disable music

       -l, --language=LANG
              Select language to use with Pingus

       --list-languages
              List all available languages

              Loads the level editor

   DIRECTORY OPTIONS
       -d, --datadir=DIR
              Load game datafiles from DIR

       -a, --addon=DIR
              Load  game  modifications  from DIR. Files in DIR will be used in&#8208;
              stead of the files in found in the main datadir  of  Pingus,  thus
              allowing to modifications, such as sprites replacements, addition&#8208;
              al levels, etc. to the game, without changing the main data files.

ACTIONS
       Basher The  Basher  will to a horizontal dig, leaving behind it a tunnel.
              It is not able to dig through metal.

       Blocker
              The Blocker will stop and stay in position, directing  other  pen&#8208;
              guins to turn around when they reach him.

       Bomber The  Bomber will blow up on the spot and take a bit of surrounding
              ground with it.

       Bridger
              The Bridger will build a small bridge, useful for  crossing  small
              chasm.

       Climber
              The  Climber  actions  allows a Pingu to travel upwards a vertical
              wall. Unlike other actions the climber action is a permanent addi&#8208;
              tion to the Pingus ability.

       Digger The  Digger  will dig a hole into the ground. It can&apos;t dig through
              metal.

       Floater
              The Floater action will give a penguin a small propeller that lets
              him  gently  glide down from great heights that would otherwise be
              deadly.

       Jumper The Jumper will let the Pingu do a big leap forward, allowing  him
              to cross chasm and small vertical obstacles.

       Miner  The Miner will dig a diagonal hole into the ground.

       Slider The Slider will make a tiny leap forward, gliding on its belly for
              a short while, allowing the Pingu to make it through  narrow  tun&#8208;
              nels.

LEVEL EDITOR
       Pingus comes with a build in level editor. The level editor can currently
       be used to edit level files (*.pingus) as well as  prefabricated  objects
       (*.prefabs).  Worldmaps (*.worldmap) can currently not be edited with the
       editor.

       All Pingus data files, except the sound and images, are  raw  text  files
       and can be edited in a text editor if the editor isn&apos;t sufficient.

       If  you  want to submit a level to be included in the next release follow
       the following naming convention:

       {theme}{number}-{nickname}.pingus

       Do not use space or uppercase in the levelname  and  keep  the  levelname
       simple    (i.e.    snow1-grumbel.pingus   not   pingus-go-on-a-long-jour&#8208;
       ney-in-snowland-grumbel.pingus).  The filename should not reflect the ac&#8208;
       tual  level title, it simply should be unique and not conflict with other
       peoples levels. If you plan on building a whole levelset, name the levels
       after the levelset.

       To submit a level send it to &lt;pingus-devel@nongnu.org&gt;.

   PREFABS
       A prefab, short for prefabricated object, is a group of objects that have
       been combined into a new single object. A classic case of a prefab  would
       for  example  be  a snowman, it is build out of multiple smaller snowball
       objects and then saved as prefab to allow easy reuse in multiple  levels.
       Unlike  simple object groups, prefab are saved as reference in the level,
       thus if the prefab is updated, all levels will see the change.  Like  ob&#8208;
       ject groups prefabs can be ungrouped to break them back down to individu&#8208;
       al objects if individual editing is needed, they are seizing to  be  pre&#8208;
       fabs  at that point and changes to the .prefab file will no longer be re&#8208;
       flected in the level.

       Prefabs behave pretty much like regular levels, to create a prefab simply
       start  a new level and insert the objects as usual, unlike regular levels
       the level size is ignored and thus you have to place your  object  around
       the  center of the levels, marked by a cross, to have the prefab function
       properly. To save a prefab as prefab instead of level you have to  append
       .prefab suffix to the filename.

       Thumbnail  generation  for  prefabs  is  currently  done offline with the
       script ./tools/generate-prefab-images.sh available from the Pingus source
       tree.

   UI QUIRCKS
       The Pingus level editor is best used with a combination of mouse and key&#8208;
       board, all essential functions have keyboard shortcuts.

       Unlike more traditional GUIs, the Pingus editor lacks scrollbars,  so  to
       move around the level or the object list on the right simply use the mid&#8208;
       dle or right mouse button and drag&amp;drop the list around.

       Objects from the object list can be inserted into the level by drag&amp;drop&#8208;
       ping them over to the level.

   KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
       Delete, Backspace
              Delete all currently selected objects
&#12;       A      Select or unselect all objects

       D      Duplicate the currently selected objects

       I, K, J, L
              Move the current selection by one pixel, if Shift is held, move it
              by 32 pixel.

       PageUp, PageDown
              Raise or lower an object

       ShiftPageUp, ShiftPageDown
              Raise or lower an object to the top or bottom

       R, ShiftR
              Rotate an objects 90 degrees, if Shift is held rotate it the other
              way around

       F, ShiftV
              Flip an object horizontally

       V, ShiftF
              Flip an object vertically

       B, ShiftB
              Toggle  the  background color to make it easier to see small pixel
              errors. If shift is hold the color will be toggled in the opposite
              direction.

       +, =, -
              Increase/decrease  the repeat value of selected objects, this will
              only have an effect on objects having  an  repeat  value  (switch&#8208;
              doors, liquids, ...).
