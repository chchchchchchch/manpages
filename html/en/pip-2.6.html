PIP-2.6(1)                                                            PIP-2.6(1)



NAME
       pip-2.6 - install Python packages

SYNOPSIS
       pip-2.6 [command] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       pip is an alternative Python package installer. It performs the same
       basic job as easy_install, but with some extra features. It can work with
       version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar
       repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by
       downloading all requirements before starting installation.

       It has some disadvantages when compared to easy_install. It does not use
       egg files, although it does preserve egg metadata. Some setuptools
       features are not yet supported, and some custom setup.py features won&#180;t
       work.

COMMANDS
       The command comes before any options. The following commands are
       recognized:

       help
           Show the help text.

       bundle
           Create &quot;bundles&quot; which can be used by pip to install the group of
           Python packages in multiple places.

       freeze
           Write the current list of installed packages to a requirements file,
           which can be used by pip to reinstall the same set of packages.

       install
           Install packages.

       unzip
           Unzip an individual package.
