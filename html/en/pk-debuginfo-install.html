PK-DEBUGINFO-INSTA(1)            [FIXME: manual]           PK-DEBUGINFO-INSTA(1)



NAME
       pk-debuginfo-install - Debugging Packages Installer

SYNOPSIS
       pk-debuginfo-install [--help] [--verbose] [--simulate] [--no-depends]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pk-debuginfo-install command.

       pk-debuginfo-install is the command line client for installing debuginfo
       packages.

WHY DO I NEED DEBUGINFO PACKAGES?
       When a program crashes, it&apos;s often useful to send the developer a
       backtrace which contains symbol names and variable contents, rather than
       memory addresses. To make this possible, extra packages called debug
       packages can be installed.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;). A summary of options is included below.

       --help
           Show summary of options.

       --noninteractive
           Do not be interactive and skip the confirmation before the packages
           are installed.

       --verbose
           Show extra debugging information.

       --simulate
           Don&apos;t actually install any packages, only simulate what would be
           installed.

       --no-depends
           Do not scan for, or install dependencies of the core packages.

       --quiet
           Do not display information or progress to the terminal.
