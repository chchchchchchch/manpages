PK2BM(1)                                                                PK2BM(1)



NAME
       pk2bm - create a bitmap from a TeX pkfont

SYNOPSIS:
       pk2bm [-bh] [-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -cchar pkfont

       pk2bm [-bh] [-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -ooctchar pkfont

DESCRIPTION
       This  program generates a bitmap (ASCII file) which can be used to create
       X11 applications. The bitmap file consists of all pixels of the specified
       character  (via the -c or -o option) from the given pkfont. The format is
       described in bitmap(X11).

       The pkfont is a packed fontfile generated by gftopk(TeX) from a gffont. A
       gffont  is  the  output of METAFONT a program to design fonts in a device
       independant way.

       With the -b flag a bitmap is generated in  which  all  black  pixels  are
       drawn  as a `*&apos; and all white bits as a `.&apos;. With the -h flag a hexadeci&#8208;
       mal bitmap dump is generated.

       The -W and/or -H options can be used to create a bitmap of  respectivally
       `width&apos;  and `height&apos; pixels. The pk-bitmap will in this case be centered
       according to these new dimensions.

       The output is written to the standard output.
