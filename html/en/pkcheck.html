PKCHECK(1)                           pkcheck                          PKCHECK(1)



NAME
       pkcheck - Check whether a process is authorized

SYNOPSIS
       pkcheck [--version] [--help]

       pkcheck [--list-temp]

       pkcheck [--revoke-temp]

       pkcheck --action-id action {--process { pid | pid,pid-start-time } |
               --system-bus-name busname} [--allow-user-interaction]
               [--enable-internal-agent] [--detail key value...]

DESCRIPTION
       pkcheck is used to check whether a process, specified by either --process
       or --system-bus-name, is authorized for action. The --detail option can
       be used zero or more times to pass details about action. If
       --allow-user-interaction is passed, pkcheck blocks while waiting for
       authentication.

       The invocation pkcheck --list-temp will list all temporary authorizations
       for the current session and pkcheck --revoke-temp will revoke all
       temporary authorizations for the current session.

       This command is a simple wrapper around the PolicyKit D-Bus interface;
       see the D-Bus interface documentation for details.

RETURN VALUE
       If the specified process is authorized, pkcheck exits with a return value
       of 0. If the authorization result contains any details, these are printed
       on standard output as key/value pairs using environment style reporting,
       e.g. first the key followed by a an equal sign, then the value followed
       by a newline.

           KEY1=VALUE1
           KEY2=VALUE2
           KEY3=VALUE3
           ...

       Octects that are not in [a-zA-Z0-9_] are escaped using octal codes
       prefixed with \. For example, the UTF-8 string f&#195;&#184;l,&#228;&#189; &#229;&#165;&#189; will be
       printed as f\303\270l\54\344\275\240\345\245\275.

       If the specificied process is not authorized, pkcheck exits with a return
       value of 1 and a diagnostic message is printed on standard error. Details
       are printed on standard output.

       If the specificied process is not authorized because no suitable
       authentication agent is available or if the --allow-user-interaction
       wasn&apos;t passed, pkcheck exits with a return value of 2 and a diagnostic
       message is printed on standard error. Details are printed on standard
       output.

       If the specificied process is not authorized because the authentication
       dialog / request was dismissed by the user, pkcheck exits with a return
       value of 3 and a diagnostic message is printed on standard error. Details
       are printed on standard output.

       If an error occured while checking for authorization, pkcheck exits with
       a return value of 127 with a diagnostic message printed on standard
       error.

       If one or more of the options passed are malformed, pkcheck exits with a
       return value of 126. If stdin is a tty, then this manual page is also
       shown.

NOTES
       Since process identifiers can be recycled, the caller should always use
       pid,pid-start-time to specify the process to check for authorization when
       using the --process option. The value of pid-start-time can be determined
       by consulting e.g. the proc(5) file system depending on the operating
       system. If only pid is passed to the --process option, then pkcheck will
       look up the start time itself but note that this may be racy.

AUTHENTICATION AGENT
       pkcheck, like any other PolicyKit application, will use the
       authentication agent registered for the process in question. However, if
       no authentication agent is available, then pkcheck can register its own
       textual authentication agent if the option --enable-internal-agent is
       passed.
