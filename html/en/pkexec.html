PKEXEC(1)                            pkexec                            PKEXEC(1)



NAME
       pkexec - Execute a command as another user

SYNOPSIS
       pkexec [--version] [--disable-internal-agent] [--help]

       pkexec [--user username] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]

DESCRIPTION
       pkexec allows an authorized user to execute PROGRAM as another user. If
       username is not specified, then the program will be executed as the
       administrative super user, root.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the return value is the return value of
       PROGRAM. If the calling process is not authorized or an authorization
       could not be obtained through authentication or an error occured, pkexec
       exits with a return value of 127. If the authorization could not be
       obtained because the user dismissed the authentication dialog, pkexec
       exits with a return value of 126.

AUTHENTICATION AGENT
       pkexec, like any other PolicyKit application, will use the authentication
       agent registered for the calling process. However, if no authentication
       agent is available, then pkexec will register its own textual
       authentication agent. This behavior can be turned off by passing the
       --disable-internal-agent option.

SECURITY NOTES
       Executing a program as another user is a privileged operation. By default
       the required authorization (See the section called &#8220;REQUIRED
       AUTHORIZATIONS&#8221;) requires administrator authentication. In addition, the
       authentication dialog presented to the user will display the full path to
       the program to be executed so the user is aware of what will happen:

               |                                                          |

       The environment that PROGRAM will run it, will be set to a minimal known
       and safe environment in order to avoid injecting code through
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar mechanisms. In addition the PKEXEC_UID
       environment variable is set to the user id of the process invoking
       pkexec. As a result, pkexec will not allow you to run X11 applications as
       another user since the $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY environment variables are
       not set. These two variables will be retained if the
       org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.allow_gui annotation on an action is set
       to a nonempty value; this is discouraged, though, and should only be used
       for legacy programs.

REQUIRED AUTHORIZATIONS
       By default, the org.freedesktop.policykit.exec authorization is required
       unless an action definition file is present for the program in question.
       To require another authorization, it can be specified using the
       org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path annotation on an action (See the
       section called &#8220;EXAMPLE&#8221; for details).

EXAMPLE
       To specify what kind of authorization is needed to execute the program
       /usr/bin/pk-example-frobnicate as another user, simply write an action
       definition file like this

           &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
           &lt;!DOCTYPE policyconfig PUBLIC
            &quot;-//freedesktop//DTD PolicyKit Policy Configuration 1.0//EN&quot;
            &quot;http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/PolicyKit/1/policyconfig.dtd&quot;&gt;
           &lt;policyconfig&gt;

             &lt;vendor&gt;Examples for the PolicyKit Project&lt;/vendor&gt;
             &lt;vendor_url&gt;http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/PolicyKit/&lt;/vendor_url&gt;

             &lt;action id=&quot;org.freedesktop.policykit.example.pkexec.run-frobnicate&quot;&gt;
               &lt;description&gt;Run the PolicyKit example program Frobnicate&lt;/description&gt;
               &lt;description xml:lang=&quot;da&quot;&gt;K&#195;&#184;r PolicyKit eksemplet Frobnicate&lt;/description&gt;
               &lt;message&gt;Authentication is required to run the PolicyKit example program Frobnicate (user=$(user), program=$(program), command_line=$(command_line))&lt;/message&gt;
               &lt;message xml:lang=&quot;da&quot;&gt;Autorisering er p&#195;&#165;kr&#195;&#166;vet for at afvikle PolicyKit eksemplet Frobnicate (user=$(user), program=$(program), command_line=$(command_line))&lt;/message&gt;
               &lt;icon_name&gt;audio-x-generic&lt;/icon_name&gt;
               &lt;defaults&gt;
                 &lt;allow_any&gt;no&lt;/allow_any&gt;
                 &lt;allow_inactive&gt;no&lt;/allow_inactive&gt;
                 &lt;allow_active&gt;auth_self_keep&lt;/allow_active&gt;
               &lt;/defaults&gt;
               &lt;annotate key=&quot;org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/pk-example-frobnicate&lt;/annotate&gt;
             &lt;/action&gt;

           &lt;/policyconfig&gt;

       and drop it in the /usr/share/polkit-1/actions directory under a suitable
       name (e.g. matching the namespace of the action). Note that in addition
       to specifying the program, the authentication message, description, icon
       and defaults can be specified. Note that occurences of the strings
       $(user), $(program) and $(command_line) in the message will be replaced
       with respectively the user (of the form &quot;Real Name (username)&quot; or just
       &quot;username&quot; if there is no real name for the username), the binary to
       execute (a fully-qualified path, e.g. &quot;/usr/bin/pk-example-frobnicate&quot;)
       and the command-line, e.g. &quot;pk-example-frobnicate foo bar&quot;. For example,
       for the action defined above, the following authentication dialog will be
       shown:

       Note that pkexec does no validation of the ARGUMENTS passed to PROGRAM.
       In the normal case (where administrator authentication is required every
       time pkexec is used), this is not a problem since if the user is an
       administrator he might as well just run pkexec bash to get root.

       However, if an action is used for which the user can retain authorization
       (or if the user is implicitly authorized), such as with
       pk-example-frobnicate above, this could be a security hole. Therefore, as
       a rule of thumb, programs for which the default required authorization is
       changed, should never implicitly trust user input (e.g. like any other
       well-written suid program).
