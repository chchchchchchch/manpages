DESCRIPTION
       The  pkg-config  program  is used to retrieve information about installed
       libraries in the system.  It  is  typically  used  to  compile  and  link
       against  one  or  more  libraries.  Here is a typical usage scenario in a
       Makefile:

       program: program.c
            cc program.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gnomeui)

       pkg-config retrieves information about  packages  from  special  metadata
       files.  These files are named after the package, and has a .pc extension.
       On most systems, pkg-config looks in /usr/lib/pkgconfig,  /usr/share/pkg&#8208;
       config, /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig and /usr/local/share/pkgconfig for these
       files.  It will additionally look in  the  colon-separated  (on  Windows,
       semicolon-separated) list of directories specified by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
       environment variable.

       The package name specified on the pkg-config command line is  defined  to
       be  the  name of the metadata file, minus the .pc extension. If a library
       can install multiple versions simultaneously, it must give  each  version
       its  own  name  (for  example, GTK 1.2 might have the package name &quot;gtk+&quot;
       while GTK 2.0 has &quot;gtk+-2.0&quot;).

       In addition to specifying a package name on the command  line,  the  full
       path  to  a  given  .pc  file may be given instead. This allows a user to
       directly query a particular .pc file.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --modversion
              Requests that the version information of the  libraries  specified
              on  the command line be displayed.  If pkg-config can find all the
              libraries on the command line, each library&apos;s  version  string  is
              printed  to  stdout, one version per line. In this case pkg-config
              exits successfully. If one or more libraries is unknown,  pkg-con&#8208;
              fig  exits  with  a  nonzero  code, and the contents of stdout are
              undefined.

       --help Displays a help message and terminates.

       --print-errors
              If one or more of the modules on the command line, or their depen&#8208;
              dencies,  are  not  found,  or if an error occurs in parsing a .pc
              file, then this option will cause errors explaining the problem to
              be printed. With &quot;predicate&quot; options such as &quot;--exists&quot; pkg-config
              runs silently by default, because it&apos;s  usually  used  in  scripts
              that  want to control what&apos;s output. This option can be used alone
              (to just print errors encountered locating modules on the  command
              line) or with other options. The PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment
              variable overrides this option.

       --silence-errors
              If one or more of the modules on the command line, or their depen&#8208;
              dencies,  are  not found, or if an error occurs in parsing a a .pc
              file, then this option will keep  errors  explaining  the  problem
              from  being  printed.  With &quot;predicate&quot; options such as &quot;--exists&quot;
              pkg-config runs silently by default, because it&apos;s usually used  in
              scripts that want to control what&apos;s output. So this option is only
              useful with options such  as  &quot;--cflags&quot;  or  &quot;--modversion&quot;  that
              print  errors  by  default.  The PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment
              variable overrides this option.

       --errors-to-stdout
              If printing errors, print them to stdout rather than  the  default
              stderr


       The following options are used to compile and link programs:

       --cflags
              This  prints  pre-processor  and compile flags required to compile
              the packages on the command line, including flags  for  all  their
              dependencies.  Flags  are &quot;compressed&quot; so that each identical flag
              appears only once. pkg-config exits with  a  nonzero  code  if  it
              can&apos;t find metadata for one or more of the packages on the command
              line.

       --cflags-only-I
              This prints the -I part of &quot;--cflags&quot;. That  is,  it  defines  the
              header search path but doesn&apos;t specify anything else.

       --libs This  option  is  identical to &quot;--cflags&quot;, only it prints the link
              flags. As with &quot;--cflags&quot;, duplicate flags are merged (maintaining
              proper  ordering),  and flags for dependencies are included in the
              output.

       --libs-only-L
              This prints the -L/-R part of &quot;--libs&quot;. That is,  it  defines  the
              library  search  path  but doesn&apos;t specify which libraries to link
              with.

       --libs-only-l
              This prints the -l part of &quot;--libs&quot; for the libraries specified on
              the  command  line.  Note  that  the  union of &quot;--libs-only-l&quot; and
              &quot;--libs-only-L&quot; may be smaller than &quot;--libs&quot;, due to flags such as
              -rdynamic.

       --variable=VARIABLENAME
              This  returns  the  value of a variable defined in a package&apos;s .pc
              file. Most packages define the variable &quot;prefix&quot;, for example,  so
              you can say:
                $ pkg-config --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /usr/

       --define-variable=VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE
              This  sets  a global value for a variable, overriding the value in
              any .pc files. Most packages define  the  variable  &quot;prefix&quot;,  for
              example, so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --print-errors --define-variable=prefix=/foo \
                             --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /foo

       --print-variables
              Returns a list of all variables defined in the package.
&#12;
       --uninstalled
              Normally  if  you  request the package &quot;foo&quot; and the package &quot;foo-
              uninstalled&quot; exists, pkg-config  will  prefer  the  &quot;-uninstalled&quot;
              variant. This allows compilation/linking against uninstalled pack&#8208;
              ages. If you specify the &quot;--uninstalled&quot; option,  pkg-config  will
              return successfully if any &quot;-uninstalled&quot; packages are being used,
              and  return  failure  (false)  otherwise.   (The   PKG_CONFIG_DIS&#8208;
              ABLE_UNINSTALLED   environment   variable  keeps  pkg-config  from
              implicitly choosing &quot;-uninstalled&quot; packages, so if  that  variable
              is  set,  they  will  only  have been used if you pass a name like
              &quot;foo-uninstalled&quot; on the command line explicitly.)

       --exists

       --atleast-version=VERSION

       --exact-version=VERSION

       --max-version=VERSION
              These options test whether the package or list of packages on  the
              command  line  are known to pkg-config, and optionally whether the
              version number of a package meets  certain  constraints.   If  all
              packages  exist  and  meet the specified version constraints, pkg-
              config exits successfully. Otherwise it exits unsuccessfully.

              Rather than using the version-test options, you can simply give  a
              version constraint after each package name, for example:
                $ pkg-config --exists &apos;glib-2.0 &gt;= 1.3.4 libxml = 1.8.3&apos;
              Remember to use --print-errors if you want error messages.

       --msvc-syntax
              This  option is available only on Windows. It causes pkg-config to
              output -l and -L flags in the form  recognized  by  the  Microsoft
              Visual  C++  command-line  compiler,  cl. Specifically, instead of
              -Lx:/some/path it  prints  /libpath:x/some/path,  and  instead  of
              -lfoo  it  prints foo.lib. Note that the --libs output consists of
              flags for the linker, and should be placed on the cl command  line
              after a /link switch.

       --dont-define-prefix
              This  option  is available only on Windows. It prevents pkg-config
              from automatically trying to override the value  of  the  variable
              &quot;prefix&quot; in each .pc file.

       --prefix-variable=PREFIX
              Also this option is available only on Windows. It sets the name of
              the variable  that  pkg-config  automatically  sets  as  described
              above.

       --static
              Output  libraries suitable for static linking.  That means includ&#8208;
              ing any private libraries in the output.  This  relies  on  proper
              tagging  in  the  .pc  files, else a too large number of libraries
              will ordinarily be output.

       --list-all
              List all modules found in the pkg-config path.

       -I &quot;--print-provides&quot;
              List all modules the given packages provides.

       --print-requires
              List all modules the given packages requires.

       --print-requires-private
              List all modules the given packages requires  for  static  linking
              (see --static).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              A colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of direc&#8208;
              tories to search for .pc files.  The default directory will always
              be   searched   after   searching   the   path;   the  default  is
              libdir/pkgconfig:datadir/pkgconfig where libdir is the libdir  for
              pkg-config  and  datadir is the datadir for pkg-config when it was
              installed.

       PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW
              If set, causes pkg-config to print all kinds of debugging informa&#8208;
              tion and report all errors.

       PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR
              A  value  to  set for the magic variable pc_top_builddir which may
              appear in .pc files. If the environment variable is not  set,  the
              default value &apos;$(top_builddir)&apos; will be used. This variable should
              refer to the top builddir of the Makefile where  the  compile/link
              flags reported by pkg-config will be used.  This only matters when
              compiling/linking  against  a  package  that   hasn&apos;t   yet   been
              installed.

       PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED
              Normally  if  you  request the package &quot;foo&quot; and the package &quot;foo-
              uninstalled&quot; exists, pkg-config  will  prefer  the  &quot;-uninstalled&quot;
              variant. This allows compilation/linking against uninstalled pack&#8208;
              ages.  If this environment  variable  is  set,  it  disables  said
              behavior.

       PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS
              Don&apos;t strip -I/usr/include out of cflags.

       PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS
              Don&apos;t strip -L/usr/lib out of libs

       PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR
              Modify -I and -L to use the directories located in target sysroot.
              this option is useful when cross-compiling packages that use  pkg-
              config  to determine CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. -I and -L are modified to
              point   to   the   new   system   root.   this   means   that    a
              -I/usr/include/libfoo will become -I/var/target/usr/include/libfoo
              with a PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR  equal  to  /var/target  (same  rule
              apply to -L)

       PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
              Replaces   the   default   pkg-config  search  directory,  usually
              /usr/lib/pkgconfig

QUERYING PKG-CONFIG&apos;S DEFAULTS
       pkg-config can be used to query itself for the default search path,  ver&#8208;
       sion number and other information, for instance using:
         $ pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
       or
         $ pkg-config --modversion pkg-config

WINDOWS SPECIALITIES
       If  a .pc file is found in a directory that matches the usual conventions
       (i.e., ends with \lib\pkgconfig or \share\pkgconfig), the prefix for that
       package  is assumed to be the grandparent of the directory where the file
       was found, and the prefix variable is overridden for  that  file  accord&#8208;
       ingly.

       If  the  value of a variable in a .pc file begins with the original, non-
       overridden, value of the prefix variable, then the  overridden  value  of
       prefix is used instead.

AUTOCONF MACROS
       PKG_CHECK_MODULES(VARIABLE-PREFIX, MODULES [,ACTION-IF-FOUND [,ACTION-IF-
       NOT-FOUND]])
&#12;              The macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES can be used in configure.ac  to  check
              whether modules exist. A typical usage would be:
               PKG_CHECK_MODULES([MYSTUFF], [gtk+-2.0 &gt;= 1.3.5 libxml = 1.8.4])

              This  would result in MYSTUFF_LIBS and MYSTUFF_CFLAGS substitution
              variables, set to the libs and cflags for the given  module  list.
              If  a  module is missing or has the wrong version, by default con&#8208;
              figure will abort with a message. To replace the  default  action,
              specify  an  ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND. PKG_CHECK_MODULES will not print
              any error messages if you specify  your  own  ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.
              However,  it  will  set the variable MYSTUFF_PKG_ERRORS, which you
              can use to display what went wrong.

              Note  that  if  there  is  a  possibility  the   first   call   to
              PKG_CHECK_MODULES  might not happen, you should be sure to include
              an explicit call to PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in your configure.ac.

       PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG([MIN-VERSION])

              Defines the PKG_CONFIG variable to the best pkg-config  available,
              useful if you need pkg-config but don&apos;t want to use PKG_CHECK_MOD&#8208;
              ULES.

       PKG_CHECK_EXISTS(MODULES, [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

              Check to see whether a particular set of modules exists.   Similar
              to  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(),  but  does  not  set  variables  or print
              errors.

              Similar to PKG_CHECK_MODULES, make sure that the first instance of
              this  or  PKG_CHECK_MODULES  is  called,  or  make  sure  to  call
              PKG_CHECK_EXISTS manually.


METADATA FILE SYNTAX
       To add a library to the set of packages pkg-config  knows  about,  simply
       install a .pc file. You should install this file to libdir/pkgconfig.

       Here is an example file:
       # This is a comment
       prefix=/home/hp/unst   # this defines a variable
       exec_prefix=${prefix}  # defining another variable in terms of the first
       libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
       includedir=${prefix}/include

       Name: GObject                            # human-readable name
       Description: Object/type system for GLib # human-readable description
       Version: 1.3.1
       URL: http://www.gtk.org
       Requires: glib-2.0 = 1.3.1
       Conflicts: foobar &lt;= 4.5
       Libs: -L${libdir} -lgobject-1.3
       Libs.private: -lm
       Cflags: -I${includedir}/glib-2.0 -I${libdir}/glib/include

       You would normally generate the file using configure, so that the prefix,
       etc. are set to the proper values.  The GNU  Autoconf  manual  recommends
       generating files like .pc files at build time rather than configure time,
       so when you build the .pc file is a matter of taste and preference.

       Files have two kinds of line: keyword lines start with a keyword  plus  a
       colon, and variable definitions start with an alphanumeric string plus an
       equals sign. Keywords are defined in advance and have special meaning  to
       pkg-config;  variables  do  not, you can have any variables that you wish
       (however, users may expect to retrieve the  usual  directory  name  vari&#8208;
       ables).

       Note  that  variable references are written &quot;${foo}&quot;; you can escape lit&#8208;
       eral &quot;${&quot; as &quot;$${&quot;.

       Name:  This field should be a human-readable name for the  package.  Note
              that it is not the name passed as an argument to pkg-config.

       Description:
              This should be a brief description of the package

       URL:   An  URL  where  people can get more information about and download
              the package

       Version:
              This should be the most-specific-possible package version string.

       Requires:
              This is a comma-separated list of packages that  are  required  by
              your  package.  Flags from dependent packages will be merged in to
              the flags reported for your package. Optionally, you  can  specify
              the  version of the required package (using the operators =, &lt;, &gt;,
              &gt;=, &lt;=); specifying a version allows pkg-config to  perform  extra
              sanity  checks.  You may only mention the same package one time on
              the Requires: line. If the version of a  package  is  unspecified,
              any version will be used with no checking.

       Requires.private:
              A  list  of packages required by this package. The difference from
              Requires is that the packages listed  under  Requires.private  are
              not  taken  into  account when a flag list is computed for dynami&#8208;
              cally linked executable (i.e., when --static was  not  specified).
              In  the  situation  where  each .pc file corresponds to a library,
              Requires.private shall be used exclusively to specify  the  depen&#8208;
              dencies between the libraries.

       Conflicts:
              This  optional line allows pkg-config to perform additional sanity
              checks, primarily to detect broken user installations.  The syntax
              is the same as Requires: except that you can list the same package
              more than once here, for example &quot;foobar = 1.2.3, foobar =  1.2.5,
              foobar  &gt;=  1.3&quot;,  if you have reason to do so. If a version isn&apos;t
              specified, then your package conflicts with all  versions  of  the
              mentioned package.  If a user tries to use your package and a con&#8208;
              flicting package at the same time, then pkg-config will complain.

       Libs:  This line should give the link flags  specific  to  your  package.
              Don&apos;t  add  any  flags  for required packages; pkg-config will add
              those automatically.

       Libs.private:
              This line should list  any  private  libraries  in  use.   Private
              libraries  are  libraries  which  are  not  exposed  through  your
              library, but are needed in the case of static linking.  This  dif&#8208;
              fers from Requires.private in that it references libraries that do
              not have package files installed.

       Cflags:
              This line should list the compile flags specific to your  package.
              Don&apos;t  add  any  flags  for required packages; pkg-config will add
              those automatically.

AUTHOR
       pkg-config was written by James  Henstridge,  rewritten  by  Martijn  van
       Beers,  and  rewritten again by Havoc Pennington. Tim Janik, Owen Taylor,
       and Raja Harinath submitted suggestions and some code.  gnome-config  was
       written  by  Miguel  de  Icaza,  Raja Harinath and various hackers in the
       GNOME team.  It was inspired by Owen Taylor&apos;s gtk-config program.

BUGS
       pkg-config does not handle mixing of parameters with and without =  well.
       Stick with one.

       Bugs can be reported at http://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under the pkg-config
       component.
