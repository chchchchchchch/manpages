PKGENPACK(1)                     [FIXME: manual]                    PKGENPACK(1)



NAME
       pkgenpack - PackageKit Pack Generator

SYNOPSIS
       pkgenpack [--help] [--verbose] [--with-package-list] [--output]
                 [--package] [--updates]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pkgenpack command.

       pkgenpack is the command line client for PackageKit for creating service
       packs.

WHAT IS A SERVICE PACK?
       A service pack is a tarball which contains a set of packages and their
       dependencies. The user can reduce the dependencies to be packed using the
       --with-package-list option. Along with the dependencies, a service pack
       has a file named metadata.conf which contains the information about the
       distribution and creation date of the pack.

CREATING A SERVICE PACK?
       A service pack is created using the command pkgenpack.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&apos;). A summary of options is included below.

       --help
           Show summary of options.

       --verbose
           Show extra debugging information.

       --with-package-list
           Set the filename of dependencies to be excluded.

           Generally, the file list of packages is generated when doing a
           PackageKit refresh on the target system. If not specified, pkgenpack
           uses /var/lib/PackageKit/system.package-list by default.

       --output
           The directory to put the pack file, or the current directory if
           omitted.

       --package
           The package to be put into the ServicePack.

       --update
           Put all updates available in the ServicePack.

NAMING A SERVICE PACK
       The only valid extension for a service pack is &quot;.servicepack&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       1. Tim is facing problems with his Internet connection at home. He needs
       a service pack with valgrind and it&apos;s dependencies for his system. He
       asks James to generate a pack for him. Both know James&apos;s system should
       contain similar packages as Tim&apos;s system, as both of them have installed
       Fedora 9 two days ago.

       James simply runs:
&#12;           [james@jamesbook:~]$ pkgenpack --output=/media/USB/TimPacks --package=valgrind

       This generates a file
       /media/USB/TimPacks/valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack on the USB key Tim
       gave to James. Tim can now go home, insert the USB key and double clicks
       on the valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack file to be prompted to install
       these packages.

       2. Bill wants to create a service pack named
       kdegames-fedora-9-i686.servicepack for his new system which does not have
       an internet connection. He generates a list of packages on his system
       using pkcon list-create and copies that list to his USB key. He then
       gives that USB to Rishi who has a good internet connectivity. Rishi runs
       the following command on his system:

           [rishi@devils-temple:~]$ pkgenpack --with-package-list=/media/USB/bill.package-list \
                                              --output=/home/rishi/Desktop --program=kdegames

       This generates a service pack, kdegames-fedora-9-i686.servicepack, on
       Rishi&apos;s Desktop, which can be distributed to Bill and users with similar
       requirements.

INSTALLING A SERVICE PACK
       Service Packs can be installed using pkcon. For example:

           [hacker@tim-lounge:~]$ pkcon install /media/USB/TimPacks/valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack
