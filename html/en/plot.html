PLOT(1)                      GNU Plotting Utilities                      PLOT(1)



NAME
       plot - translate GNU metafiles to other graphics formats

SYNOPSIS
       plot [ options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       plot  translates  files in GNU metafile format to other graphics formats,
       or displays them on an X Window System display.  GNU metafile format is a
       device-independent  format  for  the  storage of graphic data.  It is the
       default output format of the programs graph(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1),
       and  plotfont(1),  and  is  further documented in plot(5), since it is an
       enhanced version of the traditional plot(5) format found on non-GNU  sys&#8208;
       tems.   It  can  also  be produced by the GNU libplot 2-D graphics export
       library (see plot(3)).

       The output format is specified with the -T option.  The  possible  output
       formats  and  display  types are the same as those supported by graph(1),
       plotfont(1), pic2plot(1), and tek2plot(1).  If an  output  file  is  pro&#8208;
       duced, it is written to standard output.

       Options  and  file names may be interspersed on the command line, but the
       options are processed before the file names are read.  If -- is seen,  it
       is  interpreted  as  the end of the options.  If no file names are speci&#8208;
       fied, or the file name - is encountered, the standard input is read.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -T type
       --output-format type
              Select type as the output format.  It may be  &quot;X&quot;,  &quot;png&quot;,  &quot;pnm&quot;,
              &quot;gif&quot;,  &quot;svg&quot;,  &quot;ai&quot;,  &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;, &quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;,
              &quot;tek&quot;, or &quot;meta&quot; (the default).  These refer respectively to the X
              Window  System,  PNG  (Portable Network Graphics) format, portable
              anymap format (PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use
              LZW  encoding,  the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format,
              the format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript  or  Encapsulated
              Postscript  (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), CGM format (by
              default, confirming to the WebCGM profile), the format used by the
              xfig(1)  drawing  editor,  the  Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer lan&#8208;
              guage, the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics  for&#8208;
              mat  (which can be displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or
              by a VT330 or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format (which can be dis&#8208;
              played  by the xterm(1) terminal emulator), and device-independent
              GNU metafile format itself.  Unless type is &quot;X&quot;, an output file is
              produced and written to standard output.

              Omitting  the  -T  option  is  equivalent  to  specifying -T meta.
              Translating from metafile format to itself is occasionally useful,
              since there are two versions of metafile format (see the -O option
              below).

              A listing of the fonts available in any  specified  output  format
              may  be  obtained  with the --help-fonts option (see below).  If a
              requested font is unavailable, a default font will be substituted.
              The default font is &quot;Helvetica&quot; for &quot;X&quot;, &quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;,
              and &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;Univers&quot; for  &quot;pcl&quot;,  and  &quot;HersheySerif&quot;  for  &quot;png&quot;,
              &quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;, &quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, and &quot;meta&quot;.

       -p n
       --page-number n
              Output  only  page  number  n,  within the metafile or sequence of
              metafiles that is being translated.

              Metafiles may consist of one or  more  pages,  numbered  beginning
              with  1.   Also, each page may contain multiple `frames&apos;.  plot -T
              X, plot -T regis, and plot -T tek, which plot in real  time,  will
              separate  successive frames by screen erasures.  plot -T png, plot
              -T pnm, plot -T gif, plot -T svg, plot -T ai, plot -T ps, plot  -T
              cgm, plot -T fig, plot -T pcl, and plot -T hpgl, which do not plot
              in real time, will output only the last frame of  any  multi-frame
              page.

              The  default  behavior, if -p is not used, is to output all pages.
              For example, plot -T X displays each page in its own X window.  If
              the  -T  png, -T pnm, -T gif, -T ai, or -T fig option is used, the
              default behavior is to output only the first nonempty page,  since
              files in those output formats contain only a single page of graph&#8208;
              ics.

              Metafiles produced by graph(1) and plotfont(1) contain only a sin&#8208;
              gle  page  (page #1), which consists of two frames: an empty frame
              to clear the display, and a second frame that contains the  graph&#8208;
              ics.

       -s
       --merge-pages
              Merge  all  displayed pages into a single page, and also merge all
              `frames&apos;.

              This option is useful when merging together single-page plots from
              different  sources.  For example, it can be used to merge together
              plots obtained from separate invocations of graph(1).

       --bitmap-size bitmap_size
              Set the size of the graphics display in which  the  plot  will  be
              drawn,  in  terms  of  pixels,  to be bitmap_size.  The default is
              &quot;570x570&quot;.  This is relevant only to plot -T X, plot -T png,  plot
              -T  pnm,  and  plot  -T gif, all of which produce bitmaps.  If you
              choose a rectangular (non-square) window size, the  fonts  in  the
              plot will be scaled anisotropically, i.e., by different factors in
              the horizontal and vertical  directions.   For  plot  -T  X,  this
              requires an X11R6 display.  Any font that cannot be scaled in this
              way will be replaced by a default scalable font, such as the  vec&#8208;
              tor font &quot;HersheySerif&quot;.

              The  environment  variable  BITMAPSIZE can equally well be used to
              specify the  window  size.   For  backward  compatibility,  the  X
              resource Xplot.geometry may be used instead.

       --emulate-color option
              If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an appropri&#8208;
              ate shade of gray.  This is seldom useful, except when using  plot
              -T pcl to prepare output for a PCL 5 device.  (Many monochrome PCL
              5 devices, such as monochrome LaserJets, do a poor job of  emulat&#8208;
              ing  color on their own.)  You may equally well request color emu&#8208;
              lation by setting the environment variable EMULATE_COLOR to &quot;yes&quot;.

       --max-line-length max_line_length
              Set the maximum number of points that a polygonal  line  may  con&#8208;
              tain,  before  it  is flushed out, to be max_line_length.  If this
              flushing occurs, the polygonal line will be split into two or more
              sub-lines,  though  the  splitting  should not be noticeable.  The
              default value of max_line_length is 500.

              The reason for splitting long polygonal lines is that some display
              devices  (e.g.,  old  Postscript  printers and pen HP-GL plotters)
              have   limited   buffer   sizes.    The    environment    variable
              MAX_LINE_LENGTH  can  also  be  used  to  specify the maximum line
              length.

       --page-size pagesize
              Set the size of the page on which the  plot  will  be  positioned.
              This is relevant only to plot -T svg, plot -T ai, plot -T ps, plot
              -T cgm, plot -T fig, plot -T pcl, and plot -T hpgl.   The  default
              is  &quot;letter&quot;,  which  means  an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.  Any ISO
              page size in the range &quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot; or ANSI page size in the  range
              &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot;  may  be  specified  (&quot;letter&quot;  is  an alias for &quot;a&quot; and
              &quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias for &quot;b&quot;).  &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot;  are  recog&#8208;
              nized  page  sizes  also.   The  environment variable PAGESIZE can
              equally well be used to specify the page size.

              The graphics display in which the plot is drawn will, by  default,
              be  a  square  region  that  occupies nearly the full width of the
              specified page.  An alternative size for the graphics display  can
              be  specified.   For  example, the page size could be specified as
              &quot;letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;,   or   &quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;.
              For  all  of  the  above except plot -T hpgl, the graphics display
              will, by default, be centered on the page.  For all of  the  above
              except  plot  -T  svg and plot -T cgm, the graphics display may be
              repositioned manually, by specifying the  location  of  its  lower
              left  corner,  relative to the lower left corner of the page.  For
              example,  the  page  size  could  be  specified  as  &quot;letter,xori&#8208;
              gin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;,  or &quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;.  It is
              also possible to specify an offset vector.  For example, the  page
              size  could be specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or &quot;letter,xoff&#8208;
              set=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or &quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;.  In SVG  format  and
              WebCGM  format  it is possible to specify the size of the graphics
              display, but not its position.

       --rotation angle
              Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees.   Recognized  values
              are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to
              &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respectively.  The environment variable ROTATION can
              also be used to specify a rotation angle.

   Parameter Initialization Options
       The following options set the initial values of drawing parameters.  How&#8208;
       ever, all of these may be overridden by directives  in  a  metafile.   In
       fact,  these  options are useful primarily when plotting old metafiles in
       the traditional (pre-GNU) plot(5) format,  which  did  not  support  such
       directives.

       --bg-color name
              Set  the color initially used for the background to be name.  This
              is relevant only to plot -T X, plot -T png, plot -T pnm,  plot  -T
              gif, plot -T svg, plot -T cgm, and plot -T regis.  An unrecognized
              name sets the color to the default, which is &quot;white&quot;.   The  envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable BG_COLOR can equally well be used to specify the
              background color.

              If the -T png or -T gif option is used, a transparent PNG file  or
              a transparent pseudo-GIF, respectively, may be produced by setting
              the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable  to  the  name  of  the
              background color.  If the -T svg or -T cgm option is used, an out&#8208;
              put file without a background may be produced by setting the back&#8208;
              ground color to &quot;none&quot;.

       -f size
       --font-size size
              Set  the  size of the font initially used for rendering text, as a
              fraction of the width of the graphics display, to  be  size.   The
              default is 0.0525.

       -F name
       --font-name name
              Set  the  font initially used for text to be name.  Font names are
              case-insensitive.  If the specified font  is  not  available,  the
              default  font  will  be  used.  Which fonts are available, and the
              default font, depend on which -T option is specified (see  above).
              A  list  of  available fonts can be obtained with the --help-fonts
              option (see below).

       -W line_width
       --line-width line_width
              Set the initial width of lines, as a fraction of the width of  the
              display,  to be line_width.  A negative value means that a default
              value should be used.  This value is format-dependent.  The inter&#8208;
              pretation  of  zero  line  width is also format-dependent (in some
              output formats, a zero-width line is the thinnest line that can be
              drawn; in others, a zero-width line is invisible).

       --pen-color name
              Set  the  initial pen color to be name.  An unrecognized name sets
              the pen color to the default, which is &quot;black&quot;.

   Options for Metafile Output
       The following option is relevant only if the -T option is omitted  or  if
       -T  meta  is used.  In this case the output of plot, like the input, will
       be in GNU graphics metafile format.

       -O
       --portable-output
              Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile  for&#8208;
              mat,  rather than the binary version (the default).  The format of
              the binary version is machine-dependent.

   Options for Backward Compatibility
       By default, plot assumes that its input file(s) are in either the  binary
       version  or the portable version of GNU metafile format.  You may specify
       that the input is, instead, in the traditional  Unix  (pre-GNU)  graphics
       metafile  format, which is documented in plot(5).  The traditional graph&#8208;
       ics metafile format was produced by pre-GNU versions of graph(1).

       -h
       --high-byte-first-input
              Input file(s) are assumed to be in the binary, `high  byte  first&apos;
              version of traditional metafile format.  This variant is uncommon.

       -l
       --low-byte-first-input
              Input  file(s)  are  assumed to be in the binary, `low byte first&apos;
              version of traditional metafile format.  This variant is the  most
              common.

       -A
       --ascii-input
              Input  file(s)  are  assumed  to  be in the ASCII (human-readable)
              variant of traditional metafile format.  On some older  Unix  sys&#8208;
              tems, this variant was produced by plottoa(1).

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --help-fonts
              Print a table of available fonts, and exit.  The table will depend
              on which output format is specified with the -T option.   plot  -T
              X,  plot  -T svg, plot -T ai, plot -T ps, plot -T cgm, and plot -T
              fig each support the 35 standard Postscript fonts.  plot  -T  svg,
              plot -T pcl, and plot -T hpgl support the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts,
              and the latter two support  a  number  of  Hewlett-Packard  vector
              fonts.   All seven support a set of 22 Hershey vector fonts, as do
              plot -T png, plot -T pnm, plot -T gif, plot -T regis, and plot  -T
              tek.   plot without a -T option in principle supports any of these
              fonts, since its output must be translated to other formats  by  a
              further invocation of plot.

              The  plotfont(1)  utility may be used to obtain a character map of
              any supported font.

       --list-fonts
              Like --help-fonts, but lists the  fonts  in  a  single  column  to
              facilitate piping to other programs.  If no output format is spec&#8208;
              ified with the -T option, the  full  set  of  supported  fonts  is
              listed.

       --version
              Print  the version number of plot and the plotting utilities pack&#8208;
              age, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,  EMULATE_COLOR,
       MAX_LINE_LENGTH  and  ROTATION  serve  as  backups for the options --bit&#8208;
       map-size, --page-size,  --bg-color,  --emulate-color,  --max-line-length,
       and  --rotation,  respectively.   The remaining environment variables are
       specific to individual output formats.

       plot -T X, which pops up a window on an X Window System display and draws
       graphics  in  it,  checks  the  DISPLAY  environment variable.  Its value
       determines the display that will be used.

       plot -T png and plot -T gif, which  produce  output  in  PNG  format  and
       pseudo-GIF format respectively, are affected by the INTERLACE environment
       variable.  If its value is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be  interlaced.   Also,
       if  the  TRANSPARENT_COLOR  environment  variable is set to the name of a
       color, that color will be treated as transparent in the output.

       plot -T pnm, which produces output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM)  for&#8208;
       mat,  is affected by the PNM_PORTABLE environment variable.  If its value
       is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be  in  a  human-readable  format  rather  than
       binary (the default).

       plot  -T  cgm,  which produces output in CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile)
       format, is affected by the CGM_MAX_VERSION and  CGM_ENCODING  environment
       variables.   By default, it produces a binary-encoded version of CGM ver&#8208;
       sion 3 format.  For backward compatibility, the  version  number  may  be
       reduced  by  setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.  Irrespective of ver&#8208;
       sion, the output CGM file will use the human-readable clear text encoding
       if CGM_ENCODING is set to &quot;clear_text&quot;.  However, only binary-encoded CGM
       files conform to the WebCGM profile.

       plot -T pcl, which produces PCL 5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers and
       plotters,  is affected by the environment variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.  It
       should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when producing PCL 5 output for a color printer or
       other color device.  This will ensure accurate color reproduction by giv&#8208;
       ing the output device complete freedom in assigning  colors,  internally,
       to  its  &quot;logical  pens&quot;.  If it is &quot;no&quot; then the device will use a fixed
       set of colored pens, and will  emulate  other  colors  by  shading.   The
       default  is  &quot;no&quot;  because  monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are much more
       common than colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.

       plot -T hpgl, which produces Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language output, is
       affected  by  several  environment  variables.   The  most  important  is
       HPGL_VERSION, which may be set to &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the default).   &quot;1&quot;
       means  that the output should be generic HP-GL, &quot;1.5&quot; means that the out&#8208;
       put should be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and  the  HP758x,
       HP7595A  and  HP7596A  drafting  plotters (HP-GL with some HP-GL/2 exten&#8208;
       sions), and &quot;2&quot; means that the output should be modern HP-GL/2.   If  the
       version  is  &quot;1&quot;  or  &quot;1.5&quot;  then the only available fonts will be vector
       fonts, and all lines will be drawn with a default width  (the  -W  option
       will  not work).  Additionally, if the version is &quot;1&quot; then the filling of
       arbitrary curves with solid color will not be supported (circles and rec&#8208;
       tangles aligned with the coordinate axes may be filled, though).
&#12;       The  position  of  the  plot  -T hpgl graphics display on the page can be
       rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise by setting the  HPGL_ROTATE  environ&#8208;
       ment  variable  to  &quot;yes&quot;.  This is not the same as the rotation obtained
       with the --rotation option, since it both rotates  the  graphics  display
       and  repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of the page.
       Besides &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;,  &quot;90&quot;,
       &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respec&#8208;
       tively.  &quot;180&quot; and &quot;270&quot; are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is  &quot;2&quot;  (the
       default).

       By  default, plot -T hpgl will draw with a fixed set of pens.  Which pens
       are present may be specified by setting the HPGL_PENS  environment  vari&#8208;
       able.   If  HPGL_VERSION  is  &quot;1&quot;,  the  default  value  of  HPGL_PENS is
       &quot;1=black&quot;; if  HPGL_VERSION  is  &quot;1.5&quot;  or  &quot;2&quot;,  the  default  value  of
       HPGL_PENS   is  &quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
       The format should be self-explanatory.   By  setting  HPGL_PENS  you  may
       specify  a color for any pen in the range #1...#31.  All color names rec&#8208;
       ognized by the X Window System may  be  used.   Pen  #1  must  always  be
       present,  though  it  need  not  be  black.   Any  other pen in the range
       #1...#31 may be omitted.

       If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; then plot -T hpgl will also  be  affected  by  the
       environment  variable  HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS.   If  its value is &quot;yes&quot;, then
       plot -T  hpgl  will  not  be  restricted  to  the  palette  specified  in
       HPGL_PENS: it will assign colors to &quot;logical pens&quot; in the range #1...#31,
       as needed.  The default value is &quot;no&quot; because other than  color  LaserJet
       printers  and  DesignJet  plotters,  not  many  HP-GL/2 devices allow the
       assignment of colors to logical pens.

       Opaque filling and the drawing of visible white lines are supported  only
       if  HPGL_VERSION  is &quot;2&quot; and the environment variable HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE is
       &quot;yes&quot; (the default).  If its value is &quot;no&quot; then  white  lines  (if  any),
       which are normally drawn with pen #0, will not be drawn.  This feature is
       to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices.  HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example,
       do  not support opacity or the use of pen #0 to draw visible white lines.
       Some older HP-GL/2 devices may, in fact, malfunction  if  asked  to  draw
       opaque objects.

       plot  -T tek, which produces output for a Tektronix terminal or emulator,
       checks the TERM environment variable.  If the value of TERM is  a  string
       beginning  with &quot;xterm&quot;, &quot;nxterm&quot;, or &quot;kterm&quot;, it is taken as a sign that
       plot is running in an X Window System VT100 terminal emulator: a copy  of
       xterm(1),  nxterm(1),  or kterm(1).  Before drawing graphics, plot -T tek
       will emit an escape sequence that causes the terminal  emulator&apos;s  auxil&#8208;
       iary  Tektronix  window,  which is normally hidden, to pop up.  After the
       graphics are drawn, an escape sequence that returns control to the origi&#8208;
       nal  VT100  window  will be emitted.  The Tektronix window will remain on
       the screen.

       If the value of TERM is a string beginning with &quot;kermit&quot;, &quot;ansi.sys&quot;,  or
       &quot;nansi.sys&quot;, it is taken as a sign that plot is running in the VT100 ter&#8208;
       minal emulator provided by the MS-DOS version of kermit(1).  Before draw&#8208;
       ing  graphics, plot -T tek will emit an escape sequence that switches the
       terminal emulator to Tektronix mode.  Also, some of the Tektronix control
       codes  emitted  by  plot -T tek will be kermit-specific.  There will be a
       limited amount of color support, which is not normally the case  (the  16
       `ansi.sys&apos;  colors  will  be supported).  After drawing graphics, plot -T
       tek will emit an escape sequence that returns the emulator to VT100 mode.
       The  key  sequence  `ALT minus&apos; can be employed manually within kermit to
       switch between the two modes.
