PLOTFONT(1)                  GNU Plotting Utilities                  PLOTFONT(1)



NAME
       plotfont  -  produce  character  maps  of fonts supported by the plotting
       utilities

SYNOPSIS
       plotfont [ options ] fonts

DESCRIPTION
       plotfont produces a character map for any font that is supported  by  the
       plotting   utilities,   which  include  graph(1),  plot(1),  pic2plot(1),
       tek2plot(1), and  the  GNU  libplot  2-D  graphics  export  library  (see
       plot(3)).   Which fonts are supported depends on the output format, which
       is specified by the -T option.  A listing of the fonts available  in  any
       specified output format may be obtained with the --help-fonts option (see
       below).

       The character map, or maps, will be written to  standard  output  in  the
       specified  format.   For  example, the Times-Roman font is available when
       producing Postscript output.  The command plotfont -T  ps  Times-Roman  &gt;
       charmap.ps will yield a character map of the Times-Roman font, in a Post&#8208;
       script format that can be viewed or edited with the idraw(1) drawing edi&#8208;
       tor.   The  Times-Roman font is also available when producing Fig output,
       which can be viewed or edited with the xfig(1) drawing editor.  The  com&#8208;
       mand  plotfont -T fig Times-Roman &gt; charmap.fig will yield the same char&#8208;
       acter map, but in Fig format rather than in Postscript format.

       As another example, the Univers font is available when  producing  PCL  5
       output.  The command plotfont -T pcl Univers &gt; charmap.pcl will produce a
       character map of the Univers font, in PCL 5 format.

       When producing output for the X Window System, i.e., for a popped-up win&#8208;
       dow,  any scalable X Window System font that has an XLFD (i.e., X Logical
       Font Description) name is supported.  For example, the  command  plotfont
       -T  X  utopia-medium-r-normal  will pop up a window, and draw a character
       map of the Utopia-Regular font.  &quot;utopia-medium-r-normal&quot; is a  truncated
       version  of the Utopia-Regular font&apos;s XLFD name.  The Utopia-Regular font
       is available on most X Window System displays.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -T type
       --output-format type
              Select type as the output format.  It may be  &quot;X&quot;,  &quot;png&quot;,  &quot;pnm&quot;,
              &quot;gif&quot;,  &quot;svg&quot;,  &quot;ai&quot;,  &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;, &quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;,
              &quot;tek&quot;, or &quot;meta&quot; (the default).  These refer respectively to the X
              Window  System,  PNG  (Portable Network Graphics) format, portable
              anymap format (PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use
              LZW  encoding,  the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format,
              the format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript  or  Encapsulated
              Postscript  (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), CGM format (by
              default, confirming to the WebCGM profile), the format used by the
              xfig(1)  drawing  editor,  the  Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer lan&#8208;
              guage, the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics  for&#8208;
              mat  (which can be displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or
              by a VT330 or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format (which can be dis&#8208;
              played  by the xterm(1) terminal emulator), and device-independent
              GNU metafile format itself.  Unless type is &quot;X&quot;, an output file is
              produced and written to standard output.

              Files  in  PNG,  PNM, pseudo-GIF, AI, or Fig format contain only a
              single page of graphics.  So if the -T  png  option,  the  -T  pnm
              option,  the -T gif option, the -T ai option, or the -T fig option
              is used, the output file will contain a character map for only the
              first-specified font.

              A  listing  of  the fonts available in any specified output format
              may be obtained with the --help-fonts option (see  below).   If  a
              requested font is unavailable, a default font will be substituted.
              The default font is &quot;Helvetica&quot; for &quot;X&quot;, &quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;,
              and  &quot;fig&quot;,  &quot;Univers&quot;  for  &quot;pcl&quot;,  and &quot;HersheySerif&quot; for &quot;png&quot;,
              &quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;, &quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, and &quot;meta&quot;.

       -1
       --lower-half
              Generate a character map for the  lower  half  of  each  specified
              font.  This is the default.

       -2
       --upper-half
              Generate  a  character  map  for  the upper half of each specified
              font.

       -o
       --octal
              Number the  characters  in  octal  rather  than  in  decimal  (the
              default).

       -x
       --hexadecimal
              Number  the  characters in hexadecimal rather than in decimal (the
              default).

       --box  Surround each character with a box, showing its extent to left and
              right.  The default is not to do this.

       -j row
       --jis-row row
              Generate  a  character map for row row of a Japanese font arranged
              according to JIS [Japanese Industrial Standard] X0208.   The  only
              such  font  currently  available  is the HersheyEUC [Extended Unix
              Code] font.  If used, this option overrides the -1 and -2 options.
              The valid rows are 1...94.  In the JIS X0208 standard, Roman char&#8208;
              acters are located in row  3,  and  Japanese  syllabic  characters
              (Hiragana  and  Katakana)  are located in rows 4 and 5.  Greek and
              Cyrillic characters are located in rows 6 and 7.   Japanese  ideo&#8208;
              graphic characters (Kanji) are located in rows 16...84.

       --bg-color name
              Set  the  color used for the background to be name.  This is rele&#8208;
              vant only to plotfont -T X, plotfont  -T  png,  plotfont  -T  pnm,
              plotfont -T gif, plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T cgm, and plotfont -T
              regis.  An unrecognized name sets the color to the default,  which
              is &quot;white&quot;.  The environment variable BG_COLOR can equally well be
              used to specify the background color.

              If the -T png or -T gif option is used, a transparent PNG file  or
              a transparent pseudo-GIF, respectively, may be produced by setting
              the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable  to  the  name  of  the
              background color.  If the -T svg or -T cgm option is used, an out&#8208;
              put file without a background may be produced by setting the back&#8208;
              ground color to &quot;none&quot;.

       --bitmap-size bitmap_size
              Set the size of the graphics display in which the character map(s)
              will be drawn, in terms of pixels, to be bitmap_size.  The default
              is &quot;570x570&quot;.  This is relevant only to plotfont -T X, plotfont -T
              png, plotfont -T pnm, and plotfont -T gif, all  of  which  produce
              bitmaps.   If  you  choose a rectangular (non-square) window size,
              the fonts in the character map(s) will be scaled  anisotropically,
              i.e.,  by  different factors in the horizontal and vertical direc&#8208;
              tions.  For plotfont -T X, this requires an  X11R6  display.   Any
              font  that  cannot  be  scaled  in  this way will be replaced by a
              default scalable font, such as the vector font &quot;HersheySerif&quot;.

              The environment variable BITMAPSIZE can equally well  be  used  to
              specify  the  window  size.   For  backward  compatibility,  the X
              resource Xplot.geometry may be used instead.

       --emulate-color option
              If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an appropri&#8208;
              ate shade of gray.  This is seldom useful, except when using plot&#8208;
              font -T pcl to prepare output for a PCL  5  device.   (Many  mono&#8208;
              chrome  PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome LaserJets, do a poor job
              of emulating color on their own.)  You may  equally  well  request
              color  emulation by setting the environment variable EMULATE_COLOR
              to &quot;yes&quot;.

       --numbering-font name
              Set the font used for the numbering of the characters in the char&#8208;
              acter map(s) to be name, rather than the default.

       --page-size pagesize
              Set  the  size  of  size of the page on which the character map(s)
              will be positioned.  This is relevant only  to  plotfont  -T  svg,
              plotfont  -T ai, plotfont -T ps, plotfont -T cgm, plotfont -T fig,
              plotfont -T pcl, and plotfont -T hpgl.  The default  is  &quot;letter&quot;,
              which means an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.  Any ISO page size in the
              range &quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot; or ANSI page size in the range &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot; may  be
              specified  (&quot;letter&quot; is an alias for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias
              for &quot;b&quot;).  &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot; are recognized  page  sizes  also.
              The  environment  variable  PAGESIZE  can  equally well be used to
              specify the page size.

              The graphics display in which each character map is drawn will  be
              a  square  region  that  would occupy nearly the full width of the
              specified page.  An alternative size for the graphics display  can
              be  specified.   For  example, the page size could be specified as
              &quot;letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;,   or   &quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;.
              For all of the above except plotfont -T hpgl, the graphics display
              will, by default, be centered on the page.  For all of  the  above
              except  plotfont  -T svg and plotfont -T cgm, the graphics display
              may be repositioned manually, by specifying the  location  of  its
              lower  left corner, relative to the lower left corner of the page.
              For example, the page size could  be  specified  as  &quot;letter,xori&#8208;
              gin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;,  or &quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;.  It is
              also possible to specify an offset vector.  For example, the  page
              size  could be specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or &quot;letter,xoff&#8208;
              set=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or &quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;.  In SVG  format  and
              WebCGM  format  it is possible to specify the size of the graphics
              display, but not its position.

       --rotation angle
              Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees.   Recognized  values
              are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to
              &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respectively.  The environment variable ROTATION can
              also be used to specify a rotation angle.

       --pen-color name
              Set  the  pen color to be name.  An unrecognized name sets the pen
              color to the default, which is &quot;black&quot;.

   Options for Metafile Output
       The following option is relevant only if the -T option is omitted  or  if
       -T  meta  is  used.   In  this case the output of plotfont will be in GNU
       graphics metafile format.  It may  be  translated  to  other  formats  by
       invoking plot(1).

       -O
       --portable-output
              Output  the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile for&#8208;
              mat, rather than the binary version (the default).  The format  of
              the binary version is machine-dependent.

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --help-fonts
              Print a table of available fonts, and exit.  The table will depend
              on which output format is specified with the -T option.   plotfont
              -T X, plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T ai, plotfont -T ps, plotfont -T
              cgm, and plotfont -T fig each support the 35  standard  Postscript
              fonts.   plotfont  -T  svg,  plotfont -T pcl, and plotfont -T hpgl
              support the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter two support  a
              number  of  Hewlett-Packard vector fonts.  All seven support a set
              of 22 Hershey vector fonts, as do plotfont  -T  png,  plotfont  -T
              pnm,  plotfont  -T  gif,  plotfont  -T regis, and plotfont -T tek.
              plotfont without a -T option in principle supports  any  of  these
              fonts,  since  its  output  must be translated to other formats by
              invoking plot(1).

       --list-fonts
              Like --help-fonts, but lists the  fonts  in  a  single  column  to
              facilitate piping to other programs.  If no output format is spec&#8208;
              ified with the -T option, the  full  set  of  supported  fonts  is
              listed.

       --version
              Print  the  version  number of plotfont and the plotting utilities
              package, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,  EMULATE_COLOR,
       and ROTATION serve as backups for the options --bitmap-size, --page-size,
       --bg-color, --emulate-color, and --rotation, respectively.  The remaining
       environment variables are specific to individual output formats.

       plotfont  -T  X, which pops up a window on an X Window System display for
       each character map, checks the DISPLAY environment variable.   Its  value
       determines the display that will be used.

       plotfont  -T  png and plotfont -T gif, which produce output in PNG format
       and pseudo-GIF format respectively, are affected by the  INTERLACE  envi&#8208;
       ronment  variable.  If its value is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be interlaced.
       Also, if the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is set to the name of
       a color, that color will be treated as transparent in the output.

       plotfont  -T  pnm, which produces output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM)
       format, is affected by the PNM_PORTABLE  environment  variable.   If  its
       value is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be in a human-readable format rather than
       binary (the default).

       plotfont  -T  cgm,  which  produces  output  in  CGM  (Computer  Graphics
       Metafile)  format,  is  affected  by the CGM_MAX_VERSION and CGM_ENCODING
       environment variables.  By default, it produces a binary-encoded  version
       of  CGM version 3 format.  For backward compatibility, the version number
       may be reduced by setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.  Irrespective of
       version,  the  output  CGM  file  will  use the human-readable clear text
       encoding if CGM_ENCODING is set to &quot;clear_text&quot;.  However,  only  binary-
       encoded CGM files conform to the WebCGM profile.
&#12;       plotfont -T pcl, which produces PCL 5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers
       and plotters, is affected by the environment variable  PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.
       It should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when producing PCL 5 output for a color printer
       or other color device.  This will ensure accurate color  reproduction  by
       giving  the  output  device  complete freedom in assigning colors, inter&#8208;
       nally, to its &quot;logical pens&quot;.  If it is &quot;no&quot; then the device will  use  a
       fixed set of colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading.  The
       default is &quot;no&quot; because monochrome PCL 5 devices,  which  are  much  more
       common than colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.

       plotfont  -T  hpgl, which produces Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language out&#8208;
       put, is affected by several environment variables.  The most important is
       HPGL_VERSION,  which may be set to &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the default).  &quot;1&quot;
       means that the output should be generic HP-GL, &quot;1.5&quot; means that the  out&#8208;
       put  should  be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and the HP758x,
       HP7595A and HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL  with  some  HP-GL/2  exten&#8208;
       sions),  and  &quot;2&quot; means that the output should be modern HP-GL/2.  If the
       version is &quot;1&quot; or &quot;1.5&quot; then the only  available  fonts  will  be  vector
       fonts,  and  all lines will be drawn with a default width.  Additionally,
       if the version is &quot;1&quot; then the filling of  arbitrary  curves  with  solid
       color  will  not  be  supported  (circles and rectangles aligned with the
       coordinate axes may be filled, though).

       The position of the plotfont -T hpgl graphics display on the page can  be
       rotated  90  degrees counterclockwise by setting the HPGL_ROTATE environ&#8208;
       ment variable to &quot;yes&quot;.  This is not the same as  the  rotation  obtained
       with  the  --rotation  option, since it both rotates the graphics display
       and repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of the  page.
       Besides  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;,
       &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respec&#8208;
       tively.   &quot;180&quot;  and &quot;270&quot; are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; (the
       default).

       By default, plotfont -T hpgl will draw with a fixed set of  pens.   Which
       pens  are  present  may be specified by setting the HPGL_PENS environment
       variable.  If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1&quot;, the  default  value  of  HPGL_PENS  is
       &quot;1=black&quot;;  if  HPGL_VERSION  is  &quot;1.5&quot;  or  &quot;2&quot;,  the  default  value of
       HPGL_PENS  is   &quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
       The  format  should  be  self-explanatory.   By setting HPGL_PENS you may
       specify a color for any pen in the range #1...#31.  All color names  rec&#8208;
       ognized  by  the  X  Window  System  may  be used.  Pen #1 must always be
       present, though it need not  be  black.   Any  other  pen  in  the  range
       #1...#31 may be omitted.

       If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; then plotfont -T hpgl will also be affected by the
       environment variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS.  If its  value  is  &quot;yes&quot;,  then
       plotfont  -T  hpgl  will  not  be  restricted to the palette specified in
       HPGL_PENS: it will assign colors to &quot;logical pens&quot; in the range #1...#31,
       as  needed.   The default value is &quot;no&quot; because other than color LaserJet
       printers and DesignJet plotters,  not  many  HP-GL/2  devices  allow  the
       assignment of colors to logical pens.

       Opaque  filling and the drawing of visible white lines are supported only
       if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; and the environment variable  HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE  is
       &quot;yes&quot;  (the  default).   If  its value is &quot;no&quot; then white lines (if any),
       which are normally drawn with pen #0, will not be drawn.  This feature is
       to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices.  HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example,
       do not support opacity or the use of pen #0 to draw visible white  lines.
       Some  older  HP-GL/2  devices  may, in fact, malfunction if asked to draw
       opaque objects.

       plotfont -T tek, which produces output for a Tektronix terminal or emula&#8208;
       tor,  checks  the  TERM  environment variable.  If the value of TERM is a
       string beginning with &quot;xterm&quot;, &quot;nxterm&quot;, or &quot;kterm&quot;, it  is  taken  as  a
       sign that plotfont is running in an X Window System VT100 terminal emula&#8208;
       tor: a copy of xterm(1), nxterm(1), or kterm(1).  Before  drawing  graph&#8208;
       ics,  plotfont -T tek will emit an escape sequence that causes the termi&#8208;
       nal emulator&apos;s auxiliary Tektronix window, which is normally  hidden,  to
       pop  up.   After  the graphics are drawn, an escape sequence that returns
       control to the original VT100 window will be emitted.  The Tektronix win&#8208;
       dow will remain on the screen.

       If  the value of TERM is a string beginning with &quot;kermit&quot;, &quot;ansi.sys&quot;, or
       &quot;nansi.sys&quot;, it is taken as a sign that plotfont is running in the  VT100
       terminal  emulator  provided  by the MS-DOS version of kermit(1).  Before
       drawing graphics, plotfont -T tek  will  emit  an  escape  sequence  that
       switches the terminal emulator to Tektronix mode.  Also, some of the Tek&#8208;
       tronix control codes emitted by plotfont -T tek will be  kermit-specific.
       There  will  be  a limited amount of color support, which is not normally
       the case (the 16 `ansi.sys&apos; colors will  be  supported).   After  drawing
       graphics,  plotfont  -T tek will emit an escape sequence that returns the
       emulator to VT100 mode.  The key sequence `ALT  minus&apos;  can  be  employed
       manually within kermit to switch between the two modes.
