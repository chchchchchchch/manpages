PLTOTF(1)                                                              PLTOTF(1)



NAME
       pltotf - convert property list files to TeX font metric (tfm) format

SYNOPSIS
       pltotf [-verbose] pl_file_name[.pl] [tfm_file_name[.tfm]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documenta&#8208;
       tion for this version of TeX can be found in  the  info  file  or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The  pltotf program translates a (human-oriented) property list file to a
       (program-oriented) TeX font metric file. Thus, after editing the property
       list file, a TFM file can be generated for use with, for example, tex(1).

       The  pl_file_name  is  extended  with  .pl  if it lacks a suffix. No path
       searching is done.

       If no tfm_file_name is given, the basename of  pl_file_name  with  suffix
       .tfm is used; otherwise tfm_file_name is extended with .tfm if it lacks a
       suffix.

OPTIONS
       Without the -verbose option, pltotf operates silently.  With it, a banner
       and progress report are printed on stdout.
