NAME
       plymouth - A graphical boot system and logger

SYNOPSIS
       plymouth-set-default-theme [options] &lt;theme&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       plymouth  is  a  graphical boot system for Linux which takes advantage of
       the kernel-based mode setting (KMS) available for modern graphic cards to
       provide  a seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It allows to
       choose between various, static or animated graphical themes to spruce  up
       the  startup  and  avoid the noise generated by the vast amount of kernel
       messages while the machine boots into X.  On systems  where  kernel-based
       mode  setting  is  not available, plymouth falls back to a text mode boot
       screen which provides a simple progress bar to  provide  feedback  during
       boot.

       To  configure  plymouth, that is to choose and install the preferred boot
       theme, the user has to invoke plymouth-set-default-theme. It changes  the
       configuration  to the new theme and also performs the necessary regenera&#8208;
       tion of the initial ramdisk (initrd) since plymouth is  loaded  from  the
       boot loader from the initrd prior to the mounting of the root filesystem.
       The options available to this script are explained in the  OPTIONS  para&#8208;
       graph.

       In  order  for  the configured default plymouth theme to be loaded during
       boot, the option `splash&apos; (or `rhgb&apos; for backward compatibility with  the
       RHGB boot splash) must be provided at the kernel command line.  With this
       command line option, plymouth will default to showing detailed boot  out&#8208;
       put.

OPTIONS
       plymouth-set-default-theme  follows  the  usual  GNU command line syntax,
       with long options starting with two dashes (`-&apos;) and  short  variants  of
       each of them.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -l, --list
              List available themes.

       -r, --reset
              Reset to default theme.

       -R, --rebuild-initrd
              Rebuild initrd (necessary after changing theme).

       &lt;theme-name&gt;
              Name  of  new  theme  to  use. If you want to see which themes are
              available, invoke the script with just --list.

       If plymouth-set-default-theme is invoked with no options  or  parameters,
       it  shows the currently selected theme by default. This output is used by
       the helper scripts `plymouth-generate-initrd&apos;  and  `plymouth-update-ini&#8208;
       trd&apos; to set the proper theme in the initial ramdisk.
