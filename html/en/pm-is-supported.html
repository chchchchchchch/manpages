PM-IS-SUPPORTED(1)            pm-utils User Manual            PM-IS-SUPPORTED(1)



NAME
       pm-is-supported - Test whether suspend or hibernate is supported.

SYNOPSIS
       pm-is-supported [{--suspend | --hibernate | --suspend-hybrid}]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pm-is-supported command.

       The intended purpose of pm-is-supported is to find out which power
       management modes are supported by the system. hald(8) will call it to do
       just that. (Note that UPower does not use this.)

OPTIONS
       --suspend
           Test whether suspend is supported. Suspend is a state where most
           devices are shutdown, except for RAM. This state still draws power.

       --hibernate
           Test whether hibernate is supported. During hibernate the state of
           the system is saved to disk, the system is fully powered off.

       --suspend-hybrid
           Test whether hybrid-suspend is supported. Hybrid-suspend is the
           process where first the state of the system is saved to disk -- just
           like with hibernate -- but instead of poweroff, the system goes in
           suspend state, which means it can wakeup quicker than for normal
           hibernation. The advantage over suspend is that you can resume even
           if you run out of power. s2both is a hybrid-suspend implementation.

RETURN VALUE
       The result of the test for a certain powermanagement state is defined by
       the following exit codes.

       ll.  Code Diagnostic T{ 0 T}   T{ State available.  T} T{ 1 T}   T{ State NOT available.  T}
