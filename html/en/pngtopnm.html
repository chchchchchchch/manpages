NAME
       pngtopnm - convert a Portable Network Graphics file into portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pngtopnm [-verbose] [-alpha | -mix] [-background color]
       [-gamma value] [-text file] [-time] [pngfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  Portable Network Graphics as input.  Produces a portable anymap
       as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input  file  -  if
       it&apos;s  black  &amp; white, a pbm file is written, else if it&apos;s grayscale a pgm
       file, else a ppm file.

OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Display the format of the input file and the type  of  the  output
              file.  If  the  chunks are part of the png-file, the alpha, trans&#8208;
              parency and gamma-values will be indicated.

       -alpha Output the alpha channel or transparency mask of  the  image.  The
              result is either a pbm file or pgm file, depending on whether dif&#8208;
              ferent levels of transparency appear.

       -mix   Compose the image with the transparency or alpha  mask  against  a
              the background. When a background chunk is available that color is
              taken, else black will do.

       -background color
              If no background color chunck is present in the png-file, or  when
              another  color  is  required this parameter can be used to set the
              background color of images. This is especially useful  for  alpha-
              channel  images  or those with transparency chunks. The format, to
              specify  the  color  in,  is  either  (in  the  case  of   orange)
              &quot;1.0,0.5,0.0&quot;,  where  the values are floats between zero and one,
              or with the syntax &quot;#RGB&quot;, &quot;#RRGGBB&quot; or &quot;#RRRRGGGGBBBB&quot; where R, G
              and B are hexa-decimal numbers.

       -gamma value
              Converts the image to a new display-gamma value. When a gAMA chunk
              is present in the png-file, the image-gamma value  will  be  used.
              When  not,  the  image-gamma is considered to be 1.0. Based on the
              image-gamma and the display-gamma given with this option the  col&#8208;
              ors written to the pnm-file will be adjusted.
              Because  the  gamma&apos;s  of  uncompensated  monitors are around 2.6,
              which results in an image-gamma of 0.45, some  typical  situations
              are:  when the image-gamma is 0.45 (use -verbose to check) and the
              picture is too light, your system is gamma-corrected,  so  convert
              with  &quot;-gamma  1.0&quot;.   When no gAMA chunk is present or the image-
              gamma is 1.0, use 2.2 to make the picture lighter and 0.45 to make
              the picture darker.

       -text file
              Writes  the  tEXt  and  zTXt  chunks  to  a  file,  in a format as
              described in the pnmtopng man-page.   These  chunks  contain  text
              comments or annotations.

       -time  Prints the tIME chunk to stderr.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

SEE ALSO
       pnmtopng(1), ptot(1), pnmgamma(1), pnm(5)
&#12;NOTE
       Instead  of  pngtopnm|pnmtoxxx,  a  specific converter should be used, if
       available. E.g.  ptot (PNG to TIFF conversion), etc.

BUGS
       There could be an option to read  the  comment  text  from  pnm  comments
       instead of a separate file.

       The program could be much faster, with a bit of code optimizing.
