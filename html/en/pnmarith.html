pnmarith(1)                                                          pnmarith(1)



NAME
       pnmarith - perform arithmetic on two portable anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmarith   -add|-subtract|-multiply|-difference|-minimum|-maximum.   pnm&#8208;
       file1 pnmfile2

DESCRIPTION
       Reads two portable anymaps as input.  Performs the  specified  arithmetic
       operation,  and  produces  a  portable  anymap  as output.  The two input
       anymaps must be the same width and height.

       The arithmetic is performed  between  corresponding  pixels  in  the  two
       anymaps,  as  if  maxval  was  1.0,  black was 0.0, and a linear scale in
       between.  Results that fall outside of [0..1) are truncated.

       The operator -difference calculates the absolute value of pnmarith  -sub&#8208;
       tract pnmfile1 pnmfile2, i.e. no truncation is done.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
