NAME
       pnmcolormap - create quantization color map for a portable anymap


SYNOPSIS
       pnmcolormap [-center|-meancolor|-meanpixel] [-spreadbrightness|-spreadlu&#8208;
       minosity] [-sort] [-square] ncolors|all [pnmfile]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You  may
       use  two  hyphens  instead  of  one  to designate an option.  You may use
       either white space or an equals sign  between  an  option  name  and  its
       value.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PNM image as input.  Chooses ncolors colors to best represent the
       image, maps the existing colors to the new ones, and writes a  PNM  color
       map defining them as output.

       You  can  use  this  map  as input to pnmremap on the same input image to
       quantize the colors in that image, I.e.  produce  a  similar  image  with
       fewer  colors.  pnmquant does both the pnmcolormap and pnmremap steps for
       you.

       A PNM colormap is a PNM image of any dimensions that  contains  at  least
       one pixel of each color in the set of colors it represents.

       The  quantization  method  is  Heckbert&apos;s  &quot;median cut&quot;.  See the section
       QUANTIZATION METHOD.

       If the input image is a PPM, the output image is a  PPM.   If  the  input
       image  is  a  PBM or PGM, the output colormap is a PGM.  Note that a col&#8208;
       ormap of a PBM image is not very interesting.

       The colormap generally has the same maxval as the input image,  but  pnm&#8208;
       colormap may reduce it if there are too many colors in the input, as part
       of its quantization algorithm.

       If you want to create a colormap without basing it on the  colors  in  an
       input image, see ppmcolors.


PARAMETERS
       The single parameter, which is required, is the number of colors you want
       in the output  colormap.   pnmcolormap  may  produce  a  color  map  with
       slightly  fewer  colors than that.  You may specify all to get a colormap
       of every color in the input image (no quantization).


       OPTIONS

       -sort  This option causes the output colormap to be  sorted  by  the  red
              component  intensity,  then  the green, then the blue in ascending
              order.  This is an insertion sort, so it is not very fast on large
              colormaps.  Sorting is useful because it allows you to compare two
              sets of colors.

       -square
              By default, pnmcolormap produces as the color map a PPM image with
              one  row  and  one  column  for  each color in the colormap.  This
              option causes pnmcolormap instead to produce a PPM image  that  is
              within  one row or column of being square, with multiple pixels of
              the same color as necessary to create a number of pixels which  is
              a perfect square.

       -verbose
              This  option  causes  pnmcolormap  to display messages to Standard
              Error about the quantization.

       -center

       -meancolor

       -meanpixel

       -spreadbrightness

       -spreadluminosity
              These options control the quantization algorithm.   See  QUANTIZA&#8208;
              TION METHOD below.



QUANTIZATION METHOD
       A  quantization  method  is  a way to choose which colors, being fewer in
       number than in the input, you want in the output.  pnmcolormap uses Heck&#8208;
       bert&apos;s &quot;median cut&quot; quantization method.

       This method involves separating all the colors into &quot;boxes,&quot; each holding
       colors that represent about the same number of pixels.   You  start  with
       one  box  and split boxes in two until the number of boxes is the same as
       the number of colors you want in the output, and choose one color to rep&#8208;
       resent each box.

       When you split a box, you do it so that all the colors in one sub-box are
       &quot;greater&quot; than all the colors in the other.  &quot;Greater,&quot; for a  particular
       box, means it is brighter in the color component (red, green, blue) which
       has the largest spread in that box.  pnmcolormap gives you  two  ways  to
       define  &quot;largest  spread.&quot;:   1) largest spread of brightness; 2) largest
       spread of contribution to the luminosity  of  the  color.   E.g.  red  is
       weighted much more than blue.  Select among these with the -spreadbright&#8208;
       ness and -spreadluminosity options.  The default is -spreadbrightness.

       pnmcut provides three ways of choosing a color to represent a box: 1) the
       center color - the color halfway between the greatest and least colors in
       the box, using the above definition of &quot;greater&quot;; 2) the mean of the col&#8208;
       ors (each component averaged separately by brightness) in the box; 3) the
       mean weighted by the number of pixels of a color in the image.

       Note that in all three methods, there may be colors in the  output  which
       do not appear in the input at all.

       Select  among these with the -center, -meancolor, and -meanpixel options.
       The default is -center.
