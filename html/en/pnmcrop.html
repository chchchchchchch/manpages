pnmcrop(1)                                                            pnmcrop(1)



NAME
       pnmcrop - crop a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmcrop  [-white|-black|-sides]  [-left]  [-right] [-top] [-bottom] [pnm&#8208;
       file]

       All options may be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix or  speci&#8208;
       fied with double hyphens.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  PBM,  PGM, or PPM image as input.  Removes borders that are the
       background color, and produces the same type of image as output.

       If you don&apos;t specify otherwise, pnmcrop assumes the background  color  is
       whatever  color  the  top  left and right corners of the image are and if
       they are different colors, something midway between them.  You can  spec&#8208;
       ify  that  the  background  is  white or black with the -white and -black
       options or make pnmcrop base its guess on all  four  corners  instead  of
       just two with -sides.

       By default, pnmcrop chops off any stripe of background color it finds, on
       all four sides.  You can tell pnmcrop to  remove  only  specific  borders
       with the -left, -right, -top, and -bottom options.

       If  you want to chop a specific amount off the side of an image, use pnm&#8208;
       cut.

       If you want to add different borders after removing  the  existing  ones,
       use pnmcat or pnmcomp.


OPTIONS
       -white Take  white  to  be the background color.  pnmcrop removes borders
              which are white.

       -black Take black to be the background color.   pnmcrop  removes  borders
              which are black.

       -sides Determine the background color from the colors of the four corners
              of the input image.  pnmcrop removes  borders  which  are  of  the
              background color.

              If  at least three of the four corners are the same color, pnmcrop
              takes that as the background color.  If not, pnmcrop looks for two
              corners of the same color in the following order, taking the first
              found as the background color: top, left, right, bottom.   If  all
              four  corners  are different colors, pnmcrop assumes an average of
              the four colors as the background color.

              The -sides option slows pnmcrop down, as it reads the entire image
              to  determine  the background color in addition to the up to three
              times that it would read it without -sides.


       -left  Remove any left border.

       -right Remove any right border.

       -top   Remove any top border.
&#12;       -bottom
              Remove any bottom border.

       -verbose
              Print on Standard Error information about the processing,  includ&#8208;
              ing exactly how much is being cropped off of which sides.
