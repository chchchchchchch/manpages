pnmenlarge(1)                                                      pnmenlarge(1)



NAME
       pnmenlarge - read a portable anymap and enlarge it N times

SYNOPSIS
       pnmenlarge N [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  anymap  as input.  Replicates its pixels N times, and
       produces a portable anymap as output.

       pnmenlarge can only enlarge by integer factors.  The slower but more gen&#8208;
       eral  pnmscale  can enlarge or reduce by arbitrary factors, and pbmreduce
       can reduce by integer factors, but only for bitmaps.

       If you enlarge by a factor of 3  or  more,  you  should  probably  add  a
       pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the original pixels in the result&#8208;
       ing image.
