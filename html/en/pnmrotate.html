NAME
       pnmrotate - rotate a portable anymap by some angle

SYNOPSIS
       pnmrotate [-noantialias] angle [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable anymap as input.  Rotates it by the specified angle and
       produces a portable anymap as output.  If the input file is in color, the
       output  will  be  too,  otherwise  it will be grayscale.  The angle is in
       degrees (floating point), measured counter-clockwise.  It  can  be  nega&#8208;
       tive,  but  it should be between -90 and 90.  Also, for rotations greater
       than 45 degrees you may get better results if you first use pnmflip to do
       a  90  degree  rotation  and then pnmrotate less than 45 degrees back the
       other direction

       The rotation algorithm is Alan Paeth&apos;s three-shear method.  Each shear is
       implemented  by looping over the source pixels and distributing fractions
       to each of the destination pixels.  This has an &quot;anti-aliasing&quot; effect  -
       it  avoids  jagged  edges  and similar artifacts.  However, it also means
       that the original colors or gray levels in the image  are  modified.   If
       you need to keep precisely the same set of colors, you can use the -noan&#8208;
       tialias flag.  This does the shearing by moving pixels  without  changing
       their values.  If you want anti-aliasing and don&apos;t care about the precise
       colors, but still need a limited *number* of  colors,  you  can  run  the
       result through ppmquant.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
