NAME
       pnmscalefixed - scale a portable anymap quickly, but less accurate


DESCRIPTION
       pnmscalefixed  is  the  same  thing as pnmscale except that it uses fixed
       point arithmetic internally instead of floating point, which makes it run
       faster.  In turn, it is less accurate and may distort the image.

       Use  the  pnmscale  man  page  with  pnmscalefixed.   This  man page only
       describes the difference.

       pnmscalefixed uses fixed point 12 bit arithmetic.  By contrast,  pnmscale
       uses  floating point arithmetic which on most machines is probably 24 bit
       precision.  This makes pnmscalefixed run faster (30% faster in one exper&#8208;
       iment), but the imprecision can cause distortions at the right and bottom
       edges.

       The distortion takes the following form: One pixel from the edge  of  the
       input  is rendered larger in the output than the scaling factor requires.
       Consequently, the rest of the image is smaller than  the  scaling  factor
       requires,  because  the  overall  dimensions  of  the image are always as
       requested.  This distortion will usually be very hard to see.

       pnmscalefixed with the -verbose option  tells  you  how  much  distortion
       there is.

       The  amount  of distortion depends on the size of the input image and how
       close the scaling factor is to an integral 1/4096th.

       If the scaling factor is an exact multiple of 1/4096, there is no distor&#8208;
       tion.  So, for example doubling or halving an image causes no distortion.
       But reducing it or enlarging it by a third would cause  some  distortion.
       To  consider  an extreme case, scaling a 100,000 row image down to 50,022
       rows would create an output image with all of the input squeezed into the
       top  50,000 rows, and the last row of the input copied into the bottom 22
       rows of output.

       pnmscalefixed could probably be modified to use 16 bit or  better  arith&#8208;
       metic  without losing anything.  The modification would consist of a sin&#8208;
       gle constant in the source code.  Until there is a demonstrated need  for
       that,  though,  the  Netpbm  maintainer  wants to keep the safety cushion
       afforded by the original 12 bit precision.


       pnmscalefixed does not have pnmscale &apos;s -nomix option.
