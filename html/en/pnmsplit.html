NAME
       pnmsplit - split a multi-image portable anymap into multiple single-image
       files

SYNOPSIS
       pnmsplit [pnmfile[ output_file_pattern]]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Netpbm file as input.  Copies each image in the input into a sep&#8208;
       arate file, in the same format.

       pnmfile  is  the  file  specification of the input file, or - to indicate
       Standard Input.  The default is Standard Input.

       output_file_pattern tells how to name the output files.  It is  the  file
       specification of the output file, except that the first occurence of &quot;%d&quot;
       in it is replaced by the image sequence number in unpadded ASCII decimal,
       with  the  sequence  starting  at 0.  If there is no &quot;%d&quot; in the pattern,
       pnmsplit fails.

       The default output file pattern is &quot;image%d&quot;.

       Note that to do the reverse operation  (combining  multiple  single-image
       PNM  files  into  a multi-image one), there is no special Netpbm program.
       Just use cat.
