NAME
       pnmtofits - convert a portable anymap into FITS format

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtofits [-max f] [-min f] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Produces a FITS (Flexible Image Trans&#8208;
       port System) file as output.  The resolution of the output file is either
       8  bits/pixel,  or 16 bits/pixel, depending on the value of maxval in the
       input file.  If the input  file  is  a  portable  bitmap  or  a  portable
       graymap, the output file consists of a single plane image (NAXIS = 2). If
       instead the input file is a portable pixmap, the output file will consist
       of  a  three-plane  image (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).  A full description of
       the FITS format can be  found  in  Astronomy  &amp;  Astrophysics  Supplement
       Series 44 (1981), page 363.

OPTIONS
       Flags -min and -max can be used to set DATAMAX, DATAMIN, BSCALE and BZERO
       in the FITS header, but do not cause the data to be rescaled.

BUGS
       FITS uses signed data, and this program outputs unsigned values.  If  you
       run into this problem, you might use &quot;-min 32768&quot;.
