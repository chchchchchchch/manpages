PO2DEBCONF(1)                      po-debconf                      PO2DEBCONF(1)



NAME
       po2debconf - merge master templates file and PO files

SYNOPSIS
       po2debconf [-v] [-h] [--podir=DIR] [-o FILE] [-e STRING] master

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads all PO files and a single templates file, and produces
       a Debconf templates file containing all translations, similar to the one
       produced by debconf-mergetemplate(1) (from the &quot;debconf-utils&quot; package).
       PO files are by default searched in the po subdirectory below the
       location of the master file.

       To help the language code transition for Norwegian Bokm&#195;&#165;l, the no and nb
       language codes are handled specially.  If no.po exists, it should be
       renamed to nb.po.  Using nb.po will make both &quot;-no&quot; and &quot;-nb&quot;
       translations available in the templates file.

       Lines beginning with a number sign (&quot;#&quot;) are comments in templates files.
       They are useful to give hints to translators, and are discarded by
       po2debconf.  Special comments have been introduced in &quot;po-debconf&quot; 1.0.
       They are in the form &quot;#flag:directive&quot;.  The &quot;#flag:partial&quot; is the only
       directive interpreted by po2debconf.  Normally when a field is composed
       of several paragraphs (like &quot;__Choices&quot; and &quot;_Description&quot;), it is
       translated if all paragraphs are translated.  When a field contains
       &quot;#flag:partial&quot;, translated strings may be mixed with untranslated
       strings.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display a usage summary and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           Process in verbose mode.

       --podir=DIR
           Set directory for PO files.  Default is to search PO files in the po
           subdirectory below the location of the master file.

       -o, --output=FILE
           Set output filename (default is standard output).

       -e, --encoding=STRING
           Convert encoding.  Argument can take 3 values: &quot;utf8&quot; (convert to
           UTF-8), &quot;po&quot; (do not change encoding) and &quot;popular&quot; (convert encoding
           of input files depending on their language; the &quot;PODEBCONF_ENCODINGS&quot;
           environment variable must point to a name of a file containing the
           encoding map).

           Such a filename looks like:

             #
             #   Number is comment sign
             #
             cs       ISO-8859-2
             da       ISO-8859-1
             de       ISO-8859-1
             el       ISO-8859-7

           etc.

           Default encoding used to be &quot;popular&quot;, and has been switched to
           &quot;utf8&quot; since po-debconf 0.9.0.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Since debconf 1.2.0, templates format has changed, encoding is part of
       field names, i.e. they are &quot;foo-lang.encoding&quot;.  When older debconf
       encounter such fields, they are silently ignored, which means that
       original text is displayed.

       If present, a po/output file can override defaults for encoding and
       output format.  It contains a single line with two fields. The first
       field is the output format (currently valid values are 1 for fields in
       the form &quot;foo-lang&quot;, and 2 for &quot;foo-lang.encoding&quot;) and the second field
       is the encoding, e.g.

          echo &apos;2 utf8&apos; &gt; po/output

       let po2debconf convert text to UTF-8.

       When encoding is set to &quot;po&quot; or &quot;utf8&quot;, output format is always set to 2,
       so that older debconf do not try to display text with wrong encodings.
