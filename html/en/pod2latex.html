POD2LATEX(1)            Perl Programmers Reference Guide            POD2LATEX(1)



NAME
       pod2latex - convert pod documentation to latex format

SYNOPSIS
         pod2latex *.pm

         pod2latex -out mytex.tex *.pod

         pod2latex -full -sections &apos;DESCRIPTION|NAME&apos; SomeDir

         pod2latex -prefile h.tex -postfile t.tex my.pod

DESCRIPTION
       &quot;pod2latex&quot; is a program to convert POD format documentation (perlpod)
       into latex. It can process multiple input documents at a time and either
       generate a latex file per input document or a single combined output
       file.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum
       matching is supported.

       -out
           Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input pods
           it is assumed that the intention is to write all translated output
           into a single file. &quot;.tex&quot; is appended if not present.  If the
           argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for each
           input file.

       -full
           Creates a complete &quot;latex&quot; file that can be processed immediately
           (unless &quot;=for/=begin&quot; directives are used that rely on extra
           packages).  Table of contents and index generation commands are
           included in the wrapper &quot;latex&quot; code.

       -sections
           Specify pod sections to include (or remove if negated) in the
           translation.  See &quot;SECTION SPECIFICATIONS&quot; in Pod::Select for the
           format to use for section-spec. This option may be given multiple
           times on the command line.This is identical to the similar option in
           the &quot;podselect()&quot; command.

       -modify
           This option causes the output &quot;latex&quot; to be slightly modified from
           the input pod such that when a &quot;=head1 NAME&quot; is encountered a section
           is created containing the actual pod name (rather than NAME) and all
           subsequent &quot;=head1&quot; directives are treated as subsections. This has
           the advantage that the description of a module will be in its own
           section which is helpful for including module descriptions in
           documentation.  Also forces &quot;latex&quot; label and index entries to be
           prefixed by the name of the module.

       -h1level
           Specifies the &quot;latex&quot; section that is equivalent to a &quot;H1&quot; pod
           directive. This is an integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a
           &quot;latex&quot; chapter, 1 equivalent to a &quot;latex&quot; section etc. The default
           is 1 (&quot;H1&quot; equivalent to a latex section).

       -help
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       -man
           Print the manual page and exit.
&#12;       -verbose
           Print information messages as each document is processed.

       -preamble
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by &quot;\n&quot;.  See -prefile for
           reading the preamble from a file.

       -postamble
           A user supplied postamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by &quot;\n&quot;.  See -postfile for
           reading the postamble from a file.

       -prefile
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the named
           file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order. See
           -preamble.

       -postfile
           A user-supplied postamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the
           named file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order. See
           -postamble.

BUGS
       Known bugs are:

       &#183;   Cross references between documents are not resolved when multiple pod
           documents are converted into a single output &quot;latex&quot; file.

       &#183;   Functions and variables are not automatically recognized and they
           will therefore not be marked up in any special way unless instructed
           by an explicit pod command.
