DESCRIPTION
       pod2man is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
       from POD source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
       terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using troff(1).

       input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
       code).  If input isn&apos;t given, it defaults to &quot;STDIN&quot;.  output, if given,
       is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If output isn&apos;t
       given, the formatted output is written to &quot;STDOUT&quot;.  Several POD files
       can be processed in the same pod2man invocation (saving module load and
       compile times) by providing multiple pairs of input and output files on
       the command line.

       --section, --release, --center, --date, and --official can be used to set
       the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will assume
       various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.

       pod2man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named
       &quot;CW&quot;.  If yours is called something else (like &quot;CR&quot;), use --fixed to
       specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for printing.
       Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic
       fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
       takes care of formatting func(), func(n), and simple variable references
       like $foo or @bar so you don&apos;t have to use code escapes for them; complex
       expressions like $fred{&apos;stuff&apos;} will still need to be escaped, though.
       It also translates dashes that aren&apos;t used as hyphens into en dashes,
       makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes &quot;paired
       quotes,&quot; and takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See
       Pod::Man for complete information.

OPTIONS
       -c string, --center=string
           Sets the centered page header to string.  The default is &quot;User
           Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;, but also see --official below.

       -d string, --date=string
           Set the left-hand footer string to this value.  By default, the
           modification date of the input file will be used, or the current date
           if input comes from &quot;STDIN&quot;.

       --fixed=font
           The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
           &quot;CW&quot;.  Some systems may want &quot;CR&quot; instead.  Only matters for troff(1)
           output.

       --fixedbold=font
           Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to &quot;CB&quot;.  Only
           matters for troff(1) output.

       --fixeditalic=font
           Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a
           misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version,
           not an italic version).  Defaults to &quot;CI&quot;.  Only matters for troff(1)
           output.

       --fixedbolditalic=font
           Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width
           font.  Pod::Man doesn&apos;t assume you have this, and defaults to &quot;CB&quot;.
           Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as &quot;CX&quot;.
           Only matters for troff(1) output.

       -h, --help
           Print out usage information.

       -l, --lax
           No longer used.  pod2man used to check its input for validity as a
           manual page, but this should now be done by podchecker(1) instead.
           Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does
           anything.

       -n name, --name=name
           Set the name of the manual page to name.  Without this option, the
           manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being
           converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is
           parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like
           &quot;.../lib/Pod/Man.pm&quot; is converted into a name like &quot;Pod::Man&quot;.  This
           option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the name.

           Note that this option is probably not useful when converting multiple
           POD files at once.  The convention for Unix man pages for commands is
           for the man page title to be in all-uppercase even if the command
           isn&apos;t.

       -o, --official
           Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the
           standard Perl release, if --center is not also given.

       -q quotes, --quotes=quotes
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text to quotes.  If quotes
           is a single character, it is used as both the left and right quote;
           if quotes is two characters, the first character is used as the left
           quote and the second as the right quoted; and if quotes is four
           characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second
           two as the right quote.

           quotes may also be set to the special value &quot;none&quot;, in which case no
           quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed
           for troff output).

       -r, --release
           Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you
           run pod2man under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that
           the centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend
           something like &quot;Last modified: &quot;; if this is the case, you may want
           to set --release to the last modified date and --date to the version
           number.

       -s, --section
           Set the section for the &quot;.TH&quot; macro.  The standard section numbering
           convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
           functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
           miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There
           is a lot of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use
           4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for
           devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.
           About the only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2,
           and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in &quot;.pm&quot;, in
           which case section 3 will be selected.

       --stderr
           By default, pod2man puts any errors detected in the POD input in a
           POD ERRORS section in the output manual page.  If --stderr is given,
           errors are sent to standard error instead and the POD ERRORS section
           is suppressed.

       -u, --utf8
           By default, pod2man produces the most conservative possible *roff
           output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different
           *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot
           handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters
           are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create
           a properly accented character (at least for troff output) or to &quot;X&quot;.

           This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If your
           *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to
           use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII
           characters.  However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8
           characters is not supported by many implementations and may even
           result in segfaults and other bad behavior.

           Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD
           source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin-1.
           POD input without an &quot;=encoding&quot; command will be assumed to be in
           Latin-1, and if it&apos;s actually in UTF-8, the output will be double-
           encoded.  See perlpod(1) for more information on the &quot;=encoding&quot;
           command.

       -v, --verbose
           Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If pod2man fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for
       information about what those errors might mean.

EXAMPLES
           pod2man program &gt; program.1
           pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3
           pod2man --section=7 note.pod &gt; note.7

       If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you
       probably want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page
       numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of man(7).

           troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

       To get index entries on &quot;STDERR&quot;, turn on the F register, as in:

           troff -man -rF1 perl.1

       The indexing merely outputs messages via &quot;.tm&quot; for each major page,
       section, subsection, item, and any &quot;X&lt;&gt;&quot; directives.  See Pod::Man for
       more details.

BUGS
       Lots of this documentation is duplicated from Pod::Man.
