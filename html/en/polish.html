POLISH(5)                            Debian                            POLISH(5)



NAME
       polish - a list of Polish words

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/share/dict/polish is an ASCII file which contains an alphabetic list
       of words, one per line.

FILES
       /etc/dictionaries-common/words    is    a    symbolic    link    to     a
       /usr/share/dict/&lt;language&gt;  file.   /usr/share/dict/words  is  a symbolic
       link to /etc/dictionaries-common/words, and is the name  by  which  other
       software    should    refer    to    the    system    word   list.    See
       select-default-wordlist(8) for more information.

       The directory /usr/share/dict can contain word lists for many  languages,
       with  name  of  the language in English, e.g., /usr/share/dict/french and
       /usr/share/dict/danish contain respectively lists of  French  and  Danish
       words  if they exist.  Such lists should be coded using the UTF-8 charac&#8208;
       ter set encoding.

SEE ALSO
       ispell(1), select-default-wordlist(8), and the Filesystem Hierarchy Stan&#8208;
       dard.

HISTORY
       The words lists are not specific, and may be generated from any number of
       sources.

       The system word list used  to  be  /usr/dict/words.   For  compatibility,
       software  should  check  that  location if /usr/share/dict/words does not
       exist.

AUTHOR
       Word lists are collected and maintained by various authors.
