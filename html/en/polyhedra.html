NAME
       polyhedra - draws the 80 uniform polyhedra and their duals

SYNOPSIS
SYNOPSIS
       polyhedra   [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual  visual]  [-window]
       [-root] [-delay number] [-speed float] [-duration  seconds]  [-no-wander]
       [-spin XYZ] [-wireframe] [-no-titles] [-which name] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program renders 160 different 3D solids, and displays some informa&#8208;
       tion about each.  A new solid is chosen every few seconds.

       There are 75 uniform polyhedra, plus an inifinite number  of  prisms  and
       antiprisms:

         * Convex Uniform Polyhedra:
           * Platonic solids (5)
           * Archimedean solids (13)
           * Convex prisms and antiprisms (2 infinite families)
         * Nonconvex Uniform Polyhedra:
           * Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra (4)
           * Nonconvex uniform polyhedra (53)
           * Nonconvex prisms, antiprisms, and crossed antiprisms
             (3 infinite families)

       Representative  samples  of the prism sets brings the total to 80 solids.
       Including the dual of each brings the total up to 160.   (To  create  the
       &quot;dual&quot;  of  a  polyhedron, faces are replaced with vertices, and vertices
       with faces.)

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  30000  (0.03  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -speed number
               Larger numbers mean run faster.  Default: 1.0.

       -duration seconds
               How  long  before switching to a new polyhedron.  Default 12 sec&#8208;
               onds.

       -wander | -no-wander
               Whether the objects should wander around the screen.

       -spin [XYZ] | -no-spin
               Which axes, if any, to spin around on.

       -titles | -no-titles
               Whether to display text describing each object.

       -which object-name
               Display only one particular object, identified by  number,  name,
               or Whthoff symbol.

       -wireframe | -no-wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

KEY BINDINGS
       When  running  in  a  window,  you  can rotate the object with the mouse.
       Also, the following keystrokes are defined:

       SPC or TAB  Select a new polyhedron at random.

       + or &gt;      Select the next-higher-numbered polyhedron.

       - or &lt;      Select the next-lower-numbered polyhedron.

       ESC or ^C   Quit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
