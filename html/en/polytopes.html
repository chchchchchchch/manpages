DESCRIPTION
       The polytopes program shows one of the six regular 4d polytopes  (5-cell,
       8-cell,  16-cell,  24-cell,  120-cell,  or 600-cell) rotating in 4d.  The
       program projects the 4d polytope to 3d using either a perspective  or  an
       orthographic projection.  The projected 3d polytope can then be projected
       to the screen either perspectively or orthographically.  There are  three
       display  modes for the polytope: mesh (wireframe), solid, or transparent.
       Furthermore, the colors with which the polytope is drawn can  be  set  to
       either  single  color or to a coloring according to the 4d &quot;depth&quot; (the w
       coordinate) of the polytope in its  unrotated  position.   In  the  first
       case,  the  polytope is drawn in red.  This coloring combined with trans&#8208;
       parency gives a nice visual effect of the structure of the polytope.  The
       second  mode  draws  the  polytope  with a fully saturated color wheel in
       which the edges or  faces  are  colored  accoring  to  their  average  4d
       &quot;depth&quot;.   This  mode  is best combined with the wireframe mode, where it
       allows you to see how different parts of the polytope are  moved  to  the
       &quot;inside&quot;  of  the  projected polytope in 3d.  Of course, in 4d the cells,
       faces, and edges of the polytope all have the same distance from the cen&#8208;
       ter  of  the  polytope.   Only the projection creates the appearance that
       some of the cells lie &quot;inside&quot; the figure in 3d.

OPTIONS
       polytopes accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -delay microseconds
               How much of a delay should be introduced  between  steps  of  the
               animation.  Default 25000, or 1/40th second.

       The  following  six options are mutually exclusive.  They determine which
       polytope is displayed.

       -5-cell Display the 5-cell.  The 5-cell is the 4d analogon of  a  regular
               tetrahedron  in 3d.  It has 5 regular tetrahedra as its cells, 10
               equilateral triangles as faces, 10 edges, and 5 vertices.

       -8-cell Display the 8-cell (a.k.a. hypercube or tessaract).   The  8-cell
               is the 4d analogon of a cube in 3d.  It has 8 cubes as its cells,
               24 squares as faces, 32 edges, and 16 vertices.
&#12;       -16-cell

               hedron  in  3d.   It  has  16 regular tetrahedra as its cells, 32
               equilateral triangles as faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices.

       -24-cell
               Display the 24-cell.  The 24-cell has no 3d analogon.  It has  24
               regular  octahedra  as  its  cells,  96  equilateral triangles as
               faces, 96 edges, and 24 vertices.

       -120-cell
               Display the 120-cell.  The 120-cell has no 3d analogon.   It  has
               120  regular  dodecahedra  as its cells, 720 regular pentagons as
               faces, 1200 edges, and 600 vertices.

       -600-cell
               Display the 600-cell.  The 600-cell has no 3d analogon.   It  has
               600  regular  tetrahedra as its cells, 1200 equilateral triangles
               as faces, 720 edges, and 120 vertices.

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They  determine  how
       the polytope is displayed.

       -wireframe
               Display the polytope as a wireframe mesh.

       -surface
               Display the polytope as a solid object.

       -transparent
               Display the polytope as a transparent object (default).

       The  following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how to
       color the polytope.

       -single-color
               Display the polytope in red.

       -depth-colors
               Display the polytope with a fully saturated color wheel in  which
               the  edges  or  faces  are  colored  accoring to their average 4d
               &quot;depth&quot;, i.e., the w coordinate of the polytope in its  unrotated
               position (default).

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the
       polytope is projected from 3d to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       -perspective-3d
               Project the polytope from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection
               (default).

       -orthographic-3d
               Project  the polytope from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projec&#8208;
               tion.

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the
       polytope is projected from 4d to 3d.

       -perspective-4d
               Project the polytope from 4d to 3d using a perspective projection
               (default).

       -orthographic-4d
               Project the polytope from 4d to 3d using an orthographic  projec&#8208;
               tion.
&#12;       The  following  six  options determine the rotation speed of the polytope
       around the six possible hyperplanes.  The rotation speed is  measured  in
       degrees  per frame.  The speeds should be set to relatively small values,
       e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.

       -speed-wx float
               Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).

       -speed-wy float
               Rotation speed around the wy plane (default: 1.3).

       -speed-wz float
               Rotation speed around the wz plane (default: 1.5).

       -speed-xy float
               Rotation speed around the xy plane (default: 1.7).

       -speed-xz float
               Rotation speed around the xz plane (default: 1.9).

       -speed-yz float
               Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).

INTERACTION
       If you run this program in standalone mode you can rotate the polytope by
       dragging  the  mouse  while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates
       the polytope in 3D, i.e., around the wx, wy, and wz planes.  If you press
       the  shift  key while dragging the mouse with the left button pressed the
       polytope is rotated in 4D, i.e., around the xy, xz, and  yz  planes.   To
       examine  the polytope at your leisure, it is best to set all speeds to 0.
       Otherwise, the polytope will rotate while the left mouse  button  is  not
       pressed.   -fps  Display  the  current  frame rate, CPU load, and polygon
       count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
