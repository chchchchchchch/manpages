DESCRIPTION
       The  popt library exists essentially for parsing command-line options. It
       is found superior in many ways when compared to parsing the argv array by
       hand  or  using  the  getopt  functions  getopt()  and getopt_long() [see
       getopt(3)].  Some specific advantages of popt are: it  does  not  utilize
       global  variables, thus enabling multiple passes in parsing argv ; it can
       parse an arbitrary array of argv-style elements, allowing parsing of com&#8208;
       mand-line-strings  from  any  source;  it  provides  a standard method of
       option aliasing (to be discussed at length below.); it can exec  external
       option  filters;  and,  finally,  it  can automatically generate help and
       usage messages for the application.

       Like getopt_long(), the  popt  library  supports  short  and  long  style
       options.   Recall  that a short option consists of a - character followed
       by a single alphanumeric character.  A long option, common in GNU  utili&#8208;
       ties,  consists  of two - characters followed by a string made up of let&#8208;
       ters, numbers and hyphens.  Long options are optionally allowed to  begin
       with  a  single  -, primarily to allow command-line compatibility between
       popt applications and X toolkit applications.  Either type of option  may
       be  followed  by  an argument.  A space separates a short option from its
       arguments; either a space or an = separates a long option from  an  argu&#8208;
       ment.

       The  popt  library  is highly portable and should work on any POSIX plat&#8208;
       form.  The latest version is distributed with rpm and is always available
       from: ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist.

       It  may  be  redistributed  under  the X consortium license, see the file
       COPYING in the popt source distribution for details.

BASIC POPT USAGE
   1. THE OPTION TABLE
       Applications provide popt with information on their command-line  options
       by means of an &quot;option table,&quot; i.e., an array of struct poptOption struc&#8208;
       tures:

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;

       struct poptOption {
           const char * longName; /* may be NULL */
           char shortName;        /* may be &apos;\0&apos; */
           int argInfo;
           void * arg;            /* depends on argInfo */
           int val;               /* 0 means don&apos;t return, just update flag */
           char * descrip;        /* description for autohelp -- may be NULL */
           char * argDescrip;     /* argument description for autohelp */
       };

       Each member of the table defines a single option that may  be  passed  to
       the  program.  Long and short options are considered a single option that
       may occur in two different forms.  The first two  members,  longName  and
       shortName,  define  the  names  of  the option; the first is a long name,
       while the latter is a single character.

       The argInfo member tells popt what type of argument is expected after the
       option.   If  no argument is expected, POPT_ARG_NONE should be used.  The
       rest of the valid values are shown in the following table:


       lfB   lfB   lfB   lfB   lfR   lfR.    Value     Description    arg   Type
       POPT_ARG_NONE  No   argument  expected  int  POPT_ARG_STRING     No  type
       checking to be performed    char * POPT_ARG_ARGV  No type checking to  be
       performed   char  **  POPT_ARG_SHORT An  short argument is expected short
       POPT_ARG_INT   An integer argument is expected  int POPT_ARG_LONG  A long
       integer  is  expected     long POPT_ARG_LONGLONG   A long long integer is
       expected    long long POPT_ARG_VAL   Integer value  taken  from  val  int
       POPT_ARG_FLOAT An   float  argument  is  expected    float  POPT_ARG_DOU&#8208;
       BLE     A double argument is expected    double

       For numeric values, if the argInfo value is  bitwise  or&apos;d  with  one  of
       POPT_ARGFLAG_OR,  POPT_ARGFLAG_AND,  or  POPT_ARGFLAG_XOR,  the  value is
       saved by performing an OR, AND, or XOR.  If the argInfo value is  bitwise
       or&apos;d  with POPT_ARGFLAG_NOT, the value will be negated before saving. For
       the common operations of setting and/or clearing bits,  POPT_BIT_SET  and
       POPT_BIT_CLR have the appropriate flags set to perform bit operations.

       If  the argInfo value is bitwise or&apos;d with POPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH, the long
       argument may be given with a single - instead of  two.  For  example,  if
       --longopt  is an option with POPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH, is specified, -longopt
       is accepted as well.

       The next element, arg, allows popt to automatically update program  vari&#8208;
       ables  when  the  option  is used. If arg is NULL, it is ignored and popt
       takes no special action.  Otherwise it should point to a variable of  the
       type   indicated   in  the  right-most  column  of  the  table  above.  A
       POPT_ARG_ARGV arg will (re-)allocate an array of char * string  pointers,
       append  the  string  argument,  and add a NULL sentinel at the end of the
       array as needed.  The target char  **  address  of  a  POPT_ARG_ARGV  arg
       should be initialized to NULL.

       If  the option takes no argument (argInfo is POPT_ARG_NONE), the variable
       pointed to by arg is set to 1 when the option is used.  (Incidentally, it
       will  perhaps  not escape the attention of hunt-and-peck typists that the
       value of POPT_ARG_NONE is 0.)  If the option does take an  argument,  the
       variable  that arg points to is updated to reflect the value of the argu&#8208;
       ment.  Any string is acceptable  for  POPT_ARG_STRING  and  POPT_ARG_ARGV
       arguments, but POPT_ARG_INT, POPT_ARG_SHORT, POPT_ARG_LONG, POPT_ARG_LON&#8208;
       GLONG, POPT_ARG_FLOAT, and POPT_ARG_DOUBLE are converted to the appropri&#8208;
       ate type, and an error returned if the conversion fails.

       POPT_ARG_VAL  causes arg to be set to the (integer) value of val when the
       argument is found.  This is  most  often  useful  for  mutually-exclusive
       arguments  in  cases  where  it is not an error for multiple arguments to
       occur and where you want the last argument specified to win; for example,
       &quot;rm  -i  -f&quot;.   POPT_ARG_VAL  causes the parsing function not to return a
       value, since the value of val has already been used.

       If the argInfo value is  bitwise  or&apos;d  with  POPT_ARGFLAG_OPTIONAL,  the
       argument  to  the  long option may be omitted. If the long option is used
       without an argument, a default value of zero or NULL will  be  saved  (if
       the  arg  pointer  is present), otherwise behavior will be identical to a
       long option with argument.

       The next option, val, is the value popt&apos;s parsing function should  return
       when  the  option  is encountered.  If it is 0, the parsing function does
       not return a value, instead parsing the next command-line argument.

       The last two options, descrip and argDescrip are only required  if  auto&#8208;
       matic  help  messages are desired (automatic usage messages can be gener&#8208;
       ated without them). descrip is a text description  of  the  argument  and
       argdescrip  is  a  short  summary  of  the  type  of arguments the option
       expects, or NULL if the option doesn&apos;t require any arguments.

       If popt should automatically provide --usage and  --help  (-?)   options,
       one  line  in  the  table  should be the macro POPT_AUTOHELP.  This macro
       includes another option table (via POPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE ; see below) in
       the  main  one which provides the table entries for these arguments. When
       --usage or --help are passed to programs which use popt&apos;s automatic help,
       popt  displays  the appropriate message on stderr as soon as it finds the
       option, and exits the program with a return code of 0. If you want to use
       popt&apos;s  automatic help generation in a different way, you need to explic&#8208;
       itly add the option entries to your  programs  option  table  instead  of
       using POPT_AUTOHELP.

       If  the  argInfo  value is bitwise or&apos;d with POPT_ARGFLAG_DOC_HIDDEN, the
       argument will not be shown in help output.

       If the argInfo value is bitwise or&apos;d with POPT_ARGFLAG_SHOW_DEFAULT,  the
       initial value of the arg will be shown in help output.

       The  final  structure in the table should have all the pointer values set
       to NULL and all the arithmetic values set to 0, marking the  end  of  the
       table. The macro POPT_TABLEEND is provided to do that.

       There  are two types of option table entries which do not specify command
       line options. When either of these types of entries are used,  the  long&#8208;
       Name element must be NULL and the shortName element must be &apos;\0&apos;.

       The  first  of  these  special entry types allows the application to nest
       another option table in the current one; such nesting  may  extend  quite
       deeply  (the  actual  depth is limited by the program&apos;s stack). Including
       other option tables allows a library to provide a standard  set  of  com&#8208;
       mand-line  options  to every program which uses it (this is often done in
       graphical programming toolkits, for example). To do this, set the argInfo
       field  to  POPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE and the arg field to point to the table
       which is being included. If automatic help generation is being used,  the
       descrip  field  should  contain a overall description of the option table
       being included.

       The other special option table entry type tells popt to call  a  function
       (a  callback)  when any option in that table is found. This is especially
       useful when included option tables are being used, as the  program  which
       provides the top-level option table doesn&apos;t need to be aware of the other
       options which are provided by the included table. When a callback is  set
       for  a table, the parsing function never returns information on an option
       in the table. Instead, options information must be retained via the call&#8208;
       back  or  by  having  popt set a variable through the option&apos;s arg field.
       Option callbacks should match the following prototype:

       void poptCallbackType(poptContext con,
                             const struct poptOption * opt,
                             const char * arg, void * data);

       The first parameter is the context which is being parsed  (see  the  next
       section  for  information  on  contexts),  opt points to the option which
       triggered this callback, and arg is the option&apos;s argument.  If the option
       does  not  take  an  argument, arg is NULL.  The final parameter, data is
       taken from the descrip field of the option table entry which defined  the
       callback.  As  descrip is a pointer, this allows callback functions to be
       passed an arbitrary set of data (though a typecast will have to be used).

       The option table entry  which  defines  a  callback  has  an  argInfo  of
       POPT_ARG_CALLBACK,  an  arg  which points to the callback function, and a
       descrip field which specifies an arbitrary pointer to be  passed  to  the
       callback.

   2. CREATING A CONTEXT
       popt  can interleave the parsing of multiple command-line sets. It allows
       this by keeping all the state information for a particular  set  of  com&#8208;
       mand-line  arguments in a poptContext data structure, an opaque type that
       should not be modified outside the popt library.

       New popt contexts are created by poptGetContext():

       poptContext poptGetContext(const char * name, int argc,
                                  const char ** argv,
                                  const struct poptOption * options,
                                  int flags);

       The first parameter, name, is used only  for  alias  handling  (discussed
       later).  It should be the name of the application whose options are being
       parsed, or should be NULL if no option aliasing is desired. The next  two
       arguments  specify  the command-line arguments to parse. These are gener&#8208;
       ally passed to poptGetContext() exactly as they were passed to  the  pro&#8208;
       gram&apos;s main() function. The options parameter points to the table of com&#8208;
       mand-line options, which was described in the previous section. The final
       parameter, flags, can take one of three values:

       lfB  lfB  lfB lfR.  Value     Description POPT_CONTEXT_NO_EXEC     Ignore
       exec expansions POPT_CONTEXT_KEEP_FIRST  Do not ignore argv[0]  POPT_CON&#8208;
       TEXT_POSIXMEHARDER    Options cannot follow arguments

       A  poptContext  keeps track of which options have already been parsed and
       which remain, among other things. If a program wishes to  restart  option
       processing of a set of arguments, it can reset the poptContext by passing
       the context as the sole argument to poptResetContext().

       When argument processing is complete, the process should free  the  popt&#8208;
       Context as it contains dynamically allocated components. The poptFreeCon&#8208;
       text() function takes a poptContext as its sole argument  and  frees  the
       resources the context is using.

       Here are the prototypes of both poptResetContext() and poptFreeContext():

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       void poptFreeContext(poptContext con);
       void poptResetContext(poptContext con);


   3. PARSING THE COMMAND LINE
       After  an  application  has  created  a poptContext, it may begin parsing
       arguments. poptGetNextOpt() performs the actual argument parsing.

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       int poptGetNextOpt(poptContext con);

       Taking the context as its sole argument, this function  parses  the  next
       command-line  argument  found.  After  finding  the  next argument in the
       option table, the function fills in the object pointed to by  the  option
       table  entry&apos;s  arg  pointer  if it is not NULL. If the val entry for the
       option is non-0, the function then returns that value.  Otherwise,  popt&#8208;
       GetNextOpt() continues on to the next argument.

       poptGetNextOpt()  returns -1 when the final argument has been parsed, and
       other negative values when errors occur. This makes it  a  good  idea  to
       keep the val elements in the options table greater than 0.

       If all of the command-line options are handled through arg pointers, com&#8208;
       mand-line parsing is reduced to the following line of code:

       rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon);

       Many applications require more complex command-line  parsing  than  this,
       however, and use the following structure:

       while ((rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon)) &gt; 0) {
            switch (rc) {
                 /* specific arguments are handled here */
            }
       }

       When  returned  options  are  handled,  the application needs to know the
       value of any arguments that were specified after the  option.  There  are
       two  ways to discover them. One is to ask popt to fill in a variable with
       the value of the option through the  option  table&apos;s  arg  elements.  The
       other is to use poptGetOptArg():

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       char * poptGetOptArg(poptContext con);

       This function returns the argument given for the final option returned by
       poptGetNextOpt(), or it returns NULL if no argument was  specified.   The
       calling function is responsible for deallocating this string.


   4. LEFTOVER ARGUMENTS
       Many  applications  take  an  arbitrary number of command-line arguments,
       such as a list of file names. When popt encounters an argument that  does
       not  begin  with  a -, it assumes it is such an argument and adds it to a
       list of leftover arguments. Three functions allow applications to  access
       such arguments:

       const char * poptGetArg(poptContext con);
              This  function  returns the next leftover argument and marks it as
              processed.

       const char * poptPeekArg(poptContext con);
              The next leftover argument is returned  but  not  marked  as  pro&#8208;
              cessed.   This  allows an application to look ahead into the argu&#8208;
              ment list, without modifying the list.

       const char ** poptGetArgs(poptContext con);
              All the leftover arguments are returned in a manner  identical  to
              argv.   The  final  element  in the returned array points to NULL,
              indicating the end of the arguments.


   5. AUTOMATIC HELP MESSAGES
       The popt library can automatically generate help messages which  describe
       the options a program accepts. There are two types of help messages which
       can be generated. Usage messages are a short messages which  lists  valid
       options,  but  does not describe them. Help messages describe each option
       on one (or more) lines, resulting in a longer, but more useful,  message.
       Whenever  automatic  help  messages  are used, the descrip and argDescrip
       fields struct poptOption members should be filled in for each option.

       The POPT_AUTOHELP macro makes it easy to add --usage and --help  messages
       to  your  program,  and  is described in part 1 of this man page. If more
       control is needed over your help messages, the  following  two  functions
       are available:

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       void poptPrintHelp(poptContext con, FILE * f, int flags);
       void poptPrintUsage(poptContext con, FILE * f, int flags);

       poptPrintHelp()  displays  the  standard  help  message to the stdio file
       descriptor f, while poptPrintUsage() displays the shorter usage  message.
       Both  functions currently ignore the flags argument; it is there to allow
       future changes.


ERROR HANDLING
       All of the popt functions that can return errors return  integers.   When
       an  error  occurs, a negative error code is returned. The following table
       summarizes the error codes that occur:

            Error                      Description
       POPT_ERROR_NOARG       Argument missing for an option.
       POPT_ERROR_BADOPT      Option&apos;s argument couldn&apos;t be parsed.
       POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP Option aliasing nested too deeply.
       POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE    Quotations do not match.
       POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER   Option couldn&apos;t be converted to number.
       POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW    A given number was too big or small.

       Here is a more detailed discussion of each error:


       POPT_ERROR_NOARG
              An option that requires an argument was specified on  the  command
              line,  but  no  argument  was  given. This can be returned only by
              poptGetNextOpt().


       POPT_ERROR_BADOPT
              An option was specified in argv but is not in  the  option  table.
              This error can be returned only from poptGetNextOpt().
&#12;
       POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP
              A set of option aliases is nested too deeply. Currently, popt fol&#8208;
              lows options only 10 levels to prevent  infinite  recursion.  Only
              poptGetNextOpt() can return this error.


       POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE
              A  parsed string has a quotation mismatch (such as a single quota&#8208;
              tion mark). poptParseArgvString(), poptReadConfigFile(),  or  pop&#8208;
              tReadDefaultConfig() can return this error.


       POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER
              A conversion from a string to a number (int or long) failed due to
              the string containing  nonnumeric  characters.  This  occurs  when
              poptGetNextOpt()  is  processing an argument of type POPT_ARG_INT,
              POPT_ARG_SHORT, POPT_ARG_LONG, POPT_ARG_LONGLONG,  POPT_ARG_FLOAT,
              or POPT_ARG_DOUBLE.


       POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW
              A  string-to-number  conversion  failed because the number was too
              large or too small.  Like  POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER,  this  error  can
              occur only when poptGetNextOpt() is processing an argument of type
              POPT_ARG_INT,  POPT_ARG_SHORT,  POPT_ARG_LONG,  POPT_ARG_LONGLONG,
              POPT_ARG_FLOAT, or POPT_ARG_DOUBLE.


       POPT_ERROR_ERRNO
              A system call returned with an error, and errno still contains the
              error from the system call.  Both  poptReadConfigFile()  and  pop&#8208;
              tReadDefaultConfig() can return this error.


       Two  functions  are available to make it easy for applications to provide
       good error messages.


              const char *const poptStrerror(const int error);
              This function takes  a  popt  error  code  and  returns  a  string
              describing  the  error, just as with the standard strerror() func&#8208;
              tion.


              const char * poptBadOption(poptContext con, int flags);
              If  an  error  occurred  during  poptGetNextOpt(),  this  function
              returns the option that caused the error. If the flags argument is
              set to POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS, the outermost option  is  returned.
              Otherwise,  flags should be 0, and the option that is returned may
              have been specified through an alias.

       These two functions make popt error handling trivial  for  most  applica&#8208;
       tions.  When  an  error  is detected from most of the functions, an error
       message is printed along with the error string from poptStrerror().  When
       an  error  occurs  during argument parsing, code similar to the following
       displays a useful error message:

       fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;,
               poptBadOption(optCon, POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS),
               poptStrerror(rc));


OPTION ALIASING
       One of the primary benefits of using popt over getopt() is the ability to
       use option aliasing. This lets the user specify options that popt expands
       into other options when they are specified. If the standard grep  program
       made  use of popt, users could add a --text option that expanded to -i -n
       -E -2 to let them more easily find information in text files.


   1. SPECIFYING ALIASES
       Aliases are normally specified in two places:  /etc/popt  and  the  .popt
       file  in  the  user&apos;s  home directory (found through the HOME environment
       variable). Both files have the same format, an arbitrary number of  lines
       formatted like this:

       appname alias newoption expansion

       The appname is the name of the application, which must be the same as the
       name parameter passed to poptGetContext(). This allows each file to spec&#8208;
       ify  aliases  for  multiple programs. The alias keyword specifies that an
       alias is being defined; currently popt configuration files  support  only
       aliases,  but other abilities may be added in the future. The next option
       is the option that should be aliased, and it may be either a short  or  a
       long  option. The rest of the line specifies the expansion for the alias.
       It is parsed similarly to a shell command, which allows \, &quot;, and &apos; to be
       used  for  quoting.  If a backslash is the final character on a line, the
       next line in the file is assumed to be a logical continuation of the line
       containing the backslash, just as in shell.

       The  following  entry  would  add a --text option to the grep command, as
       suggested at the beginning of this section.

       grep alias --text -i -n -E -2

   2. ENABLING ALIASES
       An application must enable alias expansion for a poptContext before call&#8208;
       ing  poptGetNextArg()  for the first time. There are three functions that
       define aliases for a context:


              int poptReadDefaultConfig(poptContext con, int flags);
              This function reads aliases from /etc/popt and the .popt  file  in
              the  user&apos;s home directory. Currently, flags should be NULL, as it
              is provided only for future expansion.


              int poptReadConfigFile(poptContext con, char * fn);
              The file specified by fn is opened and parsed as a popt configura&#8208;
              tion file. This allows programs to use program-specific configura&#8208;
              tion files.


              int poptAddAlias(poptContext con, struct poptAlias alias,
                               int flags);
              Occasionally, processes want to specify aliases without having  to
              read  them  from  a  configuration  file. This function adds a new
              alias to a context. The flags argument should be 0, as it is  cur&#8208;
              rently  reserved  for future expansion. The new alias is specified
              as a struct poptAlias, which is defined as:

              struct poptAlias {
                   const char * longName; /* may be NULL */
                   char shortName; /* may be &apos;\0&apos; */
                   int argc;
                   const char ** argv; /* must be free()able */
              };

              The first two elements, longName and shortName, specify the option
              that  is  aliased. The final two, argc and argv, define the expan&#8208;
              sion to use when the aliases option is encountered.

PARSING ARGUMENT STRINGS
       Although popt is usually used for parsing arguments already divided  into
       an argv-style array, some programs need to parse strings that are format&#8208;
       ted identically to command lines. To facilitate  this,  popt  provides  a
       function that parses a string into an array of strings, using rules simi&#8208;
       lar to normal shell parsing.

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       int poptParseArgvString(char * s, int * argcPtr,
                               char *** argvPtr);
       int poptDupArgv(int argc, const char ** argv, int * argcPtr,
                               const char *** argvPtr);

       The string s is parsed into an argv-style array. The integer  pointed  to
       by  the argcPtr parameter contains the number of elements parsed, and the
       final argvPtr parameter contains the address of the newly created  array.
       The routine poptDupArgv() can be used to make a copy of an existing argu&#8208;
       ment array.

       The argvPtr created by poptParseArgvString() or poptDupArgv() is suitable
       to  pass  directly  to  poptGetContext().   Both routines return a single
       dynamically allocated contiguous block of storage and should be  free()ed
       when the application is finished with the storage.

HANDLING EXTRA ARGUMENTS
       Some applications implement the equivalent of option aliasing but need to
       do so through special  logic.  The  poptStuffArgs()  function  allows  an
       application to insert new arguments into the current poptContext.

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       int poptStuffArgs(poptContext con, const char ** argv);

       The passed argv must have a NULL pointer as its final element. When popt&#8208;
       GetNextOpt() is next called, the &quot;stuffed&quot; arguments are the first to  be
       parsed.  popt  returns to the normal arguments once all the stuffed argu&#8208;
       ments have been exhausted.

EXAMPLE
       The following example is a simplified  version  of  the  program  &quot;robin&quot;
       which  appears  in  Chapter  15  of the text cited below.  Robin has been
       stripped of everything but its argument-parsing logic, slightly reworked,
       and renamed &quot;parse.&quot; It may prove useful in illustrating at least some of
       the features of the extremely rich popt library.

       #include &lt;popt.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void usage(poptContext optCon, int exitcode, char *error, char *addl) {
           poptPrintUsage(optCon, stderr, 0);
           if (error) fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;, error, addl);
           exit(exitcode);
       }

       int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
          int     c;            /* used for argument parsing */
          int     i = 0;        /* used for tracking options */
          int     speed = 0;    /* used in argument parsing to set speed */
          int     raw = 0;      /* raw mode? */
          int     j;
          char    buf[BUFSIZ+1];
          const char *portname;
          poptContext optCon;   /* context for parsing command-line options */

          struct poptOption optionsTable[] = {
             { &quot;bps&quot;, &apos;b&apos;, POPT_ARG_INT, &amp;speed, 0,
            &quot;signaling rate in bits-per-second&quot;, &quot;BPS&quot; },
             { &quot;crnl&quot;, &apos;c&apos;, 0, 0, &apos;c&apos;,
            &quot;expand cr characters to cr/lf sequences&quot;, NULL },
             { &quot;hwflow&quot;, &apos;h&apos;, 0, 0, &apos;h&apos;,
            &quot;use hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control&quot;, NULL },
             { &quot;noflow&quot;, &apos;n&apos;, 0, 0, &apos;n&apos;,
            &quot;use no flow control&quot;, NULL },

            &quot;don&apos;t perform any character conversions&quot;, NULL },
             { &quot;swflow&quot;, &apos;s&apos;, 0, 0, &apos;s&apos;,
            &quot;use software (XON/XOF) flow control&quot;, NULL } ,
             POPT_AUTOHELP
             { NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0 }
           };

          optCon = poptGetContext(NULL, argc, argv, optionsTable, 0);
          poptSetOtherOptionHelp(optCon, &quot;[OPTIONS]* &lt;port&gt;&quot;);

          if (argc &lt; 2) {
            poptPrintUsage(optCon, stderr, 0);
            exit(1);
          }

          /* Now do options processing, get portname */
          while ((c = poptGetNextOpt(optCon)) &gt;= 0) {
             switch (c) {
              case &apos;c&apos;:
                 buf[i++] = &apos;c&apos;;
                 break;
              case &apos;h&apos;:

       RPM, a popular Linux package  management  program,  makes  heavy  use  of
       popt&apos;s  features.  Many  of  its  command-line  arguments are implemented
       through popt aliases, which makes RPM an excellent example of how to take
       advantage  of  the  popt  library.  For  more  information  on  RPM,  see
       http://www.rpm.org. The popt source code distribution includes test  pro&#8208;
       gram(s)  which  use  all of the features of the popt libraries in various
       ways. If a feature isn&apos;t working for you, the popt test code is the first
       place to look.
