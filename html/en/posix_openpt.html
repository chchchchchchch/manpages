POSIX_OPENPT(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            POSIX_OPENPT(3)



NAME
       posix_openpt - open a pseudoterminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int posix_openpt(int flags);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       posix_openpt(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_openpt() function opens an unused pseudoterminal master device,
       returning a file descriptor that can be used to refer to that device.

       The flags argument is a bit mask that ORs together zero or  more  of  the
       following flags:

       O_RDWR Open  the  device  for  both  reading and writing.  It is usual to
              specify this flag.

       O_NOCTTY
              Do not make this device the controlling terminal for the process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, posix_openpt() returns a nonnegative file descriptor which is
       the  lowest  numbered unused descriptor.  On failure, -1 is returned, and
       errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       See open(2).

VERSIONS
       Glibc support for posix_openpt() has been provided since version 2.2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       posix_openpt() is  part  of  the  UNIX  98  pseudoterminal  support  (see
       pts(4)).  This function is specified in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  posix_openpt()  function  is a recent invention in POSIX.  Some UNIX
       implementations that support System V (aka UNIX 98) pseudoterminals don&apos;t
       have this function, but it is easy to implement:

           int
           posix_openpt(int flags)
           {
               return open(&quot;/dev/ptmx&quot;, flags);
           }

       Calling  posix_openpt()  creates  a  pathname for the corresponding pseu&#8208;
       doterminal slave device.   The  pathname  of  the  slave  device  can  be
       obtained using ptsname(3).  The slave device pathname exists only as long
       as the master device is open.
