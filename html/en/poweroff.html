HALT(8)                Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual               HALT(8)



NAME
       halt, reboot, poweroff - stop the system.

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/halt [-n] [-w] [-d] [-f] [-i] [-p] [-h]
       /sbin/reboot [-n] [-w] [-d] [-f] [-i]
       /sbin/poweroff [-n] [-w] [-d] [-f] [-i] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       halt   notes   that  the  system  is  being  brought  down  in  the  file
       /var/log/wtmp, and then either tells the kernel to halt, reboot or power-
       off the system.

       If halt or reboot is called when the system is not in runlevel 0 or 6, in
       other words when it&apos;s running normally, shutdown will be invoked  instead
       (with the -h or -r flag). For more info see the shutdown(8) manpage.

       The  rest  of  this manpage describes the behaviour in runlevels 0 and 6,
       that is when the systems shutdown scripts are being run.

OPTIONS
       -n     Don&apos;t sync before reboot or halt. Note that the kernel and storage
              drivers may still sync.  This implies -d.

       -w     Don&apos;t  actually  reboot or halt but only write the wtmp record (in
              the /var/log/wtmp file).

       -d     Don&apos;t write the wtmp record.

       -f     Force halt or reboot, don&apos;t call shutdown(8).

       -i     Shut down all network interfaces just before halt or reboot.

       -h     Put all hard drives on the system in  stand-by  mode  just  before
              halt or power-off.

       -p     When halting the system, switch off the power. This is the default
              when halt is called as poweroff.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If you&apos;re not the superuser, you will get  the  message  `must  be  supe&#8208;
       ruser&apos;.

NOTES
       Under  older  sysvinit  releases , reboot and halt should never be called
       directly. From release 2.74 on halt and reboot invoke shutdown(8) if  the
       system  is not in runlevel 0 or 6. This means that if halt or reboot can&#8208;
       not find out the current runlevel (for example, when /var/run/utmp hasn&apos;t
       been  initialized  correctly) shutdown will be called, which might not be
       what you want.  Use the -f flag if you want to do a hard halt or reboot.

       The -h flag puts all hard disks in  standby  mode  just  before  halt  or
       power-off.  Right  now  this  is  only implemented for IDE drives. A side
       effect of putting the drive in stand-by mode is that the write  cache  on
       the  disk  is flushed. This is important for IDE drives, since the kernel
       doesn&apos;t flush the write cache itself before power-off.

       The halt program uses /proc/ide/hd* to find all IDE disk  devices,  which
       means  that  /proc needs to be mounted when halt or poweroff is called or
       the -h switch will do nothing.
