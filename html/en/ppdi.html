NAME
       ppdi - import ppd files

SYNOPSIS
       ppdi [ -I include-directory ] [ -o source-file ] ppd-file [ ppd-file2 ...
       ppd-fileN ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdi imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source file.  Mul&#8208;
       tiple  languages  of  the  same PPD file are merged into a single printer
       definition to facilitate accurate changes for all localizations.

       The -o option specifies the PPD source file to update. If the source file
       does not exist, a new source file is created. Otherwise the existing file
       is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line. If no source file
       is specified, the filename &quot;ppdi.drv&quot; is used.
