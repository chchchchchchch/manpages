ppm(5)                                                                    ppm(5)



NAME
       ppm - portable pixmap file format

DESCRIPTION
       The  portable  pixmap  format  is a lowest common denominator color image
       file format.

       It should be noted that this format is egregiously  inefficient.   It  is
       highly  redundant,  while  containing a lot of information that the human
       eye can&apos;t even discern.   Furthermore,  the  format  allows  very  little
       information about the image besides basic color, which means you may have
       to couple a file in this format with other independent information to get
       any  decent use out of it.  However, it is very easy to write and analyze
       programs to process this format, and that is the point.

       It should also be noted that files often conform to this format in  every
       respect  except  the precise semantics of the sample values.  These files
       are useful because of the way PPM is  used  as  an  intermediary  format.
       They  are  informally called PPM files, but to be absolutely precise, you
       should indicate the variation from true PPM.  For example, &quot;PPM using the
       red, green, and blue colors that the scanner in question uses.&quot;

       The format definition is as follows.

       A PPM file consists of a sequence of one or more PPM images. There are no
       data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between images.

       Each PPM image consists of the following:

       - A &quot;magic number&quot; for identifying the file type.  A  ppm  image&apos;s  magic
         number is the two characters &quot;P6&quot;.

       - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

       - A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - A height, again in ASCII decimal.

       - Whitespace.

       - The maximum color value (Maxval), again in ASCII decimal.  Must be less
         than 65536.

       - Newline or other single whitespace character.

       - A raster of Width * Height pixels, proceeding through the image in nor&#8208;
         mal  English reading order.  Each pixel is a triplet of red, green, and
         blue samples, in that order.  Each sample is represented in pure binary
         by  either 1 or 2 bytes.  If the Maxval is less than 256, it is 1 byte.
         Otherwise, it is 2 bytes.  The most significant byte is first.

       - In the raster, the sample values are  &quot;nonlinear.&quot;   They  are  propor&#8208;
         tional to the intensity of the CIE Rec. 709 red, green, and blue in the
         pixel, adjusted by the CIE Rec. 709  gamma  transfer  function.   (That
         transfer function specifies a gamma number of 2.2 and has a linear sec&#8208;
         tion for small intensities).  A value of Maxval for all  three  samples
         represents  CIE  D65 white and the most intense color in the color uni&#8208;
         verse of which the image is part (the color universe is all the  colors
         in all images to which this image might be compared).
&#12;       - Note  that  a  common variation on the PPM format is to have the sample
         values be &quot;linear,&quot; i.e. as specified above except  without  the  gamma
         adjustment.   pnmgamma takes such a PPM variant as input and produces a
         true PPM as output.


       - Characters from a &quot;#&quot; to the next end-of-line, before the maxval  line,
         are comments and are ignored.

       Note  that  you  can  use pnmdepth to convert between a the format with 1
       byte per sample and the one with 2 bytes per sample.

       There is actually another version of the PPM format that is fairly  rare:
       &quot;plain&quot;  PPM  format.   The  format above, which generally considered the
       normal one, is known as the &quot;raw&quot; PPM format.  See pbm(5) for  some  com&#8208;
       mentary on how plain and raw formats relate to one another.

       The difference in the plain format is:

       - There is exactly one image in a file.

       - The magic number is P3 instead of P6.

       - Each sample in the raster is represented as an ASCII decimal number (of
         arbitrary size).

       - Each sample in the raster has white space before and after  it.   There
         must  be at least one character of white space between any two samples,
         but there is no maximum.  There is  no  particular  separation  of  one
         pixel  from  another  --  just the required separation between the blue
         sample of one pixel from the red sample of the next pixel.

       - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

       Here is an example of a small pixmap in this format:
       P3
       # feep.ppm
       4 4
       15
        0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
        0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
        0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
       15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0

       Programs that read this format should be as lenient as possible,  accept&#8208;
       ing anything that looks remotely like a pixmap.


COMPATIBILITY
       Before  April 2000, a raw format PPM file could not have a maxval greater
       than 255.  Hence, it could not have more than one byte per  sample.   Old
       programs may depend on this.

       Before  July  2000, there could be at most one image in a PPM file.  As a
       result, most tools to process PPM files ignore (and don&apos;t read) any  data
       after the first image.
