ppmbrighten(1)                                                    ppmbrighten(1)



NAME
       ppmbrighten - change an images Saturation and Value from an HSV map

SYNOPSIS
       ppmbrighten [-n] [-s &lt;+- saturation&gt;] [-v &lt;+- value&gt;] &lt;ppmfile&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable pixmap as input.  Converts the image from RGB space to
       HSV space and changes the Value by &lt;+- value&gt; as a percentage.   Likewise
       with the Saturation.  Doubling the Value would involve

       ppmbrighten -v 100

       to add 100 percent to the Value.

       The  &apos;n&apos;  option  normalizes  the Value to exist between 0 and 1 (normal&#8208;
       ized).
