NAME
       ppmcie - draw a CIE color chart as a PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       ppmcie [-rec709|-cie|-ebu|-hdtv|-ntsc|-smpte] [-xy|-upvp] [-red rx ry]
                [-green gx gy] [-blue bx by] [-white wx wy] [-size edge]
                [-xsize|-width width] [-ysize|-height height] [-noblack]
                [-nowpoint] [-nolabel] [-noaxes] [-full]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       ppmcie creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE  ``tongue&apos;&apos;  color
       chart -- to the extent possible in a PPM image.  Alternatively, creates a
       pseudo-PPM image of the color tongue using RGB values from a color system
       of your choice.

       The CIE color tongue is an image of all the hues that can be described by
       CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates.  They are arranged on a two dimensional
       coordinate plane with the X chromaticity on the horizontal axis and the Y
       chromaticity on the vertical scale.  (You can choose alternatively to use
       CIE  u&apos;-v&apos;  chromaticity  coordinates,  but the general idea of the color
       tongue is the same).

       Note that the PPM format specifies that the RGB values in  the  file  are
       from  CIE  Rec.  709  color  system, gamma-corrected.  And positive.  See
       ppm(5) for details.  If you use one of the color system options  on  ppm&#8208;
       cie,  what  you get is not a true PPM image, but is very similar.  If you
       display such ppmcie output using a device that expects PPM  input  (which
       includes  just about any computer graphics display program), it will dis&#8208;
       play the wrong colors.

       However, you may have a device that expects one of  these  variations  on
       PPM.

       In  every  RGB color system you can specify, including the default (which
       produces a true PPM image) there are hues in the color tongue that  can&apos;t
       be  represented.  For example, monochromatic blue-green with a wavelength
       of 500nm cannot be represented in a PPM image.

       For these hues, ppmcie substitutes a similar hue as follows: They are de&#8208;
       saturated  and rendered as the shade where the edge of the Maxwell trian&#8208;
       gle intersects a line drawn from the requested shade to the  white  point
       defined by the color system&apos;s white point.  Furthermore, unless you spec&#8208;
       ify the -full option, ppmcie reduces their intensity by 25%  compared  to
       the true hues in the image.

       ppmcie  draws  and  labels  the CIE X-Y coordinate axes unless you choose
       otherwise with options.

       ppmcie draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system in use on the col&#8208;
       or  tongue.   The Maxwell triangle is the triangle whose vertices are the
       primary illuminant hues for the color system.  The hues inside the trian&#8208;
       gle  show  the  color gamut for the color system.  They are also the only
       ones that are correct for the CIE  X-Y  chromaticity  coordinates  shown.
       (See explanation above).

       ppmcie  also places a mark at the color system&apos;s white point and displays
       in text the CIE X-Y chromaticities of the primary illuminants  and  white
       point for the color system.  You can turn this off with options, though.

       ppmcie  annotates  the periphery of the color tongue with the wavelength,
       in nanometers of the monochromatic hues which appear there.

       Finally, ppmcie displays the black body chromaticity curve for  Planckian
       radiators from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on the image.

       You  can  choose  from  several standard color systems, or specify one of
       your own numerically.


       CIE charts, by their very nature, contain a very large number of  colors.
       If  you&apos;re  encoding  the chart for a color mapped device or file format,
       you&apos;ll need to use ppmquant or ppmdither to reduce the number  of  colors
       in the image.


OPTIONS
       -rec709|-cie|-ebu|-hdtv|-ntsc|-smpte
                 Select  a  standard  color system whose gamut to plot.  The de&#8208;
                 fault is -rec709, which chooses CIE Rec. 709,  gamma-corrected.
                 This  is  the  only color system for which ppmcie&apos;s output is a
                 true PPM image.  See explanation above.  -ebu chooses the  pri&#8208;
                 maries used in the PAL and SECAM broadcasting standards.  -ntsc
                 chooses the primaries specified by the NTSC broadcasting system
                 (few  modern  monitors  actually cover this range).  -smpte se&#8208;
                 lects the primaries recommended by the Society of  Motion  Pic&#8208;
                 ture  and  Television  Engineers (SMPTE) in standards RP-37 and
                 RP-145, and -hdtv uses the much broader HDTV  ideal  primaries.
                 -cie chooses a color system that has the largest possible gamut
                 within the spectrum of the chart.  This is the same color  sys&#8208;
                 tem  as  you get with the -cie option to John Walker&apos;s cietoppm
                 program.


       -xy       plot CIE 1931 x y chromaticities.  This is the default.

       -upvp     plot u&apos; v&apos; 1976 chromaticities rather than CIE 1931 x  y  chro&#8208;
                 maticities.   The  advantage of u&apos; v&apos; coordinates is that equal
                 intervals of distance on the u&apos; v&apos; plane correspond roughly  to
                 the eye&apos;s ability to discriminate colors.

       -red rx ry
                 specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the red illuminant of
                 a custom color system and selects the custom system.

       -green gx gy
                 specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the green  illuminant
                 of the color system and selects the custom system.

       -blue bx by
                 specifies  the  CIE x and y co-ordinates of the blue illuminant
                 of the color system and selects the custom system.

       -white wx wy
                 specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the  white  point  of
                 the color system and selects the custom system.

       -size edge
                 Create  a  pixmap  of  edge  by  edge  pixels.   The default is
                 512x512.

       -xsize|-width width
                 Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels.  The de&#8208;
                 fault  width is 512 pixels.  If the height and width of the im&#8208;
                 age are not the same, the CIE diagram will be stretched in  the
                 longer dimension.

       -ysize|-height height
                 Sets  the  height of the generated image to height pixels.  The
                 default height is 512 pixels.  If the height and width  of  the
                 image  are  not  the same, the CIE diagram will be stretched in
                 the longer dimension.

       -noblack  Don&apos;t plot the black body chromaticity curve.

       -nowpoint Don&apos;t plot the color system&apos;s white point.

       -nolabel  Omit the label.

       -noaxes   Don&apos;t plot axes.

       -full     Plot the entire CIE tongue in full intensity; don&apos;t enhance the
                 gamut of the specified color system.
