ppmdim(1)                                                              ppmdim(1)



NAME
       ppmdim - dim a portable pixmap down to total blackness

SYNOPSIS
       ppmdim dimfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input. Diminishes its brightness by the speci&#8208;
       fied dimfactor down to total blackness.  The  dimfactor  may  be  in  the
       range  from 0.0 (total blackness, deep night, nada, null, nothing) to 1.0
       (original picture&apos;s brightness).

       As pnmgamma does not do the brightness correction in the way I wanted it,
       this small program was written.

       ppmdim is similar to ppmbrighten , but not exactly the same.
