ppmflash(1)                                                          ppmflash(1)



NAME
       ppmflash - brighten a picture up to complete white-out

SYNOPSIS
       ppmflash flashfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input. Increases its brightness by the speci&#8208;
       fied flashfactor up to a total white-out image.  The flashfactor  may  be
       in the range from 0.0 (original picture&apos;s brightness) to 1.0 (full white-
       out, The Second After).

       As pnmgamma does not do the brightness correction in the way I wanted it,
       this small program was written.

       This program is similar to ppmbrighten , but not exactly the same.
