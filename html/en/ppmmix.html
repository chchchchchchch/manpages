NAME
       ppmmix - blend together two portable pixmaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmmix fadefactor ppmfile1 ppmfile2

DESCRIPTION
       Reads two portable pixmaps as input. Mixes them together using the speci&#8208;
       fied fade factor. The fade factor may be in the range from 0.0 (only ppm&#8208;
       file1&apos;s  image  data)  to  1.0 (only ppmfile2&apos;s image data).  Anything in
       between gains a smooth blend between the two images.

       The two pixmaps must have the same size.

       pnmcomp is a more general alternative.  It allows you to  mix  images  of
       different  size  and  to  have  the fade factor vary throughout the image
       (through the use of an alpha mask).
