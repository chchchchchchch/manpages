NAME
       ppmtoicr - convert a portable pixmap into NCSA ICR format

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoicr  [-windowname  name]  [-expand expand] [-display display] [-rle]
       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap file as input.  Produces an NCSA Telnet  Interac&#8208;
       tive  Color  Raster  graphic file as output.  If ppmfile is not supplied,
       ppmtoicr will read from standard input.

       Interactive Color Raster (ICR) is a protocol for displaying raster graph&#8208;
       ics  on  workstation  screens. The protocol is implemented in NCSA Telnet
       for the Macintosh version 2.3.  The ICR protocol  shares  characteristics
       of  the  Tektronix  graphics  terminal  emulation protocol.  For example,
       escape sequences are used to control the display.

       ppmtoicr will output the appropriate sequences to create a window of  the
       dimensions  of the input pixmap, create a colormap of up to 256 colors on
       the display, then load the picture data into the window.

       Note that there is no icrtoppm tool - this transformation is one way.

OPTIONS
       -windownamename
                     Output will be displayed in name (Default is to use ppmfile
                     or &quot;untitled&quot; if standard input is read.)

       -expandexpand Output  will  be  expanded on display by factor expand (For
                     example, a value of 2 will cause four  pixels  to  be  dis&#8208;
                     played for every input pixel.)

       -displaydisplay
                     Output will be displayed on screen numbered display

       -rle          Use  run-length  encoded  format  for  display.  (This will
                     nearly always result in a quicker display, but may skew the
                     colormap.)

EXAMPLES
       To display a ppm file using the protocol:
           ppmtoicr ppmfile
       This  will  create a window named ppmfile on the display with the correct
       dimensions for ppmfile, create and download a colormap of up to 256  col&#8208;
       ors,  and  download  the  picture into the window. The same effect may be
       achieved by the following sequence:
           ppmtoicr ppmfile &gt; filename
           cat filename
       To display a GIF file using the protocol in a  window  titled  after  the
       input  file,  zoom  the  displayed image by a factor of 2, and run-length
       encode the data:
           giftopnm giffile | ppmtoicr -w giffile -r -e 2

BUGS
       The protocol uses frequent fflush calls to speed up display. If the  out&#8208;
       put  is  saved  to a file for later display via cat, drawing will be much
       slower. In either case, increasing the Blocksize  limit  on  the  display
       will speed up transmission substantially.
