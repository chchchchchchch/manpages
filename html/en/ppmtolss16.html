PPMTOLSS16(1)                                                      PPMTOLSS16(1)



NAME
       ppmtolss16 &#8212; Convert a PPM to an LSS16 image

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtolss16  [                #rrggbb=i            ...]  [&lt; input.ppm]  [&gt;
       output.rle]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ppmtolss16 command.


       The ppmtolss16 program converts a &quot;raw&quot; PPM file with max 16 colors to  a
       simple RLE-based format:


       simple RLE-based format

       tab(&#7;);  l  l.  unint32 0x1413f3d&#7;magic (littleendian) unint16 xsize&#7;lit&#8208;
       tleendian unint15 ysize&#7;littleendian 16 x unint8 r,g,b&#7;color map

       Color map is in 6-bit format (each byte is 0..63)

       Then, a sequence of nybbles:

       N   ... if N is != previous pixel, one pixel of color  N,  otherwise  run
       sequence follows ...


       M    ...  if  M  &gt;  0  then  run length is M+1, otherwise run sequence is
       encoded in two nybbles, littleendian, +17


       The nybble sequences are on a per-row basis, runs may not  extend  across
       rows and odd-nybble rows are zero-padded.


       At the start of a row, the &quot;previous pixel&quot; is assumed to be zero.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       #rrggbb=i Specify that the color #rrggbb (hex) should be assigned index i
                 (decimal).


BUG
       This program cannot handle comments in the header, nor &quot;plain&quot;  ppm  for&#8208;
       mat.
