ppmtopcx(1)                                                          ppmtopcx(1)



NAME
       ppmtopcx - convert a portable pixmap into a PCX file


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopcx [-24bit] [-packed] [-xpos=cols] [-ypos=rows] [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a PPM image as input.  Produces a PCX file as output.  The type of
       the PCX file depends on the number of colors in the pixmap:

       16 colors or less:
              1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes.

       256 colors or less:
              8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the file.

       More than 256 colors:
              24bit truecolor file (8 bits/pixel, 3 planes).

OPTIONS
       -24bit Produce a 24bit truecolor file, even if the pixmap has 256  colors
              or less.

       -packed
              Use  &quot;packed pixel&quot; format for files with 16 colors or less: 1, 2,
              or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane.

       -xpos=cols

       -ypos=rows
              These options set the position of the image in some field (e.g. on
              a  screen) in columns to the right of the left edge and rows below
              the top edge.  The PCX format contains image position information.
              Don&apos;t confuse this with the position of an area of interest within
              the image.  For example, using pnmpad to add a 10 pixel left  bor&#8208;
              der  to an image and then converting that image to PCX with xpos =
              0 is not the same as converting the original image to PCX and set&#8208;
              ting xpos = 10.

              The values may be from -32767 to 32768.

              The default for each is zero.
