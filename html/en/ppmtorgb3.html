ppmtorgb3(1)                                                        ppmtorgb3(1)



NAME
       ppmtorgb3 - separate a portable pixmap into three portable graymaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtorgb3 [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Writes three portable graymaps as out&#8208;
       put, one each for red, green, and blue.

       The output filenames are constructed by taking the input filename, strip&#8208;
       ping  off  any  extension, and appending &quot;.red&quot;, &quot;.grn&quot;, and &quot;.blu&quot;.  For
       example, separating lenna.ppm would result in lenna.red,  lenna.grn,  and
       lenna.blu.   If the input comes from stdin, the names are noname.red, no&#8208;
       name.grn, and noname.blu.
