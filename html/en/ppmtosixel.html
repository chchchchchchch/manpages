NAME
       ppmtosixel - convert a portable pixmap into DEC sixel format

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtosixel [-raw] [-margin] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input.  Produces sixel commands (SIX) as out&#8208;
       put.  The output is formatted for color printing, e.g. for  a  DEC  LJ250
       color inkjet printer.

       If  RGB  values  from the PPM file do not have maxval=100, the RGB values
       are rescaled.  A printer control header  and  a  color  assignment  table
       begin  the  SIX  file.   Image  data is written in a compressed format by
       default.  A printer control footer ends the image file.

OPTIONS
       -raw   If specified, each pixel will be explicitly described in the image
              file.  If -raw is not specified, output will default to compressed
              format in which identical adjacent pixels are replaced by  &quot;repeat
              pixel&quot; commands.  A raw file is often an order of magnitude larger
              than a compressed file and prints much slower.

       -margin
              If -margin is not specified, the image will be start at  the  left
              margin  (of the window, paper, or whatever).  If -margin is speci&#8208;
              fied, a 1.5 inch left margin will offset the image.

PRINTING
       Generally, sixel files must reach the printer unfiltered.  Use the lpr -x
       option or cat filename &gt; /dev/tty0?.

BUGS
       Upon  rescaling,  truncation  of the least significant bits of RGB values
       may result in poor color conversion.  If  the  original  PPM  maxval  was
       greater  than  100,  rescaling  also  reduces the image depth.  While the
       actual RGB values from the ppm file are more or less retained, the  color
       palette of the LJ250 may not match the colors on your screen.  This seems
       to be a printer limitation.
