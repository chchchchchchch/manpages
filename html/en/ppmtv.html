NAME
       ppmtv - make a portable pixmap look like taken from an American TV

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtv dimfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input. Dims every other row of image data down
       by the specified dim factor. This factor may be in the range of 0.0  (the
       alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image).

       This  creates  an effect similar to what I&apos;ve once seen in the video clip
       &apos;You could be mine&apos; by Guns&apos;n&apos;Roses. In the scene I&apos;m talking  about  you
       can  see  John  Connor on his motorbike, looking up from the water trench
       (?)  he&apos;s standing in. While the camera pulls back, the image gets  &apos;nor&#8208;
       mal&apos;  by brightening up the alternate rows of it. I thought this would be
       an interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not yet check this out,  how&#8208;
       ever.  Try for yourself.
