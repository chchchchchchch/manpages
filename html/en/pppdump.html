PPPDUMP(8)                                                            PPPDUMP(8)



NAME
       pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable format

SYNOPSIS
       pppdump [ -h | -p [ -d ]] [ -r ] [ -m mru ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       The pppdump utility converts the files written using the record option of
       pppd into a human-readable format.  If one or more filenames  are  speci&#8208;
       fied, pppdump will read each in turn; otherwise it will read its standard
       input.  In each case the result is written to standard output.

       The options are as follows:

       -h     Prints the bytes sent and received  in  hexadecimal.   If  neither
              this  option nor the -p option is specified, the bytes are printed
              as the characters  themselves,  with  non-printing  and  non-ASCII
              characters printed as escape sequences.

       -p     Collects  the bytes sent and received into PPP packets, interpret&#8208;
              ing the async HDLC framing and escape characters and checking  the
              FCS  (frame  check  sequence)  of  each  packet.   The packets are
              printed as hex values and as characters (non-printable  characters
              are printed as `.&apos;).

       -d     With the -p option, this option causes pppdump to decompress pack&#8208;
              ets which have been compressed with the  BSD-Compress  or  Deflate
              methods.

       -r     Reverses  the  direction indicators, so that `sent&apos; is printed for
              bytes or packets received, and `rcvd&apos;  is  printed  for  bytes  or
              packets sent.

       -m mru Use  mru  as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for both directions of
              the link when checking for over-length PPP packets  (with  the  -p
              option).
