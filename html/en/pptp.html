PPTP(8)                                                                  PPTP(8)



NAME
       pptp - PPTP driver

SYNOPSIS
       pptp &lt;pptp-server-IP&gt; &lt;pptp-options&gt; [ppp-options] ...

DESCRIPTION
       pptp establishes the client side of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using
       the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).  Use this program  to  con&#8208;
       nect  to  an employer&apos;s PPTP based VPN, or to certain cable and ADSL ser&#8208;
       vice providers.

       By default, pptp establishes the PPTP call to the PPTP server,  and  then
       starts  an  instance  of pppd to manage the data transfer.  However, pptp
       can also be run as a connection manager within pppd.

OPTIONS
       The first non-option argument on the pptp command line must be  the  host
       name or IP address of the PPTP server.

       All  long  options  (starting with &quot;--&quot;) are interpreted as pptp options,
       and a fatal error occurs if an unrecognised option is used.

       All command-line arguments which do not start with &quot;-&quot; are interpreted as
       ppp options, and passed as is to pppd unless --nolaunchpppd is given.

       --phone &lt;number&gt;
              Pass &lt;number&gt; to remote host as phone number

       --nolaunchpppd
              Do  not  launch pppd but use stdin as the network connection.  Use
              this flag when including pptp as a pppd connection  process  using
              the pty option.  See EXAMPLES.

       --quirks &lt;quirk&gt;
              Work  around a buggy PPTP implementation, adopts special case han&#8208;
              dling for particular PPTP  servers  and  ADSL  modems.   Currently
              recognised values are BEZEQ_ISRAEL only

       --debug
              Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb)

       --sync Enable Synchronous HDLC (pppd must use it too)

       --timeout &lt;secs&gt;
              Time to wait for reordered packets (0.01 to 10 secs)

       --nobuffer
              Completely  disables  buffering  and  reordering  of packets.  Any
              --timeout specified will be ignored.

       --idle-wait &lt;secs&gt;
              Time to wait before sending a  control  connection  echo  request.
              The RFC2637 default is 60 seconds.

       --max-echo-wait &lt;secs&gt;
              Time  to wait for an echo reply before closing the control connec&#8208;
              tion.  The RFC2637 default is 60 seconds.

       --logstring &lt;name&gt;
              Use &lt;name&gt; instead of &apos;anon&apos; in syslog messages
&#12;       --localbind &lt;addr&gt;
              Bind to specified IP address instead of wildcard

       --loglevel &lt;level&gt;
              Sets the debugging level (0=low, 1=default, 2=high)


       --test-type &lt;n&gt;
              Enable packet reordering tests that damage the  integrity  of  the
              packet  stream to the server.  Use this only when testing servers.
              Zero is the default, and means that packets are sent in  the  cor&#8208;
              rect  order.   A value of one (1) causes a single swap between two
              packets, such that the sequence numbers might be 1 2 3 4 6 5  7  8
              9.   A  value  of  two (2) causes ten packets to be buffered, then
              sent out of order but ascending, such that  the  sequence  numbers
              might  be  1  2  3  4 16 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 20.  A
              value of three (3) causes ten packets to be buffered, then sent in
              the reverse order, like this; 1 2 3 4 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6
              5 17 18 19 20.


       --test-rate &lt;n&gt;
              Sets the number of packets to pass  before  causing  a  reordering
              test.   Default  is 100.  Has no effect if test-type is zero.  The
              result of test types 2 and 3 are undefined if this value  is  less
              than ten.



QUIRKS
       BEZEQ_ISRAEL
              modifies  packets  to  interoperate with Orckit ADSL modems on the
              BEZEQ network in Israel.


EXAMPLES
       Connection to a Microsoft Windows VPN Server

        pppd noauth nobsdcomp nodeflate require-mppe-128 name domain\\\\username
       remotename PPTP pty &quot;pptp 10.0.0.5 --nolaunchpppd&quot;

       Note  that  the  chap-secrets file used by pppd must include an entry for
       domain\\username


STATISTICS
       The pptp process collects statistics when sending and receiving GRE pack&#8208;
       ets.  They  are intended to be useful for debugging poor PPTP performance
       and for general monitoring of link quality. The statistics are cumulative
       since the pptp process was started.

       The  statistics can be viewed by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the &quot;GRE-to-
       PPP Gateway&quot; process, which will cause it to dump them to the system logs
       (at  the  LOG_NOTICE  level).  A  better way to present the statistics to
       applications is being sought (e.g. SNMP?).

       The following statistics are collected at  the  time  of  writing  (April
       2003):

       rx accepted
              the number of GRE packets successfully passed to PPP

       rx lost
              the  number  of  packets  never received, and presumed lost in the
              network
&#12;       rx under win
              the number of packets which were duplicates or  had  old  sequence
              numbers  (this  might  be caused by a packet-reordering network if
              your reordering timeout is set too low)

       rx over win
              the number of packets which were too far ahead in the sequence  to
              be  reordered (might be caused by loss of more than 300 packets in
              a row)

       rx buffered
              the number of packets which were slightly ahead of  sequence,  and
              were  either buffered for reordering, or if buffering is disabled,
              accepted immediately (resulting in the intermediate packets  being
              discarded).

       rx OS errors
              the  number  of times where the operating system reported an error
              when we tried to read a packet

       rx truncated
              the number of times we received a packet which  was  shorter  than
              the length implied by the GRE header

       rx invalid
              the  number  of  times  we  received a packet which had invalid or
              unsupported flags set in the header, wrong version, or wrong  pro&#8208;
              tocol.

       rx acks
              the  number  of pure acknowledgements received (without data). Too
              many of these will waste bandwidth, and might be solved by  tuning
              the remote host.

       tx sent
              the number of GRE packets sent with data

       tx failed
              the  number  of  packets  we tried to send, but the OS reported an
              error

       tx short
              the number of times the OS would  not  let  us  write  a  complete
              packet

       tx acks
              the number of times we sent a pure ack, without data

       tx oversize
              the  number of times we couldn&apos;t send a packet because it was over
              PACKET_MAX bytes long

       round trip
              the estimated round-trip time in milliseconds
