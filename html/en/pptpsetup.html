DESCRIPTION
       PPTP Client is a Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD client for the
       proprietary Microsoft Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, PPTP.

       This script configures PPTP Client on Linux.

OPTIONS
       --create TUNNEL create a tunnel named TUNNEL

       --delete TUNNEL delete the file /etc/ppp/peers/TUNNEL and any lines from
                       /etc/ppp/chap-secrets that contains &quot;TUNNEL&quot; as a single
