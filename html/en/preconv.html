PRECONV(1)                                                            PRECONV(1)



NAME
       preconv  -  convert encoding of input files to something GNU troff under&#8208;
       stands

SYNOPSIS
       preconv [-dr] [-e encoding] [files ...]
       preconv -h | --help
       preconv -v | --version

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -e command line option  and
       its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       preconv  reads  files and converts its encoding(s) to a form GNU troff(1)
       can process, sending the data to standard output.  Currently, this  means
       ASCII  characters  and `\[uXXXX]&apos; entities, where `XXXX&apos; is a hexadecimal
       number with four to six digits, representing a Unicode input code.   Nor&#8208;
       mally, preconv should be invoked with the -k and -K options of groff.

OPTIONS
       -d     Emit  debugging messages to standard error (mainly the used encod&#8208;
              ing).

       -Dencoding
              Specify default encoding if everything fails (see below).

       -eencoding
              Specify input encoding explicitly, overriding all  other  methods.
              This  corresponds  to  groff&apos;s  -Kencoding  option.   Without this
              switch, preconv uses the algorithm described below to  select  the
              input encoding.

       --help
       -h     Print help message.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests.

       --version
       -v     Print version number.

USAGE
       preconv tries to find the input encoding with the following algorithm.

       1.     If  the  input  encoding has been explicitly specified with option
              -e, use it.

       2.     Otherwise, check whether the input starts with a Byte  Order  Mark
              (BOM, see below).  If found, use it.

       3.     Finally,  check whether there is a known coding tag (see below) in
              either the first or second input line.  If found, use it.

       4.     If everything fails, use a default encoding as given  with  option
              -D,  by  the  current  locale, or `latin1&apos; if the locale is set to
              `C&apos;, `POSIX&apos;, or empty (in that order).

       Note that the groff program supports a GROFF_ENCODING  environment  vari&#8208;
       able which is eventually expanded to option -k.

   Byte Order Mark
       The  Unicode  Standard  defines  character  U+FEFF as the Byte Order Mark
       (BOM).  On the other hand, value U+FFFE is guaranteed not  be  a  Unicode
       character  at  all.  This allows to detect the byte order within the data
       stream (either  big-endian  or  lower-endian),  and  the  MIME  encodings
       `UTF-16&apos;  and  `UTF-32&apos;  mandate that the data stream starts with U+FEFF.
       Similarly, the data stream encoded as `UTF-8&apos; might start with a BOM  (to
       ease  the  conversion  from and to UTF-16 and UTF-32).  In all cases, the
       byte order mark is not part of the data but part of the  encoding  proto&#8208;
       col; in other words, preconv&apos;s output doesn&apos;t contain it.

       Note  that U+FEFF not at the start of the input data actually is emitted;
       it has then the meaning of a `zero  width  no-break  space&apos;  character  &#8211;
       something not needed normally in groff.

   Coding Tags
       Editors  which  support  more  than a single character encoding need tags
       within the input files to mark the file&apos;s encoding.  While it is possible
       to  guess  the right input encoding with the help of heuristic algorithms
       for data which represents a greater amount of a natural language,  it  is
       still  just  a guess.  Additionally, all algorithms fail easily for input
       which is either too short or doesn&apos;t represent a natural language.

       For these reasons, preconv supports the coding tag convention (with  some
       restrictions)  as  used  by GNU Emacs and XEmacs (and probably other pro&#8208;
       grams too).

       Coding tags in GNU Emacs and XEmacs are stored in  so-called  File  Vari&#8208;
       ables.   preconv  recognizes  the following syntax form which must be put
       into a troff comment in the first or second line.

              -*- tag1: value1; tag2: value2; ... -*-

       The only relevant tag for preconv is `coding&apos; which can take  the  values
       listed  below.   Here an example line which tells Emacs to edit a file in
       troff mode, and to use latin2 as its encoding.

              .\&quot; -*- mode: troff; coding: latin-2 -*-

       The following list gives all MIME coding tags (either lowercase or upper&#8208;
       case) supported by preconv; this list is hard-coded in the source.

              big5, cp1047, euc-jp, euc-kr, gb2312, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2,
              iso-8859-5, iso-8859-7, iso-8859-9, iso-8859-13, iso-8859-15,
              koi8-r, us-ascii, utf-8, utf-16, utf-16be, utf-16le

       In  addition,  the  following hard-coded list of other tags is recognized
       which eventually map to values from the list above.

              ascii, chinese-big5, chinese-euc, chinese-iso-8bit, cn-big5,
              cn-gb, cn-gb-2312, cp878, csascii, csisolatin1, cyrillic-iso-8bit,
              cyrillic-koi8, euc-china, euc-cn, euc-japan, euc-japan-1990,
              euc-korea, greek-iso-8bit, iso-10646/utf8, iso-10646/utf-8,
              iso-latin-1, iso-latin-2, iso-latin-5, iso-latin-7, iso-latin-9,
              japanese-euc, japanese-iso-8bit, jis8, koi8, korean-euc,
              korean-iso-8bit, latin-0, latin1, latin-1, latin-2, latin-5,
              latin-7, latin-9, mule-utf-8, mule-utf-16, mule-utf-16be,
              mule-utf-16-be, mule-utf-16be-with-signature, mule-utf-16le,
              mule-utf-16-le, mule-utf-16le-with-signature, utf8, utf-16-be,
              utf-16-be-with-signature, utf-16be-with-signature, utf-16-le,
              utf-16-le-with-signature, utf-16le-with-signature

       Those  tags  are  taken  from  GNU  Emacs  and XEmacs, together with some
       aliases.  Trailing `-dos&apos;, `-unix&apos;, and `-mac&apos; suffixes  of  coding  tags
       (which give the end-of-line convention used in the file) are stripped off
       before the comparison with the above tags happens.

   Iconv Issues
       preconv by itself only supports three  encodings:  latin-1,  cp1047,  and
       UTF-8; all other encodings are passed to the iconv library functions.  At
       compile time it is searched and checked for a valid iconv implementation;
       a call to `preconv --version&apos; shows whether iconv is used.

BUGS
       preconv  doesn&apos;t  support  local variable lists yet.  This is a different
       syntax form to specify local variables at the end of a file.
