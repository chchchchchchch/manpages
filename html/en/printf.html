       and all C format specifications ending with one  of  diouxXfeEgGcs,  with
       ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are handled.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of printf, which usually super&#8208;
       sedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell&apos;s  documen&#8208;
       tation for details about the options it supports.
