NAME
       projects - persistent project root defintion

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/projects file provides a mapping between numeric project identi&#8208;
       fiers and those directories which are the roots of the quota  tree.   Its
       format is simply:


            # comments are hash-prefixed
            # ...
            10:/export/cage
            42:/var/log

       The /etc/projects file is optional, instead xfs_quota(8) can be used with
       the -p argument to specify a project root directly for each operation.


SEE ALSO
       xfs_quota(8), xfsctl(3), projid(5).
