NAME
       projid - the project name mapping file

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/projid  file provides a mapping between numeric project identi&#8208;
       fiers and a simple human readable name (similar relationship to  the  one
       that exists between usernames and uids).  Its format is simply:

            # comments are hash-prefixed
            # ...
            cage:10
            logfiles:42


       This  file  is  optional,  if  a project identifier cannot be mapped to a
       name, it will be parsed and displayed as a numeric value.


SEE ALSO
       xfs_quota(8), xfsctl(3), projects(5).
