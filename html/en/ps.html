PS(1)                             User Commands                            PS(1)



NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.
       There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due
       to the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible
       with.

       Note that &quot;ps -aux&quot; is distinct from &quot;ps aux&quot;.  The POSIX and UNIX
       standards require that &quot;ps -aux&quot; print all processes owned by a user
       named &quot;x&quot;, as well as printing all processes that would be selected by
       the -a option.  If the user named &quot;x&quot; does not exist, this ps may
       interpret the command as &quot;ps aux&quot; instead and print a warning.  This
       behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It
       is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID
       (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as
       the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal
       associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in
       [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).
       Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the
       default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the
       executable name.  You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment
       variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process
       selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned
       by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be
       the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other
       users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when
       options are described as being &quot;identical&quot; below, so -M will be
       considered identical to Z and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The
       default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added
       to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if
       it meets any of the given selection criteria.

EXAMPLES
       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
          ps -e
          ps -ef
          ps -eF
          ps -ely

       To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
          ps ax
          ps axu

       To print a process tree:
          ps -ejH
          ps axjf

       To get info about threads:
          ps -eLf
          ps axms

       To get security info:
          ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label
          ps axZ
          ps -eM

       To see every process running as root (real &amp; effective ID) in user
       format:
          ps -U root -u root u

       To see every process with a user-defined format:
          ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm
          ps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm
          ps -Ao pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan

       Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
          ps -C syslogd -o pid=

       Print only the name of PID 42:
          ps -p 42 -o comm=

SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION
       a      Lift the BSD-style &quot;only yourself&quot; restriction, which is imposed
              upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;)
              options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.
              The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the
              set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate
              description is that this option causes ps to list all processes
              with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together
              with the x option.

       -A     Select all processes.  Identical to -e.

       -a     Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2))
              and processes not associated with a terminal.

       -d     Select all processes except session leaders.

       --deselect
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to -N.

       -e     Select all processes.  Identical to -A.

       g      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may
              be discontinued in a future release.  It is normally implied by
              the a flag, and is only useful when operating in the sunos4
              personality.

       -N     Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to --deselect.

       T      Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical to
              the t option without any argument.

       r      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       x      Lift the BSD-style &quot;must have a tty&quot; restriction, which is imposed
              upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;)
              options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.
              The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the
              set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate
              description is that this option causes ps to list all processes
              owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used
              together with the a option.

PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST
       These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated
       or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.  For example:
       ps -p &quot;1 2&quot; -p 3,4

       -123   Identical to --pid 123.

       123    Identical to --pid 123.

       -C cmdlist
              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose
              executable name is given in cmdlist.

       -G grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose real group name or ID is in the grplist list.  The
              real group ID identifies the group of the user who created the
              process, see getgid(2).

       -g grplist
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by
              session is specified by many standards, but selection by effective
              group is the logical behavior that several other operating systems
              use.  This ps will select by session when the list is completely
              numeric (as sessionsare).  Group ID numbers will work only when
              some group names are also specified.  See the -s and --group
              options.

       --Group grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to -G.

       --group grplist
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective group name or ID is in grouplist.  The
              effective group ID describes the group whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).  The -g
              option is often an alternative to --group.

       p pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and --pid.

       -p pidlist
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID
              numbers appear in pidlist.  Identical to p and --pid.

       --pid pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and p.

       --ppid pidlist
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a
              parent process ID in pidlist.  That is, it selects processes that
              are children of those listed in pidlist.

       -s sesslist
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session
              ID specified in sesslist.

       --sid sesslist
              Select by session ID.  Identical to -s.
&#12;       t ttylist
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can also be
              used with an empty ttylist to indicate the terminal associated
              with ps.  Using the T option is considered cleaner than using t
              with an empty ttylist.

       -t ttylist
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the
              terminals given in ttylist.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for text
              output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.
              A plain &quot;-&quot; may be used to select processes not attached to any
              terminal.

       --tty ttylist
              Select by terminal.  Identical to -t and t.

       U userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.  The
              effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions
              are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical to -u and
              --user.

       -U userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes
              whose real user name or ID is in the userlist list.  The real user
              ID identifies the user who created the process, see getuid(2).

       -u userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical
              to U and --user.

       --User userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to -U.

       --user userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to -u and
              U.

OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps.  The
       output may differ by personality.

       -c     Show different scheduler information for the -l option.

       --context
              Display security context format (for SE Linux).

       -f     Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many
              other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also
              causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with -L,
              the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be
              added.  See the c option, the format keyword args, and the format
              keyword comm.

       -F     Extra full format.  See the -f option, which -F implies.

       --format format
              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

       j      BSD job control format.

       -j     Jobs format.
&#12;       l      Display BSD long format.

       -l     Long format.  The -y option is often useful with this.

       -M     Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SE Linux).

       O format
              is preloaded o (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O
              (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or
              can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to
              determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired
              behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option
              in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).  When used as a
              formatting option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD
              personality.

       -O format
              Like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to
              -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command or -o pid,format,tname,
              time,cmd, see -o below.

       o format
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to -o and --format.

       -o format
              User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the form of a
              blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a way to
              specify individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are
              described in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section below.
              Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command)
              as desired.  If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=)
              then the header line will not be output.  Column width will
              increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up
              columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).
              Explicit width control (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The
              behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies with personality; output may
              be one column named &quot;X,comm=Y&quot; or two columns named &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.
              Use multiple -o options when in doubt.  Use the PS_FORMAT
              environment variable to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and
              DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or
              BSD columns.

       s      Display signal format.

       u      Display user-oriented format.

       v      Display virtual memory format.

       X      Register format.

       -y     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can
              only be used with -l.

       Z      Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SE Linux).

OUTPUT MODIFIERS
       c      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of the
              executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command
              arguments and any modifications to them are thus not shown.  This
              option effectively turns the args format keyword into the comm
              format keyword; it is useful with the -f format option and with
              the various BSD-style format options, which all normally display
              the command arguments.  See the -f option, the format keyword
              args, and the format keyword comm.

       --cols n
              Set screen width.
&#12;       --columns n
              Set screen width.

       --cumulative
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

       e      Show the environment after the command.

       f      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       --forest
              ASCII art process tree.

       h      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).
              The h option is problematic.  Standard BSD ps uses this option to
              print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses
              this option to totally disable the header.  This version of ps
              follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD
              personality has been selected, in which case it prints a header on
              each page of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you
              can use the long options --headers and --no-headers to enable
              printing headers each page or disable headers entirely,
              respectively.

       -H     Show process hierarchy (forest).

       --headers
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       k spec Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  The &quot;+&quot; is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.
              Identical to --sort.

                      Examples:
                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
                      ps axk comm o comm,args
                      ps kstart_time -ef

       --lines n
              Set screen height.

       -n namelist
              Set namelist file.  Identical to N.  The namelist file is needed
              for a proper WCHAN display, and must match the current Linux
              kernel exactly for correct output.  Without this option, the
              default search path for the namelist is:

                      $PS_SYSMAP
                      $PS_SYSTEM_MAP
                      /proc/*/wchan
                      /boot/System.map-$(uname -r)
                      /boot/System.map
                      /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/System.map
                      /usr/src/linux/System.map
                      /System.map

       n      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID and
              GID).

       N namelist
              Specify namelist file.  Identical to -n, see -n above.

       --no-headers
              Print no header line at all.  --no-heading is an alias for this
              option.
&#12;       O order
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O
              (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or
              can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to
              determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired
              behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option
              in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is
              O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing
              according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of
              one-letter short keys k1,k2, ...  described in the OBSOLETE SORT
              KEYS section below.  The &quot;+&quot; is currently optional, merely
              re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to
              distinguish an O sort from an O format.  The &quot;-&quot; reverses
              direction only on the key it precedes.

       --rows n
              Set screen height.

       S      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child
              processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a
              system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived
              children to do work.

       --sort spec
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  The &quot;+&quot; is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.
              Identical to k.  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid

       w      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       -w     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       --width n
              Set screen width.

NOTES
       This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ps does not
       need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not give this
       ps any special permissions.

       This ps needs access to namelist data for proper WCHAN display.  For
       kernels prior to 2.6, the System.map file must be installed.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running
       during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and it does
       not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is
       unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don&apos;t count some parts of a process including the
       page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct task_struct.
       This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident.  SIZE
       is the virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).

       Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called &quot;zombies&quot;) that
       remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.  These
       processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display
       column, the numeric user ID is displayed instead.

PROCESS FLAGS
       The sum of these values is displayed in the &quot;F&quot; column, which is provided
       by the flags output specifier:

               1    forked but didn&apos;t exec
               4    used super-user privileges

PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output
       specifiers (header &quot;STAT&quot; or &quot;S&quot;) will display to describe the state of a
       process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is
                    being traced
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct (&quot;zombie&quot;) process, terminated but not reaped by its
                    parent

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters
       may be displayed:

               &lt;    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads
                    do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

OBSOLETE SORT KEYS
       These keys are used by the BSD O option (when it is used for sorting).
       The GNU --sort option doesn&apos;t use these keys, but the specifiers
       described below in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  Note that the
       values used in sorting are the internal values ps uses and not the
       &quot;cooked&quot; values used in some of the output format fields (e.g.  sorting
       on tty will sort into device number, not according to the terminal name
       displayed).  Pipe ps output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort
       the cooked values.

AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS
       This ps supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the
       formatting codes of printf(1) and printf(3).  For example, the normal
       default output can be produced with this: ps -eo &quot;%p %y %x %c&quot;.  The
       NORMAL codes are described in the next section.

STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output
       format (e.g. with option -o) or to sort the selected processes with the
       GNU-style --sort option.

       For example: ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user

       This version of ps tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other
       implementations of ps.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces:
       args, cmd, comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm, lstart, bsdstart, start.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.


       expand; lB1 lB1 lBw(51n) lB1 l1  l.  CODE HEADER    DESCRIPTION

       %cpu %CPU T{ cpu utilization of the process in &quot;##.#&quot; format.  Currently,
       it is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running
       (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage.  It will not add up
       to 100% unless you are lucky.  (alias pcpu).  T}

       %mem %MEM T{ ratio of the process&apos;s resident set size  to the physical
       memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.  (alias pmem).  T}

       args COMMAND   T{ command with all its arguments as a string.
       Modifications to the arguments may be shown.  The output in this column
       may contain spaces.  A process marked &lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead, waiting
       to be fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes the process args will be
       unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead print the executable name
       in brackets.  (alias cmd, command).  See also the comm format keyword,
       the -f option, and the c option.
       When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.
       If ps can not determine display width, as when output is redirected
       (piped) into a file or another command, the output width is undefined (it
       may be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM variable, and so on).  The
       COLUMNS environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly
       determine the width in this case.  The w or -w option may be also be used
       to adjust width.  T}

       blocked   BLOCKED   T{ mask of the blocked signals, see signal(7).
       According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64-bit mask in hexadecimal
       format is displayed.  (alias sig_block, sigmask).  T}

       bsdstart  START     T{ time the command started.  If the process was
       started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is &quot; HH:MM&quot;, else it is
       &quot; Mmm:SS&quot; (where Mmm is the three letters of the month).  See also
       lstart, start, start_time, and stime.  T}

       bsdtime   TIME T{ accumulated cpu time, user + system.  The display
       format is usually &quot;MMM:SS&quot;, but can be shifted to the right if the
       process used more than 999 minutes of cpu time.  T}

       c    C    T{ processor utilization. Currently, this is the integer value
       of the percent usage over the lifetime of the process.  (see %cpu).  T}

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables could affect ps:

       COLUMNS
          Override default display width.

       LINES
          Override default display height.

       PS_PERSONALITY
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...  (see section
          PERSONALITY below).

       CMD_ENV
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...  (see section
          PERSONALITY below).

       I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS
          Force obsolete command line interpretation.

       LC_TIME
          Date format.

       PS_COLORS
          Not currently supported.
&#12;       PS_FORMAT
          Default output format override. You may set this to a format string of
          the type used for the -o option.  The DefSysV and DefBSD values are
          particularly useful.

       PS_SYSMAP
          Default namelist (System.map) location.

       PS_SYSTEM_MAP
          Default namelist (System.map) location.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
          Don&apos;t find excuses to ignore bad &quot;features&quot;.

       POSIX2
          When set to &quot;on&quot;, acts as POSIXLY_CORRECT.

       UNIX95
          Don&apos;t find excuses to ignore bad &quot;features&quot;.

       _XPG
          Cancel CMD_ENV=irix non-standard behavior.

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables.  The one exception
       is CMD_ENV or PS_PERSONALITY, which could be set to Linux for normal
       systems.  Without that setting, ps follows the useless and bad parts of
       the Unix98 standard.

AUTHOR
       ps was originally written by Branko Lankester &#10216;lankeste@fwi.uva.nl&#10217;.
       Michael K. Johnson &#10216;johnsonm@redhat.com&#10217; re-wrote it significantly to use
       the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.  Michael
       Shields &#10216;mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu&#10217; added the pid-list feature.  Charles
       Blake &#10216;cblake@bbn.com&#10217; added multi-level sorting, the dirent-style
       library, the device name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate
       binary search directly on System.map, and many code and documentation
       cleanups.  David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psup&#8208;
       date.  Albert Cahalan &#10216;albert@users.sf.net&#10217; rewrote ps for full Unix98
       and BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and foreign syn&#8208;
       tax.
