PS2ASCII(1)                     Ghostscript Tools                    PS2ASCII(1)



NAME
       ps2ascii - Ghostscript translator from PostScript or PDF to ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ascii [ input.ps [ output.txt ] ]
       ps2ascii input.pdf [ output.txt ]

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ascii  uses  gs(1)  to extract ASCII text from PostScript(tm) or Adobe
       Portable Document Format (PDF) files. If no files are  specified  on  the
       command  line, gs reads from standard input; but PDF input must come from
       an explicitly-named file, not standard input.  If no output file is spec&#8208;
       ified, the ASCII text is written to standard output.

       ps2ascii  doesn&apos;t  look  at font encoding, and isn&apos;t very good at dealing
       with kerning, so for PostScript (but not currently PDF), you  might  con&#8208;
       sider pstotext (see below).

FILES
       Run  &quot;gs  -h&quot;  to  find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your
       system, from which you can get more details.
