PS2EPSI(1)                      Ghostscript Tools                     PS2EPSI(1)



NAME
       ps2epsi - generate conforming Encapsulated PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ] (Unix)
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epi ] (DOS)

DESCRIPTION
       ps2epsi  uses gs(1) to process a PostScript(tm) file and generate as out&#8208;
       put a new file which conforms to Adobe&apos;s Encapsulated  PostScript  Inter&#8208;
       change  (EPSI) format.  EPSI is a special form of encapsulated PostScript
       (EPS) which adds to the beginning of the file in the form  of  PostScript
       comments a bitmapped version of the final displayed page.  Programs which
       understand EPSI (usually word processors or DTP programs)  can  use  this
       bitmap  to  give a preview version on screen of the PostScript.  The dis&#8208;
       played quality is often not very good (e.g., low resolution, no colours),
       but  the final printed version uses the real PostScript, and thus has the
       normal PostScript quality.

USAGE
       On Unix systems invoke ps2epsi like this:

            ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ]

       where &quot;infile.ps&quot; is the input file and &quot;outfile.epsi&quot; is  the  resulting
       EPSI  file.   If the output filename is omitted, it is generated from the
       input filename.  When a standard  extension  (&quot;.ps&quot;,  &quot;.cps&quot;,  &quot;.eps&quot;  or
       &quot;.epsf&quot;)  is  used, it is replaced with the output extension &quot;.epsi&quot;.  On
       DOS systems the command is:

            ps2epsi infile.ps outfile.epi

       where &quot;infile.ps&quot; is the original PostScript file, and  &quot;outfile.epi&quot;  is
       the name of the output file.

LIMITATIONS
       Not every PostScript file can be encapsulated successfully, because there
       are restrictions on what PostScript  constructs  a  correct  encapsulated
       file may contain.  ps2epsi does a little extra work to try to help encap&#8208;
       sulation, and it automatically calculates the bounding box  required  for
       all  encapsulated  PostScript files, so most of the time it does a pretty
       good job. There are certain to be cases, however, where the encapsulation
       does not work because of the content of the original PostScript file.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  Framemaker  DTP  system  is  one  application which understands EPSI
       files, and ps2epsi has been tested on a  number  of  PostScript  diagrams
       from  a  variety  of  sources, using Framemaker 3.0 on a Sun workstation.
       Framemaker on other platforms should be able to use these files, although
       I have not been able to test this.
