NAME
       ps2frag - obsolete shell script for the PSfrag system.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
       The  new PSfrag system no longer requires the ps2frag script; instead, it
       handles the processing entirely within TeX/LaTeX and DVIPS. I&apos;m sure  you
       will agree that never needing to run ps2frag again is a nice convenience!

       However,  there  are two significant differences in the way this new ver&#8208;
       sion of PSfrag works. Please make yourself aware of them:

       1) XDvi is no longer able to determine  where  your  PSfrag  replacements
       should  go, so instead it lines them up in a vertical list to the left of
       the figure. This allows you to confirm that they have been typeset  prop&#8208;
       erly,  at  least. However, to confirm that PSfrag positions your replace&#8208;
       ments properly, you will have to view the PostScript version of your file
       with a viewer like GhostView, or print it out.  This seems to be the only
       disadvantage to the elimination of the pre-processing step.

       2) If you embed &apos;\tex&apos; commands inside your  figures,  you  now  need  to
       explicitly _tell_ PSfrag to process these commands. To do so, use \usepa&#8208;
       ckage[scanall]{psfrag} instead of \usepackage{psfrag} at the beginning of
       your LaTeX file.

       If you only use &apos;\tex&apos; commands in a small number of figures, then a more
       efficient might be to turn on &apos;\tex&apos;-scanning only for those figures.  To
       do that, add the command &apos;\psfragscanon&apos; immediately before each relevant
       \includegraphics or \epsfbox command.

NOTES
       See the PSfrag documentation for further information.
