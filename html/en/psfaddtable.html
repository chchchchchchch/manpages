PSFADDTABLE(1)                                                    PSFADDTABLE(1)



NAME
       psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font

SYNOPSIS
       psfaddtable fontfile tablefile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       psfaddtable  takes  a  console  font in .psf format given by fontfile and
       merges it with the Unicode character table given by tablefile to  produce
       a  font  file  with an embedded character table, which is written to out&#8208;
       file.  An input file name of &quot;-&quot; denotes standard input,  and  an  output
       file  name  of &quot;-&quot; denotes standard output.  If the fontfile already con&#8208;
       tains an embedded character table, it is ignored.

TABLE FILE FORMAT
       Each line in the tablefile should be  either  blank,  contain  a  comment
       (preceded  by  #),  or  contain  a  sequence of numbers in either decimal
       (default), octal (preceded by 0), or hexadecimal (preceded by 0x) format,
       separated by spaces or tabs.  The first number on each line indicates the
       glyph slot in the font that is being referred to, this is between  0  and
       0xff  for  a 256-character font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.
       Any subsequent numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this spe&#8208;
       cific glyph slot.  Instead of a single Unicode one may have a sequence of
       Unicodes separates by commas, to denote that the glyph depicts the corre&#8208;
       sponding  composed  symbol.  It is permissible to have multiple lines for
       the same glyph.
