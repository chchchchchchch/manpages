NAME
       psidtopgm - convert PostScript &quot;image&quot; data into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       psidtopgm width height bits/sample [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  the &quot;image&quot; data from a PostScript file as input.  Produces a por&#8208;
       table graymap as output.

       This program is obsoleted by pstopnm.  What follows  was  written  before
       pstopnm existed.

       This  is  a  very simple and limited program, and is here only because so
       many people have asked for it.  To use it you have  to  manually  extract
       the  readhexstring  data portion from your PostScript file, and then give
       the width, height, and bits/sample  on  the  command  line.   Before  you
       attempt  this,  you  should  at least read the description of the &quot;image&quot;
       operator in the PostScript Language Reference Manual.

       It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this filter
       to  read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the variation is too
       great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of course, you  want  to
       write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
