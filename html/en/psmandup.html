PSMANDUP(1)                            FSF                           PSMANDUP(1)



NAME
       psmandup - print duplex on non duplex printers

SYNOPSIS
       psmandup FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Tries  to  produce  a  version  of the PostScript FILE to print in manual
       Duplex.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -q, --quiet
              don&apos;t print informational messages

       -o, --output=FILE
              save result in FILE.  If FILE is `-&apos;, send to stdout

       -n, --no-fix
              don&apos;t call fixps to fix PS problems in FILE

       -f, --front
              output only the front pages (recto) on the regular tray

       -b, --back
              output only the back pages (verso) on the manual feed tray

       Produced output is meant for PS level  2  printers  which  don&apos;t  support
       Duplex printing, but support Manual Feed.  Once the first set of pages is
       printed (odd pages), manual feed is asked: introduce  the  odd  pages  to
       print the even pages on the other side.

       Because  there  is  usually  a  short time out for manually fed jobs, you
       should really be next to the printer.  If ever the time out expired,  use
       the option -b to send only the missing part.

       Environment  variables FIXPS, PSSELECT and PSSET, if defined, are used to
       find the tools.
