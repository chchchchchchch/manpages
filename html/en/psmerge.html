NAME
       psmerge - filter to merge several PostScript files into one

SYNOPSIS
       psmerge [ -oout.ps ] file.ps ...

DESCRIPTION
       Psmerge merges PostScript documents into a single document. It only works
       in the specific case the the files were created using the  same  applica&#8208;
       tion,  with  the  same  device setup and resources (fonts, procsets, pat&#8208;
       terns, files, etc) loaded.

       If the -o option is used, output will be sent to the file  named,  other&#8208;
       wise it will go to standard output.

       Psmerge  will  merge multiple files concatenated into a single file as if
       they were in separate files.
