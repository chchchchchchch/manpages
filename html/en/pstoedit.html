   FROM GSVIEW
       Pstoedit can be called from within gsview via &quot;Edit | Convert  to  vector
       format&quot;

   FROM PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE ALDUS GRAPHIC IMPORT FILTER INTERFACE
       pstoedit can also be used as PostScript and PDF graphic import filter for
       several programs including MS-Office, PaintShop-Pro  and  PhotoLine.  See
       http://www.pstoedit.net/importps/ for more details.

DESCRIPTION
   RELEASE LEVEL
       This manpage documents release 3.60 of pstoedit.

   USE
       pstoedit converts PostScript and PDF files to various vector graphic for&#8208;
       mats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various  drawing
       packages. Type

       pstoedit -help

       to  get  a  list of supported output formats. Pstoedit comes with a large
       set of format drivers integrated in the binary. Additional drivers can be
       installed  as plugins and are available via http://www.pstoedit.net/plug&#8208;
       ins/.  Just copy the plugins to the same  directory  where  the  pstoedit
       binary  is  installed  or  - under Unix like systems only - alternatively
       into the lib directory parallel to the bin directory  where  pstoedit  is
       installed.

       However,  unless  you  also  get a license key for the plugins, the addi&#8208;
       tional drivers will slightly distort the resulting graphics. See the doc&#8208;
       umentation provided with the plugins for further details.

   PRINCIPLE OF CONVERSION
       pstoedit  works  by redefining the some basic painting operators of Post&#8208;
       Script, e.g. stroke or show (bitmaps drawn by the image operator are  not
       supported  by  all output formats.) After redefining these operators, the
       PostScript or PDF file that needs to be converted is processed by a Post&#8208;
       Script interpreter, e.g., Ghostscript (gs(1)).  You normally need to have
       a PostScript interpreter installed in order to use this program. However,
       you  can  perform  some &quot;back end only&quot; processing of files following the
       conventions of the pstoedit intermediate formate by  specifying  the  -bo
       option. See &quot;Available formats and their specific options&quot; below.

       The  output that is written by the interpreter due to the redefinition of
       the drawing operators is a sort of &apos;flat&apos; PostScript file  that  contains
       only  simple  operations  like moveto, lineto, show, etc. You can look at
       this file using the -f debug option.

       This output is read by end-processing functions of pstoedit and  triggers
       the  drawing  functions  in  the  selected  output format driver sometime
       called also &quot;backend&quot;.

   NOTES
       If you want to process PDF files directly,  your  PostScript  interpreter
       must  provide  this  feature, as does Ghostscript. Aladdin Ghostscript is
       recommended for processing PDF and PostScript files.

OPTIONS
   GENERAL OPTIONS
       [-include name of a PostScript file to be included]
               This options allows to specify an additional PostScript file that
              will  be  executed  just  before the normal input is read. This is
              helpful for including specific  page  settings  or  for  disabling
              potentially  unsafe  PostScript operators, e.g., file, renamefile,
              or deletefile.

       [-xscale number]
               scale by a factor in x-direction

       [-yscale number]
               scale by a factor in y-direction

       [-xshift number]
               shift image in x-direction

       [-yshift number]
               shift image in y-direction

       [-centered]
               center image before scaling or shifting

       [-minlinewidth number]
               minimal line width. All lines thinner than this will be drawn  in
              this line width - especially zero-width lines

       [-split]
               Create a new file for each page of the input. For this the output
              filename must contain a %d which is replaced with the current page
              number.  This  option is automatically switched on for output for&#8208;
              mats that don&apos;t support multiple pages within one file,  e.g.  fig
              or gnuplot.

       [-usebbfrominput]
               If  specified,  pstoedit  uses  the BoundingBox as is (hopefully)
              found in the input file instead of one that is calculated  by  its
              own.

       [-page page number]
               Select a single page from a multi page PostScript or PDF file.

       [-rgb]
               Since  version 3.30 pstoedit uses the CMYK colors internally. The
              -rgb option turns on the old behavior to use RGB values.

       [-useagl]
               use Adobe Glyph List instead of  the  IsoLatin1  table  (this  is
              experimental)

       [-noclip]
               don&apos;t use clipping (relevant only if output format supports clip&#8208;
              ping at all)

       [-rotate angle (0-360)]
               Rotage image by angle.

       [-pagesize page format]
               set page size for output medium.  This option sets the page  size
              for  the output medium. Currently this is just used by the libplot
              output format driver, but might be used  by  other  output  format
              drivers  in  future.  The  page  size is specified in terms of the
              usual page size names, e.g. letter or a4.

       [-help]
               show the help information

       [-gs path to the ghostscript executable/DLL ]
               tells pstoedit which ghostscript executable/DLL to  use  -  over&#8208;
              writes the internal search heuristic

       [-bo]
               You  can  run  backend  processing  only  (without the PostScript
              interpreter frontend) by first running  pstoedit  -f  dump  infile
              dumpfile and then running pstoedit -f format -bo dumpfile outfile.

       [-psarg argument string]
               The  string  given  with this option is passed directly to Ghost&#8208;
              script when Ghostscript is called to process the  PostScript  file
              for  pstoedit.   For example: -psarg &quot;-r300x300&quot;.  This causes the
              resolution to be changed to 300x300 dpi. (With older  versions  of
              GhostScript,  changing  the resolution this way has an effect only
              if the -dis option is given.) If you want to pass multiple options
              to  Ghostscript  you  can  use multiple -psarg options -psarg opt1
              -psarg opt2 -psarg opt2.  See the  GhostScript  manual  for  other
              possible options.

       [-pslanguagelevel PostScript Language Level to be used 1,2, or 3]
               PostScript  Language  Level  to  be used 1,2, or 3 You can switch
              Ghostscript into PostScript Level 1 only mode by  -pslanguagelevel
              1.   This  can  be useful for example if the PostScript file to be
              converted uses some Level 2 specific custom color models that  are
              not  supported  by pstoedit. However, this requires that the Post&#8208;
              Script program checks for the PostScript level  supported  by  the
              interpreter  and &quot;acts&quot; accordingly. The default language level is
              3.

       -f &quot;format[:options]&quot;
               target output format recognized by pstoedit.  Since other  format
              drivers  can  be  loaded dynamically, type pstoedit -help to get a
              full list of formats. See &quot;Available formats  and  their  specific
              options &quot; below for an explanation of the [:options] to -f format.
              If the format option is not given, pstoedit  tries  to  guess  the
              target  format from the suffix of the output filename. However, in
              a lot of cases, this is not a unique mapping  and  hence  pstoedit
              demands the -f option.

       [-gsregbase GhostScript base registry path]
               registry  path  to  use as a base path when searching GhostScript
              interpreter This option provides means to specify a  registry  key
              under  HKLM/Software  where to search for GS interpreter key, ver&#8208;
              sion and GS_DLL / GS_LIB values. Example:  &quot;-gsregbase  MyCompany&quot;
              means   that   HKLM/Software/MyCompany/GPL  GhostScript  would  be
              searched instead of HKLM/Software/GPL GhostScript.

   TEXT AND FONT HANDLING RELATED OPTIONS
       [-df font name]
               Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript program do  not  have  a
              fontname.  For example, this happens in PostScript files generated
              by dvips(1).  In such a case pstoedit uses a replacement font. The
              default  for  this is Courier. Another font can be specified using
              the -df option. -df Helvetica  causes  all  unnamed  fonts  to  be
              replaced by Helvetica.

       [-nomaptoisolatin1]
               Normally pstoedit maps all character codes to the ones defined by
              the ISO-Latin1 encoding. If you specify -nomaptoisolatin1 then the
              encoding from the input PostScript is passed unchanged to the out&#8208;
              put. This may result in strange text output but on the other  hand
              may be the only way to get some fonts converted appropriately. Try
              what fits best to your concrete case.

       [-dt]
               Draw text - Text is drawn as polygons. This might produce a large
              output  file.  This  option  is  automatically  switched on if the
              selected output format does not support text, e.g. gnuplot(1).

       [-adt]
               Automatic Draw text - This option turns on the -dt option  selec&#8208;
              tively  for  fonts that seem to be no normal text fonts, e.g. Sym&#8208;
              bol..

       [-ndt]
               Never Draw text - fully disable the heuristics used  by  pstoedit
              to  decide when to &quot;draw&quot; text instead of showing it as text. This
              may produce incorrect results, but in some cases it  might  never&#8208;
              theless be useful. &quot;Use at own risk&quot;.

       [-correctdefinefont]
               Some  PostScript  files,  e.g. such as generated by ChemDraw, use
              the PostScript definefont operator in  way  that  is  incompatible
              with pstoedit&apos;s assumptions. The new font is defined by copying an
              old font without changing the FontName of the new font. When  this
              option  is  applied, some &quot;patches&quot; are done after a definefont in
              order to make it again  compatible  with  pstoedit&apos;s  assumptions.
              This  option  is not enabled per default, since it may break other
              PostScript file. It is tested only with ChemDraw generated files.

       [-pti]
               Precision text - Normally a text string is drawn as it occurs  in
              the  input  file.  However, in some situations, this might produce
              wrongly positioned characters. This is due to limitiations in most
              output  formats of pstoedit. They cannot represent text with arbi&#8208;
              tray inter-letter spacing which is  easily  possible  in  PDF  and
              PostScript.  With  -pta, each character of a text string is placed
              separately. With -pti, this is done only in cases when there is  a
              non zero inter-letter spacing. The downside of &quot;precision text&quot; is
              a bigger file size and hard to edit text.

       [-pta]
               see -pti

       [-uchar character]
               Sometimes pstoedit cannot map a character from the encoding  used
              by  the PostScript file to the font encoding of the target format.
              In this case pstoedit replaces the input character  by  a  special
              character  in order to show all the places that couldn&apos;t be mapped
              correctly. The default for this is a &quot;#&quot;. Using the -uchar  option
              it is possible to specify another character to be used instead. If
              you want to use a space, use -uchar &quot; &quot;.

       [-t2fontsast1]
               Handle type 2 fonts same as type 1. Type 2 fonts sometimes  occur
              as  embedded  fonts  within  PDF  files. In the default mode, text
              using such fonts is drawn as polygons since pstoedit assumes  that
              such  a font is not available on the users machine. If this option
              is set, pstoedit assumes that the internal  encoding  follows  the
              same as for a standard font and generates normal text output. This
              assumption may not be true in all cases. But it is nearly impossi&#8208;
              ble for pstoedit to verify this assumption - it would have to do a
              sort of OCR.

       [-nfr]
               In normal mode pstoedit replaces bitmap  fonts  with  a  font  as
              defined  by the -df option. This is done, because most output for&#8208;
              mats can&apos;t handle such fonts. This behavior can  be  switched  off
              using the -nfr option but then it strongly depends on the applica&#8208;
              tion reading the the generated file whether the file is usable and
              correctly interpreted or not. Any problems are then out of control
              of pstoedit.

       [-glyphs]
               pass glyph names to the output format driver. So  far  no  output
              format  driver  really uses the glyph names, so this does not have
              any effect at the moment. It is a preparation for future work.

       [-useoldnormalization]
               Just use this option in case the new heuristic introduced in  3.5
              doesn&apos;t  produce  correct results - however, this normalization of
              font encoding will always be a best-effort approach since there is
              no real general solution to it with reasonable effort

       [-fontmap name of font map file for pstoedit]
               The  font  map is a simple text file containing lines in the fol&#8208;
              lowing format:

       document_font_name target_font_name
       Lines beginning with % are considerd comments
       If a font name contains spaces, use the &quot;font name with spaces&quot; notation.

       Each font name found in the document is checked against this mapping  and
       if there is a corresponding entry, the new name is used for the output.

       If the -fontmap option is not specified, pstoedit automatically looks for
       the file drivername.fmp in the installation directory and uses that  file
       as a default fontmap file if available. The installation directory is:

              *      Windows:  The  same directory where the pstoedit executable
                     is located

              *      Unix:
                     &lt;The directory where the pstoedit  executably  is  located&gt;
                     /../lib/

       The mpost.fmp in the misc directory of the pstoedit distibution is a sam&#8208;
       ple map file with mappings from over 5000 PostScript font names to  their
       TeXequivalents.  This  is useful because MetaPost is frequently used with
       TeX/LaTeX and those programs don&apos;t use standard font names. This file and
       the   MetaPost   output   format  driver  are  provided  by  Scott  Pakin
       (scott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org).  Another example is wemf.fmp to be used under
       Windows. See the misc directory of the pstoedit source distribution.

   DEBUG OPTIONS
       [-dis]
               Open  a display during processing by Ghostscript. Some files only
              work correctly this way.

       [-q]
               quiet mode - do not write startup message

       [-nq]
               No exit from the  PostScript  interpreter.  Normally  Ghostscript
              exits  after  processing the pstoedit input-file. For debugging it
              can be useful to avoid this. If you do, you will have to type quit
              at the GS&gt; prompt to exit from Ghostscript.

       [-v]
               Switch on verbose mode. Some additional information is shown dur&#8208;
              ing processing.

       [-nb]
               Since version 3.10 pstoedit  uses  the  -dDELAYBIND  option  when
              calling  GhostScript.  Previously  the  -dNOBIND  option  was used
              instead but that sometimes caused problems if a user&apos;s  PostScript
              file  overloaded  standard  PostScript  operator  with totally new
              semantic, e.g. lt for lineto instead of the  standard  meaning  of
              &quot;less  than&quot;.  Using  -nb  the old style can be activated again in
              case the -dDELAYBIND gives different results as before. In such  a
              case please also contact the author.

       [-ups]
               write  text as plain string instead of hex string in intermediate
              format - normally useful for trouble shooting and debugging only.

       [-keep]
               keep the intermediate files produced by pstoedit - for debug pur&#8208;
              poses only

       [-gstest]
               perform a basic test for the interworking with GhostScript

   DRAWING RELATED OPTIONS
       [-nc]
               no curves.  Normally pstoedit tries to keep curves from the input
              and transfers them to the output if  the  output  format  supports
              curves.  If  the  output  format  does  not  support  curves, then
              pstoedit replaces curves by a series  of  lines  (see  also  -flat
              option).  However,  in some cases the user might wish to have this
              behavior also for output formats that originally  support  curves.
              This can be forced via the -nc option.

       [-nsp]
               normally  subpathes  are  used if the output format support them.
              This option turns off subpathes.

       [-mergelines]
               Some output formats permit the representation of filled  polygons
              with  edges  that  are  in  a different color than the fill color.
              Since PostScript does not support this  by  the  standard  drawing
              primitives  directly,  drawing  programs  typically  generate  two
              objects (the outline and the filled polygon) into  the  PostScript
              output.  pstoedit  is able to recombine these, if they follow each
              other directly and you specify -mergelines.  However, this merging
              is  not supported by all output formats due to restrictions in the
              target format.

       [-filledrecttostroke]
               Rectangles filled with a  solid  color  can  be  converted  to  a
              stroked  line  with  a  width that corresponds to the width of the
              rectangle. This is of primary interest for output formats which do
              not  support  filled polygons at all. But it is restricted to rec&#8208;
              tangles only, i.e. it is not supported for general polygons

       [-mergetext]
               In order to produce nice looking text output, programs  producing
              PostScript  files  often split words into smaller pieces which are
              then placed individually  on  adjacent  positions.  However,  such
              split  text is hard to edit later on and hence it is sometime bet&#8208;
              ter to recombine these pieces  again  to  form  a  word  (or  even
              sequence  of  words). For this pstoedit implements some heuristics
              about what text pieces are to be considered parts of a split word.
              This  is based on the geometrical proximity of the different parts
              and seems to work quite well so far. But there are certainly cases
              where  this  simple  heuristic  fails. So please check the results
              carefully.

       [-ssp]
               simulate sub paths.  Several output formats don&apos;t  support  Post&#8208;
              Script pathes containing sub pathes, i.e. pathes with intermediate
              movetos. In the normal case, each subpath is treated as  an  inde&#8208;
              pendent path for such output formats. This can lead to bad looking
              results. The most common case where this happens is if you use the
              -dt  option  and show some text with letters like e, o, or b, i.e.
              letter that have a &quot;hole&quot;. When the -ssp option is  set,  pstoedit
              tries  to  eliminate  these  problems. However, this option is CPU
              time intensive!

       [-flat flatness factor]
               If the output format does not support curves  in  the  way  Post&#8208;
              Script  does  or  if  the  -nc option is specified, all curves are
              approximated by lines. Using the -flat option one can control this
              approximation.  This  parameter  is  directly converted to a Post&#8208;
              Script setflat command. Higher  numbers,  e.g.  10  give  rougher,
              lower numbers, e.g. 0.1 finer approximations.

       [-sclip]
               simulate  clipping.   Most  output formats of pstoedit don&apos;t have
              native support for clipping. For that pstoedit offers an option to
              perform  the clipping of the graphics directly without passing the
              clippath to the output driver. However,  this  results  in  curves
              being  replaced  by  a lot of line segments and thus larger output
              files. So use this option only if your output looks different from
              the  input due to clipping. In addition, this &quot;simulated clipping&quot;
              is not exactly the same as defined in PostScript. There  might  be
              lines  drawn at the double size. Also clipping of text is not sup&#8208;
              ported unless you also use the -dt option.

   INPUT AND OUTFILE FILE ARGUMENTS
       [ inputfile [outputfile] ]

       If neither an input nor an output file is  given  as  argument,  pstoedit
       works  as filter reading from standard input and writing to standard out&#8208;
       put.  The special filename &quot;-&quot; can also be used. It  represents  standard
       input if it is the first on the command line and standard output if it is
       the second. So &quot;pstoedit - output.xxx&quot;  reads  from  standard  input  and
       writes to output.xxx

AVAILABLE FORMATS AND THEIR SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       pstoedit  allows  passing  individual  options to a output format driver.
       This is done by appending all options to the format specified  after  the
       -f  option.  The  format specifier and its options must be separated by a
       colon (:). If more than one option needs to be passed to the output  for&#8208;
       mat driver, the whole argument to -f must be enclosed within double-quote
       characters, thus:

       -f &quot;format[:option option ...]&quot;

       To see which options are supported by a specific format,  type:  pstoedit

   magick - MAGICK driver
       This driver uses the C++ API of ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick to  finally
       produce  different  output formats. The output format is determined auto&#8208;
       matically by Image/GraphicsMagick based on the suffix of the output file&#8208;
       name.  So  an output file test.png will force the creation of an image in
       PNG format.

NOTES
   AUTOTRACE
       pstoedit cooperates with autotrace. Autotrace can now produce a dump file
       for further processing by pstoedit using the -bo (backend  only)  option.
       Autotrace  is a program written by a group around Martin Weber and can be
       found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/.

   PS2AI
       The ps2ai output format driver is not a  native  pstoedit  output  format
       driver. It does not use the pstoedit postcript flattener, instead it uses
       the PostScript program ps2ai.ps which is  installed  in  the  GhostScript
       distribution   directory.   It   is   included   to   provide   the  same
       &quot;look-and-feel&quot; for the conversion to AI.  The additional benefit is that
       this conversion is now available also via the &quot;convert-to-vector&quot; menu of
       Gsview. However, lot&apos;s of files don&apos;t convert  nicely  or  at  all  using
       ps2ai.ps.  So  a  native pstoedit driver would be much better. Anyone out
       there to take this? The AI format is usable for example  by  Mayura  Draw
       (http://www.mayura.com).  Also a driver to the Mayura native format would
       be nice.

       An alternative to the ps2ai based driver is available via the -f  plot:ai
       format if the libplot(ter) is installed.

       You should use a version of GhostScript greater than or equal to 6.00 for
       using the ps2ai output format driver.

   METAPOST
       Note that, as far as Scott knows, MetaPost does not support  PostScript&apos;s
       eofill.  The  metapost output format driver just converts eofill to fill,
       and issues a warning if verbose is set. Fortunately, very few  PostScript
       programs rely on the even-odd fill rule, even though many specify it.

       For more on MetaPost see:

       http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html

   CONTEXT FREE - CFDG
       The  driver  for  the CFDG format (drvcfdg) defines one shape per page of
       PostScript, but only the first shape is  actually  rendered  (unless  the
       user  edits  the  generated  CFDG code, of course).  CFDG doesn&apos;t support
       multi-page output, so this probably a reasonable thing to do.

       For more on Context Free see: http://www.contextfreeart.org/

   LATEX2E
       *      LaTeX2e&apos;s picture environment is not very powerful. As  a  result,
              many  elementary  PostScript constructs are ignored -- fills, line
              thicknesses (besides &quot;thick&quot; and &quot;thin&quot;), and  dash  patterns,  to
              name a few. Furthermore, complex pictures may overrun TeX&apos;s memory
              capacity.

       *      Some PostScript constructs are not  supported  directly  by  &quot;pic&#8208;
              ture&quot;,  but  can be handled by external packages. If a figure uses
              color, the  top-level  document  will  need  to  do  a  &quot;\usepack&#8208;
              age{color}&quot;.  And if a figure contains rotated text, the top-level
              document will need to do a &quot;\usepackage{rotating}&quot;.

       *      All lengths, coordinates, and font sizes output by the output for&#8208;
              mat  driver  are  in  terms of \unitlength, so scaling a figure is
              simply a matter of doing a &quot;\setlength{\unitlength}{...}&quot;.

       *      The output format driver  currently  supports  one  output  format
              driver  specific  option,  &quot;integers&quot;,  which  rounds all lengths,
              coordinates, and font sizes to the  nearest  integer.  This  makes
              hand-editing the picture a little nicer.

       *      Why  is  this output format driver useful? One answer is portabil&#8208;
              ity; any LaTeX2e system can handle the picture  environment,  even
              if  it  can&apos;t  handle PostScript graphics. (pdfLaTeX comes to mind
              here.) A second answer is that pictures can be  edited  easily  to
              contain  any  arbitrary  LaTeX2e code. For instance, the text in a
              figure can be modified to contain complex  mathematics,  non-Latin
              alphabets,  bibliographic  citations,  or -- the real reason Scott
              wrote the LaTeX2e output format driver -- hyperlinks to  the  sur&#8208;
              rounding document (with help from the hyperref package).

   CREATING A NEW OUTPUT FORMAT DRIVER
       To  implement  a new output format driver you can start from drvsampl.cpp
       and drvsampl.h.  See also comments in drvbase.h  and  drvfuncs.h  for  an
       explanation of methods that should be implemented for a new output format
       driver.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       A default PostScript interpreter to be called by pstoedit is specified at
       compile time. You can overwrite the default by setting the GS environment
       variable to the name of a suitable PostScript interpreter.

       You can check which name of a PostScript interpreter  was  compiled  into
       pstoedit using: pstoedit -help -v.

       See the GhostScript manual for descriptions of environment variables used
       by Ghostscript most importantly GS_FONTPATH and GS_LIB; other environment
       variables  also affect output to display, print, and additional filtering
       and processing. See the related documentation.

       pstoedit allocates temporary files using the function  tempnam(3).   Thus
       the  location for temporary files might be controllable by other environ&#8208;
       ment variables used by this function.  See  the  tempnam(3)  manpage  for
       descriptions  of  environment variables used. On UNIX like system this is
       probably the TMPDIR variable, on DOS/WINDOWS either TMP or TEMP.

TROUBLE SHOOTING
       If you have problems with pstoedit first try whether Ghostscript success&#8208;
       fully displays your file. If yes, then try pstoedit -f ps infile.ps test&#8208;
       file.ps and check whether  testfile.ps  still  displays  correctly  using
       Ghostscript. If this file doesn&apos;t look correctly then there seems to be a
       problem with pstoedit&apos;s PostScript frontend. If this file looks good  but
       the output for a specific format is wrong, the problem is probably in the
       output format driver for the specific format. In  either  case  send  bug
       fixes and reports to the author.

       A  common problem with PostScript files is that the PostScript file rede&#8208;
       fines one of the standard PostScript operators inconsistently.  There  is
       no  effect  of  this  if you just print the file since the original Post&#8208;
       Script &quot;program&quot; uses these new operator in the new meaning and does  not
       use  the  original  ones  anymoew. However, when run under the control of
       pstoedit, these operators are expected to work with the  original  seman&#8208;
       tics.

       So far I&apos;ve seen redefinitions for:

       *      lt - &quot;less-then&quot; to mean &quot;draw a line to&quot;

       *      string - &quot;create a string object&quot; to mean &quot;draw a string&quot;

       *      length - &quot;get the length of e.g. a string&quot; to a &quot;float constant&quot;

       I&apos;ve  included work-arounds for the ones mentioned above, but some others
       could show up in addition to those.

RESTRICTIONS
       *      Non-standard fonts (e.g. TeXbitmap fonts) are mapped to a  default
              font  which  can be changed using the -df option. pstoedit chooses
              the size of the replacement font such that the width of the string
              in  the original font is the same as in the replacement font. This
              is done for each text fragment displayed. Special character encod&#8208;
              ing  support  is  limited  in  this case. If a character cannot be
              mapped into the target format, pstoedit displays  a  &apos;#&apos;  instead.
              See also the -uchar option.

       *      pstoedit  supports  bitmap  graphics  only  for some output format
              drivers.

       *      Some output format drivers, e.g. the Gnuplot output format  driver
              or  the  3D  output  format  driver (rpl, lwo, rib) do not support
              text.

       *      For most output format drivers pstoedit does not support  clipping
              (mainly  due  to limitations in the target format). You can try to
              use the -sclip option to simulate clipping. However, this  doesn&apos;t
              work in all cases as expected.

       *      Special  note  about  the  Java  output  format drivers (java1 and
              java2).  The java output format drivers  generate  a  java  source
              file  that  needs  other files in order to be compiled and usable.
              These other  files  are  Java  classes  (one  applet  and  support
              classes) that allow to step through the individual pages of a con&#8208;
              verted PostScript document. This applet can  easily  be  activated
              from  a html-document. See the contrib/java/java1/readme_java1.txt
              or contrib/java/java2/readme_java2.htm file for more details.

FAQS
       1.     Why do letters like O or B get strange if converted  to  tgif/xfig
              using the -dt option?

       This  is because most output format drivers don&apos;t support composite paths
       with intermediate gaps (moveto&apos;s) and second don&apos;t support very well  the
       (eo)fill  operators  of  PostScript  (winding  rule).  For  such  objects
       pstoedit breaks them into smaller objects whenever such a gap  is  found.
       This results in the &quot;hole&quot; beeing filled with black color instead of bee&#8208;
       ing transparent. Since version 3.11 you can try the -ssp option in combi&#8208;
       nation with the xfig output format driver.

       2.     Why  does pstoedit produce ugly results from PostScript files gen&#8208;
              erated by dvips?

       TeX documents usually use bitmap fonts. Such  fonts  cannot  be  used  as
       native  font  in  other  format.  So  pstoedit replaces the TeX font with
       another native font. Of course, the replacement font will in  most  cases
       produce  another  look, especially if mathematical symbols are used.  Try
       to use PostScript fonts instead of the bitmap  fonts  when  generating  a
       PostScript file from TeX or LaTeX.
