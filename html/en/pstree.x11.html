PSTREE(1)                         User Commands                        PSTREE(1)



NAME
       pstree - display a tree of processes

SYNOPSIS
       pstree [-a|--arguments] [-c|--compact] [-h|--highlight-all|-Hpid|--high&#8208;
       light-pid pid] [-g]--show-pgids] [-l|--long] [-n|--numeric-sort]
       [-p|--show-pids] [-s|--show-parents] [-u|--uid-changes] [-Z|--secu&#8208;
       rity-context] [-A|--ascii|-G|--vt100|-U|--unicode] [pid|user]
       pstree -V|--version

DESCRIPTION
       pstree shows running processes as a tree. The tree is  rooted  at  either
       pid  or  init if pid is omitted. If a user name is specified, all process
       trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

       pstree visually merges identical  branches  by  putting  them  in  square
       brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]


       Child  threads  of  a  process are found under the parent process and are
       shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]


       If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the end
       of  the line to press return and will not return until that has happened.
       This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.


OPTIONS
       -a     Show command line arguments. If the command line of a  process  is
              swapped  out,  that process is shown in parentheses. -a implicitly
              disables compaction for processes but not threads.

       -A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

       -c     Disable compaction of identical subtrees. By default, subtrees are
              compacted whenever possible.

       -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       -h     Highlight  the  current process and its ancestors. This is a no-op
              if the terminal doesn&apos;t support highlighting  or  if  neither  the
              current  process nor any of its ancestors are in the subtree being
              shown.

       -H     Like -h, but highlight the specified process instead. Unlike  with
              -h, pstree fails when using -H if highlighting is not available.

       -g     Show  PGIDs.  Process  Group  IDs  are shown as decimal numbers in
              parentheses after each process name. -p implicitly  disables  com&#8208;
              paction.  If both PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs are shown
              first.

       -l     Display long lines. By default, lines are truncated to the display
              width  or  132  if  output  is sent to a non-tty or if the display
              width is unknown.

       -n     Sort processes with the same ancestor by PID instead of  by  name.
              (Numeric sort.)

       -p     Show  PIDs. PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after
              each process name. -p implicitly disables compaction.

       -s     Show parent processes of the specified process.

       -u     Show uid transitions. Whenever the uid of a process  differs  from
              the  uid  of its parent, the new uid is shown in parentheses after
              the process name.

       -U     Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under  Linux  1.1-54
              and  above,  UTF-8  mode  is  entered  on the console with echo -e
              &apos;\033%8&apos; and left with echo -e &apos;\033%@&apos;

       -V     Display version information.

       -Z     (SELinux) Show security context for each process. This  flag  will
              only work if pstree is compilied with SELinux support.
