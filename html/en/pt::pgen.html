DESCRIPTION
       Are  you  lost  ?   Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools.  This  document  is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package provides a command implementing a  parser  generator  taking
       parsing expression grammars as input.

       It  is  the  implementation  of  method  generate of pt, the Parser Tools
       Application.

       As such the intended audience of this document are people wishing to mod&#8208;
       ify  and/or  extend  this  part of pt&apos;s functionality. Users of pt on the
       other hand are hereby refered to the applications&apos; manpage,  i.e.  Parser
       Tools Application.

       It resides in the User Package Layer of Parser Tools.

API
       ::pt::pgen inputformat text resultformat ?options...?
              This  command takes the parsing expression grammar in text (in the
              format specified by inputformat), and returns the same grammar  in
              the format resultformat as the result of the command.

              The  two  known  input formats are peg and json.  Introductions to
              them, including their formal specifications, can be found  in  the
              PEG  Language  Tutorial  and The JSON Grammar Exchange Format. The
              packages used to parse these formats are

              peg    pt::peg::from::peg

              json   pt::peg::from::json

       On the output side the known formats, and the packages used  to  generate
       them are

              c      pt::peg::to::cparam

              container
                     pt::peg::to::container

              critcl pt::peg::to::cparam + pt::cparam::configuration::critcl

              json   pt::peg::to::json
&#12;              oo     pt::peg::to::tclparam + pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo

              peg    pt::peg::to::peg

              snit   pt::peg::to::tclparam + pt::tclparam::configuration::snit

              The options supported by each of these formats are documented with
              their respective packages.

EXAMPLE
       In this section we are working a complete example, starting  with  a  PEG
       grammar  and  ending  with running the parser generated from it over some
       input, following the outline shown in the figure below:

       IMAGE: flow

       Our grammar, assumed to the stored in the file &quot;calculator.peg&quot; is


              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- &apos;0&apos;/&apos;1&apos;/&apos;2&apos;/&apos;3&apos;/&apos;4&apos;/&apos;5&apos;/&apos;6&apos;/&apos;7&apos;/&apos;8&apos;/&apos;9&apos;       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- &apos;-&apos; / &apos;+&apos;                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- &apos;*&apos; / &apos;/&apos;                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- &apos;+&apos;/&apos;-&apos;                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- &apos;(&apos; Expression &apos;)&apos; / Number                   ;
              END;

       From this we create a snit-based parser using the script &quot;gen&quot;


              package require Tcl 8.5
              package require fileutil
              package require pt::pgen

              lassign $argv name
              set grammar [fileutil::cat $name.peg]
              set pclass  [pt::pgen peg $gr snit -class $name -file  $name.peg -name  $name]
              fileutil::writeFile $name.tcl $pclass
              exit 0

       calling it like

               tclsh8.5 gen calculator
       which leaves us with the parser package and class  written  to  the  file
       &quot;calculator.tcl&quot;.   Assuming that this package is then properly installed
       in a place where Tcl can find it we can now use this class via  a  script
       like


                  package require calculator

                  lassign $argv input
                  set channel [open $input r]

                  set parser [calculator]
                  set ast [$parser parse $channel]
                  $parser destroy
                  close $channel

                  ... now process the returned abstract syntax tree ...

       where the abstract syntax tree stored in the variable will look like
&#12;              set ast {Expression 0 4
                  {Factor 0 4
                      {Term 0 2
                          {Number 0 2
                              {Digit 0 0}
                              {Digit 1 1}
                              {Digit 2 2}
                          }
                      }
                      {AddOp 3 3}
                      {Term 4 4
                          {Number 4 4
                              {Digit 4 4}
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }


       assuming that the input file and channel contained the text

               120+5
       A more graphical representation of the tree would be

       IMAGE: expr_ast

       Regardless,  at  this  point it is the user&apos;s responsibility to work with
       the tree to reach whatever goal she desires. I.e. analyze  it,  transform
       it,  etc.  The package pt::ast should be of help here, providing commands
       to walk such ASTs structures in various ways.

       One important thing to note is that the parsers used here return  a  data
       structure  representing the structure of the input per the grammar under&#8208;
       lying the parser. There are no callbacks during the parsing process, i.e.
       no parsing actions, as most other parsers will have.

       Going  back  to the last snippet of code, the execution of the parser for
       some input, note how the parser instance  follows  the  specified  Parser
       API.
