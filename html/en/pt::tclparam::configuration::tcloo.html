NAME
       pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo  -  Tcl/PARAM,  Canned  configuration,
       Tcloo

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.5

       package require pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo  ?1.0.1?

       ::pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo def name cmdprefix

DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding  this  document  ?   In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole  system  the  current
       package is a part of.

       This  package  is an adjunct to pt::peg::to::tclparam, to make the use of
       this highly configurable package easier by providing a canned  configura&#8208;
       tion.    When    applied    this   configuration   causes   the   package
       pt::peg::to::tclparam to generate OO-based parser packages.

       It is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.

       IMAGE: arch_core_support

API
       ::pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo def name cmdprefix
              The command applies the configuration provided by this package  to
              the  cmdprefix,  causing  the  creation  of OO-based parsers whose
              class is name.

              The use of a command prefix as API allows application of the  con&#8208;
              figuration       to       not      only      pt::peg::to::tclparam
              (pt::peg::to::tclparam  configure),  but   also   export   manager
              instances and PEG containers ($export configuration set and [$con&#8208;
              tainer exporter] configuration set respectively).

              Or anything other command prefix accepting two  arguments,  option
              and value.
