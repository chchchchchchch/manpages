PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3)    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual   PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3)



NAME
       pthread_attr_setscope,  pthread_attr_getscope  - set/get contention scope
       attribute in thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_attr_setscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int scope);
       int pthread_attr_getscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int *scope);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setscope() function sets the contention scope  attribute
       of  the  thread attributes object referred to by attr to the value speci&#8208;
       fied in scope.  The contention scope attribute defines the set of threads
       against   which  a  thread  competes  for  resources  such  as  the  CPU.
       POSIX.1-2001 specifies two possible values for scope:

       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
              The thread competes for resources with all other  threads  in  all
              processes on the system that are in the same scheduling allocation
              domain (a group of one or more processors).   PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
              threads  are  scheduled relative to one another according to their
              scheduling policy and priority.

       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
              The thread competes for resources with all other  threads  in  the
              same process that were also created with the PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
              contention scope.   PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS  threads  are  scheduled
              relative to other threads in the process according to their sched&#8208;
              uling policy and priority.  POSIX.1-2001 leaves it unspecified how
              these  threads  contend with other threads in other process on the
              system or with other threads in the same process that were created
              with the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention scope.

       POSIX.1-2001  only  requires  that an implementation support one of these
       contention scopes, but permits both  to  be  supported.   Linux  supports
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, but not PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS.

       The   pthread_attr_getscope()   function  returns  the  contention  scope
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the buf&#8208;
       fer pointed to by scope.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions  return 0; on error, they return a nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setscope() can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL An invalid value was specified in scope.

       ENOTSUP
              scope specified the value PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS, which is not sup&#8208;
              ported on Linux.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM  contention  scope  typically  indicates that a
       user-space thread is bound directly to a single kernel-scheduling entity.
       This  is  the  case on Linux for the obsolete LinuxThreads implementation
       and the modern NPTL implementation, which are both 1:1  threading  imple&#8208;
       mentations.

       POSIX.1-2001  specifies  that the default contention scope is implementa&#8208;
       tion-defined.
