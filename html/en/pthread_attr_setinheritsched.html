PTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHEDLinux Programmer&apos;s MaPTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHED(3)



NAME
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched,   pthread_attr_getinheritsched   -  set/get
       inherit scheduler attribute in thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                        int inheritsched);
       int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                        int *inheritsched);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function sets  the  inherit  scheduler
       attribute  of  the  thread  attributes  object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in inheritsched.  The inherit scheduler attribute  deter&#8208;
       mines  whether  a  thread created using the thread attributes object attr
       will inherit its scheduling attributes from the calling thread or whether
       it will take them from attr.

       The following values may be specified in inheritsched:

       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
              Threads  that are created using attr inherit scheduling attributes
              from the creating thread; the scheduling attributes  in  attr  are
              ignored.

       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
              Threads   that  are  created  using  attr  take  their  scheduling
              attributes from the values specified by the attributes object.

       The default setting of the inherit scheduler attribute in  a  newly  ini&#8208;
       tialized thread attributes object is PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED.

       The   pthread_attr_getinheritsched()   returns   the   inherit  scheduler
       attribute of the thread attributes object attr in the buffer  pointed  to
       by inheritsched.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions  return 0; on error, they return a nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL Invalid value in inheritsched.

       POSIX.1-2001 also documents an optional ENOTSUP error (&quot;attempt was  made
       to set the attribute to an unsupported value&quot;) for pthread_attr_setinher&#8208;
       itsched().

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       As at glibc 2.8, if a  thread  attributes  object  is  initialized  using
       pthread_attr_init(3), then the scheduling policy of the attributes object
       is set to SCHED_OTHER and the scheduling priority is set to 0.   However,
       if the inherit scheduler attribute is then set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED,
       then a thread created using the attribute  object  wrongly  inherits  its
       scheduling  attributes from the creating thread.  This bug does not occur
       if either the scheduling  policy  or  scheduling  priority  attribute  is
       explicitly   set   in   the   thread  attributes  object  before  calling
       pthread_create(3).

       See pthread_setschedparam(3).
