PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACK(3)    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual   PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACK(3)



NAME
       pthread_attr_setstack,  pthread_attr_getstack  - set/get stack attributes
       in thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_attr_setstack(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                 void *stackaddr, size_t stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_getstack(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                 void **stackaddr, size_t *stacksize);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_attr_getstack(), pthread_attr_setstack():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setstack() function sets the  stack  address  and  stack
       size  attributes  of  the thread attributes object referred to by attr to
       the values specified in stackaddr  and  stacksize,  respectively.   These
       attributes specify the location and size of the stack that should be used
       by a thread that is created using the thread attributes object attr.

       stackaddr should point to the lowest addressable  byte  of  a  buffer  of
       stacksize bytes that was allocated by the caller.  The pages of the allo&#8208;
       cated buffer should be both readable and writable.

       The pthread_attr_getstack() function returns the stack address and  stack
       size  attributes  of  the thread attributes object referred to by attr in
       the buffers pointed to by stackaddr and stacksize, respectively.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error,  they  return  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setstack() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL stacksize  is  less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN (16384) bytes.  On some
              systems,  this  error  may  also  occur  if  stackaddr  or  stack&#8208;
              addr + stacksize is not suitably aligned.

       POSIX.1-2001  also  documents an EACCES error if the stack area described
       by stackaddr and stacksize is not both readable and writable by the call&#8208;
       er.

VERSIONS
       These functions are provided by glibc since version 2.2.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       These  functions  are  provided  for applications that must ensure that a
       thread&apos;s stack is placed in a particular  location.   For  most  applica&#8208;
       tions,  this  is  not necessary, and the use of these functions should be
       avoided.  (Use  pthread_attr_setstacksize(3)  if  an  application  simply
       requires a stack size other than the default.)
&#12;       When  an  application  employs pthread_attr_setstack(), it takes over the
       responsibility of allocating the stack.  Any guard size  value  that  was
       set  using pthread_attr_setguardsize(3) is ignored.  If deemed necessary,
       it is the application&apos;s responsibility to allocate a guard area  (one  or
       more pages protected against reading and writing) to handle the possibil&#8208;
       ity of stack overflow.

       The address specified in stackaddr should be suitably aligned:  for  full
       portability,   align  it  on  a  page  boundary  (sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)).
       posix_memalign(3) may be  useful  for  allocation.   Probably,  stacksize
       should also be a multiple of the system page size.

       If  attr  is used to create multiple threads, then the caller must change
       the stack address attribute between calls  to  pthread_create(3);  other&#8208;
       wise,  the  threads  will  attempt  to use the same memory area for their
       stacks, and chaos will ensue.
