PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKADDR(3)Linux Programmer&apos;s ManuaPTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKADDR(3)



NAME
       pthread_attr_setstackaddr,   pthread_attr_getstackaddr  -  set/get  stack
       address attribute in thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_attr_setstackaddr(pthread_attr_t *attr, void *stackaddr);
       int pthread_attr_getstackaddr(pthread_attr_t *attr, void **stackaddr);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are obsolete: do not  use  them.   Use  pthread_attr_set&#8208;
       stack(3) and pthread_attr_getstack(3) instead.

       The pthread_attr_setstackaddr() function sets the stack address attribute
       of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the  value  speci&#8208;
       fied  in  stackaddr.   This attribute specifies the location of the stack
       that should be used  by  a  thread  that  is  created  using  the  thread
       attributes object attr.

       stackaddr  should  point  to a buffer of at least PTHREAD_STACK_MIN bytes
       that was allocated by the caller.  The  pages  of  the  allocated  buffer
       should be both readable and writable.

       The   pthread_attr_getstackaddr()  function  returns  the  stack  address
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the buf&#8208;
       fer pointed to by stackaddr.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions  return 0; on error, they return a nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined (but applications should nevertheless handle a pos&#8208;
       sible error return).

VERSIONS
       These functions are provided by glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001  specifies  these  functions  but  marks  them  as obsolete.
       POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of these functions.

NOTES
       Do not use these functions!  They cannot be  portably  used,  since  they
       provide  no way of specifying the direction of growth or the range of the
       stack.  For example, on architectures with a stack that  grows  downward,
       stackaddr  specifies  the  next  address  past the highest address of the
       allocated stack area.  However, on architectures with a stack that  grows
       upward,  stackaddr  specifies  the  lowest address in the allocated stack
       area.  By contrast, the stackaddr used  by  pthread_attr_setstack(3)  and
       pthread_attr_getstack(3),  is  always  a pointer to the lowest address in
       the allocated stack area (and the stacksize argument specifies the  range
       of the stack).
