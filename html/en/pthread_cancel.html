PTHREAD_CANCEL(3)           Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual          PTHREAD_CANCEL(3)



NAME
       pthread_cancel - send a cancellation request to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_cancel() function sends a cancellation request to the thread
       thread.  Whether and when the target thread reacts  to  the  cancellation
       request  depends  on  two  attributes  that are under the control of that
       thread: its cancelability state and type.

       A thread&apos;s cancelability state, determined by  pthread_setcancelstate(3),
       can  be  enabled  (the default for new threads) or disabled.  If a thread
       has disabled cancellation, then a  cancellation  request  remains  queued
       until the thread enables cancellation.  If a thread has enabled cancella&#8208;
       tion, then its cancelability type determines when cancellation occurs.

       A thread&apos;s cancellation type, determined by pthread_setcanceltype(3), may
       be  either asynchronous or deferred (the default for new threads).  Asyn&#8208;
       chronous cancelability means that the thread can be canceled at any  time
       (usually  immediately, but the system does not guarantee this).  Deferred
       cancelability means that cancellation will be delayed  until  the  thread
       next  calls a function that is a cancellation point.  A list of functions
       that are or may be cancellation points is provided in pthreads(7).

       When a cancellation requested is acted on, the following steps occur  for
       thread (in this order):

       1. Cancellation clean-up handlers are popped (in the reverse of the order
          in which they were pushed) and called.  (See pthread_cleanup_push(3).)

       2. Thread-specific data destructors are called, in an unspecified  order.
          (See pthread_key_create(3).)

       3. The thread is terminated.  (See pthread_exit(3).)

       The  above  steps  happen asynchronously with respect to the pthread_can&#8208;
       cel() call; the return status  of  pthread_cancel()  merely  informs  the
       caller whether the cancellation request was successfully queued.

       After  a  canceled  thread  has terminated, a join with that thread using
       pthread_join(3) obtains PTHREAD_CANCELED as  the  thread&apos;s  exit  status.
       (Joining with a thread is the only way to know that cancellation has com&#8208;
       pleted.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_cancel() returns 0; on error, it  returns  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       On  Linux,  cancellation  is  implemented  using signals.  Under the NPTL
       threading implementation, the first real-time signal (i.e., signal 32) is
       used  for  this purpose.  On LinuxThreads, the second real-time signal is
       used, if real-time signals are available, otherwise SIGUSR2 is used.

EXAMPLE
       The program below creates a thread and then cancels it.  The main  thread
       joins  with  the  canceled  thread  to  check  that  its  exit status was
       PTHREAD_CANCELED.  The following shell session shows what happens when we
       run the program:

           $ ./a.out
           thread_func(): started; cancellation disabled
           main(): sending cancellation request
           thread_func(): about to enable cancellation
           main(): thread was canceled
