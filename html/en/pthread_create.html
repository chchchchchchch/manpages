PTHREAD_CREATE(3)           Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual          PTHREAD_CREATE(3)



NAME
       pthread_create - create a new thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                          void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_create() function starts a new thread in the calling process.
       The new thread starts  execution  by  invoking  start_routine();  arg  is
       passed as the sole argument of start_routine().

       The new thread terminates in one of the following ways:

       * It  calls  pthread_exit(3),  specifying  an  exit  status value that is
         available  to  another  thread  in  the   same   process   that   calls
         pthread_join(3).

       * It  returns  from  start_routine().   This  is  equivalent  to  calling
         pthread_exit(3) with the value supplied in the return statement.

       * It is canceled (see pthread_cancel(3)).

       * Any of the threads in the process calls exit(3),  or  the  main  thread
         performs  a  return  from  main().   This causes the termination of all
         threads in the process.

       The attr argument points to a pthread_attr_t structure whose contents are
       used  at thread creation time to determine attributes for the new thread;
       this structure is  initialized  using  pthread_attr_init(3)  and  related
       functions.   If  attr  is  NULL,  then the thread is created with default
       attributes.

       Before returning, a successful call to pthread_create() stores the ID  of
       the  new  thread  in  the buffer pointed to by thread; this identifier is
       used to refer to the thread in subsequent calls to other  pthreads  func&#8208;
       tions.

       The  new  thread  inherits  a  copy  of the creating thread&apos;s signal mask
       (pthread_sigmask(3)).  The set of pending signals for the new  thread  is
       empty  (sigpending(2)).   The  new  thread  does not inherit the creating
       thread&apos;s alternate signal stack (sigaltstack(2)).

       The new thread inherits the calling thread&apos;s  floating-point  environment
       (fenv(3)).

       The  initial  value  of  the  new  thread&apos;s  CPU-time  clock  is  0  (see
       pthread_getcpuclockid(3)).

   Linux-specific details
       The new thread inherits copies of the calling  thread&apos;s  capability  sets
       (see capabilities(7)) and CPU affinity mask (see sched_setaffinity(2)).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  pthread_create()  returns  0; on error, it returns an error
       number, and the contents of *thread are undefined.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN Insufficient resources to create  another  thread,  or  a  system-
              imposed  limit on the number of threads was encountered.  The lat&#8208;
              ter case may occur in two ways:  the  RLIMIT_NPROC  soft  resource
              limit  (set  via setrlimit(2)), which limits the number of process
              for a real user ID, was reached; or the kernel&apos;s system-wide limit
              on   the  number  of  threads,  /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max,  was
              reached.

       EINVAL Invalid settings in attr.

       EPERM  No permission to set the scheduling policy and  parameters  speci&#8208;
              fied in attr.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       See  pthread_self(3) for further information on the thread ID returned in
       *thread by pthread_create().  Unless real-time  scheduling  policies  are
       being  employed,  after  a  call to pthread_create(), it is indeterminate
       which thread&#8212;the caller or the new thread&#8212;will next execute.

       A thread may either be joinable or detached.  If a  thread  is  joinable,
       then  another  thread  can call pthread_join(3) to wait for the thread to
       terminate and fetch its exit status.  Only  when  a  terminated  joinable
       thread has been joined are the last of its resources released back to the
       system.  When a detached thread terminates, its resources  are  automati&#8208;
       cally  released  back  to the system: it is not possible to join with the
       thread in order to obtain its exit status.  Making a thread  detached  is
       useful for some types of daemon threads whose exit status the application
       does not need to care about.  By default, a new thread is  created  in  a
       joinable  state,  unless  attr was set to create the thread in a detached
       state (using pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3)).

       On Linux/x86-32, the default stack size for a new thread is 2  megabytes.
       Under  the  NPTL  threading  implementation,  if  the  RLIMIT_STACK  soft
       resource limit at the time the program started has any value  other  than
       &quot;unlimited&quot;,  then  it  determines the default stack size of new threads.
       Using pthread_attr_setstacksize(3),  the  stack  size  attribute  can  be
       explicitly  set in the attr argument used to create a thread, in order to
       obtain a stack size other than the default.

BUGS
       In the obsolete LinuxThreads implementation, each of  the  threads  in  a
       process  has  a  different process ID.  This is in violation of the POSIX
       threads specification, and is the source of many other nonconformances to
       the standard; see pthreads(7).

EXAMPLE
       The  program below demonstrates the use of pthread_create(), as well as a
       number of other functions in the pthreads API.

       In the following run, on a system providing the NPTL threading  implemen&#8208;
       tation,  the  stack  size defaults to the value given by the &quot;stack size&quot;
       resource limit:

           $ ulimit -s
           8192            # The stack size limit is 8 MB (0x80000 bytes)
           $ ./a.out hola salut servus
           Thread 1: top of stack near 0xb7dd03b8; argv_string=hola
           Thread 2: top of stack near 0xb75cf3b8; argv_string=salut
           Thread 3: top of stack near 0xb6dce3b8; argv_string=servus
           Joined with thread 1; returned value was HOLA
           Joined with thread 2; returned value was SALUT
           Joined with thread 3; returned value was SERVUS

       In the next run, the program explicitly sets a stack size of  1MB  (using
       pthread_attr_setstacksize(3)) for the created threads:

           $ ./a.out -s 0x100000 hola salut servus
           Thread 1: top of stack near 0xb7d723b8; argv_string=hola
           Thread 2: top of stack near 0xb7c713b8; argv_string=salut
           Thread 3: top of stack near 0xb7b703b8; argv_string=servus
           Joined with thread 1; returned value was HOLA
           Joined with thread 2; returned value was SALUT
           Joined with thread 3; returned value was SERVUS
