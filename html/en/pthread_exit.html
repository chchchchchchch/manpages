PTHREAD_EXIT(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            PTHREAD_EXIT(3)



NAME
       pthread_exit - terminate calling thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       void pthread_exit(void *retval);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_exit()  function terminates the calling thread and returns a
       value via retval that (if the thread is joinable) is available to another
       thread in the same process that calls pthread_join(3).

       Any  clean-up  handlers  established by pthread_cleanup_push(3) that have
       not yet been popped, are popped (in the reverse of  the  order  in  which
       they  were  pushed)  and executed.  If the thread has any thread-specific
       data, then, after the clean-up handlers have been  executed,  the  corre&#8208;
       sponding destructor functions are called, in an unspecified order.

       When a thread terminates, process-shared resources (e.g., mutexes, condi&#8208;
       tion variables, semaphores, and file descriptors) are not  released,  and
       functions registered using atexit(3) are not called.

       After  the last thread in a process terminates, the process terminates as
       by calling exit(3) with an exit  status  of  zero;  thus,  process-shared
       resources  are  released  and  functions  registered  using atexit(3) are
       called.

RETURN VALUE
       This function does not return to the caller.

ERRORS
       This function always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Performing a return from the start function of any thread other than  the
       main  thread  results  in  an  implicit call to pthread_exit(), using the
       function&apos;s return value as the thread&apos;s exit status.

       To allow other threads to continue execution, the main thread should ter&#8208;
       minate by calling pthread_exit() rather than exit(3).

       The  value  pointed  to  by  retval  should not be located on the calling
       thread&apos;s stack, since the contents of that stack are undefined after  the
       thread terminates.

BUGS
       Currently,  there  are limitations in the kernel implementation logic for
       wait(2)ing on a stopped thread group with a  dead  thread  group  leader.
       This  can manifest in problems such as a locked terminal if a stop signal
       is sent to a foreground process whose thread  group  leader  has  already
       called pthread_exit().
