PTHREAD_KILL(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            PTHREAD_KILL(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_kill()  function sends the signal sig to thread, a thread in
       the same process as the caller.  The signal is asynchronously directed to
       thread.

       If  sig  is  0,  then no signal is sent, but error checking is still per&#8208;
       formed; this can be used to check for the existence of a thread ID.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_kill() returns 0; on error, it returns an error  num&#8208;
       ber, and no signal is sent.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Signal  dispositions  are process-wide: if a signal handler is installed,
       the handler will be invoked in the thread thread, but if the  disposition
       of  the  signal  is  &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, or &quot;terminate&quot;, this action will
       affect the whole process.
