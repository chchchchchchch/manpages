PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NLinux Programmer&apos;s MPTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP(3)



NAME
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np - terminate all other threads in process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np()  only  has  an effect in the LinuxThreads
       threading implementation.  On that implementation, calling this  function
       causes  the  immediate  termination  of  all  threads in the application,
       except the calling thread.  The cancellation state and cancellation  type
       of the to-be-terminated threads are ignored, and the cleanup handlers are
       not called in those threads.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a nonstandard GNU  extension;  hence  the  suffix  &quot;_np&quot;
       (nonportable) in the name.

NOTES
       pthread_kill_other_threads_np()  is  intended  to be called just before a
       thread calls execve(2) or a similar function.  This function is  designed
       to  address  a  limitation  in  the  obsolete LinuxThreads implementation
       whereby the other threads of an application are not automatically  termi&#8208;
       nated (as POSIX.1-2001 requires) during execve(2).

       In  the  NPTL  threading  implementation, pthread_kill_other_threads_np()
       exists, but does nothing.  (Nothing needs to be done, because the  imple&#8208;
       mentation does the right thing during an execve(2).)

SEE ALSO
       execve(2),   pthread_cancel(3),  pthread_setcancelstate(3),  pthread_set&#8208;
       canceltype(3), pthreads(7)
