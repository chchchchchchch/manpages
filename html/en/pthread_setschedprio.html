PTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3)     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual    PTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3)



NAME
       pthread_setschedprio - set scheduling priority of a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       pthread_setschedprio(pthread_t thread, int prio);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_setschedprio()  function sets the scheduling priority of the
       thread  thread  to  the  value   specified   in   prio.    (By   contrast
       pthread_setschedparam(3)  changes both the scheduling policy and priority
       of a thread.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero error
       number.   If  pthread_setschedprio()  fails,  the  scheduling priority of
       thread is not changed.

ERRORS
       EINVAL prio is not valid for  the  scheduling  policy  of  the  specified
              thread.

       EPERM  The  caller does not have appropriate privileges to set the speci&#8208;
              fied priority.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

       POSIX.1-2001 also documents an ENOTSUP (&quot;attempt was made to set the pri&#8208;
       ority to an unsupported value&quot;) error for pthread_setschedparam(3).

VERSIONS
       This function is available in glibc since version 2.3.4.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

       For  a  description  of  the  permissions required to, and the effect of,
       changing a thread&apos;s scheduling priority, and  details  of  the  permitted
       ranges  for  priorities  in  each  scheduling policy, see sched_setsched&#8208;
