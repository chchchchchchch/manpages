PTHREAD_TRYJOIN_NP(3)       Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual      PTHREAD_TRYJOIN_NP(3)



NAME
       pthread_tryjoin_np,  pthread_timedjoin_np - try to join with a terminated
       thread

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_tryjoin_np(pthread_t thread, void **retval);

       int pthread_timedjoin_np(pthread_t thread, void **retval,
                                const struct timespec *abstime);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       These functions operate in the same way as  pthread_join(3),  except  for
       the differences described on this page.

       The  pthread_tryjoin_np()  function  performs a nonblocking join with the
       thread thread, returning the exit status of the thread  in  *retval.   If
       thread  has  not  yet terminated, then instead of blocking, as is done by
       pthread_join(3), the call returns an error.

       The pthread_timedjoin_np() function  performs  a  join-with-timeout.   If
       thread has not yet terminated, then the call blocks until a maximum time,
       specified in abstime.  If the timeout expires before  thread  terminates,
       the  call  returns  an error.  The abstime argument is a structure of the
       following form, specifying an absolute time measured since the Epoch (see
       time(2)):

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;    /* nanoseconds */
           };

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return an error num&#8208;
       ber.

ERRORS
       These functions  can  fail  with  the  same  errors  as  pthread_join(3).
       pthread_tryjoin_np() can in addition fail with the following error:

       EBUSY  thread had not yet terminated at the time of the call.

       pthread_timedjoin_np() can in addition fail with the following error:

       ETIMEDOUT
              The call timed out before thread terminated.

       pthread_timedjoin_np() never returns the error EINTR.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.3.3.

CONFORMING TO
       These  functions  are  nonstandard GNU extensions; hence the suffix &quot;_np&quot;
       (nonportable) in the names.

EXAMPLE
       The following code waits to join for up to 5 seconds:
&#12;           struct timespec ts;
           int s;

           ...

           if (clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;ts) == -1) {
            /* Handle error */
           }

           ts.tv_sec += 5;

           s = pthread_timedjoin_np(thread, NULL, &amp;ts);
           if (s != 0) {
               /* Handle error */
           }
