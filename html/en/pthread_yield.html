PTHREAD_YIELD(3)            Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual           PTHREAD_YIELD(3)



NAME
       pthread_yield - yield the processor

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_yield(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       pthread_yield()  causes  the  calling  thread to relinquish the CPU.  The
       thread is placed at the end of the run queue for its static priority  and
       another   thread   is   scheduled  to  run.   For  further  details,  see
       sched_yield(2)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_yield() returns 0; on error, it returns an error num&#8208;
       ber.

ERRORS
       On Linux, this call always succeeds (but portable and future-proof appli&#8208;
       cations should nevertheless handle a possible error return).

CONFORMING TO
       This call is nonstandard, but present on several other systems.  Use  the
       standardized sched_yield(2) instead.

NOTES
       On Linux, this function is implemented as a call to sched_yield(2).

SEE ALSO
