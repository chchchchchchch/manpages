PTS(4)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     PTS(4)



NAME
       ptmx, pts - pseudoterminal master and slave

DESCRIPTION
       The file /dev/ptmx is a character file with major number 5 and minor num&#8208;
       ber 2, usually of mode 0666 and owner.group of root.root.  It is used  to
       create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.

       When  a  process  opens  /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a pseu&#8208;
       doterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is  cre&#8208;
       ated in the /dev/pts directory.  Each file descriptor obtained by opening
       /dev/ptmx is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS,  whose  path
       can be found by passing the descriptor to ptsname(3).

       Before  opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master&apos;s file
       descriptor to grantpt(3) and unlockpt(3).

       Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open,  the  slave  pro&#8208;
       vides  processes  with  an  interface that is identical to that of a real
       terminal.

       Data written to the slave is presented on the master descriptor as input.
       Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.

       In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators
       such as xterm(1), in which data read from the  pseudoterminal  master  is
       interpreted  by  the  application  in  the same way a real terminal would
       interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login  programs  such  as
       sshd(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across
       the network to a client program that is connected to a terminal or termi&#8208;
       nal emulator.

       Pseudoterminals  can also be used to send input to programs that normally
       refuse to read input from pipes (such as su(1), and passwd(1)).

FILES
       /dev/ptmx, /dev/pts/*

NOTES
       The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal  naming)
       is done using the devpts file system, that should be mounted on /dev/pts.

       Before   this   UNIX   98  scheme,  master  pseudoterminals  were  called
       /dev/ptyp0, ...  and  slave  pseudoterminals  /dev/ttyp0,  ...   and  one
       needed lots of preallocated device nodes.
