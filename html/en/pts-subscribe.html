PTS-SUBSCRIBE(1)                                                PTS-SUBSCRIBE(1)



NAME
       pts-subscribe - time-limited subscription to the PTS

SYNOPSIS
       pts-subscribe [options] package

       pts-unsubscribe [options] package

DESCRIPTION
       pts-subscribe  sends  a  subscription  request for package to the Package
       Tracking System at pts@qa.debian.org, and  cancels  the  subscription  30
       days later.

       If  called as pts-unsubscribe, send an unsubscription request for package
       to the Package Tracking System.

       This utility is useful if a developer has made an NMU and wants to  track
       the package for a limited period of time.

OPTIONS
       --until time, -u time
              When at(1) should cancel the subscription.  time must be specified
              using at&apos;s syntax.  Default is &apos;now + 30 days&apos;.  This option  will
              probably require quoting!

       --forever
              Don&apos;t  cancel  the  subscription  automatically.  This can also be
              specified as --until forever.

       --help, -h
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBEMAIL, EMAIL
              If one of these is set (with preference give  to  DEBEMAIL),  then
              this  will  be  used  for the subscription address.  If neither is
              set, then the email will be sent without a specified  subscription
              address,  and the email&apos;s From: line will be used to determine the
              sender&apos;s address.  This will be determined by mail(1).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf  and  ~/.devscripts  are
       sourced  in  that  order  to  set  configuration variables.  Command line
       options can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised
       variables are:

       PTS_UNTIL
              Setting this is equivalent to giving a --until option.
