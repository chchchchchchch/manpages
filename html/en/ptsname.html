PTSNAME(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 PTSNAME(3)



NAME
       ptsname, ptsname_r - get the name of the slave pseudoterminal

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *ptsname(int fd);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int ptsname_r(int fd, char *buf, size_t buflen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ptsname()  function  returns  the  name  of the slave pseudoterminal
       device corresponding to the master referred to by fd.

       The ptsname_r() function is the reentrant equivalent  of  ptsname().   It
       returns  the name of the slave pseudoterminal device as a null-terminated
       string in the buffer pointed to by buf.  The  buflen  argument  specifies
       the number of bytes available in buf.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  ptsname()  returns  a pointer to a string in static storage
       which will be overwritten by subsequent calls.  This pointer must not  be
       freed.  On failure, a NULL pointer is returned.

       On  success,  ptsname_r()  returns  0.   On  failure,  a nonzero value is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL (ptsname_r() only) buf is NULL.

       ENOTTY fd does not refer to a pseudoterminal master device.

       ERANGE (ptsname_r() only) buf is too small.

VERSIONS
       ptsname() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       ptsname() is part of the UNIX 98  pseudoterminal  support  (see  pts(4)).
       This function is specified in POSIX.1-2001.

       ptsname_r()  is  a  Linux extension.  A version of this function is docu&#8208;
       mented on Tru64 and HP-UX, but on those implementations, -1  is  returned
       on  error,  with errno set to indicate the error.  Avoid using this func&#8208;
       tion in portable programs.
