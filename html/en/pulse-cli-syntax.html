NAME
       pulse-cli-syntax - PulseAudio Command Line Interface Syntax

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.pulse/default.pa

       /etc/pulse/default.pa

       /etc/pulse/system.pa

DESCRIPTION
       PulseAudio  provides a simple command line language used by configuration
       scripts and the pacmd interactive shell, and the modules  module-cli  and
       module-cli-protocol-{unix,tcp}.  Empty  lines  and lines beginning with a
       hashmark (#) are silently ignored. Several commands are supported.

       Note that any boolean arguments can be given positively as &apos;1&apos;,  &apos;on&apos;  or
       any  word starting with the letters &apos;t&apos; or &apos;y&apos;. Likewise, negative values
       can be given as &apos;0&apos;, &apos;off&apos; or any word starting with the letters  &apos;f&apos;  or
       &apos;n&apos;. Case is ignored.

GENERAL COMMANDS
       help   Show a quick help on the commands available.

STATUS_COMMANDS
       list-modules
              Show all currently loaded modules with their arguments.

       list-cards
              Show all currently registered cards

       list-sinks or list-sources
              Show all currently registered sinks (resp. sources).

       list-clients
              Show all currently active clients.

       list-sink-inputs or list-source-outputs
              Show  all currently active inputs to sinks a.k.a. playback streams
              (resp. outputs of sources a.k.a. recording streams).

       stat   Show some simple statistics about the allocated memory blocks  and
              the space used by them.

       info or ls or list
              A  combination  of  all status commands described above (all three
              commands are synonyms).

MODULE MANAGEMENT
       load-module name [arguments...]
              Load a module specified by its name and arguments. For  most  mod&#8208;
              ules it is OK to be loaded more than once.

       unload-module index
              Unload  a  module  specified  by  its  index in the module list as
              returned by list-modules.

       describe-module name
              Give information about a module specified by its name.

VOLUME COMMANDS
       set-sink-volume|set-source-volume index|name volume
              Set the volume of the specified sink (resp. source). You may spec&#8208;
              ify the sink (resp. source) either by its index in the sink/source
              list or by its name. The volume should be an integer value greater
              or equal than 0 (muted). Volume 65536 (0x10000) is &apos;normal&apos; volume
              a.k.a. 100%. Values greater than this  amplify  the  audio  signal
              (with clipping).

       set-sink-mute|set-source-mute index|name boolean
              Mute  or unmute the specified sink (resp. source). You may specify
              the sink (resp. source) either by its index or by  its  name.  The
              mute value is either 0 (not muted) or 1 (muted).

       set-sink-input-volume|set-source-output-volume index volume
              Set  the volume of a sink input (resp. source output) specified by
              its index. The same volume rules apply as with set-sink-volume.

       set-sink-input-mute|set-source-output-mute index boolean
              Mute or unmute a sink input (resp. source output) specified by its
              index. The same mute rules apply as with set-sink-mute.

CONFIGURATION COMMANDS
       set-default-sink|set-default-source index|name
              Make  a  sink (resp. source) the default. You may specify the sink
              (resp. source) by its index in the sink (resp. source) list or  by
              its name.

              Note  that defaults may be overridden by various policy modules or
              by specific stream configurations.

       set-card-profile index|name profile-name
              Change the profile of a card.

       set-sink-port|set-source-port index|name port-name
              Change the profile of a sink (resp. source).

       suspend-sink|suspend-source index|name boolean
              Suspend (i.e. disconnect from  the  underlying  hardware)  a  sink
              (resp. source).

       suspend boolean
              Suspend all sinks and sources.

MOVING STREAMS
       move-sink-input|move-source-output index sink-index|sink-name
              Move  sink  input  (resp.  source  output)  to another sink (resp.
              source).

PROPERTY LISTS
       update-sink-proplist|update-source-proplist index|name properties
              Update the properties of a sink (resp. source) specified  by  name
              or index. The property is specified as e.g. device.description=&quot;My
              Preferred Name&quot;

       update-sink-input-proplist|update-source-output-proplist index properties
              Update the properties of a sink input (resp. source output) speci&#8208;
              fied by index. The properties are specified as above.

SAMPLE CACHE
       list-samples
              Lists the contents of the sample cache.

       play-sample name sink-index|sink-name
              Play a sample cache entry to a sink.

       remove-sample name
              Remove an entry from the sample cache.

       load-sample name filename
              Load an audio file to the sample cache.
&#12;       load-sample-lazy name filename
              Create  a new entry in the sample cache, but don&apos;t load the sample
              immediately. The sample is loaded only  when  it  is  first  used.
              After a certain idle time it is freed again.

       load-sample-dir-lazy path
              Load  all entries in the specified directory into the sample cache
              as lazy entries. A shell globbing expression (e.g. *.wav)  may  be
              appended to the path of the directory to add.

KILLING CLIENTS/STREAMS
       kill-client index
              Remove  a  client forcibly from the server. There is no protection
              against the client reconnecting immediately.

       kill-sink-input|kill-source-output index
              Remove a sink  input  (resp.  source  output)  forcibly  from  the
              server.  This  will  not  remove  the  owning  client or any other
              streams opened by the same client from the server.

LOG COMMANDS
       set-log-level numeric-level
              Change the log level.

       set-log-meta boolean
              Show source code location in log messages.

       play-file filename sink-index|sink-name
              Play an audio file to a sink.

       dump   Dump the daemon&apos;s current configuration in CLI commands.

       dump-volumes
              Debug: Shows the current state of all volumes.

       shared Debug: Show shared properties.

       exit   Terminate the daemon. If you want to terminate  a  CLI  connection
              (&quot;log out&quot;) you might want to use ctrl+d

META COMMANDS
       In  addition the the commands described above there a few meta directives
       supported by the command line interpreter.

       .include filename|folder
              Executes the commands from the specified script file or in all  of
              the *.pa file within the folder.

       .fail and .nofail
              Enable (resp. disable) that following failing commands will cancel
              the execution of the current script file. This is a  ignored  when
