NAME
       pulse-client.conf - PulseAudio client configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.pulse/client.conf

       /etc/pulse/client.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  PulseAudio client library reads configuration directives from a file
       ~/.pulse/client.conf on startup and when that  file  doesn&apos;t  exist  from
       /etc/pulse/client.conf.

       The  configuration  file is a simple collection of variable declarations.
       If the configuration file parser encounters either ; or # it ignores  the
       rest of the line until its end.

       For  the  settings  that take a boolean argument the values true, yes, on
       and 1 are equivalent, resp. false, no, off, 0.

DIRECTIVES
       default-sink= The default sink to connect to. If specified overwrites the
       setting in the daemon. The environment variable $PULSE_SINK however takes
       precedence.

       default-source= The default source to connect to. If specified overwrites
       the setting in the daemon. The environment variable $PULSE_SOURCE however
       takes precedence.

       default-server= The default sever to connect to. The environment variable
       $PULSE_SERVER takes precedence.

       autospawn=  Autospawn  a  PulseAudio  daemon when needed. Takes a boolean
       value, defaults to yes.

       daemon-binary= Path to the PulseAudio daemon to  run  when  autospawning.
       Defaults to a path configured at compile time.

       extra-arguments=  Extra  arguments  to pass to the PulseAudio daemon when
       autospawning. Defaults to --log-target=syslog

       cookie-file= Specify the path to the  PulseAudio  authentication  cookie.
       Defaults to ~/.pulse-cookie.

       enable-shm= Enable data transfer via POSIX shared memory. Takes a boolean
       argument, defaults to yes.

       shm-size-bytes= Sets the shared  memory  segment  size  for  clients,  in
       bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0 it will default to some system-
       specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually  there  is  no
       need  to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel that does
       not do memory overcommit.

       auto-connect-localhost= Automatically try to connect to localhost via IP.
       Enabling  this  is  a  potential security hole since connections are only
       authenticated one-way and a rogue server might hence fool a  client  into
       sending it its private (e.g. VoIP call) data. This was enabled by default
       on PulseAudio version 0.9.21 and older. Defaults to no.

       auto-connect-display= Automatically try to  connect  to  the  host  X11&apos;s
       $DISPLAY  variable  is set to. The same security issues apply as to auto-
       connect-localhost=. Defaults to no.
